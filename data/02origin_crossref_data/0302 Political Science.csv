10.1017/pan.2019.30,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Measuring Subgroup Preferences in Conjoint Experiments,"Conjoint analysis is a common tool for studying political preferences. The method disentangles patterns in respondents’ favorability toward complex, multidimensional objects, such as candidates or policies. Most conjoints rely upon a fully randomized design to generate average marginal component effects (AMCEs). They measure the degree to which a given value of a conjoint profile feature increases, or decreases, respondents’ support for the overall profile relative to a baseline, averaging across all respondents and other features. While the AMCE has a clear causal interpretation (about theeffectof features), most published conjoint analyses also use AMCEs to describelevelsof favorability. This often means comparing AMCEs among respondent subgroups. We show that using conditional AMCEs to describe the degree of subgroup agreement can be misleading as regression interactions are sensitive to the reference category used in the analysis. This leads to inferences about subgroup differences in preferences that have arbitrary sign, size, and significance. We demonstrate the problem using examples drawn from published articles and provide suggestions for improved reporting and interpretation using marginal means and an omnibus F-test. Given the accelerating use of these designs in political science, we offer advice for best practice in analysis and presentation of results.","[{""name"": ""Thomas J.

10.1017/S0003055420000052,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Democracy in America? Partisanship, Polarization, and the Robustness of Support for Democracy in the United States","Is support for democracy in the United States robust enough to deter undemocratic behavior by elected politicians? We develop a model of the public as a democratic check and evaluate it using two empirical strategies: an original, nationally representative candidate-choice experiment in which some politicians take positions that violate key democratic principles, and a natural experiment that occurred during Montana’s 2017 special election for the U.S. House. Our research design allows us to infer Americans’ willingness to trade-off democratic principles for other valid but potentially conflicting considerations such as political ideology, partisan loyalty, and policy preferences. We find the U.S. public’s viability as a democratic check to be strikingly limited: only a small fraction of Americans prioritize democratic principles in their electoral choices, and their tendency to do so is decreasing in several measures of polarization, including the strength of partisanship, policy extremism, and candidate platform divergence. Our findings echo classic arguments about the importance of political moderation and cross-cutting cleavages for democratic stability and highlight the dangers that polarization represents for democracy.","[{""name"": ""MATTHEW H.

It compares over 7300 respondents—1000 or more from each source and country—to nationally representative benchmarks in terms of demographics, political attitudes and knowledge, cooperation, and experimental replication. In the United States, MTurk offers the cheapest and fastest recruitment, Qualtrics is most demographically and politically representative, and Facebook facilitates targeted sampling. The India samples look much less like the population, though Facebook offers broad geographical coverage. We find online convenience samples often provide valid inferences into how partisanship moderates treatment effects. Yet they are typically unrepresentative on such political variables, which has implications for the external validity of sample average treatment effects.","[{""name"": ""Taylor C.

We use an interrupted time series to study the political effect of the enforcement of a strict confinement policy in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Specifically, we take advantage of a unique representative web‐based survey that was fielded in March and April 2020 in Western Europe to compare the political support of those who took the survey right before and right after the start of the lockdown in their country. We find that lockdowns have increased vote intentions for the party of the Prime Minister/President, trust in government and satisfaction with democracy. Furthermore, we find that, while rallying individuals around current leaders and institutions, they have had no effect on traditional left–right attitudes.","[{""name"": ""DAMIEN BOL"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Economy King's College London  UK""]}, {""name"": ""MARCO GIANI"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Economy King's College London  UK""]}, {""name"": ""ANDRÉ BLAIS"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Montreal  Canada""]}, {""name"": ""PETER JOHN LOEWEN"", ""affiliation"": [""Professor, Department of Political Science Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, University of Toronto""]}]","[""10.1177/0022002714564014"", ""10.31235/osf.io/dkusw"", ""10.1073/pnas.1800302115"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00533.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202"", ""10.31235/osf.io/dkvxy"", ""10.1111/ajps.12452"", ""10.1257/aer.20180805"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.2307/591118"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000449"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3578695"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990104"", ""10.1017/S1049096503001665"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12342"", ""10.1017/S0008423920000311"", ""10.2307/1955610"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12187""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We first analyze 38 studies and show that this fraud is not new, but has increased recently. We then show that these fraudulent respondents provide particularly low-quality data and can weaken treatment effects.

10.1080/14494035.2020.1787628,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Mobilizing Policy (In)Capacity to Fight COVID-19: Understanding Variations in State Responses,"ABSTRACTThe objective of this collection of essays is to gain insights into the different national-level state responses to COVID-19 around the world and the conditions that shaped them. The pandemic offers a natural experiment wherein the policy problem governments faced was the same but the responses they made were different, creating opportunities for comparison of both the kinds of policy tools being used and the factors that accounted for their choice. Accordingly, after surveying on-line databases of policy tools used in the pandemic and subjecting these to topic modelling to reveal the characteristics of a ‘standard’ national pandemic response, we discuss the similarities and differences found in specific responses. This is done with reference to the nature and level of policy capacity of respective governments, highlighting the critical roles played by (in)adequate preparation and lesson-drawing from past experiences with similar outbreaks or crises. Taken together the articles show how the national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were shaped by the opportunity and capacity each government had to learn from previous pandemics and their capacity to operationalize and build political support for the standard portfolio of policy measures deployed to deal with the crisis. However, they also show how other factors such as the nature of national leadership, the organization of government and civil society, and blindspots towards the vulnerabilities of certain population segments also helped to shape policy responses to the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Giliberto Capano"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bologna, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Howlett"", ""affiliation"": [""Simon Fraser University, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Darryl S L Jarvis"", ""affiliation"": [""The Education University, Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""M Ramesh"", ""affiliation"": [""National University of Singapore, Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Nihit Goyal"", ""affiliation"": [""National University of Singapore, Singapore""]}]","[""10.1038/d41586-020-01003-6"", ""10.1111/1468-0009.12417"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-76672-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63254-4_2"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.12241"", ""10.1017/9781316339756"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0158-5"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9267-8"", ""10.1017/S0143814X19000047"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1"", ""10.1080/01442870902863869"", ""10.25561/77482"", ""10.1038/s41586-020-2405-7"", ""10.1111/puar.13255"", ""10.1186/1743-8462-6-3"", ""10.1332/030557319X15662966019989"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001442"", ""10.1111/padm.12235"", ""10.4000/irpp.310"", ""10.4324/9780429401046"", ""10.1177/0263774X15610059"", ""10.1038/s41586-020-2404-8"", ""10.1111/puar.13239"", ""10.30636/jbpa.31.150"", ""10.1111/puar.13243"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01150.x"", ""10.1080/14494035.2018.1519979"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-00885-w"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674067547"", ""10.1007/s11077-020-09388-x"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2017.1281730"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5973.2006.00482.x"", ""10.1111/puar.13214"", ""10.1111/psj.12110"", ""10.1057/9780230524194"", ""10.15585/mmwr.mm6923e4"", ""10.4337/9781786431356"", ""10.1080/14461242.2020.1764376"", ""10.1101/2020.03.05.20031773"", ""10.1111/psj.12095"", ""10.1108/DPM-11-2018-0358"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.00168"", ""10.1068/b38058"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12528"", ""10.31234/osf.io/y38m9"", ""10.1111/puar.13219"", ""10.1111/puar.13095"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-4602-6_9"", ""10.3201/eid1201.051371"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.001"", ""10.1080/14494035.2017.1416929""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/pan.2020.33,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,On the Use of Two-Way Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal Inference with Panel Data,"AbstractThe two-way linear fixed effects regression (2FE) has become a default method for estimating causal effects from panel data. Many applied researchers use the 2FE estimator to adjust for unobserved unit-specific and time-specific confounders at the same time. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that the ability of the 2FE model to simultaneously adjust for these two types of unobserved confounders critically relies upon the assumption of linear additive effects. Another common justification for the use of the 2FE estimator is based on its equivalence to the difference-in-differences estimator under the simplest setting with two groups and two time periods. We show that this equivalence does not hold under more general settings commonly encountered in applied research. Instead, we prove that the multi-period difference-in-differences estimator is equivalent to the weighted 2FE estimator with some observations having negative weights. These analytical results imply that in contrast to the popular belief, the 2FE estimator does not represent a design-based, nonparametric estimation strategy for causal inference. Instead, its validity fundamentally rests on the modeling assumptions.","[{""name"": ""Kosuke Imai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""In Song Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.1111/ajps.12417"", ""10.1162/003355304772839588"", ""10.1017/pan.2016.2"", ""10.3386/w25018"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2826228"", ""10.3386/w24963"", ""10.3386/w25904"", ""10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08746"", ""10.1111/ajps.12185"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3158747"", ""10.1080/07350015.2018.1546591"", ""10.3368/jhr.50.2.301""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"

Despite what scholars and journalists consider a worrying trend, there is no evidence of growing popular concern about inequality. In fact, research suggests that citizens in unequal societies are less concerned than those in more egalitarian societies. How to make sense of this paradox? I argue that citizens’ consent to inequality is explained by their growing conviction that societal success is reflective of a meritocratic process. Drawing on 25 years of International Social Survey Program data, I show that rising inequality is legitimated by the popular belief that the income gap is meritocratically deserved: the more unequal a society, the more likely its citizens are to explain success in meritocratic terms, and the less important they deem nonmeritocratic factors such as a person’s family wealth and connections.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan J B Mijs"", ""affiliation"": [""London School of Economics & Political Science, International Inequalities Institute, London, UK"", ""Department of Sociology, William James Hall, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA""]}]","[""10.1093/0199267669.001.0001"", ""10.1257/aer.20162015"", ""10.1257/jel.49.1.3"", ""10.1162/qjec.2006.121.2.699"", ""10.1353/sof.2010.0033"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.31.041304.122232"", ""10.1177/0003122413498255"", ""10.1093/esr/jcv059"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2016.02.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492549"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2012.10.009"", ""10.1177/0958928710374373"", ""10.1177/0956797615586560"", ""10.1086/661290"", ""10.1017/psrm.2013.24"", ""10.1177/000169930204500402"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001595"", ""10.1111/ecpo.12103"", ""10.1007/s11211-016-0275-9"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139542425"", ""10.1007/s11205-015-1069-4"", ""10.1093/sf/90.1.65"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5890.2002.tb00072.x"", ""10.1515/9781400821730"", ""10.1111/1540-6237.00116"", ""10.1177/0038038516661264"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-031016-011009"", ""10.1177/0958928712471225"", ""10.1017/S0003975613000209"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00402.x"", ""10.1177/000312240907400101"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00472.x"", ""10.1093/ser/mwm006"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00033"", ""10.1257/aer.20130360"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226922591.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu011"", ""10.1177/0001699315622801"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-0448-5"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.1966.tb01164.x"", ""10.1093/ser/mwl002"", ""10.15453/0191-5096.2574"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-25991-8_2"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139225687"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102541"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2006.04.009"", ""10.1525/sop.2011.54.2.205"", ""10.1007/s11211-014-0228-0"", ""10.1177/2378023116632538"", ""10.1177/2378023118811805"", ""10.3390/soc8030064"", ""10.1016/S0176-2680(00)00014-8"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.623"", ""10.1111/j.0735-2166.2005.00239.x"", ""10.1086/696991"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131755"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001138"", ""10.1111/ajps.12153"", ""10.1177/1745691610393524"", ""10.1177/000312240607100305"", ""10.1177/0003122416642430"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2012.06.002"", ""10.1162/00335530360535135"", ""10.1086/657114"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043152"", ""10.1007/s13524-018-0721-4"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2014.03.001"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr023"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu030"", ""10.1093/esr/jcv090"", ""10.1007/s11211-016-0276-8"", ""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00331.x"", ""10.1177/000312240507000204"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9515.2011.00796.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01643.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000326"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.10.010"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4991.2009.00346.x"", ""10.1086/269496"", ""10.1111/spol.12192""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The articles in this issue explore the nature of these challenges by examining how the Westphalian order and the LIO have co-constituted one another over time; how both political and economic dynamics internal to the LIO threaten its core aspects; and how external threats combine with these internal dynamics to render the LIO more fragile than ever before. This introduction begins by defining and clarifying what is “liberal,” “international,” and “orderly” about the LIO. It then discusses some central challenges to the LIO, illustrated by the contributors to this issue as well as other sources. Finally, we reflect on the analytical lessons we have learned—or should learn—as the study of the LIO, represented by scholarship inInternational Organization, has sometimes overlooked or marginalized dynamics that now appear central to the functioning, and dysfunction, of the order itself.","[{""name"": ""David A.

10.1017/S0007123420000125,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Divided by the Vote: Affective Polarization in the Wake of the Brexit Referendum,"AbstractA well-functioning democracy requires a degree of mutual respect and a willingness to talk across political divides. Yet numerous studies have shown that many electorates are polarized along partisan lines, with animosity towards the partisan out-group. This article further develops the idea of affective polarization, not by partisanship, but instead by identification with opinion-based groups. Examining social identities formed during Britain's 2016 referendum on European Union membership, the study uses surveys and experiments to measure the intensity of partisan and Brexit-related affective polarization. The results show that Brexit identities are prevalent, felt to be personally important and cut across traditional party lines. These identities generate affective polarization as intense as that of partisanship in terms of stereotyping, prejudice and various evaluative biases, convincingly demonstrating that affective polarization can emerge from identities beyond partisanship.","[{""name"": ""Sara B.

10.1017/S0003055421000290,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Partisan Polarization Is the Primary Psychological Motivation behind Political Fake News Sharing on Twitter,"AbstractThe rise of “fake news” is a major concern in contemporary Western democracies. Yet, research on the psychological motivations behind the spread of political fake news on social media is surprisingly limited. Are citizens who share fake newsignorantand lazy? Are they fueled by sinister motives, seeking todisruptthe social status quo? Or do they seek to attack partisan opponents in an increasinglypolarizedpolitical environment? This article is the first to test these competing hypotheses based on a careful mapping of psychological profiles of over 2,300 American Twitter users linked to behavioral sharing data and sentiment analyses of more than 500,000 news story headlines. The findings contradict the ignorance perspective but provide some support for the disruption perspective and strong support for the partisan polarization perspective. Thus, individuals who report hating their political opponents are the most likely to share political fake news and selectively share content that is useful for derogating these opponents. Overall, our findings show that fake news sharing is fueled by the same psychological motivations that drive other forms of partisan behavior, including sharing partisan news from traditional and credible news sources.","[{""name"": ""MATHIAS OSMUNDSEN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ALEXANDER BOR"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""PETER BJERREGAARD VAHLSTRUP"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ANJA BECHMANN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MICHAEL BANG PETERSEN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.cognition.2018.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2014.01.016"", ""10.1111/ajps.12234"", ""10.1038/s41586-021-03344-2"", ""10.1111/pops.12479"", ""10.1177/0956797615594620"", ""10.31234/osf.io/kaby9"", ""10.1177/1065912916652503"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0833-x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.1126/science.aau2706"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01497.x"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1073/pnas.1618923114"", ""10.1162/003355305775097542"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0064"", ""10.1073/pnas.1806781116"", ""10.1177/0894439310397146"", ""10.1080/15205436.2018.1429635"", ""10.31234/osf.io/6m4ts"", ""10.1126/science.aao2998"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-040811-115123"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198835943.001.0001"", ""10.1037/11503-000"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1177/1461444818769689"", ""10.1086/688223"", ""10.1177/1461444820969893"", ""10.1111/jcom.12103"", ""10.1080/21670811.2019.1653208"", ""10.1111/ajps.12008"", ""10.1177/0894439319843669"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aau4586"", ""10.1017/S1930297500007622"", ""10.1177/0963721413510932"", ""10.1177/0956797620939054"", ""10.1177/0956797619887896"", ""10.1126/science.aaa1160"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1080/10999922.2017.1285540"", ""10.1177/2158244019832705""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000029,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,The Causal Effect of Radical Right Success on Mainstream Parties' Policy Positions: A Regression Discontinuity Approach,"This article investigates how the success of radical right parties affects the policy positions of mainstream parties. We do this using a regression discontinuity approach that allows us to causally attribute mainstream parties’ positional changes to radical right strength independent of public opinion as a potential confounder. Making use of exogenous variation created through differences in electoral thresholds, we empirically demonstrate that radical right success, indeed, causally affects mainstream parties’ positions. This is true for mainstream left as well as mainstream right parties. These findings make an important contribution to the broader literature on party competition as they indicate that other parties’ behavior and not only public opinion plays a crucial role in explaining parties’ policy shift.","[{""name"": ""Tarik Abou-Chadi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Werner Krause"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ajps.12127"", ""10.1177/0010414003251176"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02065.x"", ""10.1177/0010414013516069"", ""10.1080/01402380108425462"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510298"", ""10.1017/S0010417500004801"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00168.x"", ""10.1111/1468-0262.00183"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.981448"", ""10.1177/0010414004273928"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000155"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00274.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-031710-101450"", ""10.1017/S0007123404000201"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00199.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123409000635"", ""10.1177/1354068812462928"", ""10.1177/1354068810393265"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00369.x"", ""10.1080/01402380312331280598"", ""10.1080/13501760701847341"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00783.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.09.003"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006955"", ""10.1177/1465116511434788"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2007.10.006"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12015"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12121"", ""10.1177/0010414015575030"", ""10.3386/w14726"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000313"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.004"", ""10.1257/jel.48.2.281"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198273479.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1939-9162.2010.00006.x"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.005"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051701"", ""10.17645/pag.v3i2.64"", ""10.1080/01402389608425132"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.5771/9783845223414"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615955"", ""10.1086/680040"", ""10.1080/01402388708424629"", ""10.1017/S0022381608090154"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12032"", ""10.1016/0261-3794(89)90028-0"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(00)00045-7"", ""10.1111/1468-2354.t01-1-00055"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2013.830881"", ""10.1177/1354068809346002"", ""10.1177/001041407100300406"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-4541-9"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1086/685585"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.38"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12063"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00076""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1017/S000305542000009X,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Agenda Seeding: How 1960s Black Protests Moved Elites, Public Opinion and Voting","How do stigmatized minorities advance agendas when confronted with hostile majorities? Elite theories of influence posit marginal groups exert little power. I propose the concept of agenda seeding to describe how activists use methods like disruption to capture the attention of media and overcome political asymmetries. Further, I hypothesize protest tactics influence how news organizations frame demands. Evaluating black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, I find nonviolent activism, particularly when met with state or vigilante repression, drove media coverage, framing, congressional speech, and public opinion on civil rights. Counties proximate to nonviolent protests saw presidential Democratic vote share increase 1.6–2.5%. Protester-initiated violence, by contrast, helped move news agendas, frames, elite discourse, and public concern toward “social control.” In 1968, using rainfall as an instrument, I find violent protests likely caused a 1.5–7.9% shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election. Elites may dominate political communication but hold no monopoly.","[{""name"": ""OMAR WASOW"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S153759271000407X"", ""10.2307/1953984"", ""10.2307/2094726"", ""10.1353/sof.2006.0107"", ""10.1086/303110"", ""10.1177/2378023118803189"", ""10.1515/9781400889181"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02802.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817120"", ""10.2307/2110889"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12527"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000288"", ""10.1177/0002716293528001009"", ""10.1017/S0003055401000090"", ""10.2307/2111707"", ""10.1111/ajps.12384"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt021"", ""10.1017/S0898588X08000011"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000340"", ""10.2307/2088122"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510021"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36zqw3"", ""10.1086/267990"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276998.003.0005"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.105"", ""10.1177/000312240607100503"", ""10.2307/2939043"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.30.012703.110542"", ""10.2307/2110725"", ""10.4159/9780674041660"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810985"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080246"", ""10.2307/2580387"", ""10.1111/ajps.12181"", ""10.1111/lasr.12384"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001595"", ""10.1111/j.1475-682X.1986.tb00084.x"", ""10.2172/1157067"", ""10.1177/0002764216676246"", ""10.1353/urb.2004.0002"", ""10.1111/pops.12292"", ""10.1162/isec.2008.33.1.7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00452.x"", ""10.1086/JAAHv94n2p200"", ""10.1515/9780691218250"", ""10.5040/9798400698224"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.2307/2171753"", ""10.1017/S0898588X07000211"", ""10.1037/pspi0000230"", ""10.1111/ajps.12060"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139381277"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226216423.001.0001"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(81)90079-8"", ""10.1017/S0022050707000423"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226190518.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051506"", ""10.2307/3660172"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510458"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.611"", ""10.2307/2669264"", ""10.1086/378647"", ""10.1215/08992363-7-1-195"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000539""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1146/annurev-polisci-052217-104957,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VOL 23",0302 Political Science,The Changing Cleavage Politics of Western Europe,"How are the contours of Western European politics shifting? To what extent do these shifts reflect changes in the underlying social and economic structure of European polities? In this article, we reflect on insights from the classic literature on how cleavages structure party systems and consider how the emergence and persistence of new parties and new ideological conflicts are leading to both shifts of dividing lines of party competition and the fragmentation of party systems. While increasing attention has been given to the so-called second dimension of European electoral politics, we highlight the relatively limited focus on structural changes that are helping to drive this transformation. We identify some socio-demographic developments that are potentially generating new cleavages in Western European democracies: the expansion of higher education; mass migration and the growing ethnic diversity of electorates; the aging of societies and sharpening of generational divides; and increased geographical segregation of populations between prospering, globalized major cities and declining hinterlands.","[{""name"": ""Robert Ford"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom;""]}, {""name"": ""Will Jennings"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom;""]}]","[""10.1017/S0007123414000155"", ""10.1086/704436"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1615322"", ""10.1080/01402380312331280598"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00783.x"", ""10.1177/1354068813514885"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.01.001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2010.00863.x"", ""10.1017/S1755773910000366"", ""10.2307/422034"", ""10.1177/0010414012453032"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.773724"", ""10.1177/0010414019830714"", ""10.2307/2585579"", ""10.1093/019924488X.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2012.00947.x"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1339730"", ""10.1080/01402381003654569"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755934"", ""10.2307/2111573"", ""10.1017/S1537592707070788"", ""10.1080/09644008.2011.554109"", ""10.1017/9781108354943"", ""10.1017/S1062798708000264"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.401"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199663996.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68327-0"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198800583.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00829.x"", ""10.4324/9781315859057"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.01994.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000337"", ""10.4135/9781473982703"", ""10.1080/01402382.2018.1521673"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000375"", ""10.1017/9781316662557"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198842897.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060140"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070142"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-102512-194818"", ""10.1177/1465116513489779"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198297093.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000745"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199656639.001.0001"", ""10.1080/17457289.2011.562611"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134728"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000318"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.03.006"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199549948.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000409"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1177/0002764214566499"", ""10.1515/9780691186740"", ""10.1515/9780691214429"", ""10.1080/01402380701834747"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1017/9781108645157"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12228"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12612"", ""10.1177/1354068895001001001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511622014"", ""10.1086/662707"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12332"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.183"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2018.12.004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01092.x"", ""10.1037/h0054346"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000898"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.04.010"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1080/15377857.2018.1491439"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791017"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12259"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.41"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2018.1427053"", ""10.1177/1354068818810283"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1979.tb01267.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139171830"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-033649"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.031607.092945"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsx024"", ""10.1177/1354068815596514"", ""10.1080/09644016.2011.643371"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00784.x"", ""10.4324/9780203079546"", ""10.1515/9781400847488"", ""10.1080/09644008.2016.1182992"", ""10.1017/S000305540400098X"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12081"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614712"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12250"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2007.02.004"", ""10.1111/spsr.12136"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2008.00196.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00834.x"", ""10.1080/01402381003654544"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.13"", ""10.1057/ap.2009.25"", ""10.1080/13608746.2015.1119646"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.773725"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.06.007"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2007.00170.x"", ""10.1177/2053168019851680"", ""10.1080/01402381003654593"", ""10.1177/0010414004273928"", ""10.1057/ap.2012.5"", ""10.1057/s41295-018-0144-z"", ""10.1080/09644016.2013.824173"", ""10.1177/1354068810393267"", ""10.1177/0032321716639065"", ""10.1080/0964400042000229972""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1002/poi3.238,POLICY AND INTERNET,0302 Political Science; 0503 Journalism and Communication,"Social Media, Web, and Panel Surveys: Using Non-Probability Samples in Social and Policy Research","The use of online surveys has grown rapidly in social science and policy research, surpassing more established methods. We argue that a better understanding is needed, especially of the strengths and weaknesses of non‐probability online surveys, which can be conducted relatively quickly and cheaply. We describe two common approaches to non‐probability online surveys—river and panel sampling—and theorize their inherent selection biases: namely, topical self‐selection and economic self‐selection. We conduct an empirical comparison of two river samples (Facebook and web‐based sample) and one panel sample (from a major survey research company) with benchmark data grounded in a comprehensive population registry. The river samples diverge from the benchmark on demographic variables and yield much higher frequencies on non‐demographic variables, even after demographic adjustments; we attribute this to topical self‐selection. The panel sample is closer to the benchmark. When examining the characteristics of a non‐demographic subpopulation, we detect no differences between the river and panel samples. We conclude that non‐probability online surveys do not replace probability surveys, but augment the researcher's toolkit with new digital practices, such as exploratory studies of small and emerging non‐demographic subpopulations.","[{""name"": ""Vili Lehdonvirta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Atte Oksanen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pekka Räsänen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Grant Blank"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00112.x"", ""10.1177/0894439315573926"", ""10.1177/0894439316671698"", ""10.4135/9781473957992.n36"", ""10.1177/0894439315579246"", ""10.1002/9781118763520"", ""10.1093/poq/nfn065"", ""10.1002/9781118763520"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp075"", ""10.1073/pnas.1808083115"", ""10.1086/318641"", ""10.1093/poq/nfi002"", ""10.1111/add.12150"", ""10.1177/0894439315573925"", ""10.1089/cyber.2012.0231"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2012.751621"", ""10.1002/1944-2866.POI328"", ""10.1086/381773"", ""10.1002/0471725277"", ""10.5210/fm.v7i4.942"", ""10.1111/j.1651-2227.2011.02587.x"", ""10.1002/9781118763520.ch10"", ""10.1093/poq/nfl035"", ""10.4135/9781412963947"", ""10.1111/ntwe.12102"", ""10.1080/01972243.2014.915277"", ""10.1177/0894439315574248"", ""10.1093/pan/mpm003"", ""10.1177/000312240907400202"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.09.019"", ""10.1086/690118"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12253"", ""10.1108/01443330610644425"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12216"", ""10.3141/2354-04"", ""10.2501/S0021849907070201"", ""10.4135/9781452229812"", ""10.1086/269315"", ""10.15195/v1.a19"", ""10.1093/poq/nfr020"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00112.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1146/annurev-polisci-041719-102405,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VOL 24, 2021",0302 Political Science,The Backlash Against Globalization,"In recent years, the world has seen a rising backlash against globalization. This article reviews the nature, causes, and consequences of the globalization backlash. It shows that, contrary to a popular narrative, the backlash is not associated with a large swing in public opinion against globalization but is rather a result of its politicization. The increasing influence of globalization-skeptic actors has resulted in more protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist policies, some of which fundamentally threaten pillars of the contemporary international order. Both material and nonmaterial causes drive the globalization backlash, and these causes interact and mediate each other. The consequences are shaped by the responses of societal actors, national governments, and international policy makers. These responses can either yield to and reinforce the global backlash or push back against it. Understanding these dynamics will be an important task for future research.","[{""name"": ""Stefanie Walter"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Zurich, 8050 Zurich, Switzerland;""]}]","[""10.1177/0032321717725485"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000029"", ""10.1111/ajps.12503"", ""10.1093/ejil/chw019"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9341-4"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12621"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12046"", ""10.1177/1354068812462931"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09351-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678662"", ""10.1111/ajps.12449"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1488880"", ""10.1177/1465116514551303"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1713193"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000314"", ""10.1177/1465116512467546"", ""10.1057/s41311-017-0040-1"", ""10.3386/w23415"", ""10.1086/702232"", ""10.1177/0010414019830714"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000552"", ""10.1080/14782804.2020.1714560"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1257/jep.33.4.128"", ""10.1093/wber/lhx027"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190916473.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414008325576"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000849"", ""10.1111/jcms.12579"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793380.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1354068808097889"", ""10.2307/j.ctvt9k3d3"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000491"", ""10.1080/07036337.2010.546849"", ""10.4324/9781315634418"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000620"", ""10.3386/w21812"", ""10.1257/aer.20170011"", ""10.1086/702230"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678056"", ""10.1080/09692290.2013.839463"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy025"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00774.x"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9340-5"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00351"", ""10.1086/682151"", ""10.1257/aer.20181164"", ""10.1177/1465116517723499"", ""10.1093/oxrep/gry007"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.03.006"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042814-012441"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000478"", ""10.1177/1369148117710799"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx086"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000492"", ""10.1177/1465116519892328"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx022"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09344-2"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3289741"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001757"", ""10.1177/0010414015621077"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-102512-194818"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050150"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.04.002"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1225785"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042214-044157"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000125"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000409"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.43"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316422991"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1619801"", ""10.1177/2053168018822395"", ""10.1111/pops.12627"", ""10.1086/702231"", ""10.1177/1465116520928118"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.41"", ""10.1177/0032321720956326"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1177/0010414020912283"", ""10.1177/1354068815603241"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000636"", ""10.5089/9781484347065.001"", ""10.1177/0010414019897686"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00589.x"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1674906"", ""10.1017/S1744552318000034"", ""10.1111/ajps.12012"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000569"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090158"", ""10.1017/S0043887113000191"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00747.x"", ""10.1177/1354068815601787"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678058"", ""10.1177/0010414021997175"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1712457"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02065.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-063806"", ""10.1111/aepr.12035"", ""10.1017/9781108757683.002"", ""10.1017/S0043887114000203"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000044"", ""10.1007/s40797-020-00121-4"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx020"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000339"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1307245"", ""10.1093/isq/sqaa073"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12355"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678663"", ""10.1177/0022343319881175"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1712453"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9326-3"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsx024"", ""10.1057/s42214-018-0001-4"", ""10.3386/w27526"", ""10.1177/0010414017710264"", ""10.1177/1360780418768828"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491870"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1086/705924"", ""10.1111/spsr.12167"", ""10.1177/1465116516681858"", ""10.1080/09512748.2020.1779794"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198843047.001.0001"", ""10.1093/soceco/1.2.215"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9330-7"", ""10.1017/S1537592720001218"", ""10.1017/S1537592719000975"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09352-2"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00593.x"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.64"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000255"", ""10.1017/S002081832000048X"", ""10.30875/4a0b4159-en"", ""10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110126"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672097.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1752971912000012""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12425,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic: Rally around the flag or lockdown effects?,"AbstractHow can we explain the rise in diffuse political support during the Covid‐19 pandemic? Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid‐19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre‐existing time trends. Accounting for non‐linearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid‐19 infections on political trust. In line with an anxiety effect, I find that standard determinants of political trust – such as economic evaluations and social trust – lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.","[{""name"": ""DOMINIK SCHRAFF"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Comparative and International Studies ETH Zürich  Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00533.x"", ""10.1017/psrm.2020.17"", ""10.1017/9781108684606"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9339-y"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12419"", ""10.1177/1465116517723499"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt019"", ""10.1023/A:1022908232719"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.27"", ""10.1080/02699931.2018.1460321"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.31234/osf.io/mpbtr"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12115""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The study is based on a large web‐survey panel with adult Swedes (n = 11,406) in which the same individuals were asked the same set of questions at two different time points during the coronavirus pandemic (t0 and t1). The sample was self‐selected but diverse (a smaller subsample, n = 1,464, was pre‐stratified to be representative of the Swedish population on key demographics). We find support for the view that the corona crisis led to higher levels of institutional and interpersonal trust. Moreover, reactions were largely homogeneous across those groups that could potentially relate distantly to government authorities.","[{""name"": ""PETER ESAIASSON"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Gothenburg  Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""JACOB SOHLBERG"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Gothenburg  Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""MARINA GHERSETTI"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Gothenburg  Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""BENGT JOHANSSON"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Gothenburg  Sweden""]}]","[""10.31235/osf.io/dkusw"", ""10.1177/0022002701045005006"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu096"", ""10.1007/s10683-010-9257-1"", ""10.4324/9780203360804"", ""10.1111/pops.12025"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.61.4.629"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.1257/aer.90.4.980"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990104"", ""10.1097/EDE.0b013e3182109296"", ""10.1017/S1049096503001665"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.12147"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00863"", ""10.1177/0963721411422060"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.475"", ""10.30636/jbpa.31.147"", ""10.30636/jbpa.31.147"", ""10.2307/1955610"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2012.00932.x"", ""10.4337/9781782545118.00012"", ""10.2307/1964229"", ""10.12840/issn.2255-4165.2018.06.01.016"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1783787"", ""10.1177/1043463108099349"", ""10.3310/hta14340-03"", ""10.1027/1016-9040/a000169"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9322-8"", ""10.1146/annurev.ps.33.020182.000245"", ""10.2147/RMHP.S4810"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614934"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190887223.003.0003"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-11-575"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2009.162537"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

To explain when and how finance wins, the literature emphasizes lobbying capacity (instrumental power) and the financial sector’s central position in the economy (structural power). Increasingly, however, finance also enjoys infrastructural power, which stems from entanglements between specific financial markets and public-sector actors, such as treasuries and central banks, which govern by transacting in those markets. To demonstrate the analytical value of this perspective, the article traces how the European Central Bank (ECB), motivated by monetary policy considerations, has shaped post-crisis financial policymaking in the EU. It shows that the ECB has played a key part in fending off a financial transaction tax on repos and in shoring up and rebuilding the securitization market. With market-based forms of state agency on the rise, infrastructural entanglement and power shed new light on the politics of finance.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Braun"", ""affiliation"": [""Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne, Germany""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jfineco.2012.09.004"", ""10.1080/03085147.2017.1359909"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1235599"", ""10.1080/13563467.2014.951426"", ""10.1177/0032329213512976"", ""10.1515/9781400873500"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760716"", ""10.1515/bap-2015-0031"", ""10.1177/0032329214547342"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112402"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1232708"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv011"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu004"", ""10.1177/1470594X16651056"", ""10.1057/9780230295049"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1070894"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1207699"", ""10.1111/jcms.12309"", ""10.15195/v3.a22"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.03.016"", ""10.1162/002081898550644"", ""10.1017/S0043887113000221"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199662289.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198755661.003.0001"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu017"", ""10.1515/til-2014-004"", ""10.1177/0032329216655316"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1311850"", ""10.4324/9780203523025"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139015011"", ""10.1080/13563467.2015.1079168"", ""10.1177/0002716204272371"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv019"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.896269"", ""10.1017/S0003975600004239"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511570902"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1371061"", ""10.1177/1024529418758479"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1325765"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv024"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2013.03.003"", ""10.1086/692461"", ""10.1080/09692290.2013.860612"", ""10.1080/13563467.2015.1134465"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv016"", ""10.1177/0032329216655318"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198793373.003.0010"", ""10.1111/rego.12098"", ""10.1177/0032329216638061""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Finance'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1017/S0003055419000807,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,When the Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts: On the Conceptualization and Measurement of Populist Attitudes and Other Multidimensional Constructs,"Multidimensional concepts are non-compensatory when higher values on one component cannot offset lower values on another. Thinking of the components of a multidimensional phenomenon as non-compensatory rather than substitutable can have wide-ranging implications, both conceptually and empirically. To demonstrate this point, we focus on populist attitudes that feature prominently in contemporary debates about liberal democracy. Given similar established public opinion constructs, the conceptual value of populist attitudes hinges on its unique specification as an attitudinal syndrome, which is characterized by the concurrent presence of its non-compensatory concept subdimensions. Yet this concept attribute is rarely considered in existing empirical research. We propose operationalization strategies that seek to take the distinct properties of non-compensatory multidimensional concepts seriously. Evidence on five populism scales in 12 countries reveals the presence and consequences of measurement-concept inconsistencies. Importantly, in some cases, using conceptually sound operationalization strategies upsets previous findings on the substantive role of populist attitudes.","[{""name"": ""ALEXANDER WUTTKE"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""CHRISTIAN SCHIMPF"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""HARALD SCHOEN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2127102"", ""10.1007/s11615-018-0131-7"", ""10.1057/9781137414113"", ""10.1177/1065912916639138"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00708.x"", ""10.2307/1958356"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1674906"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.30"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.2307/2111227"", ""10.1177/1354068819868908"", ""10.1080/09644008.2018.1484906"", ""10.1080/15205436.2017.1291817"", ""10.1177/106591299705000412"", ""10.2307/2111517"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.27"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.5.2.155"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12224"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199689491.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11205-017-1832-9"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2011.10.005"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12314"", ""10.1177/1354068819848112"", ""10.4324/9781315196923-7"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12216"", ""10.1177/0010414009331721"", ""10.2307/j.ctvk12sz4"", ""10.1177/2053168018801469"", ""10.1177/0003122416663683"", ""10.2307/1959140"", ""10.1080/08913810608443650"", ""10.2307/3235246"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9558.2011.01388.x"", ""10.1177/1369148117701753"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.110.2.305"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226452593.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edw037"", ""10.4324/9780203808030"", ""10.4324/9781315196923"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1287448"", ""10.2307/422412"", ""10.2307/1963953"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.17"", ""10.1353/book.3406"", ""10.4324/9781315196923-8"", ""10.1007/978-1-4939-0317-7"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1602.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12032"", ""10.4324/9781315196923"", ""10.1177/0002716216662639"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000538"", ""10.1177/0149206307312506"", ""10.1177/0013164415589595"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00339"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0196292"", ""10.2307/2938818"", ""10.1515/9781400842995"", ""10.1177/1354068808097890""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

However, supporting empirical evidence is weak, particularly in the context of real-world conflict. Mousa randomized Christian Iraqi refugees to soccer teams that were composed of either all Christian players or a mixture of Christian and Muslim players (see the Perspective by Paluck and Clark). Playing on the same team as Muslims had positive effects on Christian players' attitudes and behaviors toward Muslims within the context of soccer, but these effects did not generalize to non-soccer contexts. These findings have implications for the potential benefits and limits of positive intergroup contact for achieving peace between groups.

10.1017/pan.2023.2,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,"Out of One, Many: Using Language Models to Simulate Human Samples","AbstractWe propose and explore the possibility that language models can be studied as effective proxies for specific human subpopulations in social science research. Practical and research applications of artificial intelligence tools have sometimes been limited by problematic biases (such as racism or sexism), which are often treated as uniform properties of the models. We show that the “algorithmic bias” within one such tool—the GPT-3 language model—is instead both fine-grained and demographically correlated, meaning that proper conditioning will cause it to accurately emulate response distributions from a wide variety of human subgroups. We term this propertyalgorithmic fidelityand explore its extent in GPT-3. We create “silicon samples” by conditioning the model on thousands of sociodemographic backstories from real human participants in multiple large surveys conducted in the United States. We then compare the silicon and human samples to demonstrate that the information contained in GPT-3 goes far beyond surface similarity. It is nuanced, multifaceted, and reflects the complex interplay between ideas, attitudes, and sociocultural context that characterize human attitudes. We suggest that language models with sufficient algorithmic fidelity thus constitute a novel and powerful tool to advance understanding of humans and society across a variety of disciplines.","[{""name"": ""Lisa P.

Or, does the racialized nature of these events polarize mass opinion based on standing racial and political orientations? To answer these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.","[{""name"": ""TYLER T.

But do liberals and conservatives in the United States embrace conspiratorial thinking to an equivalent degree? There are important historical, philosophical, and scientific reasons dating back to Richard Hofstadter's bookThe Paranoid Style in American Politicsto doubt this claim. In four large studies of U.S. adults (totalN = 5049)—including national samples—we investigated the relationship between political ideology, measured in both symbolic and operational terms, and conspiratorial thinking in general. Results reveal that conservatives in the United States were not only more likely than liberals to endorse specific conspiracy theories, but they were also more likely to espouse conspiratorial worldviews in general (r = .27, 95% CI: .24, .30). Importantly, extreme conservatives were significantly more likely to engage in conspiratorial thinking than extreme liberals (Hedges'g = .77,SE = .07,p &lt; .001). The relationship between ideology and conspiratorial thinking was mediated by a strong distrust of officialdom and paranoid ideation, both of which were higher among conservatives, consistent with Hofstadter's account of the paranoid style in American politics.","[{""name"": ""Sander van der Linden"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cambridge""]}, {""name"": ""Costas Panagopoulos"", ""affiliation"": [""Northeastern University""]}, {""name"": ""Flávio Azevedo"", ""affiliation"": [""New York University"", ""Cologne University"", ""Friedrich‐Schiller Universität Jena""]}, {""name"": ""John T.

Starting from the premise that nationalism is a global and ubiquitous idea in the contemporary world, it explores whether exclusionary tendencies have been reinforced by the pandemic. The pandemic and government responses will not necessarily trigger the increase in exclusionary nationalism that both far-right politicians and observers have noted. However, there are 4 aspects, examined in the article, that might be shaped by the pandemic. These include the recent trajectory of nationalism and its social relevance prior to the pandemic,the rise of authoritarianism as governments suspend or reduce democratic freedoms and civil liberties, the rise of biases against some groups associated with the pandemic, the rise of borders and deglobalization, and the politics of fear. Thus, while the rise of exclusionary nationalism might not be the inevitable consequence of the pandemic, it risks reinforcing preexisting nationalist dynamics.","[{""name"": ""Florian Bieber"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532635"", ""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532633"", ""10.5539/res.v9n1p158"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00325.x"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1177/0022343311425693"", ""10.5040/9781350098558"", ""10.1525/9780520342057"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12072"", ""10.1080/09557570008400339"", ""10.4324/9780203806210"", ""10.1017/S0043887100020852"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2018.304328"", ""10.1017/9781108589451"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02328""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1080/14494035.2021.1928377,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Governance of artificial intelligence,"ABSTRACT The rapid developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the intensification in the adoption of AI in domains such as autonomous vehicles, lethal weapon systems, robotics and alike pose serious challenges to governments as they must manage the scale and speed of socio-technical transitions occurring. While there is considerable literature emerging on various aspects of AI, governance of AI is a significantly underdeveloped area. The new applications of AI offer opportunities for increasing economic efficiency and quality of life, but they also generate unexpected and unintended consequences and pose new forms of risks that need to be addressed. To enhance the benefits from AI while minimising the adverse risks, governments worldwide need to understand better the scope and depth of the risks posed and develop regulatory and governance processes and structures to address these challenges. This introductory article unpacks AI and describes why the Governance of AI should be gaining far more attention given the myriad of challenges it presents. It then summarises the special issue articles and highlights their key contributions. This special issue introduces the multifaceted challenges of governance of AI, including emerging governance approaches to AI, policy capacity building, exploring legal and regulatory challenges of AI and Robotics, and outstanding issues and gaps that need attention. The special issue showcases the state-of-the-art in the governance of AI, aiming to enable researchers and practitioners to appreciate the challenges and complexities of AI governance and highlight future avenues for exploration.","[{""name"": ""Araz Taeihagh"", ""affiliation"": [""Policy Systems Group, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, Singapore""]}]","[""10.1109/IVS.2019.8813817"", ""10.1080/03071847.2019.1694260"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0080"", ""10.3390/su12197844"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12890"", ""10.1080/08839514.2019.1600301"", ""10.1080/14494035.2021.1927588"", ""10.1177/2053951719860542"", ""10.1111/rego.12344"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019"", ""10.1109/MIC.2017.4180835"", ""10.1609/aimag.v38i3.2741"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0307-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90869-4_6"", ""10.1177/0270467617719820"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101381"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101493"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2011.02.004"", ""10.4271/2016-01-0128"", ""10.5235/17579961.6.2.193"", ""10.1080/17579961.2017.1304921"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-3384-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-3384-2_8"", ""10.3390/en11051277"", ""10.3390/en11051062"", ""10.3390/su11205791"", ""10.3390/su10020440"", ""10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.1080/20508840.2019.1664543"", ""10.3390/bdcc3020026"", ""10.1057/s41599-020-0501-9"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9430-8"", ""10.1007/s12369-014-0242-2"", ""10.1080/15027570.2014.975010"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9234-6"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2016.08.018"", ""10.1080/01441647.2018.1494640"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101546"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120686"", ""10.4018/JDM.2019010104"", ""10.1080/01900692.2018.1498103"", ""10.1080/01900692.2020.1749851"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.001""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Drawing on quantitative data, archival work, and elite interviews, we review empirical support for this model and find that the evidence for its claims is weak relative to the theory’s pervasive influence. We find, first, that the strongest collective action claims appear empirically unsubstantiated in many important climate politics cases. Second, collective action claims—whether in their strongest or in more nuanced versions—appear observationally equivalent to alternative theories focused on distributive conflict within countries. We argue that extant patterns of climate policy making can be explained without invoking free-riding. Governments implement climate policies regardless of what other countries do, and they do so whether a climate treaty dealing with free-riding has been in place or not. Without an empirically grounded model for global climate policy making, institutional and political responses to climate change may ineffectively target the wrong policy-making dilemma. We urge scholars to redouble their efforts to analyze the empirical linkages between domestic and international factors shaping climate policy making in an effort to empirically ground theories of global climate politics. Such analysis is, in turn, the topic of this issue’s special section.","[{""name"": ""Michaël Aklin"", ""affiliation"": [""Michaël Aklin is associate professor of political science and public policy at the University of Pittsburgh.

Previous research, based on observational data, has reached conflicting conclusions about this foundational assumption. We use experiments to examine two mechanisms—responsiveness and selection—through which opinion could shape decisions about the use of military force. We tested responsiveness by asking members of the Israeli parliament to consider a crisis in which we randomized information about public opinion. Parliamentarians were more willing to use military force when the public was in favor and believed that contravening public opinion would entail heavy political costs. We tested selection by asking citizens in Israel and the US to evaluate parties/candidates, which varied randomly on many dimensions. In both countries, security policy proved as electorally significant as economic and religious policy, and far more consequential than nonpolicy considerations such as gender, race, and experience. Overall, our experiments in two important democracies imply that citizens can affect policy by incentivizing incumbents and shaping who gets elected.","[{""name"": ""Michael Tomz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jessica L.P.

10.1017/S1537592720001243,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Conceptualizing Criminal Governance,"In informal urban areas throughout the developing world, and even in some US and UK neighborhoods, tens if not hundreds of millions of people live under some form of criminal governance. For them, states’ claims of a monopoly on the use of force ring hollow; for many issues, a local criminal organization is the relevant authority. Yet the state is far from absent: residents may pay taxes, vote, and even inform on gangs as punishment for abusive behavior. Criminal governance flourishes in pockets of low state presence, but ones that states can generally enter at will, if not always without violence. It thus differs from state, corporate, and rebel governance because it is embedded within larger domains of state power. I develop a conceptual framework centered around the who, what, and how of criminal governance, organizing extant research and proposing a novel dimension: charismatic versus rational-bureaucratic forms of criminal authority. I then delineate the logics that may drive criminal organizations to provide governance for non-members, establishing building blocks for future theory-building and -testing. Finally, I explore how criminal governance intersects with the state, refining the concept of crime–state “symbiosis” and distinguishing it from neighboring concepts in organized-crime and drug-violence scholarship.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Lessing"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226345536.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.1994.tb01309.x"", ""10.1525/9780520911314"", ""10.1023/A:1013355122531"", ""10.4159/9780674969223"", ""10.1590/S0103-49792010000100005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760891"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316182468.012"", ""10.1057/9780230101333_9"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-060415-093825"", ""10.25222/larr.387"", ""10.1353/sor.2007.0000"", ""10.1017/9781316650073"", ""10.1017/S1537592712000655"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818462"", ""10.1590/S0103-40142007000300004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283.008"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(93)90048-E"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469623405.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781316823705"", ""10.1215/00382876-2692191"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316711323"", ""10.1080/14718800108405087"", ""10.1177/0011392116667165"", ""10.11606/0103-2070.ts.2017.125494"", ""10.25222/larr.377"", ""10.1093/bjc/azx078"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000928"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000856"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990128"", ""10.1017/S0023879100018136"", ""10.25222/larr.334"", ""10.1590/S1517-45222006000200011"", ""10.1525/9780520909540"", ""10.1080/17440572.2010.490632"", ""10.1111/j.1542-4774.2012.01099.x"", ""10.2307/2938736"", ""10.1177/1043463117701132"", ""10.7560/728608-009"", ""10.31060/rbsp.2016.v10.n2.698"", ""10.1177/0022343315626239"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000335"", ""10.1007/s10611-009-9195-z"", ""10.1017/S1537592717002110"", ""10.1017/9781316421925"", ""10.4000/etnografica.303"", ""10.1177/0022427894031003002"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135218"", ""10.1007/s12116-017-9242-1"", ""10.1590/S0103-20702010000200003"", ""10.1007/s10940-018-9393-x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808654""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Epidemiology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In particular, police administrative records lack information on civilians police observe but do not investigate. In this article, we show that if police racially discriminate when choosing whom to investigate, analyses using administrative records to estimate racial discrimination in police behavior are statistically biased, and many quantities of interest are unidentified—even among investigated individuals—absent strong and untestable assumptions. Using principal stratification in a causal mediation framework, we derive the exact form of the statistical bias that results from traditional estimation. We develop a bias-correction procedure and nonparametric sharp bounds for race effects, replicate published findings, and show the traditional estimator can severely underestimate levels of racially biased policing or mask discrimination entirely. We conclude by outlining a general and feasible design for future studies that is robust to this inferential snare.","[{""name"": ""DEAN KNOX"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""WILL LOWE"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JONATHAN MUMMOLO"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1073/pnas.1910157116"", ""10.1007/s10940-005-9000-9"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00539.x"", ""10.1080/21565503.2016.1160413"", ""10.1080/01621459.1997.10474074"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135218"", ""10.1016/0378-3758(90)90077-8"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226041049.001.0001"", ""10.1515/jci-2018-2001"", ""10.1080/01621459.2019.1585248"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-060415-093825"", ""10.1111/1745-9133.12269"", ""10.1073/pnas.1805161115"", ""10.2307/2110474"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043455"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195370409.001.0001"", ""10.1093/qje/qjy012"", ""10.1257/jep.12.2.91"", ""10.1111/j.1751-2409.2011.01039.x"", ""10.1016/0047-2352(82)90001-0"", ""10.1214/15-AOAS897"", ""10.3818/JRP.4.1.2002.131"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcm4j72"", ""10.1080/15614260802586350"", ""10.2307/2981697"", ""10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00536.x"", ""10.1198/016214506000000168"", ""10.1214/17-AOAS1058"", ""10.1097/EDE.0b013e31818f69ce"", ""10.1037/h0043424"", ""10.1073/pnas.1821204116"", ""10.1257/aer.104.11.3397"", ""10.1073/pnas.1903856116"", ""10.2202/1557-4679.1329"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00626.x"", ""10.1086/701423"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226065090.001.0001"", ""10.1086/703539"", ""10.1177/0306396814556223"", ""10.1111/j.0006-341X.2002.00021.x"", ""10.1198/016214506000001040"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226137971.001.0001"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00110"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000494"", ""10.2307/1912352"", ""10.1097/01.ede.0000135174.63482.43"", ""10.1016/j.annepidem.2016.08.016"", ""10.1080/01621459.1986.10478354"", ""10.1073/pnas.1919418117"", ""10.4159/9780674045200"", ""10.1086/694393"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.876"", ""10.1111/ajps.12288"", ""10.1162/rest.91.1.163"", ""10.1086/686690"", ""10.2307/1143211"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.3102/10769986028004353"", ""10.1017/S000305541800093X"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-032015-010015"", ""10.1097/00001648-200009000-00011"", ""10.1080/01621459.1996.10476902"", ""10.1037/h0037350"", ""10.1086/318603"", ""10.1080/07418820500088952""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Statistics and Probability', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12589,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,(Almost) Everything in Moderation: New Evidence on Americans' Online Media Diets,"AbstractDoes the internet facilitate selective exposure to politically congenial content? To answer this question, I introduce and validate large‐N behavioral data on Americans' online media consumption in both 2015 and 2016. I then construct a simple measure of media diet slant and use machine classification to identify individual articles related to news about politics. I find that most people across the political spectrum have relatively moderate media diets, about a quarter of which consist of mainstream news websites and portals. Quantifying the similarity of Democrats' and Republicans' media diets, I find nearly 65% overlap in the two groups' distributions in 2015 and roughly 50% in 2016. An exception to this picture is a small group of partisans who drive a disproportionate amount of traffic to ideologically slanted websites. If online “echo chambers” exist, they are a reality for relatively few people who may nonetheless exert disproportionate influence and visibility.","[{""name"": ""Andrew M.

In this paper, we discuss the use of this identification strategy based on unforeseen and salient events that split the sample of respondents into treatment and control groups: the Unexpected Event during Survey Design. In particular, we focus on the assumptions under which unexpected events can be exploited to estimate causal effects and we discuss potential threats to identification, paying especial attention to the observable and testable implications of these assumptions. We propose a series of best practices in the form of various estimation strategies and robustness checks that can be used to lend credibility to the causal estimates. Drawing on data from the European Social Survey, we illustrate the discussion of this method with an original study of the impact of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks (Paris, 01/07/2015) on French citizens’ satisfaction with their national government.","[{""name"": ""Jordi Muñoz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Falcó-Gimeno"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Enrique Hernández"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1073/pnas.1800302115"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2016.04.015"", ""10.1111/ajps.12159"", ""10.1080/21565503.2013.842492"", ""10.1177/1532673X12456237"", ""10.1177/0956797616680396"", ""10.1086/669605"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02416.x"", ""10.1177/2053168017714185"", ""10.1017/S1537592716002863"", ""10.1561/100.00017138"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.4"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00022-1"", ""10.1177/0146167217752118"", ""10.1023/A:1024409732742"", ""10.1086/267688"", ""10.1177/2053168018806391"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000092"", ""10.1086/267689"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edm012"", ""10.1080/13504851.2016.1254335"", ""10.1111/ajps.12332"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl008"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.8"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2008.09.001"", ""10.1007/s11127-017-0477-1"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.001"", ""10.1177/1525822X03259479"", ""10.1111/ajps.12357"", ""10.1177/1098214014527337"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793380.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12025"", ""10.1093/sf/soy001"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-101513-113724"", ""10.1093/esr/jcx081"", ""10.1057/eps.2015.67"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edt036"", ""10.1007/s11127-011-9895-7""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Statistics and Probability', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We argue that it does, through two mechanisms. First, in an age of elite polarization, norms have been politicized. This leads affectively polarized partisans to oppose particular constitutional protections when their party is in power but support them when their party is out of power, via a cue-taking mechanism. Second, affective polarization may generate biases that motivate voters to restrict the other party’s rights. Using nationally representative surveys, we find strong support for the cue-taking argument. In 2019, with a Republican administration in power, affectively polarized Republicans opposed constitutional protections while affectively polarized Democrats supported them. The reverse was true in 2012 during a Democratic administration. The findings have important, albeit troubling, implications for American democracy, as affective polarization undermines support for basic democratic principles.","[{""name"": ""Jon Kingzette"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James N Druckman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samara Klar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yanna Krupnikov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Levendusky"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Barry Ryan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.870"", ""10.1073/pnas.2007747117"", ""10.1017/S153759271900001X"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09530-3"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.09.002"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-01012-5"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12527"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000052"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226299358.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.1002/polq.12699"", ""10.1111/pops.12244"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy014"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199772759.001.0001"", ""10.1086/688223"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003286"", ""10.2307/1952868"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1086/269363"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00708.x"", ""10.2307/2952354"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz034""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1017/S0003055419000923,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Reducing Exclusionary Attitudes through Interpersonal Conversation: Evidence from Three Field Experiments,"Exclusionary attitudes—prejudice toward outgroups and opposition to policies that promote their well-being—are presenting challenges to democratic societies worldwide. Drawing on insights from psychology, we argue that non-judgmentally exchanging narratives in interpersonal conversations can facilitate durable reductions in exclusionary attitudes. We support this argument with evidence from three pre-registered field experiments targeting exclusionary attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants and transgender people. In these experiments, 230 canvassers conversed with 6,869 voters across 7 US locations. In Experiment 1, face-to-face conversations deploying arguments alone had no effects on voters’ exclusionary immigration policy or prejudicial attitudes, but otherwise identical conversations also including the non-judgmental exchange of narratives durably reduced exclusionary attitudes for at least four months (d = 0.08). Experiments 2 and 3, targeting transphobia, replicate these findings and support the scalability of this strategy (ds = 0.08, 0.04). Non-judgmentally exchanging narratives can help overcome the resistance to persuasion often encountered in discussions of these contentious topics.","[{""name"": ""JOSHUA L.

However, this is not a sufficient explanation for less salient and politically charged questions. More attention needs to be given to anti-intellectualism—the generalized mistrust of intellectuals and experts. Using data from the General Social Survey and a survey of 3,600 Americans on Amazon Mechanical Turk, I provide evidence of a strong association between anti-intellectualism and opposition to scientific positions on climate change, nuclear power, GMOs, and water fluoridation, particularly for respondents with higher levels of political interest. Second, a survey experiment shows that anti-intellectualism moderates the acceptance of expert consensus cues such that respondents with high levels of anti-intellectualism actually increase their opposition to these positions in response. Third, evidence shows anti-intellectualism is connected to populism, a worldview that sees political conflict as primarily between ordinary citizens and a privileged societal elite. Exposure to randomly assigned populist rhetoric, even that which does not pertain to experts directly, primes anti-intellectual predispositions among respondents in the processing of expert consensus cues. These findings suggest that rising anti-elite rhetoric may make anti-intellectual sentiment more salient in information processing.","[{""name"": ""Eric Merkley"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11109-005-8145-4"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000186"", ""10.1515/for-2016-0021"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.37.8.1387"", ""10.1080/10584609.2014.944320"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.568"", ""10.1111/j.1741-5705.2004.00222.x"", ""10.1177/0956797612449177"", ""10.1177/0002716209351526"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00077"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814"", ""10.1080/13669877.2010.511246"", ""10.1007/s11109-016-9379-z"", ""10.1086/670610"", ""10.2307/2132190"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1177/0963721416654436"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195342642.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400889181"", ""10.1111/ajps.12357"", ""10.1177/1532673X17719507"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1017/XPS.2014.22"", ""10.1177/0002716216662639"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226578644.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1915"", ""10.1111/j.1475-682X.1991.tb00172.x"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.30"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb03023.x"", ""10.1017/S153759270707079X"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0118489"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.01.009"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2012.05.002"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We discuss several novel estimators under this framework, including the fixed effects counterfactual estimator, interactive fixed effects counterfactual estimator and matrix completion estimator. They provide more reliable causal estimates than conventional two‐way fixed effects models when treatment effects are heterogeneous or unobserved time‐varying confounders exist. Moreover, we propose a new dynamic treatment effects plot, along with several diagnostic tests, to help researchers gauge the validity of the identifying assumptions. We illustrate these methods with two political economy examples and develop an open‐source package, fect, in both R and Stata to facilitate implementation.","[{""name"": ""Licheng Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Massachusetts Institute of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Ye Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill""]}, {""name"": ""Yiqing Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University""]}]","[""10.1111/0034-6527.00321"", ""10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08746"", ""10.3386/w28364"", ""10.3386/w25532"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0262.2006.00668.x"", ""10.1080/01621459.2021.1891924"", ""10.3982/ECTA6135"", ""10.1080/01621459.2021.1967163"", ""10.1080/01621459.2021.1929245"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000357"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001"", ""10.1257/aer.20181169"", ""10.1017/pan.2022.8"", ""10.1086/681563"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00537"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.03.014"", ""10.1111/ajps.12433"", ""10.1111/ajps.12387"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.43"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3214231"", ""10.2307/2971733"", ""10.1111/1467-937X.00044"", ""10.1111/ajps.12417"", ""10.1111/ajps.12685"", ""10.1257/aer.101.3.532"", ""10.1073/pnas.1804597116"", ""10.1214/12-AOAS583"", ""10.1257/aeri.20210236"", ""10.1093/biomet/63.3.581"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.006"", ""10.1016/S0197-2456(01)00196-9"", ""10.1017/pan.2016.2"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3979613""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"

NPM reforms, understood as a style of organizing public services towards the efficiency and efficacy of outputs, have been controversial. They have been accused of importing practices and norms from the private sector that could collide with core public values, such as impartiality or equity. Yet, with few exceptions, we lack systematic empirical tests of the actual effects that NPM reforms have had on the delivery of public services. In this introductory article, we summarize a special issue devoted to cover this gap. And, overall, we find that neither the catastrophic nor the balsamic effects of NPM reforms are confirmed, but the success (or failure) depends on the administrative, political and policy context those reforms take place.","[{""name"": ""Victor Lapuente"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Gothenburg"", ""ESADE Business School""]}, {""name"": ""Steven Van de Walle"", ""affiliation"": [""Public Governance Institute""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jce.2003.09.003"", ""10.1177/0275074008314203"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.822532"", ""10.1111/puar.12578"", ""10.1080/14719037.2012.725757"", ""10.1016/j.jhealeco.2016.06.010"", ""10.1177/0734371X18773492"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9515.2004.00382.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.1994.tb00167.x"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00284"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.01942.x"", ""10.1177/152397210400400306"", ""10.1080/1471903042000256501"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1498817"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00368.x"", ""10.1177/0020852307085730"", ""10.1080/09692290.2011.620464"", ""10.1177/1478929916644869"", ""10.1177/0275074004272846"", ""10.1177/0095399707311785"", ""10.2307/256718"", ""10.1080/09540969409387823"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui057"", ""10.1177/0275074009355943"", ""10.1111/puar.12996"", ""10.1177/0095399714555750"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0017"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2010.01848.x"", ""10.1016/S1096-7494(01)00041-1"", ""10.1080/14719037.2012.743575"", ""10.4337/9781849804691.00012"", ""10.1177/1087724X16657830"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(93)E0001-W"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00779.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199687022.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jopart/muh019"", ""10.5465/amj.2011.0088"", ""10.1525/9780520911185"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-8078"", ""10.2307/41166480"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.159"", ""10.1093/0199266999.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400828005"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2010.01508.x"", ""10.1177/0002764205285182"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024271"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus006"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3508172"", ""10.4337/9781849802284"", ""10.1177/0275074012466935"", ""10.1080/14719037.2015.1028973"", ""10.1177/0734371X8600700105"", ""10.2307/976618"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00611.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198295143.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230504868"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198296003.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760587.002"", ""10.1177/009102600103000304"", ""10.1257/jep.12.4.133"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.02068.x"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00170"", ""10.4135/9781849200387.n4"", ""10.1177/0951629804041120"", ""10.1057/9780230277274"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup009"", ""10.2307/2139277"", ""10.1093/jopart/muh004"", ""10.1177/0091026017702611""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Continued immigration and corresponding growing ethnic diversity have prompted this essential question for modern societies, but few clear answers have been reached in the sprawling literature. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust through a narrative review and a meta-analysis of 1,001 estimates from 87 studies. The review clarifies the core concepts, highlights pertinent debates, and tests core claims from the literature on the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust. Several results stand out from the meta-analysis. We find a statistically significant negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust across all studies. The relationship is stronger for trust in neighbors and when ethnic diversity is measured more locally. Covariate conditioning generally changes the relationship only slightly. The review concludes by discussing avenues for future research.","[{""name"": ""Peter Thisted Dinesen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark;""]}, {""name"": ""Merlin Schaeffer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark;""]}, {""name"": ""Kim Mannemar Sønderskov"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark;""]}]","[""10.1086/683144"", ""10.1177/0899764018764328"", ""10.1162/003355399556269"", ""10.1093/0199267669.001.0001"", ""10.1162/003355300554935"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(01)00084-6"", ""10.2307/1388607"", ""10.1111/0022-4537.00126"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-497780-8.50019-X"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(05)37005-5"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw041"", ""10.1177/0038038513516695"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.12.002"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7379.2010.00822.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00289.x"", ""10.1177/0003122415577989"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190274801.013.13"", ""10.1017/9781108354943"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2019.02.002"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs064"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2003.11.006"", ""10.1093/esr/jcr022"", ""10.1177/019027250707000303"", ""10.1177/0042098013495578"", ""10.1177/0032321716644613"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070499"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000813"", ""10.1111/josi.12120"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990360"", ""10.1080/17457289.2013.808643"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.07.006"", ""10.1017/S0008423910000077"", ""10.1002/jrsm.35"", ""10.4324/9781315775975"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.03.014"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2011.545277"", ""10.1093/esr/jcp057"", ""10.1080/17457289.2013.808641"", ""10.1177/0038038516641867"", ""10.1093/esr/jcv081"", ""10.1086/686942"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4932.2006.00339.x"", ""10.1080/17457289.2013.808201"", ""10.1023/B:POBE.0000035960.73204.64"", ""10.1080/17457289.2013.809351"", ""10.1080/17457289.2013.808642"", ""10.1017/S1755773910000354"", ""10.1007/s11205-014-0777-5"", ""10.1126/science.1113551"", ""10.1515/9781400830282"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081309-150022"", ""10.1145/358916.361990"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00176.x"", ""10.2307/3088923"", ""10.1017/S002238160999048X"", ""10.1126/science.277.5328.918"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.12.018"", ""10.1177/0956797613508956"", ""10.2307/1334446"", ""10.1111/pops.12009"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102526"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00717.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123410000281"", ""10.1177/1043463110396058"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu073"", ""10.1007/s11205-016-1264-y"", ""10.1057/ap.2009.6"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139026758"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.09.005"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309"", ""10.18637/jss.v036.i03"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00291.x""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It then presents the results from three survey experiments – two on Mechanical Turk and one on a nationally representative sample – that find no evidence of backlash, even under theoretically favorable conditions.

10.1017/pan.2021.30,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Does Conjoint Analysis Mitigate Social Desirability Bias?,"AbstractHow can we elicit honest responses in surveys? Conjoint analysis has become a popular tool to address social desirability bias (SDB), or systematic survey misreporting on sensitive topics. However, there has been no direct evidence showing its suitability for this purpose. We propose a novel experimental design to identify conjoint analysis’s ability to mitigate SDB. Specifically, we compare a standard, fully randomized conjoint design against a partially randomized design where only the sensitive attribute is varied between the two profiles in each task. We also include a control condition to remove confounding due to the increased attention to the varying attribute under the partially randomized design. We implement this empirical strategy in two studies on attitudes about environmental conservation and preferences about congressional candidates. In both studies, our estimates indicate that the fully randomized conjoint design could reduce SDB for the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of the sensitive attribute by about two-thirds of the AMCE itself. Although encouraging, we caution that our results are exploratory and exhibit some sensitivity to alternative model specifications, suggesting the need for additional confirmatory evidence based on the proposed design.","[{""name"": ""Yusaku Horiuchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zachary Markovich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Teppei Yamamoto"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/pan.2020.11"", ""10.1016/j.csda.2007.08.015"", ""10.1073/pnas.1804597116"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000217"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.1080/01621459.2017.1319839"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000374"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr048"", ""10.1086/715073"", ""10.1353/obs.2019.0005"", ""10.2307/2111583"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.03.004"", ""10.1007/s11135-011-9640-9"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.133.5.859"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1080/01621459.2015.1050028"", ""10.1027/1614-2241/a000014"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.26"", ""10.1111/pops.12261"", ""10.1073/pnas.1306374110"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1017/psrm.2020.6"", ""10.1073/pnas.1510489113"", ""10.1108/07363760110410263"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.08.021"", ""10.7910/DVN/4WDVDB"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000205"", ""10.1037/a0031828"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807763"", ""10.1007/s10683-010-9257-1"", ""10.1214/18-AOS1709"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000035"", ""10.1111/ajps.12138"", ""10.1017/S000305542000012X""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Approaching discontent historically and sociologically, we show that there are two strains ofrecognition strugglesagainst the LIO: one in the core of the West, driven by populist politicians and their voters, and one on the semiperiphery, fueled by competitively authoritarian governments and their supporters. At this particular moment in history, these struggles are digitally, ideologically, and organizationally interconnected in their criticism of LIO institutions, amplifying each other. The LIO is thus being hollowed outfrom withinat a time when it is also facing some of its greatest external challenges.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Adler-Nissen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayşe Zarakol"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4135/9781848608290.n16"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2012.01129.x"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000359"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00233.x"", ""10.1177/0011392117717294"", ""10.1177/1354066119886024"", ""10.1177/1354066112439217"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000372"", ""10.2307/2944796"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199665686.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7sv80"", ""10.1017/9781316718599"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00649.x"", ""10.1162/002081898550734"", ""10.1017/S1752971915000202"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000264"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316534564"", ""10.1215/00182702-7033896"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198793427.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000337"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000636"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199387328.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ia/iiy148"", ""10.2307/j.ctt21668rd.9"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000141"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1131grs"", ""10.1177/1354068808097889"", ""10.1089/big.2017.0038"", ""10.1515/9780691216119"", ""10.1353/jod.2012.0055"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12285"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000311"", ""10.1162/00208180152507551"", ""10.1093/ia/iix231"", ""10.1177/02632760122051779"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190916473.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000402"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000384"", ""10.1017/S0260210517000560"", ""10.1163/19426720-01604004"", ""10.1017/S1752971913000018"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511575174"", ""10.1093/isq/sqv012"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139565073"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000261"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000206"", ""10.1515/9781400823703"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1229359"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139046527"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0343.2007.00329.x"", ""10.1177/0010414017720705"", ""10.1017/S1752971913000043"", ""10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-030830"", ""10.1017/9781108241588"", ""10.1017/S1752971910000308"", ""10.1017/9781108697385"", ""10.4324/9781315266176"", ""10.1017/S0007123409990317"", ""10.1177/0263395717729932"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1177/1354068818816975"", ""10.1017/S0260210501008087"", ""10.1017/9781316756768"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12319"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.4324/9780203789230"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7rjt2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511779930"", ""10.1080/09636412.2019.1604981"", ""10.1093/joc/jqz006"", ""10.1177/1461444813477833"", ""10.1080/01436590220108172"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3054001"", ""10.1177/1354066108089241"", ""10.1093/ia/iix241"", ""10.1017/S0260210506007054"", ""10.1177/0010836702037002973"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139179072"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491474"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000409"", ""10.1111/isqu.12038"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1177/0047117819840793"", ""10.1177/1354066109345049"", ""10.1162/002081802760199872"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0074"", ""10.2307/2600734"", ""10.1080/13523270500054952"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511676017"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1940161219895215"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000335"", ""10.1017/S175297191800012X"", ""10.1177/1474704918764506"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511664267"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.006"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000126"", ""10.1515/9781400825523"", ""10.1017/9781316856444"", ""10.1093/ips/olaa001"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12509"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2015.1068350"", ""10.1017/S175297191300002X"", ""10.4324/9781351252423"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2818659"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195176155.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000521"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000024"", ""10.1177/1354066116682070"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1017/9781108241588"", ""10.1080/23269995.2014.917031"", ""10.1017/9781108612562"", ""10.1177/0263276404046066"", ""10.1017/9781108241588.012"", ""10.1177/1354066117745365"", ""10.1017/S089267941700020X"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000533"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107337916"", ""10.1177/1354066105050137"", ""10.1177/1065912916639138""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

The infection and mortality rates of the disease have forced governments to implement a wave of public health measures. Depending on the context, these range from the implementation of simple hygienic rules to measures such as social distancing or lockdowns that cause major disruptions in citizens’ daily lives. The success of these crucial public health measures rests on the public's willingness to comply. However, individual differences in following the official public health recommendations for stopping the spread of COVID-19 have not yet to our knowledge been assessed. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of implementing public health recommendations that aim to halt the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate these associations in the context of France, one of the countries that has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and which ended up under a nationwide lockdown on March 17. In the next sections we describe our theoretical expectations over the associations between sociodemographics, personality, ideology, and emotions with abiding by the COVID-19 public health measures. We then test these hypotheses using data from the French Election Study.","[{""name"": ""Sylvain Brouard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pavlos Vasilopoulos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Becher"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00668.x"", ""10.1016/S0092-6566(03)00046-1"", ""10.1111/pops.12439"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.1992.tb00970.x"", ""10.1016/S0191-8869(01)00087-3"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1177/1948550614567356""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Governments are facing an urgent mandate to mobilize quickly and comprehensively in response, drawing not only on public resources and coordination capabilities but also on the cooperation and buy-in of civil society. Political and institutional legitimacy are crucial determinants of effective crisis management, and low-trust states lacking such legitimacy suffer a profound disadvantage. Social and economic crises attending the COVID-19 pandemic thus invite scholarly reflection about public attitudes, social leadership, and the role of social and institutional memory in the context of systemic disruption. This article examines Hong Kong as a case where failure to respond effectively could have been expected due to low levels of public trust and political legitimacy, but where, in fact, crisis response was unexpectedly successful. The case exposes underdevelopment in scholarly assumptions about the connections among political legitimacy, societal capacity, and crisis response capabilities. As such, this calls for a more nuanced understanding of how social behaviours and norms are structured and reproduced amidst existential uncertainties and policy ambiguities caused by sudden and convergent crises, and how these can themselves generate resources that bolster societal capacity in the fight against pandemics.","[{""name"": ""Kris Hartley"", ""affiliation"": [""The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong S.

Although they have become a part of the standard tool kit across disciplines, matching methods are rarely used when analysing time‐series cross‐sectional data. We fill this methodological gap. In the proposed approach, we first match each treated observation with control observations from other units in the same time period that have an identical treatment history up to the prespecified number of lags. We use standard matching and weighting methods to further refine this matched set so that the treated and matched control observations have similar covariate values. Assessing the quality of matches is done by examining covariate balance. Finally, we estimate both short‐term and long‐term average treatment effects using the difference‐in‐differences estimator, accounting for a time trend. We illustrate the proposed methodology through simulation and empirical studies. An open‐source software package is available for implementing the proposed methods.","[{""name"": ""Kosuke Imai"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard University""]}, {""name"": ""In Song Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Massachusetts Institute of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Erik H.

10.1017/S0020818320000296,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Asset Revaluation and the Existential Politics of Climate Change,"AbstractWhereas scholars have typically modeled climate change as a global collective action challenge, we offer a dynamic theory of climate politics based on the present and future revaluation of assets. Climate politics can be understood as a contest between owners of assets that accelerate climate change, such as fossil fuel plants, and owners of assets vulnerable to climate change, such as coastal property. To date, obstruction by “climate-forcing” asset holders has been a large barrier to effective climate policy. But as climate change and decarbonization policies proceed, holders of both climate-forcing and “climate-vulnerable” assets stand to lose some or even all of their assets' value over time, and with them, the basis of their political power. This dynamic contest between opposing interests is likely to intensify in many sites of political contestation, from the subnational to transnational levels. As it does so, climate politics will become increasingly existential, potentially reshaping political alignments within and across countries.

We explain how the inclusion of machine learning in the social sciences requires us to rethink not only applications of machine learning methods but also best practices in the social sciences. In contrast to the traditional tasks for machine learning in computer science and statistics, when machine learning is applied to social scientific data, it is used to discover new concepts, measure the prevalence of those concepts, assess causal effects, and make predictions. The abundance of data and resources facilitates the move away from a deductive social science to a more sequential, interactive, and ultimately inductive approach to inference. We explain how an agnostic approach to machine learning methods focused on the social science tasks facilitates progress across a wide range of questions.","[{""name"": ""Justin Grimmer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science and Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA;""]}, {""name"": ""Margaret E.

In this paper, we use the National Institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) to quantify the impact of the war on the global economy. The war represents a massive cost, equivalent to 1% of global GDP in 2022, or about $1.5 trillion valued at purchasing power parity exchange rates (PPP), compared with our GDP forecast made at the beginning of 2022. Europe is the region affected most, given trade links its proximity to Ukraine and Russia and its reliance on energy and food supplies from those countries. GDP in Europe is expected to shrink by more than 1% in 2022 compared with our forecast at the beginning of 2022. In Western Europe, Germany will be worst affected, followed by France and Italy. GDP in ‘Developing Europe’, where Ukraine is the largest representative, is expected to shrink by 30%. The war will also add about 2% to global inflation in 2022 and 1% in 2023, compared with NIESR's inflation projection at the beginning of 2022.","[{""name"": ""Iana Liadze"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute of Economic and Social Research London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Corrado Macchiarelli"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute of Economic and Social Research London UK"", ""Brunel University London UK"", ""London School of Economics and Political Science London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Paul Mortimer‐Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute of Economic and Social Research London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Patricia Sanchez Juanino"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute of Economic and Social Research London UK""]}]","[""10.1111/twec.13301"", ""10.1126/Sciadv.Aaq0883"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4080181"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4060222"", ""10.1177/002795011824400109"", ""10.24149/wp2116"", ""10.1111/twec.13336"", ""10.1111/twec.13336"", ""10.1017/nie.2022.17"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3939241"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00342"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2313021"", ""10.1038/d41586-022-01008-3"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4190655""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000314,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Populism in Place: The Economic Geography of the Globalization Backlash,"AbstractA populist backlash to globalization has ushered in nationalist governments and challenged core features of the Liberal International Order. Although startling in scope and urgency, the populist wave has been developing in declining regions of wealthy countries for some time. Trade, offshoring, and automation have steadily reduced the number of available jobs and the wages of industrial workers since at least the 1970s. The decline in manufacturing employment initiated the deterioration of social and economic conditions in affected communities, exacerbating inequalities between depressed rural areas and small cities and towns, on the one hand, and thriving cities, on the other. The global financial crisis of 2008 catalyzed these divisions, as communities already in decline suffered deeper and longer economic downturns than metropolitan areas, where superstar knowledge, technology, and service-oriented firms agglomerate. We document many of these trends across the United States and Europe, and demonstrate that populist support is strongest in communities that experienced long-term economic and social decline. Institutional differences in labor markets and electoral rules across developed democracies may explain some of the variation in populists’ electoral success. Renewed support for the Liberal International Order may require a rejuvenation of distressed communities and a reduction of stark regional inequalities.","[{""name"": ""J.

LIO II has not been only rule-based but has openly pursued a liberal social purpose with a significant amount of authority beyond the nation-state. While postnational liberal institutions helped increase overall well-being globally, they were criticized for using double standards and institutionalizing state inequality. We argue that these institutional features of the postnational LIO II led to legitimation problems, which explain both the current wave of contestations and the strategies chosen by different contestants. We develop our argument first by mapping the growing liberal intrusiveness of international institutions.

We show that increased liberal intrusiveness has led to a variety of contestation strategies, the choice of which is affected by the preference of a contestant regarding postnational liberalism and its power within the contested institution.","[{""name"": ""Tanja A.

10.1017/psrm.2019.31,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,The causal interpretation of estimated associations in regression models,"AbstractA common causal identification strategy in political science is selection on observables. This strategy assumes one observes a set of covariates that is, after statistical adjustment, sufficient to make treatment status as-if random. Under adjustment methods such as matching or inverse probability weighting, coefficients for control variables are treated as nuisance parameters and are not directly estimated. This is in direct contrast to regression approaches where estimated parameters are obtained for all covariates. Analysts often find it tempting to give a causal interpretation to all the parameters in such regression models—indeed, such interpretations are often central to the proposed research design. In this paper, we ask when we can justify interpreting two or more coefficients in a regression model as causal parameters. We demonstrate that analysts must appeal to causal identification assumptions to give estimates causal interpretations. Under selection on observables, this task is complicated by the fact that more than one causal effect might be identified. We show how causal graphs provide a framework for clearly delineating which effects are presumed to be identified and thus merit a causal interpretation, and which are not. We conclude with a set of recommendations for how researchers should interpret estimates from regression models when causal inference is the goal.","[{""name"": ""Luke Keele"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Randolph T.

Racialized burdens are the experience of learning, compliance and psychological costs that serve as inequality reproducing mechanisms. To develop this concept, we examine administrative burdens in the US state from the theoretical perspective of racialized organizations. Using examples from attempts to access citizenship rights—via immigration, voting and the social safety net—we illustrate some key points. First, racialized burdens combine control of access to resources and ideas about racial groups in ways that typically disadvantage racially marginalized groups. Second, while still promising fair and equal treatment, racially disproportionate burdens can be laundered through facially neutral rules and via claims that burdens are necessary for unrelated reasons. Third, racialized burdens emerge when more explicit forms of racial bias in policies or administrative practices become illegal, politically untenable or culturally unacceptable. Racialized burdens neatly carry out the “how” in the production of racial inequality while concealing, or providing an alibi for, the “why.”","[{""name"": ""Victor Ray"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Iowa , Iowa City, IA , USA""]}, {""name"": ""Pamela Herd"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University , Washington, DC , USA""]}, {""name"": ""Donald Moynihan"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University , Washington, DC , USA""]}]","[""10.1177/089124390004002002"", ""10.2753/ATP1084-1806320405"", ""10.1177/0095399720921508"", ""10.3386/w27798"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2009.08.001"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa033"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa042"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy008"", ""10.1017/S1049096509090283"", ""10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110819-100304"", ""10.1111/puar.13311"", ""10.1177/0896920513504600"", ""10.1177/0003122413476712"", ""10.1177/0003122420944165"", ""10.1111/puar.13134"", ""10.1017/9781108304283"", ""10.1073/pnas.2106272118"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226114040.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2079534"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv034"", ""10.1002/pam.22046"", ""10.1353/sof.2005.0067"", ""10.1093/jopart/muab020"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy009"", ""10.1111/soc4.12078"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000034"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051506"", ""10.1353/jsh.2008.0002"", ""10.1017/S0898588X14000042"", ""10.1515/9781400874071"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv027"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa031"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvy004"", ""10.7591/9781501728822"", ""10.2307/2096358"", ""10.1086/226550"", ""10.1017/9781108224987"", ""10.1111/psj.12328"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2020.306126"", ""10.1017/S1742058X14000022"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1111/puar.12200"", ""10.2307/2567407"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux025"", ""10.4324/9780203076804"", ""10.1177/0095399719854367"", ""10.1007/s12111-015-9314-0"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195079197.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0003122418822335"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X20190000060008"", ""10.2307/3088900"", ""10.1177/0095399719877160"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvz018"", ""10.2307/2939044"", ""10.1177/000312240907400304"", ""10.1177/0735275118813614"", ""10.1086/229967"", ""10.1353/cwh.2000.0049"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjz81v6"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00328.x"", ""10.2307/2669347"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-060415-093825"", ""10.1177/1065912919832374"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190624422.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq096"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00333.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000562"", ""10.1177/1476127006064068"", ""10.1111/soc4.12446""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

By examining policy changes in China’s fight against the pandemic, I show that pandemic as an exogenous shock invalidated the normal policy logics followed by multiple policy actors, resulting in policy inconsistency and chaos. A policy mix comprised traditional measures, i.e. strict community lockdown, cross-jurisdictional mobilization of resources and officials’ sanction contributed to the eventual effectiveness of China’s response to the pandemic. I argue that the policy mix during crises should conform with rooted national policy style to be consistent and effective.","[{""name"": ""Ciqi Mei"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China""]}]","[""10.1017/S0305741000035840"", ""10.1086/671339"", ""10.1080/10841806.2020.1758991"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30744-3"", ""10.1111/puar.13244"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226228693.001.0001"", ""10.1111/puar.13241"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198297772.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2011.02.005"", ""10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00163-0"", ""10.1093/019926967X.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11077-009-9079-1"", ""10.1177/0263774X15610059"", ""10.1016/S1449-4035(07)70118-2"", ""10.4324/9781315111247"", ""10.1111/puar.13253"", ""10.1086/260580"", ""10.2307/973677"", ""10.2307/976178"", ""10.4000/irpp.277"", ""10.1007/s11077-020-09388-x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00178.x"", ""10.1086/677058"", ""10.1002/pad.1799"", ""10.1017/S0305741005000500"", ""10.1353/wp.1995.0003"", ""10.1111/puar.13214"", ""10.4324/9781315111247-10"", ""10.1017/S0305741017000911"", ""10.1111/gove.12128"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790997"", ""10.1086/tcj.61.20648044"", ""10.1017/S0305741004000050"", ""10.1257/jel.49.4.1076"", ""10.1111/puar.13248"", ""10.1111/disa.12262"", ""10.1177/0097700409347970""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1093/polsoc/puab011,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,"""New normal"" at work in a post-COVID world: work-life balance and labor markets","Abstract The coronavirus pandemic has interrupted labor markets, triggering massive and instant series of experimentations with flexible work arrangements, and new relationships to centralized working environments. These approaches have laid the basis for the “new normal,” likely extending into the organization of work in the post-pandemic era. These new arrangements, especially flexible work arrangements, have challenged traditional relationships with employees and employers, work time and working hours, the work–life balance (WLB), and the relationship of individuals to work. This paper investigates how labor markets have been interrupted due to the pandemic, focusing especially on manual (blue-collar) and nonmanual (white-collar) work and the future of the WLB, along with exploring the projected deviations that are driving a foreseeable future policy revolution in work and employment. This paper argues that although hybrid and remote working would be more popular in the post-pandemic for nonmanual work, it will not be “one size fits all” solution. Traditional work practices will remain, and offices will not completely disappear. Manual labor will continue current work practices with increased demands. Employers’ attention to employees’ WLB in the new normal will target employees’ motivation and achieving better WLB. These trends for the labor market and WLB are classified into three categories—those that are predicated on changes that were already underway but were accelerated with arrival of the pandemic (“acceleration”); those that represent normalization of what were once considered avant-garde ways of work (“normalization”); and those that represent modification or alteration of pre-pandemic set-up (“remodelling”).","[{""name"": ""Lina Vyas"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Asian and Policy Studies, The Education University of Hong Kong , Tai Po, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China""]}]","[""10.1080/09585192.2017.1323227"", ""10.1093/qje/qju032"", ""10.1002/hrm.21849"", ""10.1080/1331677X.2020.1862689"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104235"", ""10.1177/0734371X17733789"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.10.021"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3846680"", ""10.1108/ER-08-2012-0059"", ""10.1108/ER-09-2017-0229"", ""10.1037/amp0000716"", ""10.33166/ACDMHR.2020.04.001"", ""10.4018/IJAVET.2017100102"", ""10.20473/tijab.V4.I1.2020.13-21"", ""10.1108/IJPSM-06-2020-0150"", ""10.35870/ijmsit.v1i1.231"", ""10.1080/08276331.2020.1790167"", ""10.4236/ajibm.2014.41004"", ""10.1108/PR-12-2016-0314"", ""10.1002/joec.12154"", ""10.1002/hbe2.242"", ""10.13106/jafeb.2020.vol7.no10.443"", ""10.1108/JWAM-01-2021-0003""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['General Health Professions', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/pops.12670,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Hate Speech Epidemic. The Dynamic Effects of Derogatory Language on Intergroup Relations and Political Radicalization,"Exposure to derogatory language about immigrants and minority groups leads to political radicalization and deteriorates intergroup relations. This article addresses the psychological processes responsible for these effects as well as those involved in hate‐speech proliferation in contemporary societies and discusses the factors that constrain its growth. We propose that frequent exposure to hate speech has severe effects on emotional, behavioral, and normative levels. Exposure to hate speech results in empathy being replaced by intergroup contempt as a dominant response to others—it is both a motivator and a consequence of derogatory language. The increased presence of hate speech in one's environment creates a sense of a descriptive norm that allows outgroup derogation. This leads to the erosion of existing antidiscriminatory norms. Finally, through a process of desensitization, hate speech reduces people's ability to recognize the offensive character of such language. Based on empirical evidence from the fields of social psychology and psychology of emotion and aggression, we propose a model that explains the described processes, and we trace the dynamics of this model using an agent‐based modeling approach. We show that the mechanisms potentially effective in constraining hate‐speech proliferation (empathy, norms) are eroded by hate speech itself. We argue that through basic psychological dynamics, societies become more accepting of derogatory language and less accepting of immigrants, as well as religious, ethnic, and sexual minorities.","[{""name"": ""Michał Bilewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Warsaw""]}, {""name"": ""Wiktor Soral"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Warsaw""]}]","[""10.1080/026999396380196"", ""10.5964/jspp.v6i1.741"", ""10.1002/casp.2137"", ""10.1089/cyber.2014.0412"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00799"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2005.08.006"", ""10.1111/j.1751-2409.2009.01013.x"", ""10.1007/s11406-007-9108-2"", ""10.1177/0261927X16654735"", ""10.1017/S0140525X16000686"", ""10.1111/pops.12313"", ""10.1016/j.avb.2018.05.006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527906.011"", ""10.1002/ejsp.640"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0193(1999)7:1<38::AID-HBM4>3.0.CO;2-Q"", ""10.1177/1948550617693064"", ""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.11.008"", ""10.5964/spb.v13i1.25497"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00499.x"", ""10.1177/0261927X07300077"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.58.6.1015"", ""10.1162/jocn_a_00069"", ""10.1037/h0034945"", ""10.1037/a0015338"", ""10.1111/1471-6402.00110"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.414"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.82.3.359"", ""10.1002/9780470773963.ch18"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.92.4.631"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(07)00002-0"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00672.x"", ""10.1037/h0030377"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00531"", ""10.1111/bjso.12090"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2148"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02464.x"", ""10.1177/1754073915610439"", ""10.1177/1754073917751229"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.878"", ""10.1177/001872674800100301"", ""10.1075/dapsac.1"", ""10.1017/S0140525X16000352"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195133622.003.0006"", ""10.2307/30040640"", ""10.1111/josi.12128"", ""10.1093/hgs/dcp040"", ""10.1016/0022-1031(85)90006-X"", ""10.1080/026999399379267"", ""10.1093/scan/nsl037"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.2008.00379.x"", ""10.1080/01639625.2016.1196985"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195114485.001.0001"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1494-7"", ""10.1111/bjso.12297"", ""10.1080/10463280240000046"", ""10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00377.x"", ""10.1002/poi3.173"", ""10.1126/science.1161405"", ""10.1177/0146167287132007"", ""10.1037/a0013066"", ""10.1111/1540-4560.00264"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-0448-5"", ""10.1073/pnas.1612903113"", ""10.1111/jopy.12055"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2958.1989.tb00197.x"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.02.005"", ""10.1609/icwsm.v13i01.3237"", ""10.1093/scan/nsw057"", ""10.1177/1948550617734615"", ""10.1177/0146167203254505"", ""10.1097/01.psy.0000126197.59447.b3"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.97.3.362"", ""10.1108/S1537-466120140000018021"", ""10.1080/09546553.2018.1442329"", ""10.1177/002071528802900317"", ""10.1177/01461672012710001"", ""10.1016/j.nlm.2008.09.012"", ""10.1080/14792779443000049"", ""10.1177/0956797615605271"", ""10.1177/01461672962212001"", ""10.1002/ab.21737"", ""10.1177/0956797617719950"", ""10.1037/10930-002"", ""10.1353/gsp.2011.0009"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8309.2012.02109.x"", ""10.1037/a0022728"", ""10.1037/h0022681"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2016.06.007"", ""10.1007/s10964-014-0135-6"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.504"", ""10.1177/0963721415599978""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Individual citizens need to voluntarily sacrifice economic and social activity for an indefinite period of time to protect others. At the same time, we know that public opinion tends to become polarized on highly salient issues, except when political elites are in consensus (Berinsky, 2009; Zaller, 1992). Avoiding elite and public polarization is thus essential for an effective societal response to the pandemic. In the United States, there appears to be elite and public polarization on the severity of the pandemic (Gadarian et al., 2020). Other evidence suggests that polarization is undermining compliance with social distancing (Cornelson and Miloucheva, 2020). Using a multimethod approach, we show that Canadian political elites and the public are in a unique period of cross-partisan consensus on important questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as its seriousness and the necessity of social distancing.","[{""name"": ""Eric Merkley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aengus Bridgman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter John Loewen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Taylor Owen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Derek Ruths"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oleg Zhilin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1380092"", ""10.2307/j.ctvnjbgwt"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226043463.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12449"", ""10.1080/09644016.2016.1263433"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226472157.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00993852""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Since the country has not had any serious experience with this kind of disease in recent decades, its response has been indicative of a first reaction to an (un)known and (un)expected event. At the same time, the Italian experience is an emblematic case of how a lack of specific preparedness measures drives a country to deal with this kind of crisis through a process in which the existing characteristics of the policy and political system, with all their pros and cons, prevail. This means that the existing country characteristics that affects policy design, state capacity, institutional arrangements and political games forge the process and content of the response. Based on this observation, this paper analyses the policy dynamics of the first four months of management of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, focusing on how the health and economic responses were designed and implemented.","[{""name"": ""Giliberto Capano"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy""]}]","[""10.1080/14494035.2019.1579502"", ""10.2202/1935-1704.1478"", ""10.4324/9781351115742"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490880"", ""10.1111/j.0033-3298.2003.00371.x"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0158-5"", ""10.4337/9781789904987"", ""10.1080/23248823.2016.1248470"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-54817-7"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9273-x"", ""10.1080/14494035.2018.1504494"", ""10.1080/01402389308424976"", ""10.4324/9781315563916-10"", ""10.1177/0002764214534667"", ""10.3167/ip.2016.310110"", ""10.1007/s11077-014-9199-0"", ""10.17645/pag.v2i2.23"", ""10.1332/147084414X13992869118596"", ""10.1080/14494035.2018.1519979"", ""10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157"", ""10.1017/S1744133115000067"", ""10.1787/9789264082205-en"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00300"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.781832"", ""10.1177/107554709101200402""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The problem, first conceptualized by Kuklinski and colleagues in 2000, plagues political systems and is exceedingly difficult to correct. In this review, we assess the empirical literature on political misinformation in the United States and consider what scholars have learned since the publication of that early study. We conclude that research on this topic has developed unevenly. Over time, scholars have elaborated on the psychological origins of political misinformation, and this work has cumulated in a productive way. By contrast, although there is an extensive body of research on how to correct misinformation, this literature is less coherent in its recommendations. Finally, a nascent line of research asks whether people's reports of their factual beliefs are genuine or are instead a form of partisan cheerleading. Overall, scholarly research on political misinformation illustrates the many challenges inherent in representative democracy.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Jerit"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA;,""]}, {""name"": ""Yangzi Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA;,""]}]","[""10.1086/697253"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610042"", ""10.1017/9781108227643"", ""10.1007/s10584-018-2192-4"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000186"", ""10.1086/694258"", ""10.1086/681591"", ""10.1111/jcom.12166"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9238-0"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090914"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000165"", ""10.1561/100.00014074"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-050904"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.42.1.116"", ""10.1177/0956797617714579"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00935.x"", ""10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0222"", ""10.2307/2111549"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.568"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0360-1"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000500"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2017.07.008"", ""10.1111/pops.12494"", ""10.1080/17470218.2010.497927"", ""10.1037/xap0000028"", ""10.3758/s13421-013-0358-x"", ""10.3758/MC.38.8.1087"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226304373.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12394"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00601.x"", ""10.1177/0956797610385953"", ""10.1111/jcom.12038"", ""10.1017/S1537592705050334"", ""10.1017/S0003055401002222"", ""10.1016/j.jarmac.2013.10.001"", ""10.1177/2053168017716547"", ""10.1177/0093650211416646"", ""10.1086/692739"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511896941.015"", ""10.1002/polq.12398"", ""10.1086/699914"", ""10.1093/poq/nfl010"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000187"", ""10.1037/0278-7393.20.6.1420"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339"", ""10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0417"", ""10.1111/pops.12396"", ""10.1017/bpp.2016.2"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9395-7"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00033"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199772759.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.11.005"", ""10.1111/pops.12164"", ""10.1016/j.jarmac.2017.07.008"", ""10.1177/1529100612451018"", ""10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00802.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1111/1467-6494.694156"", ""10.1111/ajps.12234"", ""10.2307/j.ctv941trn"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.64.5.723"", ""10.1093/poq/nfq076"", ""10.1177/0002716214555474"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09528-x"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1017/XPS.2014.22"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.11.017"", ""10.1111/ajps.12084"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226644806.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000789"", ""10.1111/jcom.12165"", ""10.1177/0146167218783192"", ""10.1177/1075547015613523"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02547.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-682X.2009.00280.x"", ""10.1561/100.00014127"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00772.x"", ""10.1177/1461444814535724"", ""10.1093/joc/jqz014"", ""10.1093/poq/nfx042"", ""10.1080/08913810802316373"", ""10.1177/1461444816634054"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.02.008"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00325.x"", ""10.1098/rsos.160802"", ""10.7560/314555-013"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1102187"", ""10.1080/0163853X.2015.1136507"", ""10.1177/1075547017731776"", ""10.1080/03637751.2018.1467564"", ""10.1111/jcom.12164"", ""10.7560/314555-010"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edu005"", ""10.1080/02724988843000168"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y"", ""10.1177/1077699017710453"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1080/09644016.2016.1166602""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The resulting bias is commonly referred to as social desirability bias, a subset of what we label sensitivity bias. We make three contributions. First, we propose a social reference theory of sensitivity bias to structure expectations about survey responses on sensitive topics. Second, we explore the bias-variance trade-off inherent in the choice between direct and indirect measurement technologies. Third, to estimate the extent of sensitivity bias, we meta-analyze the set of published and unpublished list experiments (a.k.a., the item count technique) conducted to date and compare the results with direct questions. We find that sensitivity biases are typically smaller than 10 percentage points and in some domains are approximately zero.","[{""name"": ""GRAEME BLAIR"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ALEXANDER COPPOCK"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MARGARET MOOR"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.08502004.x"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.133.5.859"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511819322"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000904"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1986.tb00231.x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3032684"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790942"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1979.tb01055.x"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-590241-0.50006-X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00578.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198832775.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000403"", ""10.2307/2950679"", ""10.1177/0049124119882468"", ""10.2307/2111770"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.09.006"", ""10.1086/268977"", ""10.1080/01621459.1967.10500909"", ""10.1086/268249"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.102.1.4"", ""10.1177/0010414015574882"", ""10.1017/S004388711400001X"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz051"", ""10.1086/269352"", ""10.1086/268719"", ""10.1093/pan/mpn013"", ""10.1515/spp-2016-0005"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs070"", ""10.18637/jss.v076.i01"", ""10.1353/lar.2004.0022"", ""10.1080/01621459.2015.1050028"", ""10.1177/0010414017695332"", ""10.1093/jssam/smu023"", ""10.1093/pan/mps023"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.31"", ""10.1017/XPS.2019.9"", ""10.1007/s00184-007-0131-x"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000194"", ""10.1093/poq/nfu024"", ""10.1177/002224295001400501"", ""10.1086/269381"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00540.x"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.40.3.414"", ""10.1023/A:1024882714254"", ""10.1093/poq/nfv024"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2658829"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.57"", ""10.1086/269494"", ""10.1080/01621459.1965.10480775"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.107.1.34"", ""10.2307/2111718"", ""10.1198/jasa.2011.ap10415"", ""10.1017/S000305540808009X"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000103"", ""10.1086/266357"", ""10.1561/100.00006005"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs060"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00391.x"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.39"", ""10.1177/1948550617707015"", ""10.1086/297704"", ""10.1177/0010414018784062"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190205782.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12086"", ""10.1086/297758"", ""10.1017/S1755048312000557"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051683"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.02.011"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.277"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-0818-6_5"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp065"", ""10.1093/poq/nfv056"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00477.x"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr048"", ""10.1016/0197-2456(86)90046-2"", ""10.1177/0049124117729711"", ""10.1093/pan/mpu017"", ""10.1111/ajps.12205"", ""10.1086/209351"", ""10.1177/1532673X13484791"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2016.1144334""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistics and Probability', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000491,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,"Politicizing International Cooperation: The Mass Public, Political Entrepreneurs, and Political Opportunity Structures","AbstractInternational institutions are increasingly being challenged by domestic opposition and nationalist political forces. Yet, levels of politicization differ significantly across countries facing the same international authority as well as within countries over time. This raises the question of when and why the mass public poses a challenge to international cooperation. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding the nature and implications of politicization of international cooperation, outlining three scope conditions: the nature of public contestation, the activities of political entrepreneurs, and the permissiveness of political opportunity structures. By empirically examining these scope conditions, we demonstrate that politicization can have both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on international cooperation. Highlighting the systemic implications of politicization for international cooperation has important implications for international relations scholarship. Although international organizations may face challenges, they also have ways of being remarkably resilient.","[{""name"": ""Catherine E. De Vries"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sara B.

This article extends these analyses by examining the dynamics between evaluations and gender and race/ethnicity. In a quasi-experimental design, faculty members teaching identical online courses recorded welcome videos that were presented to students at the course onset, constituting the sole exposure to perceived gender and race/ethnicity. This enables exploration of whether and to what degree the instructors’ characteristics influenced student evaluations, even after holding all other course factors constant. Findings show that instructors who are female and persons of color receive lower scores on ordinal student evaluations than those who are white males. Overall, we add further evidence to a growing literature calling for student evaluations of teaching (SETs) reform and extend it to encompass the effects on racial/ethnic minorities in addition to women.","[{""name"": ""Kerry Chávez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kristina M.W.

However, current research has not yet analyzed in detail the characteristics of those individuals with populist proclivities, or so-calledpopulist citizens. To address this research gap, we harmonize survey data on populist attitudes for nine European countries, five Latin American countries, and Turkey in order to uncover shared or distinct features of populist citizens. Our findings are threefold. First, we identify differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of populist citizens, notably between Europe and Latin America. Second, we find similar patterns of heterogeneity in the political features of populist citizens. Third, we show that populist citizens across all countries have the same democratic profile. They systematically support democracy over other forms of government, while being dissatisfied with its implementation. This suggests populist attitudes are intrinsic to the political culture of contemporary democracies.","[{""name"": ""Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Steven M.

By identifying radical opponents, digital surveillance enables dictators to substitute targeted repression for nonexclusive co‐optation to forestall coordinated uprisings. My theory implies that as digital surveillance technologies advance, we should observe a rise in targeted repression and a decline in universal redistribution. Using a difference‐in‐differences design that exploits temporal variation in digital surveillance systems among Chinese counties, I find that surveillance increases local governments' public security expenditure and arrests of political activists but decreases public goods provision. My theory and evidence suggest that improvements in governments' information make citizens worse off in dictatorships.","[{""name"": ""Xu Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""The Pennsylvania State University""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctvcm4j72"", ""10.1162/003355304772839588"", ""10.23943/9781400890323"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4292.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.101405.143216"", ""10.1353/jod.0.0190"", ""10.1162/JCWS_a_00448"", ""10.1017/S0009443903000044"", ""10.1093/restud/rdt020"", ""10.1177/0022343313519808"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0343.2006.00160.x"", ""10.1017/9781316336182"", ""10.1111/1468-0343.00082"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316489031"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3038812"", ""10.1017/S1537592714003120"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00390.x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3214231"", ""10.1257/app.3.2.196"", ""10.1017/psrm.2016.25"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2014.01.002"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000014"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000144"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511585869"", ""10.1177/0010414017710265"", ""10.2307/2010422"", ""10.1111/ajps.12065"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491009"", ""10.1017/S1537592711000910"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510274"", ""10.1177/0010414014555443"", ""10.1353/wp.1995.0003"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00108-5"", ""10.1017/S0305741000004768"", ""10.2307/2095728"", ""10.1257/jep.31.1.117"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000623"", ""10.1163/25427466-00302001"", ""10.1177/0022343314559624"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0018545"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000727"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051683"", ""10.1017/S0043887116000125"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176040"", ""10.1177/0022002718770520"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2006.07.001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12628,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,The Nature of Affective Polarization: Disentangling Policy Disagreement from Partisan Identity,"AbstractDemocrats and Republicans clearly dislike one another. Yet, scholars debate whether policy disagreement or partisan identity, per se, drives interparty animus. Past studies suggest the relationship between partisanship and interpersonal affect is spurious, driven by inferred policy preferences. We argue, instead, that policy preferences signal partisan identity when the parties' stances on an issue are well‐known. Using a nationally representative survey and four preregistered experiments, we disentangle the effects of policy disagreement and partisan identity on interpersonal affect. Our findings suggest that partisan identity is the principal mechanism of affective polarization, and that policy preferences factor into affective polarization largely by signaling partisan identity. However, our results also affirm that policy disagreement in itself drives interpersonal affect. This provides evidence that partisanship reflects an emotional attachment to a political party, not merely a running tally of rational considerations.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Dias"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Pennsylvania""]}, {""name"": ""Yphtach Lelkes"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Pennsylvania""]}]","[""10.1086/697253"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080210"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000795"", ""10.2307/2669291"", ""10.1023/A:1021226224601"", ""10.1007/s11109-016-9377-1"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000165"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.808"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.10"", ""10.1111/ajps.12571"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.9"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1561/100.00018027a"", ""10.1561/100.00018027b"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.46"", ""10.1111/tops.12206"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226299358.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000604"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226452593.001.0001"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.18"", ""10.1086/688223"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226473673.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11109-009-9094-0"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226069159.001.0001"", ""10.1086/693987"", ""10.1037/xge0000399"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.75.4.976"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420180102"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09559-4"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12330"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.01.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107587991"", ""10.2307/2130815"", ""10.1111/ajps.12498"", ""10.2307/2111797"", ""10.1561/100.00019039"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9323-7"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9457-5"", ""10.1080/10584609.2018.1561563"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Rather it offers a holistic model of value creation for public services, by integrating insights from both the public administration and management and the service management and marketing literatures. The components of this model are the loci, elements, and processes of value creation. Co‐production is located within this model but only as one process, not as the pre‐eminent one. The implications of this new model for public management theory and practice are explored.","[{""name"": ""Stephen P.

A good way to get a handle on what is now a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary literature is to focus on the key debates characterizing it. This article reviews the literature on the causes of populism, and in particular right-wing populism, in the United States, Europe, and other advanced industrial nations generally, but much of this literature draws on and refers to research on other parts of the world as well. This review analyzes the nature as well as the strengths and weakness of demand- and supply-side explanations of populism, economic grievance–based and sociocultural grievance–based explanations of populism, and structure- and agency-based explanations of populism.","[{""name"": ""Sheri Berman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Barnard College, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA;""]}]","[""10.1017/S0007123414000155"", ""10.1177/0002716218811309"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00304.x"", ""10.3386/w22637"", ""10.1353/jod.2021.0013"", ""10.2307/20049203"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0038"", ""10.7551/mitpress/13469.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1039374"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226087283.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctvpr7rb2"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.1177/0956797614527113"", ""10.1177/0146167214524993"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199253099.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511762734"", ""10.2307/j.ctvt9k3d3"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12620"", ""10.1353/book.47469"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01349.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190215514.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199797899.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0049"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0000"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.03.006"", ""10.1177/0010414019879947"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7s1jn"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001595"", ""10.1057/9780230510302"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0067"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb00343.x"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.64"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000606"", ""10.1093/poq/nfaa004"", ""10.1093/0198293259.001.0001"", ""10.1177/2053168018822395"", ""10.1017/S1537592717000111"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.2307/jj.17912858"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1fx4gx6"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12597"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139175173"", ""10.1007/s12290-011-0152-8"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003286"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051701"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510298"", ""10.4159/9780674969797"", ""10.4159/9780674242852"", ""10.4159/9780674984776"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12741"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02063.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190934163.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1177/0146167211418531"", ""10.4159/9780674982918"", ""10.1017/9781108785440"", ""10.3998/mpub.13524"", ""10.1057/s42214-018-0001-4"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691154848.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1584843"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mmb"", ""10.1057/ap.2012.37"", ""10.1177/0956797619875472"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511528125"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican1170-96"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.01995.x"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edm031"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00505"", ""10.1080/10584600902850718"", ""10.1177/0010414015576745""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S175297192000010X,INTERNATIONAL THEORY,0302 Political Science,"Anxiety, fear, and ontological security in world politics: thinking with and beyond Giddens","Research on ontological security in world politics has mushroomed since the early 2000s but seems to have reached an impasse. Ontological security is a conceptual lens for understanding subjectivity that focuses on the management of anxiety in self-constitution. Building especially on Giddens, IR scholars have emphasized how this translates to a need for cognitive consistency and biographical continuity – a security of ‘being.’ A criticism has been its so-called ‘status quo bias,’ a perceived tilt toward theorizing investment in the existing social order. To some, an ontological security lens both offers social theoretic foundations for a realist worldview and lacks resources to conceptualize alternatives. We disagree. Through this symposium, we address that critique and suggest pathways forward by focusing on the thematic of anxiety. Distinguishing between anxiety and fear, we note that anxiety manifests in different emotions and leaves room for a range of political possibilities. Early ontological security scholarship relied heavily on readings of Giddens, which potentially accounts for its bias. This symposium re-opens the question of the relationship between anxiety and subjectivity from the perspective of ontological security, thinking with and beyond Giddens. Three contributions re-think anxiety in ontological security drawing on existentialist philosophy; two address limitations of Giddens' approach.","[{""name"": ""Catarina Kinnvall"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jennifer Mitzen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511612183"", ""10.1017/S002081830002751X"", ""10.1080/00071310120044980"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00800.x"", ""10.1017/S0260210505006613"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0089-x"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000093"", ""10.1111/ips.12103"", ""10.1080/09636412.2011.549023"", ""10.1111/pops.12553"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000244"", ""10.1037/10760-000"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000222"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316710982"", ""10.1111/jcms.12326"", ""10.1177/0304375412452050"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000311"", ""10.3998/mpub.5031921"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199747542.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09662839.2018.1497977"", ""10.4324/9780203008690"", ""10.1177/1354066198004002004"", ""10.1111/pops.12608"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0108-y"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000402"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000256"", ""10.1111/pops.12334"", ""10.1177/0010836716641137"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000144"", ""10.1080/13523260.2012.693776"", ""10.1080/13501760500451709"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000147"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00859.x"", ""10.1177/0160597618802646"", ""10.1057/jird.2012.19"", ""10.1111/pops.12432"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2009.01288.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00463.x"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000220"", ""10.1177/0967010617695715"", ""10.2307/589357"", ""10.1068/a4385"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040"", ""10.1177/0010836716653161"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000123"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00396.x"", ""10.1057/jird.2013.22"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1391671"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139104142"", ""10.1353/jsh/32.3.509"", ""10.1111/pops.12034"", ""10.1177/0010836717719735"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.4135/9781446278963"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2004.tb00011.x"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000519"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0104-2"", ""10.1111/pops.12224"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139963107"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000135"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000111"", ""10.1080/09636412.2010.505128""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/gov.2018.23,GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION,0302 Political Science,The Activation of Populist Attitudes,"AbstractMost studies see demand for populist forces driven by broad sociological factors that make certain issues salient among specific constituencies. However, this argument is not normally tested at the individual level. We propose a theory of populist voting which argues that populist attitudes are themselves important predictors of voting, interacting with ideological positions. We test this theory through a comparison of recent voting in Chile and Greece, two countries where the contexts for activating populist attitudes are very different. We find that despite similar levels of populist attitudes across both countries, these attitudes explain much more of the vote in Greece than they do in Chile, and that in both countries they interact with ideological positions in predictable ways.","[{""name"": ""Kirk A.

Sweden kept its primary schools, daycare centers and industries largely open. The government financially supported furloughed workers and increased its support to regional and local governments delivering healthcare and elderly care. However, the death toll in Sweden which passed 4000 by late May 2020 stands in stark contrast to those of other, comparable countries, raising questions about the design of the strategy, and its appropriateness. The paper argues that key assumptions sustaining the strategy, for instance that symptom-free people do not carry, and cannot transmit the Coronavirus, or that local and regional government staff had the necessary training and equipment to tackle the pandemic, along with problems associated with coordinating a decentralized healthcare system, may explain the poor performance of the Swedish containment strategy.","[{""name"": ""Jon Pierre"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden""]}]","[""10.1332/174426418X15314036559759"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31035-7"", ""10.1086/225469"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199280414.001.0001"", ""10.31219/osf.io/7chpu""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12583,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Re-Assessing Elite-Public Gaps in Political Behavior,"AbstractPolitical scientists often criticize psychological approaches to the study of politics on the grounds that many psychological theories were developed on convenience samples of college students or members of the mass public, whereas many of the most important decisions in politics are made by elites, who are presumed to differ systematically from ordinary citizens. This paper proposes an overarching framework for thinking about differences between elites and masses, presenting the results of a meta‐analysis of 162 paired treatments from paired experiments on political elites and mass publics, as well as an analysis of 12 waves of historical elite and mass public opinion data on foreign policy issues over a 43 year period. It finds political scientists both overstate the magnitude of elite‐public gaps in decision‐making, and misunderstand the determinants of elite‐public gaps in political attitudes, many of which are due to basic compositional differences rather than to elites' domain‐specific expertise.","[{""name"": ""Joshua D.

10.1017/S0007123419000590,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,The Trump Effect: An Experimental Investigation of the Emboldening Effect of Racially Inflammatory Elite Communication,"AbstractThis article explores the effect of explicitly racial and inflammatory speech by political elites on mass citizens in a societal context where equality norms are widespread and generally heeded yet a subset of citizens nonetheless possesses deeply ingrained racial prejudices. The authors argue that such speech should have an ‘emboldening effect’ among the prejudiced, particularly where it is not clearly and strongly condemned by other elite political actors. To test this argument, the study focuses on the case of the Trump campaign for president in the United States, and utilizes a survey experiment embedded within an online panel study. The results demonstrate that in the absence of prejudiced elite speech, prejudiced citizens constrain the expression of their prejudice. However, in the presence of prejudiced elite speech – particularly when it is tacitly condoned by other elites – the study finds that the prejudiced are emboldened to both express and act upon their prejudices.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Newman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jennifer L.

However, the empirical understanding of citizens’ responses to such burdens remains limited. Using ethnographic data of doctors applying for maternity leave in Pakistan, this article documents strategies used by citizens to navigate the administrative burden faced by them. Our findings suggest that these strategies are based on an individual’s cache of social, cultural capital, and economic capital. Based on our data, we also theorize the significance of another form of capital for navigating administrative burden. This administrative capital is defined as an individual’s understanding of bureaucratic rules, processes, and behaviors. Our findings further illustrate that the different costs imposed by public policies can be interchangeable, which may be used by citizens to their advantage. Propositions for future research on the intersection of different forms capital and administrative burden are also included.","[{""name"": ""Ayesha Masood"", ""affiliation"": [""Lahore University of Management Sciences""]}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Azfar Nisar"", ""affiliation"": [""Lahore University of Management Sciences""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2005.12.002"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1017/S0047279414000622"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy008"", ""10.1177/073491492004400101"", ""10.1080/01900699208524763"", ""10.2307/2234340"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02600.x"", ""10.1111/puar.13134"", ""10.2307/2093671"", ""10.2307/2576127"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226114040.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.11.020"", ""10.2307/799656"", ""10.1086/644335"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv034"", ""10.1002/pam.22046"", ""10.1093/ppar/prv007"", ""10.7758/9781610448789"", ""10.1177/0020852304044259"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy002"", ""10.4135/9781446288719"", ""10.1080/0966369X.2017.1418736"", ""10.1111/gwao.12308"", ""10.3998/mpub.11924"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02633.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00557.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3709-x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux025"", ""10.1002/pad.1817"", ""10.1136/jech.2008.086074"", ""10.1177/0010414017710268"", ""10.1177/0095399719854367"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2018.02.003"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.47084647"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107296930"", ""10.1177/1525822X02239569"", ""10.1002/nur.4770180211"", ""10.1177/000312240907400304"", ""10.1111/padm.12242"", ""10.3390/soc5020420""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

Crises that abruptly upend political and economic relations are important and increasing in frequency. However, the division of international relations into international political economy (IPE) and international security has contributed to the relative neglect of non-militarized crises like pandemics. Crises are defined by threat, uncertainty, and time pressure: understanding them requires a careful examination of how these variables affect political and economic outcomes. Drawing on often disparate literatures on finance, energy and climate change, natural disasters, pandemics, and violent conflict, I propose a broad research program around the politics of crisis, focusing on puzzles related to causes, responses, and transformations.","[{""name"": ""Phillip Y.

10.1002/poi3.219,POLICY AND INTERNET,0302 Political Science; 0503 Journalism and Communication,Beyond Breitbart: Comparing Right-Wing Digital News Infrastructures in Six Western Democracies,"Right‐wing online news media have emerged in many countries as an important force in the media landscape, positioning themselves as an alternative to a perceived political and media mainstream. This article studies these sites as a cornerstone of right‐wing digital news infrastructures in six Western democracies (Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Drawing on content analyses of websites and social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter as well as on audience metrics, the article analyses content supply and audience demand structures, as well as organizational and thematic characteristics of seventy alternative right‐wing online news sites. We find that a country’s media and political context, in particular the representation of right‐wing positions in the political and legacy media sphere, can explain variation in the supply of—and demand for—right‐wing news across countries, but is mitigated by transnational audiences. At the same time, we can account for cross‐national heterogeneity of news sites, ranging from sites with a “normalized” appearance to more radical sites that clearly set themselves apart from legacy news outlets in terms of their thematic categories, their funding strategy, and their organizational transparency, leading to various types of digital right‐wing “alternatives” to mainstream news.","[{""name"": ""Annett Heft"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eva Mayerhöffer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susanne Reinhardt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Curd Knüpfer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1464884911415972"", ""10.1080/10584609.2010.496710"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00369.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1004230"", ""10.1080/10510974.2011.649442"", ""10.1177/1461444806065653"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00005.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001"", ""10.1108/AJIM-09-2013-0094"", ""10.1111/jcom.12127"", ""10.1080/01924036.2014.973050"", ""10.1093/acref/9780191803093.001.0001"", ""10.4135/9781452204994"", ""10.1080/10714421.2011.597245"", ""10.1386/joacm_00039_2"", ""10.1177/1464884910385191"", ""10.1007/s12134-013-0293-5"", ""10.17645/mac.v6i4.1467"", ""10.1080/21670811.2019.1625715"", ""10.1561/100.00012099"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2017.1308229"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328520"", ""10.5771/9783845271491-405"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226069159.001.0001"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy022"", ""10.1177/2053168016686915"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190274559.001.0001"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551"", ""10.1386/joacm_00042_1"", ""10.1177/1527476409334020""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communication']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1017/S1537592719000975,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Populism and Backlashes against International Courts,"International courts, like domestic courts, protect liberal limits on majoritarianism. This sometimes puts these courts in a position to protect the property rights of the “corrupt elites” that are targeted by populists or the civil liberties of those who are targeted in domestic populist identity politics. Moreover, populism offers an ideology to attack the authority of a court rather than just its individual rulings. An empirical examination illustrates the plausibility of this argument. A large number of backlashes against international courts arise from judgments that reinforce local populist mobilization narratives. Populist backlashes against international courts are not just about sovereignty but often follow efforts to curb domestic courts, usually for similar reasons. Yet populist backlashes do not always succeed, either because populist leaders do not follow up on their exit threats or because populism is too thin an ideology for creating successful multilateral reform coalitions.","[{""name"": ""Erik Voeten"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1192402"", ""10.2307/20031965"", ""10.1007/s11558-017-9276-1"", ""10.1162/002081802760199863"", ""10.1080/0143659032000105821"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0048"", ""10.1080/01436590802681090"", ""10.1515/til-2013-021"", ""10.1111/hojo.12075"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1093/ejil/chw019"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1111/spsr.12280"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0047"", ""10.1017/S1744552318000034"", ""10.1162/002081800551163"", ""10.5305/amerjintelaw.109.4.0866"", ""10.1515/til-2013-022"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12355"", ""10.1086/679017"", ""10.1177/0022002711414373"", ""10.1111/j.0023-9216.2004.00055.x"", ""10.1177/0010414009331721"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000238"", ""10.1007/s11558-010-9089-y"", ""10.1007/s40803-018-0075-4"", ""10.1177/0094582X11425333"", ""10.1162/002081800551307"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199680788.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000212"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139152365"", ""10.1086/668499"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053006.183906"", ""10.1017/9781108235075"", ""10.2307/1123662"", ""10.1177/0095327X07312081"", ""10.5305/amerjintelaw.107.4.0737"", ""10.1111/1468-2230.00192"", ""10.1162/002081800551262"", ""10.5129/001041509X12911362971990"", ""10.1093/pa/gsr071"", ""10.1163/15718123-01701005"", ""10.1017/S0021855317000158"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199811380.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1574019610100029"", ""10.1080/00358530903513681"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199680788.003.0007"", ""10.9783/9780812293784"", ""10.2307/422236"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000044"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.25"", ""10.1093/ejil/chy030"", ""10.1353/wp.1995.0004""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055421000241,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Increasing Precision without Altering Treatment Effects: Repeated Measures Designs in Survey Experiments,"The use of survey experiments has surged in political science. The most common design is the between-subjects design in which the outcome is only measured posttreatment. This design relies heavily on recruiting a large number of subjects to precisely estimate treatment effects. Alternative designs that involve repeated measurements of the dependent variable promise greater precision, but they are rarely used out of fears that these designs will yield different results than a standard design (e.g., due to consistency pressures). Across six studies, we assess this conventional wisdom by testing experimental designs against each other. Contrary to common fears, repeated measures designs tend to yield the same results as more common designs while substantially increasing precision. These designs also offer new insights into treatment effect size and heterogeneity. We conclude by encouraging researchers to adopt repeated measures designs and providing guidelines for when and how to use them.","[{""name"": ""SCOTT CLIFFORD"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""GEOFFREY SHEAGLEY"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SPENCER PISTON"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01562.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000837"", ""10.1007/s11109-014-9268-2"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.299"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000604"", ""10.1086/269015"", ""10.1111/pops.12339"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00582.x"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2011.08.009"", ""10.1093/poq/nft005"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316471050"", ""10.1111/pops.12351"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452.001"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000500"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.63.1.17"", ""10.1017/S0003055401002222"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.808"", ""10.1086/694845"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9310-z"", ""10.1016/j.jarmac.2020.06.006"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080210"", ""10.1080/19345747.2012.673143"", ""10.1017/9781108777919.004"", ""10.1006/jesp.1994.1002"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051452"", ""10.1177/1536867X0800800403"", ""10.4135/9781446212165.n9"", ""10.1017/S002238161100082X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107279247"", ""10.1111/ajps.12357"", ""10.2307/2952075"", ""10.1017/9781108676038"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452.032"", ""10.1177/0193841X9501900504"", ""10.1017/xps.2014.7"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.2.318"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.11"", ""10.7910/DVN/9MQDK7"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1007/s11109-016-9379-z"", ""10.1007/s10683-009-9230-z"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1017/S0003055402004240"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.40"", ""10.1037/h0043424"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-09525-6"", ""10.1126/science.aac4716"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452.003"", ""10.1017/XPS.2019.26"", ""10.1111/spc3.12267"", ""10.1093/poq/nfv047"", ""10.2307/2111583"", ""10.1073/pnas.1808083115""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Statistics and Probability', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We argue that in a global politics characterized by racialized inequality, pandemics such as COVID-19 exacerbate the marginalization of already oppressed groups. We review published research on previous pandemics to historicize pandemic othering and blame, and enumerate some of the consequences for politics, policy, and public health. Specifically, we draw on lessons from smallpox outbreaks, the third bubonic plague, the 1918 influenza pandemic, and more recent pandemics, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and Ebola. We also compile reports to document the discrimination and violence targeting marginalized groups early in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article lays bare the continuation of a long history of othering and blame during disease outbreaks and identifies needs for further inquiry to understand the persistence of these pandemic politics.","[{""name"": ""Kim Yi Dionne"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fulya Felicity Turkmen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/644537"", ""10.1086/590567"", ""10.1080/01459740.2020.1753047"", ""10.1086/710784"", ""10.1111/j.1556-4797.2010.01049.x"", ""10.2307/2657316"", ""10.3138/topia.16.23"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.762898"", ""10.1080/00223344.2015.1130121"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226190518.001.0001"", ""10.1207/S15327027HC1602_7"", ""10.1080/09557571.2013.770298"", ""10.2105/AJPH.90.2.191"", ""10.1007/s10912-009-9084-6"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.11.031"", ""10.1080/21565503.2020.1769693"", ""10.1080/13691050500391489"", ""10.3138/cbmh.22.1.57"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.391"", ""10.1515/9781400830459"", ""10.1017/asr.2015.11"", ""10.2307/25157817"", ""10.1177/136345930100500103"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000363"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.04.022"", ""10.1086/524986"", ""10.3201/eid1002.030750"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198819660.001.0001"", ""10.1017/ssh.2017.41"", ""10.1080/09557571.2013.770297"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000326"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a007921"", ""10.1215/03616878-8641542"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.02.036"", ""10.1057/9781137339218"", ""10.1215/03616878-16-2-215"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00710.x"", ""10.1186/1758-2652-11-8"", ""10.1093/pan/2.1.131"", ""10.1177/030437540102600403"", ""10.1353/book.69486"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2018.304645"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9020.2012.00457.x"", ""10.1111/1468-0009.00030"", ""10.1016/0277-9536(94)90273-9"", ""10.1080/21565503.2018.1484376""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Infectious Diseases', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Segmentation is valuable for two significant clinical applications, namely lesion detection and classification, providing means to improve accuracy and robustness. The manual segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images is time-consuming. As a result, the use of deep learning (DL) for automation of polyp segmentation has become important. However, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting inability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes. Recent transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation both achieve higher performance and generalise better than alternatives, however typically predict a segmentation map of $$\frac{h}{4}\times \frac{w}{4}$$ spatial dimensions for a $$h\times w$$ input image. To this end, we propose a new architecture for full-size segmentation which leverages the strengths of a transformer in extracting the most important features for segmentation in a primary branch, while compensating for its limitations in full-size prediction with a secondary fully convolutional branch. The resulting features from both branches are then fused for final prediction of a $$h\times w$$ segmentation map. We demonstrate our method’s state-of-the-art performance with respect to the mDice, mIoU, mPrecision, and mRecall metrics, on both the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB dataset benchmarks. Additionally, we train the model on each of these datasets and evaluate on the other to demonstrate its superior generalisation performance.Code available: https://github.com/CVML-UCLan/FCBFormer.","[{""name"": ""Edward Sanderson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bogdan J.

Though a growing number of studies analyze the strategy of such campaigns, it is not yet known how these efforts shaped the political attitudes and behaviors of Americans. We study this question using longitudinal data that describe the attitudes and online behaviors of 1,239 Republican and Democratic Twitter users from late 2017 merged with nonpublic data about the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) from Twitter. Using Bayesian regression tree models, we find no evidence that interaction with IRA accounts substantially impacted 6 distinctive measures of political attitudes and behaviors over a 1-mo period. We also find that interaction with IRA accounts were most common among respondents with strong ideological homophily within their Twitter network, high interest in politics, and high frequency of Twitter usage. Together, these findings suggest that Russian trolls might have failed to sow discord because they mostly interacted with those who were already highly polarized. We conclude by discussing several important limitations of our study—especially our inability to determine whether IRA accounts influenced the 2016 presidential election—as well as its implications for future research on social media influence campaigns, political polarization, and computational social science.","[{""name"": ""Christopher A.

In this article, we first consider how the concept of the policy entrepreneur can be integrated into broader theories of the policy process, with particular focus on the compatibility of the concept with the narrative policy framework. We then propose that further empirical research on policy entrepreneurs focus on five tasks: (i) delimiting policy entrepreneurs as a distinct class of actor; (ii) investigating contextual factors that encourage the emergence of policy entrepreneurs; (iii) further specifying the strategies policy entrepreneurs deploy; (iv) improving the measurement of the impact policy entrepreneurs have in the policy process; and (v) identifying when policy entrepreneurs prompt widescale change. New theoretical and empirical contributions along these lines could do much to advance our understanding of agency and structure in contemporary politics.","[{""name"": ""Evangelia Petridou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Mintrom"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13501763.2011.520879"", ""10.1111/psj.12331"", ""10.1007/s11077-012-9171-9"", ""10.1111/psj.12388"", ""10.1111/psj.12175"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01454.x"", ""10.5465/19416520903053598"", ""10.1007/s00191-012-0297-x"", ""10.1093/wentk/9780195396348.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511778834"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00437.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199249145.001.0001"", ""10.1111/psj.12000"", ""10.1332/030557318X15230056771696"", ""10.1111/psj.12346"", ""10.1002/epa2.1031"", ""10.1111/padm.12046"", ""10.1215/9780822390909"", ""10.1177/0266242607076524"", ""10.1080/13501760600808964"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.01.006"", ""10.1017/S1755773914000277"", ""10.1177/0021886312438858"", ""10.1111/psj.12341"", ""10.1111/0952-1895.00121"", ""10.1111/j.1468‐0491.2008.00402.x"", ""10.2307/1955071"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283"", ""10.1017/S0143814X18000053"", ""10.1111/1540-6210.00236"", ""10.1007/s11077‐017‐9296‐y"", ""10.1111/psj.12339"", ""10.1080/01442872.2016.1161181"", ""10.1111/1468-0491.00215"", ""10.1002/pad.1855"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb00343.x"", ""10.1111/psj.12005"", ""10.4324/9780429494284-2"", ""10.1111/1467‐8500.00224"", ""10.5751/ES-03488-150226"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur035"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00364.x"", ""10.1111/psj.12115"", ""10.1080/19460171.2015.1053959"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199604104.003.0016"", ""10.1111/gove.12387"", ""10.1007/s13280-014-0497-8"", ""10.2307/973677"", ""10.2307/976178"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2000.tb02026.x"", ""10.1080/17516234.2019.1631241"", ""10.2307/1961840"", ""10.1080/01442870902863851"", ""10.1007/s11077-005-8876-4"", ""10.5751/ES-03509-150221"", ""10.7591/9781501728822"", ""10.2307/2111674"", ""10.2307/2648004"", ""10.1080/13501763.2012.761514"", ""10.1017/9781108605946"", ""10.1177/2399654417708440"", ""10.1111/j.1541‐0072.2009.00329.x"", ""10.1080/10361146.2014.934657"", ""10.1504/IJEV.2018.092710"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1996.tb01638.x"", ""10.2307/2648004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808678"", ""10.1002/pad.1867"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7s7wm"", ""10.1111/psj.12054"", ""10.1080/01442872.2018.1434872"", ""10.1515/cejpp-2016-0028"", ""10.1080/14494035.2017.1369677"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226185941.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00136406"", ""10.2307/1964135"", ""10.1515/9781400821570"", ""10.1111/j.1747-1346.2011.00295.x"", ""10.4324/9780429494284-6"", ""10.1017/S0898588X03000129"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02610.x"", ""10.1504/IJEIM.2006.009875"", ""10.1111/padm.12273"", ""10.1080/01900692.2019.1590401"", ""10.1080/17516234.2019.1701388"", ""10.1177/1356389005058475"", ""10.1177/1356389009341900"", ""10.4324/9780429494284-11"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00310.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00299.x"", ""10.1080/13501760110064401""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

To structure the discussion, the contributors respond to three questions: (1) how should we understand the relationship between nationalism and COVID‐19; (2) will COVID‐19 fuel ethnic and nationalist conflict; and (3) will COVID‐19 reinforce or erode the nation‐state in the long run? The contributors formulated their responses to these questions near to the outset of the pandemic, amid intense uncertainty. This made it acutely difficult, if not impossible, to make predictions. Nevertheless, it was felt that a historically and theoretically informed discussion would shed light on the types of political processes that could be triggered by the COVID‐19 pandemic. In doing so, the aim is to help orient researchers and policy‐makers as they grapple with what has rapidly become the most urgent issue of our times.","[{""name"": ""Eric Taylor Woods"", ""affiliation"": [""University of East London  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Robert Schertzer"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Toronto  Ontario Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Liah Greenfeld"", ""affiliation"": [""Boston University  Boston Massachusetts USA""]}, {""name"": ""Chris Hughes"", ""affiliation"": [""London School of Economics and Political Science  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Cynthia Miller‐Idriss"", ""affiliation"": [""American University  Washington, D.C.

We map out opposing views in the emerging debate over the environmental aspects of these technologies: while proponents see them as vital tools for environmental sustainability, critics view them as antithetical to their own agroecological vision of sustainable agriculture. We argue that key insights from the broader literature on the social effects of technological change—in particular, technological lock-in, the double-edged nature of technology, and uneven power relations—help to explain the political dynamics of this debate. Our analysis highlights the divergent perspectives regarding how these technologies interact with environmental problems, as well as the risks and opportunities they present. Yet, as we argue in the article, developments so far suggest that these dynamics are not always straightforward in practice.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Clapp"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sarah-Louise Ruder"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2234208"", ""10.3390/su9081339"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.07.017"", ""10.1080/07388551.2016.1271768"", ""10.1016/j.njas.2019.03.001"", ""10.1177/2053951716648174"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-05814-6"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-07600-w"", ""10.14763/2016.1.405"", ""10.1111/soru.12120"", ""10.1111/soru.12202"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.09.001"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00454"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00464"", ""10.1057/9780230277892"", ""10.1111/nph.14993"", ""10.1007/s10460-019-09956-9"", ""10.5040/9781474264365"", ""10.1126/science.206.4424.1277"", ""10.1016/j.compag.2017.09.037"", ""10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.041"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1450344"", ""10.1002/ps.5137"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2017.09.011"", ""10.3389/fsufs.2018.00087"", ""10.1111/soru.12233"", ""10.1017/S174217050700213X"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2009.02.008"", ""10.1146/annurev-resource-100516-053654"", ""10.1111/j.1471-0366.2010.00274.x"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2017.01.023""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Plant Science', 'Molecular Biology']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)]]"
10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-033542,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VOL 23",0302 Political Science,Identity Politics and Populism in Europe,"We review the literature on the rise of identity politics and populism in Europe. Populist parties have gained large vote shares since the Great Recession of 2008. We observe in many countries, and even in the European Parliament, a transformation of the main dimension of politics from the left–right cleavage to a new cleavage opposing the mainstream parties to populist parties. We examine how this transformation relates to changes in voter attitudes and the adjustment of political parties to these changes. Two main types of causes for the rise of populism have emerged: economic and cultural. In reviewing the evidence, we find a complex interaction between economic and cultural factors. Economic anxiety among large groups of voters related to the Great Recession and austerity policies triggers a heightened receptivity to the messages of cultural backlash from populist parties.","[{""name"": ""Abdul Noury"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Social Science, New York University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates;""]}, {""name"": ""Gerard Roland"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA;""]}]","[""10.1017/S0007123418000029"", ""10.1353/eca.2017.0015"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.211"", ""10.1257/aer.103.6.2121"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2019.104123"", ""10.1093/epolic/eix012"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100054"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiy017"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.062404.170715"", ""10.1093/pa/gsx005"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.1080/01402382.2012.713744"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1339730"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.48"", ""10.1093/restud/rdy047"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsx025"", ""10.1177/1465116517723499"", ""10.1177/0010414017720705"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12319"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12285"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiy018"", ""10.1177/0093650216644026"", ""10.1177/0093650218819671"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000813"", ""10.1111/jcms.12664"", ""10.1111/spsr.12281"", ""10.1017/S0007123405000128"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491955"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1181871"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1177/1354068817694503"", ""10.1177/1354068815625230"", ""10.1177/1465116515616196"", ""10.1111/comt.12029"", ""10.9783/9780812294262"", ""10.1080/01402381003654726"", ""10.5817/PC2018-1-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-110713"", ""10.1057/9780230592100_4"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jcom.12337"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12177"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1080286"", ""10.1057/s42214-018-0001-4"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12074"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12314"", ""10.1177/0010414017720707"", ""10.4159/9780674240438"", ""10.1111/jcms.12341"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.2"", ""10.1111/ajps.12144"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-081919-050239""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The answer to this question is crucial for understanding the scope of partisan polarization. We test between these alternatives with experiments that offer incentives for correct survey responses and allow respondents to search for information before answering each question. We find that partisan cheerleading inflates divides in factual information, but only modestly. Incentives have no impact on partisan divides in information search; these divides are no different from those that occur outside the survey context when we examine web‐browsing data from the same respondents. Overall, our findings support the motivated reasoning interpretation of misinformation; partisans seek out information with congenial slant and sincerely adopt inaccurate beliefs that cast their party in a favorable light.","[{""name"": ""Erik Peterson"", ""affiliation"": [""Texas A&amp;M University""]}, {""name"": ""Shanto Iyengar"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University""]}]","[""10.1126/science.aaa1160"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000092"", ""10.1023/A:1021226224601"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000186"", ""10.1257/aer.91.2.67"", ""10.1086/681591"", ""10.1111/ajps.12349"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9238-0"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-050904"", ""10.1561/100.00014074"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0360-1"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000500"", ""10.1177/1043463107077384"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs016"", ""10.1515/9781503620766"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw006"", ""10.1017/XPS.2018.12"", ""10.1111/pops.12394"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00601.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9499-8"", ""10.1093/pan/mpu010"", ""10.1002/polq.12398"", ""10.1086/687533"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01402.x"", ""10.1086/698929"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000187"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-032814"", ""10.1561/100.00017138"", ""10.1111/ajps.12087"", ""10.1177/0002716214554758"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00033"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1007/s11109-009-9094-0"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.37.11.2098"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1561/100.00015100"", ""10.1111/ajps.12234"", ""10.1111/ajps.12357"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000837"", ""10.2202/1540-8884.1354"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.09.009"", ""10.1017/9781108688338"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090781"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-100711-135242"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00306.x"", ""10.1561/100.00014127"", ""10.1093/poq/nfx042"", ""10.1080/08913810802316373"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755509.001.0001"", ""10.1098/rsos.160802"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1102187"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199545636.003.0010"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1969.tb00619.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

This article systematically evaluates the factors that predict news avoidance behaviors, considering both individual- and country-level explanations. Using a large-scale quantitative, comparative approach, we examine more than 67,000 survey respondents across 35 countries worldwide and find consistent evidence for how factors including demographics, political attitudes, and news genre preferences shape avoidance consistently across information environments. But we also show how country-level contextual factors, what we call “cultures of news consumption,” influence behaviors beyond that which is explained by respondent-level differences. Specifically, levels of press freedom and political freedom and stability are shown to negatively predict rates of news avoidance. These findings suggest that many people’s news use practices depend not only on personal characteristics and preferences but quite sensibly on the news available to them, which they may have good reason to view as deficient or untrustworthy, as well as culturally specific norms around its value and utility.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Toff"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Antonis Kalogeropoulos"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Communication and Media, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK""]}]","[""10.1177/1940161213485990"", ""10.1177/1940161210367422"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139963107"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1080/10584600903053361"", ""10.1177/1940161209336224"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00482.x"", ""10.1177/1532673X10380848"", ""10.1093/esr/jcq051"", ""10.1111/jcom.12127"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(01)00186-4"", ""10.1080/08838151.2014.998220"", ""10.1080/15205436.2016.1262424"", ""10.1177/1461444816688451"", ""10.1177/0267323108096993"", ""10.1177/1940161212442956"", ""10.1177/1461444817724170"", ""10.1080/21670811.2018.1502045"", ""10.1111/jcom.12105"", ""10.1111/jcc4.12185"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790867"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01663.x"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2017.1280229"", ""10.1086/694105"", ""10.1080/17512781003640703"", ""10.2307/1961756"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01402.x"", ""10.1080/08838151.2010.519808"", ""10.1080/08838151.2013.816712"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1983.tb02391.x"", ""10.1177/0093650212466406"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051452"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609343"", ""10.1086/269363"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139878425"", ""10.2307/1959647"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2014.890332"", ""10.1080/10584609.2010.543006"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2015.1133253"", ""10.1093/ijpor/eds018"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.01913.x"", ""10.1177/1077699018793998"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755509.001.0001"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy009"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2018.1528882"", ""10.1177/0267323112453671"", ""10.1177/0093650213485972"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2009.00716.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00625.x"", ""10.1177/1461444815616223"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551"", ""10.1177/1464884913504260""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

We focus on the computational method of topic modeling and investigate how it interacts with two larger families of qualitative methods: content and classification methods characterized by interest in words as communication units and discourse and representation methods characterized by interest in the meaning of communicative acts. Based on analysis of recent academic publications that have used topic modeling for textual analysis, our findings show that different mixed‐method research designs are appropriate when combining topic modeling with the two groups of methods. Our main concluding argument is that topic modeling enables scholars to apply policy theories and concepts to much larger sets of data. That said, the use of computational methods requires genuine understanding of these techniques to obtain substantially meaningful results. We encourage policy scholars to reflect carefully on methodological issues, and offer a simple heuristic to help identify and address critical points when designing a study using topic modeling.","[{""name"": ""Karoliina Isoaho"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daria Gritsenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eetu Mäkelä"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/asi.23786"", ""10.1145/2133806.2133826"", ""10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.993"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.12.001"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1177/1468794106058877"", ""10.2307/271007"", ""10.1016/0304-422X(94)90011-6"", ""10.1016/j.biocon.2018.01.029"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.053"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199009)41:6<391::AID-ASI1>3.0.CO;2-9"", ""10.1080/19331681.2013.826613"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.44"", ""10.1177/2053951715602908"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2013.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.csda.2008.01.011"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X18000132"", ""10.1086/229213"", ""10.1353/nlh.2014.0025"", ""10.1017/pan.2016.7"", ""10.1093/pan/mpp034"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2016.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.030"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.17645/pag.v7i1.1731"", ""10.1080/21670811.2015.1093271"", ""10.4135/9781473957640.n4"", ""10.1177/000312240807300205"", ""10.1177/0165551515608733"", ""10.1093/llc/fqv052"", ""10.4135/9781446288719"", ""10.1037/14763-000"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-20-4-43"", ""10.1177/1750481318766936"", ""10.1080/19416520.2012.660763"", ""10.1093/pan/mpu019"", ""10.1177/1468794117743465"", ""10.1075/jnlh.5.2.01mod"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2013.10.001"", ""10.1023/A:1006896022092"", ""10.1016/j.drugpo.2016.04.021"", ""10.3366/cor.2017.0118"", ""10.1177/0049124117729703"", ""10.1287/orsc.1090.0490"", ""10.1111/psj.12110"", ""10.3115/1699510.1699543"", ""10.1111/ajps.12103"", ""10.1145/1658377.1658381"", ""10.18653/v1/E17-2069"", ""10.1162/COLI_a_00173"", ""10.4135/9780857024480"", ""10.1177/0957926516634546"", ""10.1016/j.dcm.2016.04.003"", ""10.1111/nhs.12048""]",['Social Sciences'],['General Social Sciences'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12550,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,How Political Parties Shape Public Opinion in the Real World,"AbstractHow powerful are political parties in shaping citizens' opinions? Despite long‐standing interest in the flow of influence between partisan elites and citizens, few studies to date examine how citizens react when their party changes its position on a major issue in the real world. We present a rare quasi‐experimental panel study of how citizens responded when their political party suddenly reversed its position on two major and salient welfare issues in Denmark. With a five‐wave panel survey collected just around these two events, we show that citizens' policy opinions changed immediately and substantially when their party switched its policy position—even when the new position went against citizens' previously held views. These findings advance the current, largely experimental literature on partisan elite influence.","[{""name"": ""Rune Slothuus"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Bisgaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}]","[""10.1111/0034-6527.00321"", ""10.1017/9781108227643"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000092"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000795"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.887871"", ""10.1086/268180"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00533.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02018.x"", ""10.1111/j.2047-8852.2012.00008.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12349"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9238-0"", ""10.1111/ajps.12054"", ""10.1111/ajps.12243"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000165"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00196.x"", ""10.1177/1532673X18803887"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1017629"", ""10.1073/pnas.1808083115"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00454.x"", ""10.1080/10584609.2013.852643"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000500"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00493.x"", ""10.1017/S000305541000047X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00424.x"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000964"", ""10.1080/10584609.2013.828143"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000604"", ""10.2307/2111240"", ""10.1093/poq/nft005"", ""10.1007/s11109-005-1764-y"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00377.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199772759.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12164"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226472157.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11109-009-9094-0"", ""10.1080/08913810608443658"", ""10.1073/pnas.1418188112"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9318-4"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226644806.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12495"", ""10.1080/10584601003709381"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1052892"", ""10.1017/S002238161000006X"", ""10.7146/politica.v44i4.69962"", ""10.1515/9780691188386-014"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691154145.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1465116507073284"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.06.009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Social scientists frequently invoke external validity as an ideal, but they rarely attempt to make rigorous, credible external validity inferences. In recent years, methodologically oriented scholars have advanced a flurry of work on various components of external validity, and this article reviews and systematizes many of those insights. We first clarify the core conceptual dimensions of external validity and introduce a simple formalization that demonstrates why external validity matters so critically. We then organize disparate arguments about how to address external validity by advancing three evaluative criteria: model utility, scope plausibility, and specification credibility. We conclude with a practical aspiration that scholars supplement existing reporting standards to include routine discussion of external validity. It is our hope that these evaluation and reporting standards help rebalance scientific inquiry, such that the current obsession with causal inference is complemented with an equal interest in generalized knowledge.","[{""name"": ""Michael G.

10.1017/S0043887120000131,WORLD POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Performative Governance,"ABSTRACTThe state often struggles to meet citizens’ demands but confronts strong public pressure to do so. What does the state do when public expectations exceed its actual governing capacity? This article shows that the state can respond by engaging in performative governance—the theatrical deployment of language, symbols, and gestures to foster an impression of good governance among citizens. Performative governance should be distinguished from other types of state behavior, such as inertia, paternalism, and the substantive satisfaction of citizens’ demands. The author illustrates this concept in the realm of environmental governance in China. Given the severity of China’s environmental pollution, the resulting public outcry, and the logistical and political challenges involved in solving the problem, how can the state redeem itself? Ethnographic evidence from participant observation at a municipal environmental protection bureau reveals that when bureaucrats are confronted with the dual burdens of low state capacity and high public scrutiny, they engage in performative governance to assuage citizens’ complaints. This study draws attention to the double meaning of “performance” in political contexts, and the essential distinction between the substantive and the theatrical.","[{""name"": ""Iza Ding"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7591/9781501708503"", ""10.1111/1540-5893.3703002"", ""10.1017/9781108354707"", ""10.1017/S1537592714000875"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000124"", ""10.1525/9780520948570"", ""10.1017/S0003055400271451"", ""10.1007/BF00987276"", ""10.1086/690948"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0"", ""10.1017/S0305741009990592"", ""10.1515/9781400835119"", ""10.1086/694577"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2012.00962.x"", ""10.1162/DRAM_a_00620"", ""10.1177/0003122419831228"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226345536.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2938736"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511800115"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199744466.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000250"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190205782.001.0001"", ""10.1257/aer.20171330"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3449177"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.07.025"", ""10.1353/jod.2003.0019"", ""10.1017/S030574100005133X"", ""10.1017/S0305741017001023"", ""10.1017/9781316417645"", ""10.1080/03906700500038876"", ""10.1017/jea.2019.1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615597"", ""10.2307/20031707"", ""10.2307/3207893"", ""10.1080/17530350.2010.494117"", ""10.1017/S0043887100012843"", ""10.1111/ajps.12207"", ""10.1177/0010414007308020"", ""10.1017/S0010417598001388"", ""10.2307/2058238"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.2307/2657374"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000534"", ""10.1080/09668138308411481"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5893.2006.00281.x"", ""10.1086/671335"", ""10.2307/3053830"", ""10.1038/366223a0"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195372649.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511618819"", ""10.2307/422143"", ""10.1126/science.aaz1014"", ""10.1111/rego.12082"", ""10.1017/S0305741015001629"", ""10.1515/9780691221724"", ""10.2307/1951731"", ""10.1086/428688"", ""10.1080/0308514042000225680"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511806414"", ""10.7591/9780801461705"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226521664.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000837"", ""10.1353/wp.2001.0011"", ""10.1515/9780804765602"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511509971"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139096614"", ""10.1353/wp.2007.0018"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199387557.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10670564.2017.1363020"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.21313/hawaii/9780824835132.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0002764209338800"", ""10.1007/s11366-011-9140-8""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Although ChatGPT assures that it is impartial, the literature suggests that LLMs exhibit bias involving race, gender, religion, and political orientation. Political bias in LLMs can have adverse political and electoral consequences similar to bias from traditional and social media. Moreover, political bias can be harder to detect and eradicate than gender or racial bias. We propose a novel empirical design to infer whether ChatGPT has political biases by requesting it to impersonate someone from a given side of the political spectrum and comparing these answers with its default. We also propose dose-response, placebo, and profession-politics alignment robustness tests. To reduce concerns about the randomness of the generated text, we collect answers to the same questions 100 times, with question order randomized on each round. We find robust evidence that ChatGPT presents a significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK. These results translate into real concerns that ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, can extend or even amplify the existing challenges involving political processes posed by the Internet and social media. Our findings have important implications for policymakers, media, politics, and academia stakeholders.","[{""name"": ""Fabio Motoki"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Valdemar Pinho Neto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victor Rodrigues"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3386/w29247"", ""10.18653/v1/2022.gebnlp-1.9"", ""10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.60"", ""10.1111/pops.12776"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2008.01.006"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4395751"", ""10.1126/science.aal4230"", ""10.1007/s11127-017-0496-y"", ""10.1177/10659129221119733"", ""10.1093/restud/rdq037"", ""10.1007/s11127-015-0264-9"", ""10.3386/w25815"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4391863"", ""10.18653/v1/2022.naacl-main.122"", ""10.1007/s11127-022-00998-y"", ""10.1086/499414"", ""10.1162/003355305775097542"", ""10.1007/s11186-012-9163-y"", ""10.3386/w31122"", ""10.1111/lnc3.12432"", ""10.1145/3544548.3581196"", ""10.1007/s11127-006-7509-6"", ""10.1007/s12129-018-9700-x"", ""10.1007/s11127-020-00849-8"", ""10.1111/ajps.12008"", ""10.1257/aer.20191777"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2021.103654"", ""10.1145/3597307"", ""10.1007/s11127-017-0485-1"", ""10.1086/694255"", ""10.1145/3586183.3606763"", ""10.1007/s13347-022-00512-8"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04144-6"", ""10.3982/ECTA20355"", ""10.1038/d41586-023-00288-7"", ""10.1177/1077699018778242"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-081919-050239""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Although there has been much theorizing on the intersectional and context-dependent nature of positionality, there remains a disjuncture between how positionality is understood theoretically and how it is applied. Ignoring the dynamism of positionality in practice has implications for the research process. This article theorizes one means of recognizing and responding to positionality in practice: a posture of “active reflexivity.” It outlines how we can become actively reflexive by adopting a disposition toward both ongoing reflection about our own social location and ongoing reflection on our assumptions regarding others’ perceptions. We then articulate four strategies for doing active reflexivity: recording assumptions around positionality; routinizing and systemizing reflexivity; bringing other actors into the process; and “showing our work” in the publication process.","[{""name"": ""Jessica Soedirgo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aarie Glas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/669666"", ""10.4324/9781315743172"", ""10.4324/9781315703275-20"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1177/0891243287001002004"", ""10.1057/9781137314154_7"", ""10.1177/1468794112468475"", ""10.1080/13621025.2018.1445490"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226206868.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13533310903184499"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226869087.001.0001"", ""10.1177/107780040100700403"", ""10.4135/9780857024626"", ""10.1017/S1537592718002116"", ""10.1177/1354066116679878"", ""10.1080/0951839032000060635"", ""10.2307/2111718"", ""10.1093/ia/iiy116"", ""10.1177/0010414016633487"", ""10.1177/1532708617750675""]",['Social Sciences'],"['General Social Sciences', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The agenda acknowledges that different issues such as poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, environmental degradation, among others, are intertwined and can therefore only be addressed together. Implementing the SDGs as an ‘indivisible whole’ represents the actual litmus test for the success of the 2030 Agenda. The main challenge is accomplishing a more integrated approach to sustainable development that encompasses new governance frameworks for enabling and managing systemic transformations. This thematic issue addresses the question whether and how the SDGs set off processes of societal transformation, for which cooperation between state and non-state actors at all political levels (global, regional, national, sub-national), in different societal spheres (politics, society, and economy), and across various sectors (energy, transportation, food, etc.) are indispensable. In this editorial, we first introduce the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs by providing an overview of the architecture of the agenda and the key challenges of the current implementation phase. In a second step, we present the eleven contributions that make up the thematic issue clustering them around three themes: integration, governance challenges, and implementation.","[{""name"": ""Sabine Weiland"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Hickmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markus Lederer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jens Marquardt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sandra Schwindenhammer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.cosust.2017.01.010"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3682"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3654"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3608"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3591"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1080/19452829.2014.910180"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3616"", ""10.3390/su11184947"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10894.001.0001"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3631"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3607"", ""10.1057/s41599-019-0335-5"", ""10.1002/wcc.497"", ""10.1002/sd.1582"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-0475-0"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3615"", ""10.1007/s11625-018-0604-z"", ""10.1002/2017EF000632"", ""10.1038/s41893-019-0352-9"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3590"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3656"", ""10.1080/01436597.2011.543809"", ""10.1016/S2214-109X(15)70112-9"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3630""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"

10.1111/ajps.12616,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,American Politics in Two Dimensions: Partisan and Ideological Identities versus Anti-Establishment Orientations,"AbstractContemporary political ills at the mass behavior level (e.g., outgroup aggression, conspiracy theories) are often attributed to increasing polarization and partisan tribalism. We theorize that many such problems are less the product of left‐right orientations than an orthogonal “anti‐establishment” dimension of opinion dominated by conspiracy, populist, and Manichean orientations. Using two national surveys from 2019 and 2020, we find that this dimension of opinion is correlated with several antisocial psychological traits, the acceptance of political violence, and time spent on extremist social media platforms. It is also related to support for populist candidates, such as Trump and Sanders, and beliefs in misinformation and conspiracy theories. While many inherently view politics as a conflict between left and right, others see it as a battle between “the people” and a corrupt establishment. Our findings demonstrate an urgent need to expand the traditional conceptualization of mass opinion beyond familiar left‐right identities and affective orientations.","[{""name"": ""Joseph E.

Based on a narrative systematic literature review on institutional trust and AI in the public sector, this article argues that the EU adopted a simplistic conceptualization of trust and is overselling its regulatory ambition. The paper begins by reconstructing the conflation of “trustworthiness” with “acceptability” in the AI Act. It continues by developing a prescriptive set of variables for reviewing trust research in the context of AI. The paper then uses those variables for a narrative review of prior research on trust and trustworthiness in AI in the public sector. Finally, it relates the findings of the review to the EU's AI policy. Its prospects to successfully engineer citizen's trust are uncertain. There remains a threat of misalignment between levels of actual trust and the trustworthiness of applied AI.","[{""name"": ""Johann Laux"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Internet Institute University of Oxford  1 St Giles Oxford OX1 3JS UK""]}, {""name"": ""Sandra Wachter"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Internet Institute University of Oxford  1 St Giles Oxford OX1 3JS UK""]}, {""name"": ""Brent Mittelstadt"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Internet Institute University of Oxford  1 St Giles Oxford OX1 3JS UK""]}]","[""10.3386/w29247"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106572"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101490"", ""10.1080/1062726X.2014.908722"", ""10.1177/001872679204500702"", ""10.2202/1944-2866.1076"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2010.06.010"", ""10.1093/cje/bei064"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.513474"", ""10.1177/1461444820939922"", ""10.1007/s11673-016-9767-4"", ""10.1016/j.breast.2019.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101520"", ""10.1080/10510974.2020.1807380"", ""10.1109/SNPD.2019.8935693"", ""10.4324/9781315542294-15"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2021.101666"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2019.07.004"", ""10.1037/xge0000033"", ""10.1080/13600869.2021.1999075"", ""10.1098/rsta.2016.0119"", ""10.1016/S1071-5819(03)00038-7"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb01871.x"", ""10.1136/medethics-2012-100490"", ""10.2307/2580124"", ""10.1109/ISTAS52410.2021.9629161"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2022.101704"", ""10.1007/s41649-019-00087-1"", ""10.1162/003355300554926"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2022.105681"", ""10.1111/puar.12047"", ""10.4324/9781315542294-23"", ""10.1177/0894439320980122"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2967051"", ""10.1002/poi3.276"", ""10.7249/RRA112-7"", ""10.1086/716283"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101976"", ""10.1017/epi.2013.48"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2021.105613"", ""10.1518/hfes.46.1.50.30392"", ""10.1080/00140139208967392"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106905"", ""10.4324/9780203962596"", ""10.18080/JTDE.V9N4.443"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121390"", ""10.2307/258792"", ""10.1007/3-540-45547-7_3"", ""10.4324/9781315542294-26"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.1007/s11023-021-09577-4"", ""10.1007/s11023-021-09557-8"", ""10.1007/s12130-010-9124-6"", ""10.2307/j.ctv322v3xg.4"", ""10.1145/1234772.1234775"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511606250"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1123"", ""10.3390/fi13050132"", ""10.1111/j.0272-4332.2005.00579.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12186.003.0007"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101421"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocab065"", ""10.1007/s11948-020-00228-y"", ""10.4324/9781315542294-2"", ""10.1080/12460125.2020.1819094"", ""10.1098/rsta.2017.0362"", ""10.1109/MTS.2021.3123737"", ""10.1086/233944"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2021.01.281"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3899991"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9322-8"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0237934"", ""10.1145/3447954"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2020.1748090"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2018.09.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790850"", ""10.4018/jthi.2009040102"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-02345-3"", ""10.1007/s12525-020-00441-4"", ""10.1093/cje/bem039"", ""10.1111/pops.12105"", ""10.9785/cri-2021-220402"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101961"", ""10.2307/3312707"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102401"", ""10.1109/CISE.2010.5676832"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2007.06.002"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11449.001.0001"", ""10.1108/JICES-12-2020-0128"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101926"", ""10.1080/01900692.2020.1749851"", ""10.1007/s12083-021-01207-1"", ""10.1007/s10506-022-09312-z"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375827"", ""10.17645/mac.v9i2.3806""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

We propose a conceptual model to shape the empirical analysis of what contributes to inclusion in collaborative processes. We propose that incentives, mutual interdependence and trust are important preconditions of inclusion, but that active inclusion management also matters a great deal. We also hypothesize that inclusion is strategic, with ‘selective activation’ of participants depending on functional and pragmatic choices. Drawing on cases from the Collaborative Governance Case Databank, we used a mixed method approach to analyse our model. We found support for the model, and particularly for the central importance of active inclusion management.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Ansell"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Carey Doberstein"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Hayley Henderson"", ""affiliation"": [""Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Saba Siddiki"", ""affiliation"": [""Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Paul ‘t Hart"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht School of Governance, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a003504"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1007/s00267-018-1123-5"", ""10.1007/s002670010184"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02678.x"", ""10.1080/10967490902868523"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy068"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1192165"", ""10.1111/padm.12048"", ""10.1080/14719037.2015.1045019"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080325"", ""10.1177/0095399706294460"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur011"", ""10.1080/03003930.2011.615834"", ""10.1177/1078087408324000"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00358.x"", ""10.1080/0964056042000189808"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2008.00738.x"", ""10.1080/03643107.2012.758062"", ""10.1080/01442870601121478"", ""10.1111/psj.12266"", ""10.4324/9781315147949"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq045"", ""10.1057/palgrave.eps.2210035"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1995.tb00837.x"", ""10.1023/B:OLIC.0000048532.94150.07"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.034"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.02.009"", ""10.1177/0021886391271002"", ""10.1177/0739456X0202100302"", ""10.1111/1540-6210.00240"", ""10.2753/PMR1530-9576330102"", ""10.1111/psj.12209"", ""10.1017/S0047279403007499"", ""10.1111/nzg.12038"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup006"", ""10.3390/su11010110"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.01.005"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00045"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02525.x"", ""10.1177/0739456X11410979"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226702797.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0275074017745355"", ""10.1002/eet.1633"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux009"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy053"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01753.x"", ""10.1177/1078087416651936"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00663.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw041"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.10.112"", ""10.1093/0198297556.001.0001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

To understand why, this article offers a theory about criminal governance in five types of criminal regimes—Insurgent, Bandit, Symbiotic, Predatory, and Split. These differ according to whether criminal groups confront or collude with state actors, abuse or cooperate with the community, and hold a monopoly or contest territory with rival OCGs. Police interventions in these criminal regimes pose different challenges and are associated with markedly different local security outcomes. We provide evidence of this theory by using a multimethod research design combining quasi-experimental statistical analyses, automated text analysis, extensive qualitative research, and a large-N survey in the context of Rio de Janeiro’s “Pacifying Police Units” (UPPs), which sought to reclaim control of the favelas from criminal organizations.","[{""name"": ""BEATRIZ MAGALONI"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""EDGAR FRANCO-VIVANCO"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""VANESSA MELO"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s12116-013-9133-z"", ""10.1080/15614263.2013.816494"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000928"", ""10.1007/s12116-013-9135-x"", ""10.2307/3053563"", ""10.1007/s10611-009-9195-z"", ""10.1080/09592318.2017.1322328"", ""10.1177/0022002715587047"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990323"", ""10.1353/lbr.0.0001"", ""10.1177/0022002715576753"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1177/0022002715587053"", ""10.1177/0022002715587100"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2006.tb00365.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818462"", ""10.1093/police/paq027"", ""10.1177/0010414017720703"", ""10.1525/9780520341623"", ""10.2307/2938736"", ""10.1257/aer.20121637"", ""10.1017/9781316650073"", ""10.1017/S1537592717002110"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551130"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839424957.179"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2006.tb00364.x"", ""10.1086/679021"", ""10.1017/S1537592712000655"", ""10.1080/15614260701377638"", ""10.1177/1065912908322413"", ""10.1080/09592310008423262""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

Less is known about the difficulties beneficiaries face when using public benefits, especially voucher-based public assistance programs. I argue that the costs of learning how to redeem benefits can discourage program use and undermine policy goals. To enrich the administrative burden framework, this study draws from a qualitative analysis of 43 participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to develop a new subset of learning costs—redemption costs. I argue that two conditions: limited portability and reliance on third-party agents create redemption costs for beneficiaries. I apply these two conditions to two other voucher-based programs: the Housing Choice Voucher Program and the Child Care Subsidy. Examining redemption costs can help clarify when and where beneficiaries experience burdens, reasons behind discontinuity in program participation, and why public programs fail to meet objectives.","[{""name"": ""Carolyn Y Barnes"", ""affiliation"": [""Duke University""]}]","[""10.3998/mpub.10131793"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy008"", ""10.1177/0003122410363563"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02600.x"", ""10.1016/j.jand.2018.09.003"", ""10.1086/689621"", ""10.1016/j.outlook.2005.03.011"", ""10.1016/S0891-5245(04)00278-0"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.27.6.w523"", ""10.1177/0002716213479310"", ""10.1177/016146811011200504"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198289029.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00682.x"", ""10.1080/02673037.2013.824559"", ""10.1080/10511482.2018.1502202"", ""10.1177/0885412203251339"", ""10.1080/10511482.2015.1072573"", ""10.1111/1468-0491.00188"", ""10.1007/s10834-016-9501-8"", ""10.1007/s10834-007-9094-3"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2015.302668"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02524.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv034"", ""10.1086/693751"", ""10.1111/0022-4537.00191"", ""10.7758/9781610448789"", ""10.1177/0095399715581622"", ""10.1177/002188637601200203"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2016.12.002"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6773.2011.01308.x"", ""10.1111/j.1741-3737.2012.00980.x"", ""10.2307/2234441"", ""10.1258/jhsrp.2008.008054"", ""10.1080/01459740.2000.9966173"", ""10.1017/9781108224987"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199730346.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1111/puar.12200"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux025"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy052"", ""10.1093/sf/sov069"", ""10.1080/10511482.2016.1169208"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.04.011"", ""10.1111/cico.12087"", ""10.1111/cico.12288"", ""10.1525/sp.2005.52.2.152"", ""10.4324/9780203854907"", ""10.1016/S0049-089X(03)00042-5"", ""10.1177/009539999400935493"", ""10.1177/0885412216670603"", ""10.1111/spol.12056"", ""10.1080/10511482.2016.1163276"", ""10.1080/02673037.2015.1009004"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq096"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2014.06.010""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Gender Studies', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Will public support for climate reforms increase as climate-related disasters make the short-term costs of inaction more salient? Leveraging variation in the timing of Californian wildfires, we evaluate how exposure to a climate-related hazard influences political behavior rather than self-reported attitudes or behavioral intentions. We show that wildfires increased support for costly, climate-related ballot measures by 5 to 6 percentage points for those living within 5 kilometers of a recent wildfire, decaying to near zero beyond a distance of 15 kilometers. This effect is concentrated in Democratic-voting areas, and it is nearly zero in Republican-dominated areas. We conclude that experienced climate threats can enhance willingness-to-act but largely in places where voters are known to believe in climate change.","[{""name"": ""CHAD HAZLETT"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MATTO MILDENBERGER"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10584-016-1837-4"", ""10.1007/s10584-012-0403-y"", ""10.1080/09644016.2017.1322275"", ""10.1017/S0022381607080097"", ""10.1017/jea.2019.26"", ""10.1007/s10584-013-1003-1"", ""10.1177/0956797613492775"", ""10.1007/s10584-018-2251-x"", ""10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01917.x"", ""10.1080/13669870701552235"", ""10.1108/17568691111129011"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3453287"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0208-8"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00533.x"", ""10.1086/701766"", ""10.1080/08941920600801207"", ""10.1080/17477891.2015.1080656"", ""10.1177/0013916506298800"", ""10.1111/ropr.12067"", ""10.1111/rssb.12348"", ""10.1007/s10584-012-0615-1"", ""10.1007/s10584-019-02584-6"", ""10.3763/ehaz.2010.0037"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000448"", ""10.1175/WCAS-D-12-00048.1"", ""10.1177/0038038516648547"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.09.014"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab466a"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921766"", ""10.1007/s10584-019-02513-7"", ""10.1007/s10584-015-1555-3"", ""10.1007/s11077-012-9151-0"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.10.004"", ""10.1038/nclimate1754"", ""10.1038/nclimate1059"", ""10.1111/ecin.12781"", ""10.1080/08941920.2015.1037034"", ""10.1080/13549839.2014.887666"", ""10.1073/pnas.1607171113"", ""10.1073/pnas.1422385112""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiab094,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Turkish foreign policy in a post-western order: strategic autonomy or new forms of dependence?,"Abstract Turkish foreign policy has dramatically transformed over the last two decades. In the first decade of the Justice and Development Party's (AKP) rule, the ‘logic of interdependence’ constituted the driving motive of Turkish foreign policy. In the second decade, however, the ‘logic of interdependence’ and the soft power-driven ‘mediator–integrator’ role were gradually replaced with a quest for ‘strategic autonomy’, accompanied by interventionism, unilateralism and coercive diplomacy. This article explores the causes of this dramatic shift. We argue that ‘strategic autonomy’, which goes beyond a moderate level of status-seeking compatible with Turkey's material power credentials, has a double connotation in the Turkish context. First, it constitutes a framework for the Turkish ruling elite to align with the non-western great powers and balance the US-led hierarchical order. Second, and more importantly, it serves as a legitimating foreign policy discourse for the government to mobilize its electoral base at home, fragment opposition and accrue popular support. We conclude that the search for autonomy from its western allies and the move towards the Russia–China axis has led to Turkey's isolation and permitted the emergence of new forms of dependence.","[{""name"": ""Mustafa Kutlay"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ziya Öniş"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055419000534,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,How Empathic Concern Fuels Political Polarization,"Over the past two decades, there has been a marked increase in partisan social polarization, leaving scholars in search of solutions to partisan conflict. The psychology of intergroup relations identifies empathy as one of the key mechanisms that reduces intergroup conflict, and some have suggested that a lack of empathy has contributed to partisan polarization. Yet, empathy may not always live up to this promise. We argue that, in practice, the experience of empathy is biased toward one’s ingroup and can actually exacerbate political polarization. First, using a large, national sample, we demonstrate that higher levels of dispositional empathic concern are associated with higher levels of affective polarization. Second, using an experimental design, we show that individuals high in empathic concern show greater partisan bias in evaluating contentious political events. Taken together, our results suggest that, contrary to popular views, higher levels of dispositional empathy actually facilitate partisan polarization.","[{""name"": ""ELIZABETH N.

The rise of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD, Alternative for Germany) is also a story about Germany’s internal political divide three decades after reunification, as the party has roughly twice as much support in the east than in the west. The article analyses the country’s east‐west divide, strongly visible in widespread sentiments of societal marginalisation among eastern Germans. The key socio‐structural differences between the east and the west relate to matters of economics, migration, and representation—and provide a setting suitable to AfD strength in the east.

Extending the theory of organizational learning, we propose the quadruple-loop learning model, through which we examine how a government can find solutions to a wicked policy problem like COVID-19. The quadruple-loop learning model is applied to explain how the Korean government could effectively tame COVID-19 in the initial stage through its agile as well as adaptive approach based on effective interactions of backstage (time, target, and context) and frontstage of policy processes mainly focusing on the initial stage until the highest alert level was announced. Based on the Korean case, this study also examines critical factors to effective learning organizations such as leadership, information and transparency, as well as citizen participation and governance.","[{""name"": ""Sabinne Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Associate Research Fellow, Korea Institute of Public Administration, Seoul, South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Changho Hwang"", ""affiliation"": [""Assistant Professor, Dong-A University, Busan, South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""M Jae Moon"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Social Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea""]}]","[""10.1177/1350507611408217"", ""10.2307/2391848"", ""10.1002/smj.4250131009"", ""10.1007/BF00138786"", ""10.1016/S0925-7535(01)00026-1"", ""10.1111/puar.12558"", ""10.1787/budget-v5-art6-en"", ""10.1108/10878570610637849"", ""10.1108/03090590410527636"", ""10.1007/s11558-017-9281-4"", ""10.3362/9781780449807"", ""10.1038/d41573-020-00151-8"", ""10.1177/0021886396323004"", ""10.1016/0090-2616(93)90054-5"", ""10.1111/puar.13214"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00445.x"", ""10.1108/03090590210422012"", ""10.2307/977560"", ""10.1177/1350507611426239"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00673.x"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Adding to these concerns, an influential Monte Carlo study by Stegmueller (2013) suggests that standard maximum-likelihood (ML) methods yield biased point estimates and severely anti-conservative inference with few upper-level units. In this article, the authors seek to rectify this negative assessment. First, they show that ML estimators of coefficients are unbiased in linear multilevel models. The apparent bias in coefficient estimates found by Stegmueller can be attributed to Monte Carlo Error and a flaw in the design of his simulation study. Secondly, they demonstrate how inferential problems can be overcome by usingrestrictedML estimators for variance parameters and at-distribution with appropriate degrees of freedom for statistical inference. Thus, accurate multilevel analysis is possible within the framework that most practitioners are familiar with, even if there are only a few upper-level units.","[{""name"": ""Martin Elff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Paul Heisig"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Merlin Schaeffer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susumu Shikano"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7910/DVN/CMMQRK"", ""10.1080/00949659608811740"", ""10.1027/1614-2241.1.3.86"", ""10.1186/s12874-015-0026-x"", ""10.1080/01621459.1993.10594284"", ""10.2307/3088424"", ""10.1080/03610928108828108"", ""10.1201/9780429258480"", ""10.2307/2530872"", ""10.1016/j.jmva.2006.11.009"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi009"", ""10.1198/108571102726"", ""10.1093/esr/jcv059"", ""10.1080/01621459.1996.10476971"", ""10.1007/s11222-011-9265-9"", ""10.1177/0003122417717901"", ""10.1093/biomet/58.3.545"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790942"", ""10.1111/ajps.12001"", ""10.1093/biomet/82.1.81"", ""10.2307/3002019"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-7-34"", ""10.1093/biomet/asp055"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi026"", ""10.2307/2533558"", ""10.18637/jss.v082.i13"", ""10.1093/biomet/89.2.401"", ""10.1093/biomet/80.1.27"", ""10.2307/2532189""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Statistics and Probability', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Coupling insights from economic voting and social identity theory, we consider how different groups in society may construe manufacturing job losses in contrasting ways. We argue that deindustrialization threatens dominant group status, leading some white voters in affected localities to favor candidates they believe will address economic distress and defend racial hierarchy. Examining three US presidential elections, we find white voters were more likely to vote for Republican challengers where manufacturing layoffs were high, whereas Black voters in hard-hit localities were more likely to vote for Democrats. In survey data, white respondents, in contrast to people of color, associated local manufacturing job losses with obstacles to individual upward mobility and with broader American economic decline. Group-based identities help explain divergent political reactions to common economic shocks.","[{""name"": ""LEONARDO BACCINI"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""STEPHEN WEYMOUTH"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/rep.2017.32"", ""10.7591/9781501711244"", ""10.1017/rep.2017.34"", ""10.1086/682384"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000314"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.3.1265"", ""10.1017/9781108645157"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000327"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1017/9781316687185"", ""10.1017/S000305541000050X"", ""10.1111/ecpo.12040"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.45.6.1196"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-033649"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000314"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00073"", ""10.3386/w24408"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mmb"", ""10.31235/osf.io/9ptqc"", ""10.1017/S1537592717000111"", ""10.2307/1341787"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003365"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2017.10.003"", ""10.1111/pops.12429"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3160480"", ""10.17848/9780585223940"", ""10.2307/1911072"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3411658"", ""10.2307/1924969"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.03.006"", ""10.1257/aer.103.6.2121"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2983872"", ""10.1257/aer.20170011"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00400"", ""10.1257/jep.32.2.47"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3209708"", ""10.1017/S0147547906000081"", ""10.1177/1532673X06294885"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12621"", ""10.1257/aer.20131578"", ""10.1177/053901847401300204"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1257/jep.33.4.152"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(99)00053-0"", ""10.1177/106591290105400403"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190651824.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1065912908314197"", ""10.2307/2130855"", ""10.1257/aer.98.5.2203"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090158"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.183"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000194"", ""10.2307/2991862"", ""10.1177/0956797614527113"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2015.01.010"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00063"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12122"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000405"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750717"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0043887113000191"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000330"", ""10.1177/0010414017720705"", ""10.1515/9781400834181"", ""10.1257/aer.91.4.795"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.04.002"", ""10.1007/s11127-016-0371-2"", ""10.2307/2111099"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article considers how two aspects of public salience, issue problem status and issue attention, work with environmental interest group membership to influence climate policy adoption in the American states. We contribute to the theoretical development of issue salience and offer alternative measures that capture differences in salience across subnational units. We find evidence that states where climate change is perceived to be a problem, and where attention to environmental issues is high, are more likely to adopt relevant policies. Furthermore, states with Republican majorities in either legislative chamber are less likely to adopt climate policies. Our findings have implications for the impact of salience on the policy process.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Bromley-Trujillo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Poe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2991759"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00360.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00360.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X16000155"", ""10.1007/s10584-006-9059-9"", ""10.2307/2669293"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.01.009"", ""10.1111/j.1539-6924.1994.tb00065.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973420"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2009.04.032"", ""10.2307/2111588"", ""10.2307/1956437"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2007.06.010"", ""10.1086/297828"", ""10.1080/714000580"", ""10.2307/3088421"", ""10.1162/glep.2007.7.4.19"", ""10.1002/pam.21599"", ""10.1111/ropr.12189"", ""10.1111/j.1368-423X.2004.00123.x"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.07.004"", ""10.2307/2960276"", ""10.1177/153244000700700208"", ""10.1177/153244000200200403"", ""10.1111/1467-9531.00117"", ""10.1023/A:1023825212333"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1994.tb01480.x"", ""10.1177/153244001001000201"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.121208.131609"", ""10.1177/106591290305600103"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2011.00495.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00471.x"", ""10.2307/2111583"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00537.x"", ""10.1177/1532673X04273416"", ""10.1007/s10584-016-1837-4"", ""10.1046/j.1541-1338.2003.00046.x"", ""10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01448.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a029854"", ""10.1093/poq/nfq075"", ""10.1080/13501761003662065"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00215"", ""10.1177/153244000300300305"", ""10.1007/s10584-015-1555-3"", ""10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol31-No3-7"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.923639"", ""10.2307/2111646"", ""10.2307/1956018"", ""10.1086/268922"", ""10.2307/2082973"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2008.00571.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055400258644"", ""10.1080/01944360802377973"", ""10.1080/08941920600835528"", ""10.1177/1532440012438889"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.43.4.267"", ""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00292.x"", ""10.1177/153244000700700104""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muz034,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Pathways to Implementation: Evidence on How Participation in Environmental Governance Impacts on Environmental Outcomes,"AbstractThere is much enthusiasm among scholars and public administrators for participatory and collaborative modes of governance as a means to tackle contemporary environmental problems. Participatory and collaborative approaches are expected to both enhance the environmental standard of the outputs of decision-making processes and improve the implementation of these outputs. In this article, we draw on a database of 305 coded published cases of public environmental decision-making to identify key pathways via which participation fosters effective environmental governance. We develop a conceptual model of the hypothesized relationship between participation, environmental outputs, and implementation, mediated by intermediate (social) outcomes such as social learning or trust building. Testing these assumptions through structural equation modeling and exploratory factor analysis, we find a generally positive effect of participation on the environmental standard of governance outputs, in particular where communication intensity is high and where participants are delegated decision-making power. Moreover, we identify two latent variables—convergence of stakeholder perspectives and stakeholder capacity building—to mediate this relationship. Our findings point to a need for treating complex and multifaceted phenomena such as participation in a nuanced manner, and to pay attention to how particular mechanisms work to foster a range of social outcomes and to secure more environmentally effective outputs and their implementation.","[{""name"": ""Nicolas W Jager"", ""affiliation"": [""Leuphana University Lüneburg"", ""Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg""]}, {""name"": ""Jens Newig"", ""affiliation"": [""Leuphana University Lüneburg""]}, {""name"": ""Edward Challies"", ""affiliation"": [""Leuphana University Lüneburg"", ""University of Canterbury""]}, {""name"": ""Elisa Kochskämper"", ""affiliation"": [""Leuphana University Lüneburg""]}]","[""10.1080/09585190210158529"", ""10.1111/conl.12562"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux030"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000802"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.06.029"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2015.1077440"", ""10.1126/science.aan1114"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.05.002"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM0701_03"", ""10.1002/eet.526"", ""10.1177/0739456X03022004007"", ""10.1509/jmkr.39.4.469.19117"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00665.x"", ""10.3197/096327103129341261"", ""10.1002/nml.20002"", ""10.1080/0964056032000070987"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.121003.091630"", ""10.1002/crq.98"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur011"", ""10.1002/crq.247"", ""10.1017/S037689290600275X"", ""10.1002/crq.21222"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00667.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq089"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199744671.013.0019"", ""10.1007/s11077-017-9278-0"", ""10.1177/0275074018773089"", ""10.1111/puar.12136"", ""10.1177/1094428104263675"", ""10.1111/psj.12026"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1080/01944369908976071"", ""10.1080/1464935042000293170"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq061"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.69.1.85"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2010.01826.x"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.08.007"", ""10.1111/j.1936-704X.2015.03196.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X18000041"", ""10.4337/9781785360411.00011"", ""10.2307/256824"", ""10.2307/256820"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2002.tb02141.x"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(2001)127:6(378)"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut011"", ""10.1111/2041-210X.12512"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2008.09.005"", ""10.1016/0030-5073(78)90044-2"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1106"", ""10.1177/0739456X08315888"", ""10.1287/orsc.14.1.91.12814"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.5751/ES-04476-170103"", ""10.1111/psj.12209"", ""10.1002/eet.509"", ""10.5751/ES-03713-150424"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2019.1623663"", ""10.4324/9781936331741"", ""10.1177/0095399714544941"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00394.x"", ""10.1023/A:1007537902813"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.93.5.959"", ""10.1353/jod.1995.0002"", ""10.5751/ES-03564-1504r01"", ""10.1177/0162243904271724"", ""10.1073/pnas.1604405114"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00010"", ""10.1002/pam.21836"", ""10.1111/psj.12162"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux009"", ""10.1890/08-1034.1"", ""10.1111/puar.12800"", ""10.4135/9781452231389"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00663.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum036"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-2208-1_2"", ""10.1177/00953990022019588"", ""10.1068/a44161"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00153.x"", ""10.1016/j.biocon.2012.08.018"", ""10.1086/651257""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Public Administration', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

This paper examines what is new about design thinking and compares this to rational and participatory approaches to policymaking, highlighting the difference between their logics, foundations and the basis on which they ‘speak truth to power’. It then examines the impact of design thinking on policymaking in practice, using the example of public sector innovation (PSI) labs. The paper concludes that design thinking, when it comes in contact with power and politics, faces significant challenges, but that there are opportunities for design thinking and policymaking to work better together.","[{""name"": ""Jenny M Lewis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Melbourne, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Michael McGann"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Melbourne, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Emma Blomkamp"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Melbourne, Australia""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1002/poi3.184,POLICY AND INTERNET,0302 Political Science; 0503 Journalism and Communication,Unpacking the Social Media Bot: A Typology to Guide Research and Policy,"Amid widespread reports of digital influence operations during major elections, policymakers, scholars, and journalists have become increasingly interested in the political impact of social media bots. Most recently, platform companies like Facebook and Twitter have been summoned to testify about bots as part of investigations into digitally enabled foreign manipulation during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Facing mounting pressure from both the public and from legislators, these companies have been instructed to crack down on apparently malicious bot accounts. But as this article demonstrates, since the earliest writings on bots in the 1990s, there has been substantial confusion as to exactly what a “bot” is and what it does. We argue that multiple forms of ambiguity are responsible for much of the complexity underlying contemporary bot‐related policy, and that before successful policy interventions can be formulated, a more comprehensive understanding of bots—especially how they are defined and measured—will be needed. In this article, we provide a typology of different types of bots, provide clear guidelines for better categorizing political automation, and unpack the impact that it can have on contemporary technology policy. We conclude by outlining the main challenges and ambiguities that will face both researchers and legislators as they tackle bots in the future.","[{""name"": ""Robert Gorwa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Douglas Guilbeault"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2675133.2675208"", ""10.1016/j.pubrev.2014.04.005"", ""10.1109/SP.2013.33"", ""10.1177/0894439317734157"", ""10.5210/fm.v21i11.7090"", ""10.1145/2076732.2076746"", ""10.1016/j.comnet.2012.06.006"", ""10.1145/2240236.2240247"", ""10.1525/rep.2012.117.1.30"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9384.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2012.08.016"", ""10.1177/2053951715580599"", ""10.1145/1920261.1920265"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814764077.003.0012"", ""10.1145/2872518.2889302"", ""10.3103/S0147688210020097"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2013.08.013"", ""10.5210/fm.v22i8.8005"", ""10.1145/2818717"", ""10.1145/3085558"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2013.873069"", ""10.1145/3123878.3131983"", ""10.1145/3041021.3054255"", ""10.1177/2056305115580479"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2394716"", ""10.1109/4236.623969"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11161-7_23"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000144"", ""10.1609/icwsm.v5i1.14106"", ""10.1609/icwsm.v8i1.14528"", ""10.1080/21670811.2015.1081822"", ""10.1145/3091478.3098860"", ""10.1126/science.1230456"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195397840.013.0021"", ""10.1007/s11109-016-9373-5"", ""10.5210/fm.v22i5.7051"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10421.001.0001"", ""10.1561/1500000017"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-10874-1_7"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2015.1021705"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10288.001.0001"", ""10.1145/1963192.1963301"", ""10.1145/2501654.2501659"", ""10.1007/11821830_12"", ""10.2307/1958356"", ""10.1145/2818048.2819985"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47874-6_19"", ""10.1109/MC.2016.183"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0171774"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0064"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1145/859670.859703"", ""10.1145/365153.365168"", ""10.5210/fm.v21i4.6161"", ""10.1145/2556609"", ""10.1145/3133956.3133990""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S1537592719001397,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,The Cost of Doing Politics? Analyzing Violence and Harassment against Female Politicians,"Violence against women in politics is increasingly recognized around the world as a significant barrier to women’s political participation, following a troubling rise in reports of assault, intimidation, and abuse directed at female politicians. Yet conceptual ambiguities remain as to the exact contours of this phenomenon. In this article, we seek to strengthen its theoretical, empirical, and methodological foundations. We propose that the presence of bias against women in political roles—originating in structural violence, employing cultural violence, and resulting in symbolic violence—distinguishes this phenomenon from other forms of political violence. We identify five types of violence against women in politics—physical, psychological, sexual, economic, and semiotic—and three methodological challenges related to underreporting, comparing men’s and women’s experiences, and intersectionality. Inspired by the literature on hate crimes, we develop an empirical approach for identifying cases of violence against women in politics, offering six criteria to ascertain whether an attack was potentially motivated by gender bias. We apply this framework to analyze three cases: the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, and the murder of Jo Cox. We conclude with the negative implications of violence against women in politics and point to emerging solutions around the globe.","[{""name"": ""Mona Lena Krook"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juliana Restrepo Sanín"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/07402775-3903724"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.08.004"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.24351879"", ""10.1080/14789940903174063"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2017.07.021"", ""10.1111/j.1478-9299.2005.00023.x"", ""10.5040/9798400656026"", ""10.1017/S0003055406061995"", ""10.5212/RevistaPautaGeral.v.3.i2.0003"", ""10.1080/13510341003588641"", ""10.1177/089124301015002006"", ""10.1177/0004867415583700"", ""10.1017/S1743923X14000579"", ""10.1177/0002764201045004006"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.109.3.573"", ""10.1017/S1743923X18000624"", ""10.1177/1866802X1700900103"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527555"", ""10.1111/1468-2230.12079"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0007"", ""10.1177/0886260509354503"", ""10.1093/aje/kwt295"", ""10.1177/01461672002611006"", ""10.1177/002234336900600301"", ""10.1177/0022343390027003005"", ""10.1007/s11199-010-9901-4"", ""10.1080/14789949.2015.1124908"", ""10.1080/10646170802665208"", ""10.1017/S1743923X18000582"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12458"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190088460.003.0016"", ""10.1017/S1743923X18000612"", ""10.1086/426800"", ""10.1177/15248380020032003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199368709.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.157"", ""10.2307/2644837"", ""10.1080/10361146.2014.929089"", ""10.1086/449259"", ""10.1057/fr.2015.49""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The first is to show that while co-production was originally tied to service production, co-creation has broader applications in the field of public governance and involves a broader range of actors and activities. The second objective is to demonstrate how the co-creation concept both builds on and extends the concept of collaborative governance, thus adding new dimensions to an already well-established literature. The final objective is to show how a strategic turn to co-creation introduces a new type of ‘generative governance’ aimed at solving complex problems by constructing platforms enabling the formation of arenas for co-creation that bring together a plethora of public and private actors, including citizens, in creative problem-solving processes. The three objectives are achieved through prospective theoretical analysis aimed at providing a conceptual foundation for analysing cutting-edge societal developments that are not yet commonplace.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Ansell"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California at Berkeley, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jacob Torfing"", ""affiliation"": [""Roskilde University, Denmark""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-8500.1998.tb01568.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1200662"", ""10.1111/padm.12233"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00113"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00773.x"", ""10.1007/s11266-012-9309-6"", ""10.1111/puar.12465"", ""10.1596/1020-797X_12_1_29"", ""10.2307/975300"", ""10.1068/b200175"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1192164"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.822535"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1192165"", ""10.1111/padm.12209"", ""10.1080/10630732.2014.954898"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur011"", ""10.1177/000271625831900103"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00181"", ""10.1108/09604521011092866"", ""10.1111/1468-0009.12197"", ""10.1108/08876041011072546"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00779.x"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2006.03.005"", ""10.17645/up.v1i4.749"", ""10.1177/1476127016648499"", ""10.1177/1470593106066781"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.04.038"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00248"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02391.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12141"", ""10.22215/timreview/607"", ""10.1111/puar.12765"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2008.04.005"", ""10.1016/0047-2352(73)90091-3"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(96)00023-X"", ""10.2307/2110474"", ""10.2307/974676"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1981.tb01208.x"", ""10.1002/dir.20015"", ""10.1080/01944363.2019.1618727"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2008.00415.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-0779-8_1"", ""10.1201/9780203608173-c14"", ""10.2307/41166052"", ""10.1177/0308518X15597908"", ""10.1177/0095399711418768"", ""10.1177/1078087416651936"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1559342"", ""10.1080/14494035.2018.1521676"", ""10.1177/0095399716680057"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2008.04.003"", ""10.1080/14719037.2014.930505"", ""10.1108/EJIM-05-2015-0033""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Public Administration', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12334,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,The effects of populism as a social identity frame on persuasion and mobilisation: Evidence from a 15-country experiment,"AbstractThis article investigates the impact of populist messages on issue agreement and readiness for action in 15 countries (N = 7,286). Specifically, populist communicators rely on persuasive strategies by which social group cues become more salient and affect people's judgment of and political engagement with political issues. This strategy is called ‘populist identity framing’ because the ordinary people as the in‐group is portrayed as being threatened by various out‐groups. By blaming political elites for societal or economic problems harming ordinary people, populist communicators engage in anti‐elitist identity framing. Another strategy is to blame immigrants for social problems – that is, exclusionist identity framing. Finally, right‐wing political actors combine both cues and depict an even more threatening situation of the ordinary people as the in‐group. Based on social identity theory, an experimental study in 15 European countries shows that most notably the anti‐elitist identity frame has the potential to persuade voters. Additionally, relative deprivation makes recipients more susceptible to the mobilising impact of the populist identity frames.","[{""name"": ""LINDA BOS"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam  The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""CHRISTIAN SCHEMER"", ""affiliation"": [""Johannes Gutenberg University  Mainz Germany""]}, {""name"": ""NICOLETA CORBU"", ""affiliation"": [""National University of Political Studies and Public Administration  Bucharest Romania""]}, {""name"": ""MICHAEL HAMELEERS"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam  The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""IOANNIS ANDREADIS"", ""affiliation"": [""Aristotle University of Thessaloniki  Greece""]}, {""name"": ""ANNE SCHULZ"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zürich  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""DESIRÉE SCHMUCK"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vienna  Austria""]}, {""name"": ""CARSTEN REINEMANN"", ""affiliation"": [""Ludwig‐Maximilians‐University Munich  Germany""]}, {""name"": ""NAYLA FAWZI"", ""affiliation"": [""Ludwig‐Maximilians‐University Munich  Germany""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1027/1864-1105/a000139"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12224"", ""10.1177/1354068815626603"", ""10.1080/10584609.2011.564605"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.808"", ""10.1348/014466600164642"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.27"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1329333"", ""10.1207/s15506878jobem4904_6"", ""10.1177/0010414017720705"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328523"", ""10.1177/1940161218786786"", ""10.1080/17457289.2017.1407326"", ""10.1177/0093650216644026"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511730245"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00003.x"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2010.05.005"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.1177/0959354395054005"", ""10.1111/comt.12029"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12258"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12032"", ""10.1332/174426412X654059"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1111/jcom.12337"", ""10.1177/0192512107088390"", ""10.1177/0002716216662639"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2008.00567.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.283"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.76.2.320"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1017/S1755773917000145"", ""10.1177/0010414017720707"", ""10.1177/1354068811436065"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01672.x"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edv014"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.56.4.319"", ""10.1177/1065912916639138"", ""10.1111/ajps.12001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12216"", ""10.1057/9781137414113"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.134.4.504"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60017-9""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

To ensure transparency and uniformity in research, the discipline could benefit from a systematic procedure. In this letter, we discuss how we have employed the method of ‘Expert-informed Qualitative Comparative Classification’ (EiQCC) to construct the newest version of The PopuList (3.0) – a database of populist, far-left, and far-right parties in Europe since 1989. This method takes into account the in-depth knowledge of national party experts while allowing for systematic comparative analysis across cases and over time. We also examine how scholars have made use of the previous versions of the dataset, explain how the new version of The PopuList differs from previous ones, and compare it to other data. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of The PopuList dataset.","[{""name"": ""Matthijs Rooduijn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea L. P.

10.1017/S1537592719003906,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,The Militarization of Law Enforcement: Evidence from Latin America,"What are the political consequences of militarizing law enforcement? Across the world, law enforcement has become increasingly militarized over the last three decades, with civilian police operating more like armed forces and soldiers replacing civilian police in law enforcement tasks. Scholarly, policy, and journalistic attention has mostly focused on the first type, but has neglected the study of three main areas toward which we seek to contribute: 1) the constabularization of the military—i.e., when the armed forces take on the responsibilities of civilian law enforcement agencies, 2) the extent to which this process has taken place outside of the United States, and 3) its political consequences. Toward this end, we unpack the concept of militarized law enforcement, develop theoretical expectations about its political consequences, take stock of militarization in Latin America, and evaluate whether expectations have played out in the region. We show that the distinction between civilian and military law enforcement typical of democratic regimes has been severely blurred in the region. Further, we argue that the constabularization of the military has had important consequences for the quality of democracy in the region by undermining citizen security, human rights, police reform, and the legal order.","[{""name"": ""Gustavo A.

This study proposes the first comprehensive analysis of national approaches to AI from a hybrid governance perspective, reflecting on the dominant regulatory discourses and the (re)definition of the public-private ordering in the making. It analyses national strategies released between 2017 and 2019, uncovering the plural institutional logics at play and the public-private interaction in the design of AI governance, from the drafting stage to the creation of new oversight institutions. Using qualitative content analysis, the strategies of a dozen countries (as diverse as Canada and China) are explored to determine how a hybrid configuration is set in place. The findings show a predominance of ethics-oriented rather than rule-based systems and a strong preference for functional indetermination as deliberate properties of hybrid AI governance.","[{""name"": ""Roxana Radu"", ""affiliation"": [""Global Governance Centre, Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, Switzerland"", ""Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/1468-2346.12504"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0080"", ""10.1177/0007650317717720"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199286652.001.0001"", ""10.1111/padm.12175"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3518482"", ""10.1080/14662043.2013.752175"", ""10.1179/102452906X104268"", ""10.1287/orsc.1090.0453"", ""10.4337/9781845428082"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1628/0932456041960605"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198833079.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-45299-4"", ""10.1002/poi3.99"", ""10.1111/padm.12105"", ""10.1080/01441647.2018.1494640"", ""10.1002/smj.4250070105"", ""10.4135/9781849200387.n4"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1855800"", ""10.1111/gove.12368""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

We find that women are significantly less likely than men to endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories and that this gender difference cuts across party lines. Our analysis suggests that this gender gap is partially explained by two dispositional factors: learned helplessness and conspiratorial thinking. Our findings qualify past work on the antecedents of conspiracy theory beliefs, which does not uncover robust and significant gender differences.

The relatively low cost of creating and deploying online advertisements and the ability to target online advertisements more precisely may broaden the set of candidates who advertise and allow candidates to craft messages to more narrow audiences than on television. Drawing on data from the newly released Facebook Ad Library API and television data from the Wesleyan Media Project, we find that a much broader set of candidates advertises on Facebook than television, particularly in down-ballot races. We then examine within-candidate variation in the strategic use and content of advertising on television relative to Facebook for all federal, statewide, and state legislative candidates in the 2018 election. Among candidates who use both advertising media, Facebook advertising occurs earlier in the campaign, is less negative, less issue focused, and more partisan than television advertising.","[{""name"": ""ERIKA FRANKLIN FOWLER"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MICHAEL M.

At the same time, they may introduce new biases in the human–algorithm interaction. Drawing on psychology and public administration literatures, we investigate two key biases: overreliance on algorithmic advice even in the face of “warning signals” from other sources (automation bias), and selective adoption of algorithmic advice when this corresponds to stereotypes (selective adherence). We assess these via three experimental studies conducted in the Netherlands: In study 1 (N = 605), we test automation bias by exploring participants’ adherence to an algorithmic prediction compared to an equivalent human-expert prediction. We do not find evidence for automation bias. In study 2 (N = 904), we replicate these findings, and also test selective adherence. We find a stronger propensity for adherence when the advice is aligned with group stereotypes, with no significant differences between algorithmic and human-expert advice. In study 3 (N = 1,345), we replicate our design with a sample of civil servants. This study was conducted shortly after a major scandal involving public authorities’ reliance on an algorithm with discriminatory outcomes (the “childcare benefits scandal”). The scandal is itself illustrative of our theory and patterns diagnosed empirically in our experiment, yet in our study 3, while supporting our prior findings as to automation bias, we do not find patterns of selective adherence. We suggest this is driven by bureaucrats’ enhanced awareness of discrimination and algorithmic biases in the aftermath of the scandal. We discuss the implications of our findings for public sector decision making in the age of automation. Overall, our study speaks to potential negative effects of automation of the administrative state for already vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens.","[{""name"": ""Saar Alon-Barkat"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Haifa , Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Madalina Busuioc"", ""affiliation"": [""Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1093/jopart/muy083"", ""10.1093/jopart/muab016"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy038"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000084"", ""10.1111/puar.12406"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00168"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.771699"", ""10.1177/0275074019856123"", ""10.3233/IP-170050"", ""10.1111/puar.13293"", ""10.1111/padm.12520"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy001"", ""10.1017/lst.2019.9"", ""10.21061/jots.v32i1.a.4"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.835"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1pwtb27"", ""10.3233/IP-200010"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvx045"", ""10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287563"", ""10.1145/3359280"", ""10.7758/9781610448789"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw049"", ""10.1111/gove.12317"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy002"", ""10.1093/jopart/muz012"", ""10.1002/ejsp.593"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.12.005"", ""10.20982/tqmp.16.1.p033"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocw105"", ""10.1111/puar.13391"", ""10.1177/154193129804200304"", ""10.1207/S15327108IJAP1101_1"", ""10.1518/001872097778543886"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy018"", ""10.3233/IP-200253"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0048-x"", ""10.1177/000312240907400304"", ""10.1006/ijhc.1999.0252"", ""10.1006/ijhc.1999.0349"", ""10.1207/S15327108IJAP1001_5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198838494.003.0006"", ""10.1111/puar.13286"", ""10.1111/emre.12342"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198838494.003.0001"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvab006"", ""10.1007/s11023-019-09513-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-19566-3_20""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research', 'General Decision Sciences']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7409), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7377)]]"
10.1080/14494035.2020.1855800,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Framing governance for a contested emerging technology:insights from AI policy,"ABSTRACT This paper examines how the governance in AI policy documents have been framed as way to resolve public controversies surrounding AI. It draws on the studies of governance of emerging technologies, the concept of policy framing, and analysis of 49 recent policy documents dedicated to AI which have been prepared in the context of technological hype expecting fast advances of AI that will fundamentally change economy and society. The hype about AI is accompanied by major public controversy about positive and negative effects of AI. Against the backdrop of this policy controversy, governance emerges as one of the frames that diagnoses the problems and offers prescriptions. Accordingly, the current governance characterized by oligopoly of a small number of large companies is indicated as one of the reasons for problems such as lack of consideration of societal needs and concerns. To address these problems, governance frame in AI policy documents assigns more active and collaborative roles to the state and society. Amid public controversies, the state is assigned the roles of promoting and facilitating AI development while at the same time being a guarantor of risk mitigation and enabler of societal engagement. High expectations are assigned to public engagement with multiple publics as a way to increase diversity, representation and equality in AI development and use. While this governance frame might have a normative appeal, it is not specific about addressing some well-known challenges of the proposed governance mode such as risks of capture by vested interests or difficulties to achieve consensus.","[{""name"": ""Inga Ulnicane"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""William Knight"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Tonii Leach"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Bernd Carsten Stahl"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Winter-Gladys Wanjiku"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK""]}]","[""10.4337/9781784710194"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2020.103971"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11022.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12549.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1809052"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.10.028"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30371-6"", ""10.1111/0952-1895.00121"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1332/174426411X579207"", ""10.1080/09537325.2018.1518521"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09517-8"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2019.01.006"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1787696"", ""10.3390/su11205791"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2019.01.009"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0114-4"", ""10.1215/9780822381815-007"", ""10.1007/BF02832235"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2015.06.006"", ""10.4324/9781315849195"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32320-2"", ""10.1177/0963662513518154"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.05.008"", ""10.1080/01441647.2018.1494640"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1782627"", ""10.1080/03080188.2020.1840220"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2012.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101961""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S002081832000048X,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,"Domestic Politics, China's Rise, and the Future of the Liberal International Order","AbstractWith the future of liberal internationalism in question, how will China's growing power and influence reshape world politics? We argue that views of the Liberal International Order (LIO) as integrative and resilient have been too optimistic for two reasons. First, China's ability to profit from within the system has shaken the domestic consensus in the United States on preserving the existing LIO. Second, features of Chinese Communist Party rule chafe against many of the fundamental principles of the LIO, but could coexist with a return to Westphalian principles and markets that are embedded in domestic systems of control. How, then, do authoritarian states like China pick and choose how to engage with key institutions and norms within the LIO? We propose a framework that highlights two domestic variables—centrality and heterogeneity—and their implications for China's international behavior.

Finally, we conclude by considering what alternative versions of international order might emerge as China's influence grows.","[{""name"": ""Jessica Chen Weiss"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeremy L.

The Roles of Deservingness, Political Ideology, and Personal Experience","AbstractAdministrative burdens affect peoples’ experience of public administration but there is, to date, limited evidence to as why policymakers are willing to accept and impose burdens. To address this gap, we draw from the policy design and administrative burden literatures to develop the concept of burden tolerance—the willingness of policymakers and people more generally to passively allow or actively impose state actions that result in others experiencing administrative burdens. Drawing on a survey experiment and observational data with Danish local politicians in a social welfare setting, we find that more right-wing politicians are more tolerant of burdens, but politicians are less willing to impose burdens on a welfare claimant perceived as being more deserving. Politicians with a personal experience of receiving welfare benefits themselves are less tolerant of burdens, while information about the psychological costs experienced by claimants did not reduce burden tolerance.","[{""name"": ""Martin Baekgaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}, {""name"": ""Donald P Moynihan"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University""]}, {""name"": ""Mette Kjærgaard Thomsen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Southern Denmark""]}]","[""10.1177/0261018306062589"", ""10.3162/036298010792069189"", ""10.1111/padm.12569"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux045"", ""10.1017/S1537592713002843"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199562978.003.0010"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup046"", ""10.1111/ajps.12112"", ""10.1111/puar.13134"", ""10.1023/A:1005571012599"", ""10.1093/esr/jcx076"", ""10.1177/1532440012456540"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv034"", ""10.1002/pam.22046"", ""10.1111/puar.12114"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy002"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy009"", ""10.1111/puar.13133"", ""10.1111/j.1536-7150.2011.00794.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1177/0095399713503540"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux025"", ""10.1177/0010414018784065"", ""10.1111/puar.12638"", ""10.1177/0095399719854367"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2018.02.003"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00545.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01923.x"", ""10.2307/2939044"", ""10.2307/2585401"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226768786.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2013.03.007"", ""10.1332/0305573002500811"", ""10.1177/0958928706059829""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration', 'Law']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Some scholars, relying on social identity theory, argue that as the relevance of party identification increased, Americans became more likely to see their in-party in positive terms and the out-party in negative terms. Other scholars argue that affective polarization is a reaction to increasingly extreme political actors. This study seeks to arbitrate between these two theories of affective polarization through a survey experiment which asks respondents to rate candidates whose party (or lack thereof) and ideology (or lack thereof) is randomly assigned. In line with the policy-oriented view of affective polarization, respondents reacted far more strongly to ideology than party, especially if it was the ideology of the member of the out-party.","[{""name"": ""Yphtach Lelkes"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/for-2018-0005"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.808"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1111/pops.12479"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805813.004"", ""10.1111/pops.12483"", ""10.2307/2111281"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy014"", ""10.1111/pops.12485"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1038455"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132"", ""10.1017/S0022381608090014"", ""10.1111/ajps.12330"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090066"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9323-7"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226452593.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11109-016-9377-1"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226473673.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

While fatalities in the city-state remain low and contact tracing efforts have been largely successful, it has nonetheless experienced high rates of infection and the emergence of large infection clusters in its foreign worker dormitories. This paper analyses this dual-track policy outcome – low fatalities but high infection rates – from a policy capacity perspective. Specifically, the policy capacities that had contributed to Singapore’s low fatality rates and effective contact tracing are identified while the capacity deficiencies that may have caused its high rates of infection are discussed. In doing so, I argue that the presence of fiscal, operational and political capacities that were built up after the SARS crisis had contributed to Singapore’s low fatality rate and contact tracing capabilities while deficiencies in analytical capacities may explain its high infection rate.","[{""name"": ""J J Woo"", ""affiliation"": [""Singapore""]}]","[""10.1111/0952-1895.00124"", ""10.5040/9780755619320"", ""10.1177/0090591797025001002"", ""10.1108/02686900210419949"", ""10.1108/08858621311295263"", ""10.1080/09512740801990188"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2004.00503.x"", ""10.1068/a260543"", ""10.1007/BF01115064"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.1057/9781137278173_6"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000534"", ""10.1080/09512740701306782"", ""10.1142/9472"", ""10.1080/15339114.2002.9678350"", ""10.1177/0192512117692643"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628306"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(95)00043-C"", ""10.1515/9780804765602"", ""10.2307/2009974"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2006.00330.x"", ""10.1080/17516230903027880"", ""10.1080/00220389508422370"", ""10.1080/00207540802014692"", ""10.1023/A:1016019302732"", ""10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707"", ""10.1057/9780230524194"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8500.2004.00358.x"", ""10.1002/pad.4230150323"", ""10.1108/S0732-1317(2010)19"", ""10.1177/0275074007301041"", ""10.2307/2149478"", ""10.1142/S1363919618500342"", ""10.1080/00472336.2012.634644"", ""10.4324/9781315622910"", ""10.1080/17516234.2014.922152"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-985-1"", ""10.4324/9781315115139"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2016.10.002"", ""10.7591/9781501720383"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-54675-9"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.001""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Whereas male political leaders historically drew on their traditional role as the male head of household to display forms of masculine protectionism toward citizens, women leaders are now able to draw on their traditional motherly role—for example, as the member of the household who traditionally cares for the sick—to display forms of feminine protectionism. As a result, international women leaders have managed to leverage women's role in the home to their advantage in the political sphere. Significantly, an appreciation of traditionally feminine attributes in women political leaders has been displayed in much media coverage, providing more favorable coverage of female political leaders than was previously the case.","[{""name"": ""Carol Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Blair Williams"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4337/9781789904581.00009"", ""10.1017/S1743923X16000246"", ""10.1080/10361146.2017.1374347"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856X.2004.00124.x"", ""10.3138/9781442662964"", ""10.1093/pa/gsaa008"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2015.10.008"", ""10.1017/S1743923X15000045"", ""10.1002/9781118561652"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2016.1188598"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8309.2012.02114.x"", ""10.1017/S1743923X18000545"", ""10.1080/15544771003697270"", ""10.1111/pops.12040"", ""10.59962/9780774834605-006"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195089400.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Participation in collaboration is risky––even if it has the potential to make all parties better off. This framework has uniquely shown how collaboration risk and other transaction costs can be overcome to create effective collaborations for addressing complex policy issues. However, after over a decade of use, the framework is due for critical evaluation and articulation of its state of the art and science to better inform future scholarship. For this purpose, this article defines key concepts and formulates assumptions, as well as reviews the empirical contributions and longstanding limitations of the ICA framework. A robust agenda for future research is also outlined. To move forward, we believe ICA research should focus on the foundational core of the ICA framework, maintain flexibility in explanatory models, and expand the scope beyond the collective action problems at the local level.","[{""name"": ""Serena Y.

10.1093/ia/iiz240,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,The Belt and Road Initiative: geo-economics and Indo-Pacific security competition,"Abstract The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been regarded by international society as a major policy tool in China's geo-economic strategy. Under this policy platform, Beijing has pledged to invest billions of dollars in the infrastructure and industrial sectors across Eurasia and in the Indo-Pacific nations. It is widely believed that such huge amount of investment will inevitably generate significant geostrategic repercussions in these regions. In response to the BRI, the United States and other powers have come up with a ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ strategy. This article attempts to address the following question: what impact is the BRI likely to have on the security ties between China and the other major players in the Indo-Pacific? The author finds that the BRI may significantly transform China's international security policy and the expansion of Beijing's security influence may further intensify the security competition between China and other major powers in the Indo-Pacific region. The article also proposes a new analytical angle for the study of geo-economics that unpacks the role of economic activities and processes in generating geopolitical intentions and catalysing geopolitical competition.","[{""name"": ""Mingjiang Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Development']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)]]"
10.17645/pag.v8i3.2922,POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE,0302 Political Science,When Populist Leaders Govern: Conceptualising Populism in Policy Making,"The rise of populist governance throughout the world offers a novel opportunity to study the way in which populist leaders and parties rule. This article conceptualises populist policy making by theoretically addressing the substantive and discursive components of populist policies and the decision-making processes of populist governments. It first reconstructs the implicit ideal type of policy making in liberal democracies based on the mainstream governance and policy making scholarship. Then, taking stock of the recent populism literature, the article elaborates an ideal type of populist policy making along the dimensions of content, procedures and discourses. As an empirical illustration we apply a qualitative congruence analysis to assess the conformity of a genuine case of populist governance, social policy in post-2010 Hungary with the populist policy making ideal type. Concerning the policy content, the article argues that policy heterodoxy, strong willingness to adopt paradigmatic reforms and an excessive responsiveness to majoritarian preferences are distinguishing features of any type of populist policies. Regarding the procedural features populist leaders tend to downplay the role of technocratic expertise, sideline veto-players and implement fast and unpredictable policy changes. Discursively, populist leaders tend to extensively use crisis frames and discursive governance instruments in a Manichean language and a saliently emotional manner that reinforces polarisation in policy positions. Finally, the article suggests that policy making patterns in Hungarian social policy between 2010 and 2018 have been largely congruent with the ideal type of populist policy making.","[{""name"": ""Attila Bartha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zsolt Boda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dorottya Szikra"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/gov.2013.12"", ""10.1177/0010414012453036"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12224"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1076214"", ""10.1332/030557319X15487805848586"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226039466.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501760902983382"", ""10.1057/9781137016669"", ""10.1080/01442872.2018.1478075"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1111/gove.12003"", ""10.1177/0010414010390653"", ""10.1017/9781108644655"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510175"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.1353/jod.2012.0057"", ""10.1515/eec-2016-0001"", ""10.1080/21699763.2018.1521863"", ""10.1017/S0022216X98005033"", ""10.1093/sp/jxr014"", ""10.1093/sp/jxw003"", ""10.1093/pa/gsx004"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.887879"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2017.1380264"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.13"", ""10.1017/S0043887112000251"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00608.x"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.21"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316681725"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139175104"", ""10.1177/1468795X15574414"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135342"", ""10.1080/13569317.2014.909266"", ""10.1177/0958928714545446"", ""10.1080/1356931042000263528"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1076230"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2009.00823.x"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2017.1380270"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2018.01.008"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00287.x"", ""10.2307/422412"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0045""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1093/isr/viaa061,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Global Autocracies: Strategies of Transnational Repression, Legitimation, and Co-Optation in World Politics","AbstractHow, when, and why does a state take repressive action against individuals residing outside its territorial jurisdiction? Beyond state-led domestic forms of control over citizens living within their legal borders, autocracies also seek to target those abroad—from African states’ sponsoring violence against exiled dissidents to Central Asian republics’ extraditions of political émigrés, and from the adoption of spyware software to monitor digital activism across Latin America to enforced disappearances of East Asian expatriates. Despite growing global interconnectedness, the field of international studies currently lacks an adequate comparative framework for analyzing how autocracies adapt to growing cross-border mobility. I argue that the rise of global migration flows has contributed to the emergence of “transnational authoritarianism,” as autocracies aim to both maximize material gains from citizens’ “exit” and minimize political risks by controlling their “voice” abroad. I demonstrate that governments develop strategies of transnational repression, legitimation, and co-optation that transcend state borders, as well as co-operation with a range of non-state actors. Bringing work on the international politics of migration in conversation with the literature on authoritarianism, I provide illustrative examples drawn from a range of transnational authoritarian practices by the fifty countries categorized as “Not Free” by Freedom House in 2019, covering much of Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and South America. I sketch an emerging field of international studies research around the novel means that autocracies employ to exercise power over populations abroad, while shedding light on the evolving nature of global authoritarianism.","[{""name"": ""Gerasimos Tsourapas"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Birmingham""]}]","[""10.1163/ej.9789004207295.i-214"", ""10.1111/glob.12246"", ""10.1093/isp/eky015"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000475"", ""10.1177/0022343314537860"", ""10.1080/19436149.2020.1770449"", ""10.24847/33i2016.95"", ""10.1017/9781316672020"", ""10.3167/sa.2015.590403"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491498"", ""10.5129/001041510X12911363510439"", ""10.1111/j.0023-5962.2004.00242.x"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2006.08.011"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.07.003"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1307824"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7379.2009.00804.x"", ""10.1080/14747731.2017.1403780"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00522"", ""10.4324/9781315037448"", ""10.1111/ajps.12382"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7379.2006.00017.x"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738860"", ""10.1080/14747731.2017.1403781"", ""10.1080/14747731.2011.621274"", ""10.2307/2009968"", ""10.1080/14747731.2017.1294752"", ""10.1080/13523270500363379"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7379.2004.tb00223.x"", ""10.1080/09739572.2015.1029711"", ""10.4324/9781315732916-5"", ""10.1080/17531055.2018.1547249"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0019"", ""10.2307/20434008"", ""10.1525/9780520921245"", ""10.1177/0094582X0202900103"", ""10.1093/ijrl/6.4.620"", ""10.1080/14747731.2016.1263078"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000680"", ""10.1177/0022343313505302"", ""10.1093/socpro/spw019"", ""10.4324/9780203361627"", ""10.33182/ml.v17i1.853"", ""10.1007/s12116-014-9152-4"", ""10.1080/014198799329512"", ""10.3998/mpub.93349"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199683628.001.0001"", ""10.1163/9789004272286"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2015.1049940"", ""10.1080/01419870.2019.1585558"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1307823"", ""10.1080/14747731.2017.1396798""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12719,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Does Affective Polarization Undermine Democratic Norms or Accountability? Maybe Not,"AbstractScholars warn that affective polarization undermines democratic norms and accountability. They speculate that if citizens were less affectively polarized, they would be less likely to endorse norm violations, overlook copartisan politicians’ shortcomings, oppose compromise, adopt their party's views, or misperceive economic conditions. We advance reasons to doubt that affective polarization influences political choices. We support this argument with five experiments that manipulate citizens’ affective polarization with multiple approaches. We then trace the downstream consequences of manipulating citizens’ affective polarization, such as their reactions to information about their actual representatives in Congress. In our experiments (total N = 12,341), we “rewind” the equivalent of three decades of change in affective polarization but find no evidence that these changes influence many political outcomes, only general questions about interpersonal attitudes. Our results suggest caution when assuming that reducing affective polarization would meaningfully bolster democratic norms or accountability.","[{""name"": ""David E.

10.1017/psrm.2021.44,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,What's in a buzzword? A systematic review of the state of populism research in political science,"AbstractAlthough attention to populism is ever-increasing, the concept remains contested. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of populism research and identifies tendencies to a conflation of host ideologies and populism in political science through a two-step analysis. First, we conduct a quantitative review of 884 abstracts from 2004 to 2018 using text-as-data methods. We show that scholars sit at “separate tables,” divided by geographical foci, methods, and host ideologies. Next, our qualitative analysis of 50 articles finds a common conflation of populism with other ideologies, resulting in the analytical neglect of the former. We, therefore, urge researchers to properly distinguish populism from “what it travels with” and engage more strongly with the dynamic interlinkages between thin and thick ideologies.","[{""name"": ""Sophia Hunger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fred Paxton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/cep.2014.26"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2459387"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1177/0267323107079676"", ""10.1177/0010414009331721"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13608746.2013.775720"", ""10.1111/nana.12480"", ""10.1093/pan/mpj017"", ""10.1111/spsr.12299"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00447.x"", ""10.1080/07907180903274727"", ""10.24193/csq.20.4"", ""10.1080/13608746.2017.1374323"", ""10.1080/10758216.2016.1200952"", ""10.1177/1350508418768053"", ""10.1111/j.1470-9856.2000.tb00096.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12314"", ""10.1111/j.1467-923X.2006.00762.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00338.x"", ""10.1057/s41296-017-0142-y"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511801938.011"", ""10.1177/0263395720955036"", ""10.1177/1354068815596514"", ""10.1177/0888325417736806"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2016.00317.x"", ""10.1177/1478929916680641"", ""10.1111/spsr.12281"", ""10.1080/01402382.2011.616660"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070753"", ""10.1080/09692290.2010.493733"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1287447"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615955"", ""10.2307/1958356"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2008.09.007"", ""10.2307/422412"", ""10.2307/2938818"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2016.00318.x"", ""10.1080/21670811.2017.1293487"", ""10.1177/1354068805049734"", ""10.1017/S1755773917000145"", ""10.1111/spsr.12180"", ""10.1177/0888325415602058"", ""10.1073/pnas.1915378117"", ""10.21105/joss.00774"", ""10.1017/S0007123406000172"", ""10.1111/spsr.12185"", ""10.1080/01402389508425056"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2018.03.003"", ""10.1515/for-2016-0004"", ""10.1177/0038038519853146"", ""10.1080/13569317.2016.1150137"", ""10.1080/13510347.2011.572619"", ""10.1109/DSAA.2017.61"", ""10.1080/01402382.2011.616665"", ""10.1080/21598282.2017.1405665"", ""10.1057/ap.2011.4"", ""10.1017/S1755773914000125"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12224"", ""10.1080/13645579.2012.730704"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310281"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.2307/20433986"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.001.0001"", ""10.1093/isr/viy035"", ""10.1111/spsr.12278"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcm4gmg"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738864"", ""10.1057/ap.2010.28"", ""10.1017/S1537592720003552"", ""10.1177/1940161218790035""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000133,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Perceived Discrimination and Political Behavior,"AbstractCan different experiences with discrimination produce divergent political behaviors? Does it make a difference whether individuals are discriminated against by their peers or community members in the course of everyday life as opposed to political actors or institutions tasked with upholding democratic norms of equality and fairness? Crossing disciplinary boundaries, this study proposes a new theoretical perspective regarding the relationship between discrimination and political behavior. Specifically, it distinguishes between societal (interpersonal) and political (systematic) discrimination when examining the behaviors of racial and ethnic minorities in Great Britain. The results illustrate that although experiences of political discrimination may motivate individuals to take part in mainstream politics for substantive or expressive purposes, the same conclusion cannot necessarily be drawn for those who experience societal rejection. The principal aim of this study is to further highlight the complex and multidimensional nature of discrimination, and to encourage further analyses of how different types of discrimination may impact the civic and political behaviors of minority groups.","[{""name"": ""Kassra A.R.

This is one of the most fundamental questions in political science. Despite its importance, there is currently no global dataset on governing elites over a long period. This article presents a novel dataset, WhoGov, which contains yearly data on members of cabinets in 177 countries during the period 1966–2016, making it the largest of its kind. We first present how the dataset was created and validate it by matching this data against existing data. We then demonstrate how the data can be used to gain new insights into diverse fields such as the study of autocracies, gender studies, the study of regime types, and government formation. We expect that this dataset will be an invaluable resource for both comparativists and country experts.","[{""name"": ""JACOB NYRUP"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""STUART BRAMWELL"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/jod.1990.0056"", ""10.1177/1065912913509028"", ""10.1080/01402380600842296"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000497"", ""10.1086/681028"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12030"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.993166"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62313-9_7"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000080"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00158.x"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990843"", ""10.1111/lsq.12146"", ""10.1177/0022343308100719"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198755715.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12338"", ""10.1177/0010414009332126"", ""10.1111/ajps.12075"", ""10.1177/1465116509103369"", ""10.1111/ajps.12337"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3234263"", ""10.1093/wber/lhq007"", ""10.1177/1065912917735400"", ""10.1177/1354068818820671"", ""10.3386/w20216"", ""10.1017/S1537592714000851"", ""10.1017/S1537592719000744"", ""10.1017/S000305540808012X"", ""10.1111/gove.12044"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000382"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000626"", ""10.1353/jod.2005.0026"", ""10.4324/9781315639246"", ""10.1163/156913311X607610"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2013.778544"", ""10.1086/692491"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2017.07.002"", ""10.1177/0022002719876000"", ""10.1017/S0008423911000485"", ""10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/pops.12650,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Uses and Abuses of Ideology in Political Psychology,"Ideology is a central construct in political psychology. Even so, the field's strong claims about an ideological public rarely engage evidence of enormous individual differences: a minority with real ideological coherence and weak to nonexistent political belief organization for everyone else. Here, I bridge disciplinary gaps by showing the limits of mass political ideology with several popular measures and components—self‐identification, core political values (egalitarian and traditionalism's resistance to change), and policy indices—in representative U.S. surveys across four decades (Ns ~ 13 k–37 k), plus panel data testing stability. Results show polar, coherent, stable, and potent ideological orientations only among the most knowledgeable 20–30% of citizens. That heterogeneity means full‐sample tests overstate ideology for most people but understate it for knowledgeable citizens. Whether through top‐down opinion leadership or bottom‐up ideological reasoning, organized political belief systems require political attention and understanding to form. Finally, I show that convenience samples make trouble for ideology generalizations. I conclude by proposing analytic best practices to help avoid overclaiming ideology in the public. Taken together, what first looks like strong and broad ideology is actually ideological innocence for most and meaningful ideology for a few.","[{""name"": ""Nathan P.

This article revisits and sharpens the conceptual definition of advocacy coalitions. We summarize the lessons from its theoretical emphases under the ACF and specify its five attributes (policy actors, shared beliefs, coordination, resources, and stability). Through this specification, we identify the ideal coalition type and several coalition subtypes. We then clarify and make a distinction between how we think about coalitions as a concept and how we approach coalitions empirically. This article sharpens the lens for describing and explaining coalitions toward better observations, theorizing, and measurements. It ends with next steps for further deepening and broadening knowledge about advocacy coalitions.","[{""name"": ""Christopher M.

Reflections on ""America in One Room""","This paper is positioned at the intersection of two literatures: partisan polarization and deliberative democracy. It analyzes results from a national field experiment in which more than 500 registered voters were brought together from around the country to deliberate in depth over a long weekend on five major issues facing the country. A pre–post control group was also asked the same questions. The deliberators showed large, depolarizing changes in their policy attitudes and large decreases in affective polarization. The paper develops the rationale for hypotheses explaining these decreases and contrasts them with a literature that would have expected the opposite. The paper briefly concludes with a discussion of how elements of this “antidote” can be scaled.","[{""name"": ""JAMES FISHKIN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ALICE SIU"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""LARRY DIAMOND"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""NORMAN BRADBURN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctvhrczh3"", ""10.1177/0032321719830936"", ""10.3152/147154399781782301"", ""10.1080/08913811.2012.711022"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy056"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226299358.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00148"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2012.01005.x"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01568.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198747369.001.0001"", ""10.1086/693987"", ""10.1111/pops.12591"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691165110.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592711000892"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31"", ""10.1177/2378023117727658"", ""10.1017/S0003055404041425"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070554"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491177"", ""10.1017/S0003055402004264"", ""10.1177/2053168016645137"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659935"", ""10.1111/pops.12487"", ""10.1515/9781400884711"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000298"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1974.tb00367.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00357.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198820291.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2132194"", ""10.1515/9781400828807"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226472157.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9780470690734.ch3"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9304-x"", ""10.2307/2944882"", ""10.1080/07907184.2018.1534832"", ""10.1017/S0007123402000029"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226644806.001.0001"", ""10.1162/DAED_x_00442"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226772875.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12089"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1177/0022343300037006004"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195378016.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02047.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.1515/9781400883448"", ""10.7910/DVN/KJ8IH2"", ""10.1017/S0007123409990433"", ""10.1017/9781316338179"", ""10.1111/pops.12164"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195131918.003.0016"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199567843.001.0001"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1017/S1537592721001924,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,"Forging, Bending, and Breaking: Enacting the ""Illiberal Playbook"" in Hungary and Poland","In recent years, Central and Eastern Europe have furnished several examples of illiberalism in power. The most prominent and consequential cases are Fidesz, which has ruled in Hungary since 2010, and Law and Justice (PiS), which has ruled in Poland since 2015. In both cases, illiberal governments have embarked upon an extensive project of political reform aimed at dismantling the liberal-democratic order. We examine the nature, scope, and consequences of these processes of autocratisation. We first argue that illiberal changes are ideologically founded and identify how both populism and nativism figure in the policymaking of illiberals in power. We then show how these practices emerge from a common “illiberal playbook”—a paradigm of policy change comprising forms of forging, bending, and breaking—and elaborate on the notion that illiberal governments are using legalism to kill liberalism.

In this article, we draw on aggregate‐level data to conduct an initial exploration of the vote. What was the impact of Brexit on the 2019 general election result? How far has Brexit reshaped electoral politics? Was 2019 a ‘realignment election’? And, if so, what are the implications? With a focus on England and Wales we show that, although the Conservatives made gains deep into Labour’s working class heartlands, these gains have been a long time coming, reflected in Labour’s weakening relationship with working class Britain. As such, 2019 is not a critical election but a continuation of longer‐term trends of dealignment and realignment in British politics.","[{""name"": ""David Cutts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Goodwin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oliver Heath"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paula Surridge"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

Based on data from 1,604 children who live in four different regions across the United States, we find that children not only perceive politics to be a male-dominated space, but with age, girls increasingly see political leadership as a “man’s world.” Simultaneously, as children grow older, they internalize gendered expectations, which direct their interests toward professions that embody the gendered traits that fit with their own sex. One result of this mismatch between women and politics is that girls express lower levels of interest and ambition in politics than do boys.","[{""name"": ""ANGELA L.

I argue that where governments provide Internet access, surveillance of digital information exchange can provide intelligence that enables the use of more targeted forms of repression, in particular in areas not fully controlled by the regime. Increasing restrictions on Internet accessibility can impede opposition organization, but they limit access to information on precise targets, resulting in an increase in untargeted repression. I present new data on killings in the Syrian conflict that distinguish between targeted and untargeted events, using supervised text classification. I find that higher levels of Internet accessibility are associated with increases in targeted repression, whereas areas with limited access experience more indiscriminate campaigns of violence. The results offer important implications on how governments incorporate the selective access to communication technology into their strategies of coercion.","[{""name"": ""Anita R.

Mask wearing is arguably an essential component of the new normal until substantial progress is made on a vaccine. However, though evidence suggests the practice is a positive for public health and limiting the transmission of COVID-19, there is variation in attitudes toward and practices of mask wearing. Specifically, there appears to be a sex-based divide in mask wearing, with men more likely to resist wearing masks. Utilizing an original survey, we test the correlation between masculinity and mask wearing. We find that identification with norms of masculinity has a significant influence on affective responses toward mask wearing.","[{""name"": ""Carl L.

10.1093/isq/sqae038,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Positionality Statements as a Function of Coloniality: Interrogating Reflexive Methodologies,"Abstracts Declaration of positionality and the confession of privilege as a way of revealing unequal power dynamics in knowledge production has become an increasingly encouraged reflexive practice in international relations and other disciplines. However, we interrogate the potentially negative implications of this methodology, occurring through a reification of material, assumed, and imagined hierarchies between people, which then is advertised and (re)produced by its utterance. We further query the modernist origins of reflexive methodology, which has inspired the practice of declaring positionality, and argue that its underpinning coloniality has bearings for its use today. We then explore how this coloniality manifests: Thus, first, we consider the extent to which publicly acknowledging privilege paradoxically acts as a means of centering whiteness through the narcissistic gaze and an assertion of legitimacy. Second, we argue positionality statements offer a redemption of guilt for the hegemonic researcher. And lastly, rather than ameliorating unequal power dynamics in the production of knowledge, we contend positionality statements may constitute hidden power moves in which one is able to signal and reinstate one’s authority vis-à-vis people, but especially women, of color. We end with a call for a reparative scholarship that acknowledges these limitations in positionality statements.","[{""name"": ""Jasmine K Gani"", ""affiliation"": [""University of St Andrews , UK""]}, {""name"": ""Rabea M Khan"", ""affiliation"": [""Liverpool John Moores University , UK""]}]","[""10.5871/jba/009s1.047"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511617690.015"", ""10.1017/S1743923X17000484"", ""10.1177/1354066120969789"", ""10.4324/9781315765013-2"", ""10.4324/9781315857299"", ""10.1086/679081"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198245537.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00826.x"", ""10.1177/1755088219830428"", ""10.1080/09557571.2013.770297"", ""10.1177/0011392119886864"", ""10.1086/ahr.116.3.653"", ""10.1093/isr/viv018"", ""10.1017/S0260210510000689"", ""10.4324/9780203450536_chapter_2"", ""10.1525/9780520946286-003"", ""10.1086/494362"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000256"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1093/lril/lrx006"", ""10.4324/9781315765013-3"", ""10.1080/13613324.2019.1679751"", ""10.4324/9780203710494"", ""10.1177/0305829811402709"", ""10.1525/ae.2005.32.4.538"", ""10.1017/S0260210523000232"", ""10.1111/j.0033-0124.1994.00080.x"", ""10.4324/9781315687490-14"", ""10.4324/9781315687490-7"", ""10.1177/104973202129120052"", ""10.1177/0305829817714064"", ""10.1177/09670106211054901"", ""10.1093/ia/iiab226"", ""10.1177/030437540102600404"", ""10.1177/1354066112437770"", ""10.2307/3178066"", ""10.4135/9781526402066.n2"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000232"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316154670"", ""10.4324/9780203837221"", ""10.1525/aa.2002.104.3.791"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139764407"", ""10.1177/20503032211015302"", ""10.1017/S0260210523000517"", ""10.1177/030437540102600403"", ""10.1093/isagsq/ksab022"", ""10.1093/ips/olad018"", ""10.1177/1368431008097008"", ""10.1073/pnas.2215324120"", ""10.1017/9781108961844"", ""10.1017/asr.2022.58"", ""10.1023/A:1022967012774"", ""10.36583/kohl/5-1-4"", ""10.1525/9780520911666"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816692149.001.0001"", ""10.1525/aa.1993.95.3.02a00070"", ""10.1080/21582041.2017.1418521"", ""10.1177/0305829817709083"", ""10.4324/9781315227542"", ""10.1080/0951839032000060635"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190865511.001.0001"", ""10.1177/089124300014001007"", ""10.1177/0305829810372781"", ""10.1177/107780049800400102"", ""10.4324/9781351128988-15"", ""10.1177/0305829819889575"", ""10.1177/0305829820971687"", ""10.1080/17539153.2022.2089401"", ""10.4324/9781315765013-4"", ""10.1177/0891241618811535"", ""10.1177/1354066113494323"", ""10.1177/1077800414530265"", ""10.1007/BF00990072"", ""10.1353/ncr.2004.0015"", ""10.1080/09636412.2023.2230880""]",['Social Sciences'],"['General Social Sciences', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

To elucidate the prospects of the United States under president Donald Trump, I conduct a wide-ranging comparative analysis of populism’s regime impact in Europe and Latin America. The investigation finds that the risks have been overestimated. Populist leaders manage to suffocate democracy only when two crucial conditions coincide. First, institutional weakness, which comes in various types, creates vulnerabilities to populist power grabs. Second, even in weaker institutional settings populist leaders can only succeed with their illiberal machinations if acute yet resolvable crises or extraordinary bonanzas give them overwhelming support which enables them to override and dismantle institutional constraints to power concentration. Because none of these conditions prevail in the United States, an undemocratic involution is very unlikely. First, the federal system of checks and balances, rooted in an unusually rigid constitution, remains firm and stable. Second, President Trump encountered neither acute crises nor a huge windfall; consequently, his mass support has remained limited. Facing strong resistance from an energized opposition party and a vibrant civil society, the U.S. populist cannot destroy democracy. Instead, Trump’s transgressions of norms of civility have sparked an intense counter-mobilization that may inadvertently revitalize U.S. democracy.","[{""name"": ""Kurt Weyland"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5553/TvCR/187966642017008001006"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0045"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1076213"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1076230"", ""10.1177/0951692803151002"", ""10.1353/jod.0.0170"", ""10.1017/9781108692793.003"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052213-040359"", ""10.2478/bjals-2018-0011"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198837886.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jod.2003.0043"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0048"", ""10.4159/9780674984776"", ""10.1177/0002716218818782"", ""10.1017/9781316798553.003"", ""10.1177/0951629805052883"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003286"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1353/jod.0.0023"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226409184.001.0001"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1493457"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0047"", ""10.1111/1478-9302.12021"", ""10.1080/14782804.2013.766475"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2012.01377.x"", ""10.1017/9781108692793.004"", ""10.1080/01436599814433"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511762062"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1485015"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96758-5_6"", ""10.1111/psq.12063"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060139"", ""10.1017/9781108692793"", ""10.1080/13532944.2014.986444"", ""10.1177/0002716218809322"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0040"", ""10.1353/jod.2005.0026"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738864"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0039"", ""10.1515/9780271030326"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817595"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96758-5_4"", ""10.14267/cjssp.2017.3S.14"", ""10.1017/9781108772211"", ""10.5129/001041517821273044"", ""10.2307/2944709"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003377"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.091106.121756"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0064"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-110813-032156"", ""10.1017/9781108692793.008"", ""10.1017/S0007123400007225"", ""10.3167/ip.2006.220106"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0047"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000550"", ""10.1017/9781108671019""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1017/psrm.2019.13,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Beyond the breaking point? Survey satisficing in conjoint experiments,"AbstractRecent years have seen a renaissance of conjoint survey designs within social science. To date, however, researchers have lacked guidance on how many attributes they can include within conjoint profiles before survey satisficing leads to unacceptable declines in response quality. This paper addresses that question using pre-registered, two-stage experiments examining choices among hypothetical candidates for US Senate or hotel rooms. In each experiment, we use the first stage to identify attributes which are perceived to be uncorrelated with the attribute of interest, so that their effects are not masked by those of the core attributes. In the second stage, we randomly assign respondents to conjoint designs with varying numbers of those filler attributes. We report the results of these experiments implemented via Amazon's Mechanical Turk and Survey Sampling International. They demonstrate that our core quantities of interest are generally stable, with relatively modest increases in survey satisficing when respondents face large numbers of attributes.","[{""name"": ""Kirk Bansak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jens Hainmueller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel J.

10.1017/gov.2021.31,GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION,0302 Political Science,Affective Polarization and the Populist Radical Right: Creating the Hating?,"AbstractDo populist radical right (PRR) parties fuel affective polarization? If so, how and under which circumstances? Based on a comparative cross-country analysis covering 103 elections in 28 European countries and an examination of longitudinal data from the Netherlands, we show that PRR parties occupy a particular position in the affective political landscape because they both radiate and receive high levels of dislike. In other words, supporters of PRR parties are uniquely (and homogeneously) negative about (supporters of) mainstream parties and vice versa. Our analyses suggest that these high levels of antipathy are most likely due to the combination of these parties' nativism and populism – two different forms of ingroup–outgroup thinking. Our findings also suggest that greater electoral success by PRR parties reduces dislike towards them, while government participation appears threatening to all voters except coalition partners.","[{""name"": ""Eelco Harteveld"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philipp Mendoza"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthijs Rooduijn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131752"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.5964/jspp.v7i1.1090"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.808"", ""10.3386/w26669"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226299358.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12127"", ""10.1080/21598282.2012.706777"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1177/1354068818820671"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.12153"", ""10.1111/0022-4537.00126"", ""10.1057/s41304-017-0138-3"", ""10.3167/dt.2018.050202"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00077"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.006"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00659.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511730245"", ""10.1177/1465116517718091"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12314"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1328889"", ""10.1515/for-2018-0005"", ""10.1080/13510347.2021.1883002"", ""10.7804/cses.imd.2019-10-17"", ""10.1111/ajps.12030"", ""10.1080/13569317.2018.1451227"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00623.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102199"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1177/0192512101022004003"", ""10.1126/science.abe1715"", ""10.1057/9781403920072"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1674578"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051701"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.02.003"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12228"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102332"", ""10.1177/1350508418768053"", ""10.1177/1065912917721371""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Our findings suggest that most of the fall in support for social democratic parties in recent years is correlated with a decline in the number of industrial workers as well as a reduction in the propensity of social democratic parties’ core supporters (industrial workers and public-sector employees) to vote for them.","[{""name"": ""GIACOMO BENEDETTO"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SIMON HIX"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""NICOLA MASTROROCCO"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9780755619986"", ""10.5771/9783845223414"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1515/9781400875337-007"", ""10.1017/S0003055406062083"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000813"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiy018"", ""10.1177/0958928714556970"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625633"", ""10.1080/00036840500392078"", ""10.1016/0176-2680(87)90010-3"", ""10.1086/704436"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-031710-101450"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230504592"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511521560"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09344-2""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/padm.12768,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,"Target-setting, political incentives, and the tricky trade-off between economic development and environmental protection","AbstractDisentangling the relationship between economic development and environmental protection has attracted much attention from public administration scholars. While traditionally scholars approach the relationship from either a substitutive or a complementary perspective, we offer a nuanced perspective by examining how the target‐setting on economic growth shapes environmental performance. This article proposes an explanation for the impacts of gross domestic product growth targets on environmental performance based on a yardstick competition model, where the upper‐level governments use relative performance to create competition among lower‐level governments. We argue that a trade‐off exists between economic development and environmental performance; however, the substitutive relationship tends to transit to a complementary relationship when environmental performance is incorporated into the cadre evaluation system. Analyzing a panel dataset of economic targets and PM2.5 air pollution across Chinese cities from 2001 to 2010, we confirm the relationship between economic targets and environmental performance by highlighting local leaders' political incentives.","[{""name"": ""Juan Du"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Policy and Management Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongtao Yi"", ""affiliation"": [""John Glenn College of Public Affairs The Ohio State University  Columbus Ohio USA""]}]","[""10.1086/344122"", ""10.1177/0891242413491316"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi014"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(02)00220-7"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2012.04.011"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.12.006"", ""10.4324/9781315878980"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2005.05.003"", ""10.1257/0895330027157"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa1702747"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00032"", ""10.1111/puar.13104"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2257.1996.tb00898.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00390.x"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2015.08.010"", ""10.1257/aer.102.2.994"", ""10.1002/jid.1196"", ""10.1093/jleo/7.special_issue.24"", ""10.1111/ajps.12394"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.02.021"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2013.763629"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00510.x"", ""10.1111/puar.13025"", ""10.1086/261010"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2015.08.009"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2004.06.009"", ""10.1093/ej/uez018"", ""10.1080/10967494.2015.1043167"", ""10.1111/padm.12225"", ""10.1111/1467-937X.00135"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu054"", ""10.1080/13549839908725582"", ""10.1111/juaf.12316"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190499167.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2555560"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(96)00032-0"", ""10.1111/ropr.12298"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2006.12.003"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000106"", ""10.1017/S0305741016001521"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2021.102440"", ""10.1257/jel.49.4.1076"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.01.034"", ""10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2015.12.003"", ""10.1111/puar.13184"", ""10.1080/10967494.2019.1688209"", ""10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2013.09.003"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy034""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

This reflects a growing worldwide trend in the use of physical repression to censor online speech. In this paper, we systematically examine the consequences of imprisoning well-known Saudis for online dissent by analyzing over 300 million tweets as well as detailed Google search data from 2010 to 2017 using automated text analysis and crowd-sourced human evaluation of content. We find that repression deterred imprisoned Saudis from continuing to dissent online. However, it did not suppress dissent overall. Twitter followers of the imprisoned Saudis engaged in more online dissent, including criticizing the ruling family and calling for regime change. Repression drew public attention to arrested Saudis and their causes, and other prominent figures in Saudi Arabia were not deterred by the repression of their peers and continued to dissent online.","[{""name"": ""JENNIFER PAN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ALEXANDRA A.

However, conceptual stretching and a lack of reliable measures have limited cross-national research on this concept. To address this research gap, we use V-Dem data and innovative Bayesian methods to develop new indices of accountability and its subtypes: the extent to which governments are accountable to citizens (vertical accountability), other state institutions (horizontal accountability), and the media and civil society (diagonal accountability). In this article, we describe the conceptual and empirical framework underlying these indices and demonstrate their content, convergent, and construct validity. The resulting indices have unprecedented coverage (1900–present) and offer researchers and policymakers new opportunities to investigate the causes and consequences of accountability and its disaggregated subtypes. Furthermore, the methodology provides a framework for theoretically driven index construction to scholars working with cross-national panel data.","[{""name"": ""ANNA LÜHRMANN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""KYLE L.

10.1111/pops.12754,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Conspiracy Theories and Institutional Trust: Examining the Role of Uncertainty Avoidance and Active Social Media Use,"A generalized climate of distrust in political institutions is not functional to healthy democracies. With the advent of social media, recent scholarly efforts attempt to better understand people's conspiracy theory beliefs in inhibiting institutional trust. This study contributes to this literature by considering the direct antecedent effects of uncertainty avoidance and the moderating role ofactivesocial media use—SMU (i.e., interactional SMU, informational SMU, and political expressive SMU). The former is theorized to enable conspiracy theories to thrive, while the latter should cushion the negative effects of conspiracy beliefs on institutional trust. Relying on diverse survey data across different cultures from Europe, the Americas, and New Zealand (N = 11,958) and applying structural equation modeling, findings supported the hypothesized model. In high uncertainty‐avoidance societies, where less well‐known situations are perceived as uncomfortable or downright threatening, conspiracy beliefs proliferate and negatively impact institutional trust. Active SMU attenuates these effects. Via social media, citizens have the ability to strengthen social relationships (interactional SMU), keep themselves informed about the community (informational SMU), and engage in political self‐expression (political expressive SMU), which mitigate conspiracy‐belief negative effects on institutional trust. Future research implications and key limitations of the study are all discussed.","[{""name"": ""Silvia Mari"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Milano‐Bicocca""]}, {""name"": ""Homero Gil de Zúñiga"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Salamanca"", ""Pennsylvania State University"", ""Universidad Diego Portales""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmet Suerdem"", ""affiliation"": [""Istanbul Bilgi Universitesi""]}, {""name"": ""Katja Hanke"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Applied Management Studies""]}, {""name"": ""Gary Brown"", ""affiliation"": [""Royal Holloway University of London""]}, {""name"": ""Roosevelt Vilar"", ""affiliation"": [""Massey University ‐ Albany Campus""]}, {""name"": ""Diana Boer"", ""affiliation"": [""University Koblenz‐Landau, Campus Koblenz""]}, {""name"": ""Michal Bilewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Warsaw""]}]","[""10.1111/0162-895X.00160"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00010035"", ""10.3989/ris.2018.76.1.16.147"", ""10.1111/bjso.12366"", ""10.1177/0192512110377437"", ""10.1177/0267323111433566"", ""10.4135/9781412986373"", ""10.1080/01972243.2011.583812"", ""10.1093/esr/jcv059"", ""10.1111/jcc4.12129"", ""10.1177/004931032002001"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003"", ""10.1073/pnas.1517441113"", ""10.1177/1478929920948684"", ""10.3200/SOCP.148.2.210-222"", ""10.1177/0963721417718261"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01507"", ""10.1007/s00127-017-1354-4"", ""10.1016/0191-8869(94)90048-5"", ""10.1126/science.1197754"", ""10.1093/joc/jqz002"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.nov.01"", ""10.1111/jcom.12103"", ""10.2307/3791630"", ""10.1007/s12144-013-9165-6"", ""10.1177/0963662514559891"", ""10.9707/2307-0919.1111"", ""10.1093/hcr/hqz004"", ""10.1111/bjop.12018"", ""10.4324/9780429452734-2_7"", ""10.1177/0956797612457686"", ""10.1177/0022022118766619"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2011.592648"", ""10.5334/irsp.95"", ""10.1007/3-540-45547-7_3"", ""10.1002/jcop.22119"", ""10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.341"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-22261-5_2"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0175387"", ""10.5129/001041508X12911362383354"", ""10.1111/pops.12015"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.1992.tb00034.x"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.04.084"", ""10.1037/a0018938"", ""10.4324/9780429452734-3_4"", ""10.1177/0956797614545133"", ""10.1081/PAD-120019352"", ""10.1177/0020852307085733"", ""10.1177/1948550611434786"", ""10.1007/BF02249397"", ""10.1177/1461444813518390"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.01.019"", ""10.1111/ajsp.12350""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/isq/sqz085,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,When Organizations Rebel: Introducing the Foundations of Rebel Group Emergence (FORGE) Dataset,"AbstractScholars have spent decades investigating various sources of rebellion, from societal and institutional explanations to individual motivations to take up arms against one's government. One element of the civil war process that has gone largely unstudied from a cross-national perspective is the role preexisting organizations in society play in the formation of rebel groups, principally due to a lack of comparable data on the origins of these armed actors across conflicts. In an effort to fill this gap, we present the Foundations of Rebel Group Emergence (FORGE) dataset, which offers information on the “parent” organizations and the founding processes that gave rise to rebel groups active between 1946 and 2011 in intrastate conflicts included in the Uppsala Conflict Data Program's Armed Conflict Database. The new information on rebel foundations introduced in this research note should help scholars to reconsider and newly explore a variety of conditions before, during, and after civil wars including rebel-civilian interactions, structures of rebel organizations, bargaining processes with the government, participation in postwar governance, and more.","[{""name"": ""Jessica Maves Braithwaite"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Arizona""]}, {""name"": ""Kathleen Gallagher Cunningham"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Maryland""]}]","[""10.1177/0022343308088815"", ""10.1177/0022343305057888"", ""10.1177/0022343312450886"", ""10.1177/0738894217693595"", ""10.1177/0022343313491587"", ""10.1177/0022343304043769"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00221.x"", ""10.1177/0022343309353488"", ""10.1177/0022002709336458"", ""10.1177/0738894213499673"", ""10.1111/ajps.12003"", ""10.1177/0022343319829689"", ""10.1177/0022343304043771"", ""10.1177/0022002712439496"", ""10.1086/684366"", ""10.1177/0022343302039005007"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.00525.x"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00022"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00237"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316711323"", ""10.1080/07388940802218945"", ""10.1177/0022343309353108"", ""10.1086/684631"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000243"", ""10.1177/0010414016672235"", ""10.1080/03050629.2015.984809"", ""10.1177/0022002716655441"", ""10.1177/0022343316668390"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00554.x"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000157"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogw004"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000208"", ""10.1177/0022343318784101"", ""10.1111/ajps.12199"", ""10.1177/0022002716680265"", ""10.1177/0022002702046001004"", ""10.1080/13698240701699409"", ""10.1177/0010414013512602"", ""10.7591/9780801471032"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000418"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw033"", ""10.1177/0022343312452421"", ""10.1111/ajps.12113"", ""10.1162/002081897550384"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00186.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808654"", ""10.1177/0022002718766414"", ""10.1177/0022343316675025""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/pan.2019.26,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Word Embeddings for the Analysis of Ideological Placement in Parliamentary Corpora,"Word embeddings, the coefficients from neural network models predicting the use of words in context, have now become inescapable in applications involving natural language processing. Despite a few studies in political science, the potential of this methodology for the analysis of political texts has yet to be fully uncovered. This paper introduces models of word embeddings augmented with political metadata and trained on large-scale parliamentary corpora from Britain, Canada, and the United States. We fit these models with indicator variables of the party affiliation of members of parliament, which we refer to as party embeddings. We illustrate how these embeddings can be used to produce scaling estimates of ideological placement and other quantities of interest for political research. To validate the methodology, we assess our results against indicators from the Comparative Manifestos Project, surveys of experts, and measures based on roll-call votes. Our findings suggest that party embeddings are successful at capturing latent concepts such as ideology, and the approach provides researchers with an integrated framework for studying political language.","[{""name"": ""Ludovic Rheault"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Cochrane"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/psrm.2015.77"", ""10.7910/DVN/K0OYQF"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139680752"", ""10.1017/S0007123409990299"", ""10.3162/036298004X201294"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.87"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt002"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000698"", ""10.1109/MIS.2016.45"", ""10.1353/eca.2012.0017"", ""10.1177/1354068895001001004"", ""10.1075/dapsac.55.05hir"", ""10.1017/S0008423913000632"", ""10.3386/w22423"", ""10.59962/9780774836098"", ""10.1073/pnas.1720347115"", ""10.1017/S0007123411000160"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199009)41:6<391::AID-ASI1>3.0.CO;2-9"", ""10.2307/j.ctvnjbgwt"", ""10.1017/S0008423910000624"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1984.tb00080.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-22368-8_1"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199244003.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0008423916001165"", ""10.1057/9781137484550"", ""10.1093/pan/mpw017"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-043010-095836"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0168843"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.44"", ""10.4324/9780203843604"", ""10.1162/tacl_a_00134"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.3982/ECTA7195"", ""10.4324/9780203028179"", ""10.1080/01621459.2012.734168"", ""10.2307/2669295"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.7"", ""10.1162/neco.1992.4.3.448"", ""10.1126/science.aal4230"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl009"", ""10.3386/w23276"", ""10.1093/019924488X.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00338.x"", ""10.1093/019829414X.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.9"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.012003.104815""]",['Social Sciences'],"['General Social Sciences', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Drawing on insights from moral psychology, however, we posit that partisan moral convictions heighten affective polarization beyond the effects of partisanship, increasing partisan animosity and copartisan favoritism. Testing this theory using data from two national samples and novel measures of affective polarization in everyday life, we find that people who tend to moralize politics display more partisan bias, distance and hostility, irrespective of partisan strength. These results shed light on a different moral divide that separates the American public and raise key normative questions about moral conviction and electoral politics.","[{""name"": ""Kristin N.

Factors Explaining Emotional Appeals in the Communication of Political Parties,"Are populists really more emotional than mainstream parties? The alleged link between populism and emotional communication has barely been subject to systematic empirical scrutiny. I use literature on populist communication and appraisal theory to generate expectations about which political parties use which emotional appeals. I test these claims by applying a novel emotional dictionary to a large set of text data including more than 700,000 press releases and tweets from three European countries. As expected, I find that populist parties use significantly more negative emotional appeals (anger, fear, disgust, sadness) and less positive emotional appeals (joy, enthusiasm, pride, hope) than mainstream parties. Furthermore, I find that political actors adapt the usage of emotional appeals to different purposes depending on the communication medium and the politicians' status level. This study entails important implications for the research on emotional appeals in politics and populist communication.","[{""name"": ""Tobias Widmann"", ""affiliation"": [""European University Institute Fiesole Italy""]}]","[""10.1017/S0003055416000770"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00561.x"", ""10.1080/10584609.2011.564605"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328522"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00130.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199760107.013.0006"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00353.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1080/10410236.2014.916777"", ""10.1007/s12193-012-0098-4"", ""10.1037/a0016904"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9056-y"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.48.4.384"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328525"", ""10.1111/spsr.12264"", ""10.1111/pops.12034"", ""10.1177/0267323119861875"", ""10.1007/s12144-013-9165-6"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790867"", ""10.1177/0093650216644026"", ""10.1177/0010414015575030"", ""10.1080/02699930802110007"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1111/jasp.12243"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226574431.003.0010"", ""10.1177/0010414018797942"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.887879"", ""10.1177/0093650213514599"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195130072.003.0003"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.01433"", ""10.1016/j.imr.2016.03.004"", ""10.2307/2938743"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145041"", ""10.1017/S002238160999079X"", ""10.1080/19331681.2018.1485608"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00819.x"", ""10.1177/0539018417734419"", ""10.1177/0160597618802521"", ""10.1080/10584609.2019.1631918"", ""10.1177/0146167208317771"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00621.x"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.48.4.813"", ""10.1525/si.2007.30.4.501"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000939"", ""10.30950/jcer.v12i2.709"", ""10.1111/pops.12439"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1177/1465116517698048""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12710,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Abstraction and Detail in Experimental Design,"AbstractPolitical scientists designing experiments often face the question of how abstract or detailed their experimental stimuli should be. Typically, this question is framed in terms of trade‐offs relating to experimental control and generalizability: the more context introduced into studies, the less control, and the more difficulty generalizing the results. Yet, we have reason to question this trade‐off, and there is relatively little systematic evidence to rely on when calibrating the degree of abstraction in studies. We make two contributions. First, we provide a theoretical framework that identifies and considers the consequences of three dimensions of abstraction in experimental design: situational hypotheticality, actor identity, and contextual detail. Second, we replicate and extend three survey experiments, varying these levels of abstraction. We find no evidence that situational hypotheticality substantively changes results in any of our studies, but do find that increased contextual detail dampens treatment effects, and that the salience of actor identities moderates results in our endorsement experiment.","[{""name"": ""Ryan Brutger"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California, Berkeley""]}, {""name"": ""Joshua D.

The challenges cluster around three democratic disfigurations: technocracy, populism, and plebiscitarianism—each have the potential to contribute to democratic decay. Still, they can also trigger pushback against illiberalism mobilizing citizens in defense of democracy, toward democratic resilience. This article looks at how the COVID-19 pandemic affects democratic decay and democratic resilience in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). It finds varied responses to the COVID-19 crisis by the CEE populist leaders and identifies two patterns: the rise of autocracy and democratic resilience. First, in Hungary and Poland, the populist leaders instrumentalized the state of emergency to increase executive aggrandizement. Second, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, democracy proved resilient. The COVID-19 pandemic alone is not fostering the rise of authoritarianism. However, it does accentuate existing democratic disfigurations.","[{""name"": ""Petra Guasti"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Sociology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Czechia, and University of Jena, Germany petraguasti@googlemail.com""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-40006-4"", ""10.1093/sf/sov120"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-40006-4"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726383"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.1156"", ""10.1017/S1537592718002165"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1328676"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726383"", ""10.1177/0010414013516069"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.1156"", ""10.1017/S0043887116000265"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1163/9789004385122_013"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000538"", ""10.30950/jcer.v15i4.1122"", ""10.1353/sor.2019.0005"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1328676"", ""10.30950/jcer.v15i4.1122"", ""10.1017/9781108692793.004"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1491401"", ""10.1177/0010414013516069"", ""10.1163/9789004385122_013"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1491401"", ""10.1093/sf/sov120"", ""10.1017/9781108692793.004"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1485015"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12038"", ""10.1017/S1537592719003955"", ""10.1017/S1537592719003955"", ""10.1017/S1537592718002165"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000538"", ""10.1353/sor.2019.0005"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12038"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1485015"", ""10.1017/S0043887116000265""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055419000844,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,The Geography of Inequality: How Land Use Regulation Produces Segregation,"Public goods in the United States are largely funded and delivered at the local level. Local public goods are valuable, but their production requires overcoming several collective action problems including coordinating supply and minimizing congestion, free-riding, and peer effects. Land use regulations, promulgated by local governments, allow communities to solve the collective action problems inherent in the provision of local public goods and maintenance of property values. A consequence of these efforts is residential segregation between cities along racial lines. I provide evidence that more stringent land use regulations are supported by whiter communities and that they preserve racial homogeneity. First, I show that cities that were whiter than their metropolitan area in 1970 are more likely to have restrictive land use patterns in 2006. Then, relying on Federal Fair Housing Act lawsuits to generate changes in land use policy, I show that restrictive land use helps to explain metropolitan area segregation patterns over time. Finally, I draw on precinct level initiative elections from several California cities to show that whiter neighborhoods are more supportive of restricting development. These results strongly suggest that even facially race-neutral land use policies have contributed to racial segregation.","[{""name"": ""JESSICA TROUNSTINE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/dem.2004.0002"", ""10.2307/2657496"", ""10.1086/250069"", ""10.4159/9780674036406"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226135250.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2096304"", ""10.1257/aer.98.3.843"", ""10.1017/S1742058X08080028"", ""10.1080/00420987520080301"", ""10.1086/522381"", ""10.1016/0047-2727(91)90027-Y"", ""10.2307/2061335"", ""10.1080/01944360008976094"", ""10.1017/9781108769495"", ""10.1093/restud/rdr048"", ""10.2307/795798"", ""10.1111/lapo.12022"", ""10.3386/w25699"", ""10.1162/003355397555361"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316027189"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2004.06.002"", ""10.1086/257839"", ""10.2307/3088879"", ""10.2307/2204656"", ""10.2307/1122776"", ""10.1093/qje/qjy007"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2018.01.006"", ""10.1177/0042098007087341"", ""10.1080/0042098032000165271"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100002"", ""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.3.1253"", ""10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2012.09.006"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9787.1994.tb00866.x"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2012.10.002"", ""10.1080/00420989320081651"", ""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.1.417"", ""10.1086/NTJ41792204"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.1.177"", ""10.1007/BF02761550"", ""10.1007/s12114-014-9201-2"", ""10.1017/9781108354943"", ""10.2307/2094181"", ""10.1177/1078087407305499"", ""10.1111/1467-985X.00190"", ""10.1525/sp.2006.53.2.248"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510595"", ""10.1086/687569"", ""10.1017/9781108277952"", ""10.4159/9780674041660"", ""10.1016/0166-0462(94)02059-0"", ""10.1093/aler/ahq015"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226924267.001.0001"", ""10.1093/qje/qjy006"", ""10.1017/9781108555722"", ""10.2307/2579183"", ""10.2307/1389798""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/pops.12768,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Psychological Correlates of Populist Attitudes,"Studies of demand‐side populism with a focus on attitudinal and behavioral factors are becoming more popular, but only a few have explored the phenomenon's psychological determinants. We tackle the lack of conversation between populism scholars and political psychologists and test the impact of conspiracy beliefs, moral disengagement, need for cognition, and belief in simple solutions on populist attitudes. We use the most widespread ideational definition in an attempt to bring clarity to demand‐side populism, as the literature often conflates the concept of populism with adjacent ideological and psychological factors. We analyze representative samples from two very different countries (Italy and Turkey) to test our hypotheses. We use two of the most often‐used measures of populist attitudes and also explore populism's individual building blocks: people‐centrism, antielitism, and a Manichean worldview. We consistently find conspiracy beliefs (and our control variable of institutional trust) as primary sources of populist attitudes, whereas the impact of the other psychological factors is more dependent on context and operationalization. Our article calls for more conceptual clarity, careful theorization, and more work on the refinement of available survey measures.

Using an underutilized data set on the conditions associated with World Bank loans, we find that borrower countries that vote with the United States at the United Nations are required to enact fewer domestic policy reforms, and on fewer and softer issue areas. Though U.S. preferences permeate World Bank decision making, we do not find evidence that borrower countries trade favors in exchange for active U.S. intervention on their behalf. Instead, we propose that U.S. influence operates indirectly when World Bank staff—consciously or unconsciously—design programs that are compatible with U.S. preferences. Our study provides novel evidence of World Bank conditionality and shows that politicized policies can result even from autonomous bureaucracies.","[{""name"": ""Richard Clark"", ""affiliation"": [""Columbia University""]}, {""name"": ""Lindsay R.

Scholarship on the topic has, however, remained deeply fragmented. It is discussed in separate silos of the literature – such as evidence-based policymaking, epistemic communities, and ideas and politics – and this has hindered sustained empirical study. This article argues that to stimulate more systematic research on the role that experts play in policymaking and develop a theoretical understanding of it, we need to foster dialogue across these literatures. To facilitate this, the article critically reviews how the role of expert knowledge in policymaking is conceptualised and explained in existing literatures, and offers suggestions about how to create common ground for future research by reframing research around the question of the influence of experts, and examining more closely the administrative underpinnings of expert influence.","[{""name"": ""Johan Christensen"", ""affiliation"": [""Leiden University, Netherlands""]}]",[],"['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Public Administration']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

In this article, we show that the target estimand of conjoint experiments, the average marginal component effect (AMCE), is not well defined in these terms. Even with individually rational experimental subjects, the AMCE can indicate the opposite of the true preference of the majority. To show this, we characterize the preference aggregation rule implied by the AMCE and demonstrate its several undesirable properties. With this result, we provide a method for placing bounds on the proportion of experimental subjects who prefer a given candidate feature. We describe conditions under which the AMCE corresponds in sign with the majority preference. Finally, we offer a structural interpretation of the AMCE and highlight that the problem we describe persists even when a model of voting is imposed.","[{""name"": ""Scott F.

10.1017/pan.2020.40,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Improving the External Validity of Conjoint Analysis: The Essential Role of Profile Distribution,"AbstractConjoint analysis has become popular among social scientists for measuring multidimensional preferences. When analyzing such experiments, researchers often focus on the average marginal component effect (AMCE), which represents the causal effect of a single profile attribute while averaging over the remaining attributes. What has been overlooked, however, is the fact that the AMCE critically relies upon the distribution of the other attributes used for the averaging. Although most experiments employ the uniform distribution, which equally weights each profile, both the actual distribution of profiles in the real world and the distribution of theoretical interest are often far from uniform. This mismatch can severely compromise the external validity of conjoint analysis. We empirically demonstrate that estimates of the AMCE can be substantially different when averaging over the target profile distribution instead of uniform. We propose new experimental designs and estimation methods that incorporate substantive knowledge about the profile distribution. We illustrate our methodology through two empirical applications, one using a real-world distribution and the other based on a counterfactual distribution motivated by a theoretical consideration. The proposed methodology is implemented through an open-source software package.","[{""name"": ""Brandon de la Cuesta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Naoki Egami"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kosuke Imai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1257/jep.12.2.91"", ""10.1086/692740"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.1287/inte.31.4.56.9676"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000165"", ""10.1198/016214502388618410"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.2307/2669291"", ""10.1037/h0037350"", ""10.1214/ss/1177012032"", ""10.1086/687324"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9494-0"", ""10.1080/01621459.2018.1476246"", ""10.1111/ajps.12138"", ""10.7910/DVN/O5PX0B"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9464-6"", ""10.1126/science.aag2147"", ""10.1214/10-AOAS355"", ""10.24433/CO.9475665.v1"", ""10.2307/2111716"", ""10.1080/10584609.2013.852643"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.1"", ""10.1111/ajps.12329"", ""10.2307/2669334"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000194"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9238-0"", ""10.7910/DVN/HVY5GR"", ""10.1214/11-AOS878"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000217"", ""10.1073/pnas.1808083115"", ""10.1111/ectj.12097""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'General Decision Sciences']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7409), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7377)]]"

However, out-group animosity may operate differently depending on the party or elite. We investigate the extent to which citizens’ animus toward (Democratically aligned) minority groups drove political support for Donald Trump, whose incendiary rhetoric regarding such groups is unique in modern presidential politics. Leveraging panel data beginning before Trump’s candidacy, we find that animus toward Democratic-linked groups in 2011 predicts future support for Trump regardless of party identity. This animus does not predict future support for other Republican or Democratic politicians or either party. Nor do we find that animus toward Republican groups predicts support for Democratic elites. Trump’s support is thus uniquely tied to animus toward minority groups. Our findings provide insights into the social divisions underlying American politics and the role of elite rhetoric in translating animus into political support.","[{""name"": ""LILLIANA MASON"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JULIE WRONSKI"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JOHN V.

We illustrate the potential for harnessing shared identities to mobilize resilient public responses against COVID‐19. Study 1 explored which patterns of social identification predicted protective behaviors (personal hygiene, physical distancing), prosocial actions (helping proximal and distal others), and psychological well‐being (mental well‐being, depressive symptoms, anxiety) among 560 U.K. adults surveyed during lockdown. Study 2 contrasted Prime Minister Ardern's use of identity‐based rhetoric to mobilize New Zealanders, with Prime Minister Johnson's use of individualistic appeals to the U.K. public. Our findings suggest how political leaders might beneficially use social identities in communications about extreme events. Highlights Political leaders seeking to mobilize cooperative, resilient public responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic should portray themselves and their followers as sharing multiple group identities. They should attribute collective agency and norms of solidarity to these groups. They should portray desired public behaviors as morally necessary acts of mutual helping, stemming from the “character” of the invoked group identities. They should show they have a personal stake in the political choices they make, as members of the groups affected.","[{""name"": ""Vivian L.

10.1162/glep_a_00594,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,Future-Proofing Capitalism: The Paradox of the Circular Economy for Plastics,"AbstractThe marine plastics crisis sparked a wave of corporate interest in the circular economy, a sustainable business model that aims to eliminate waste in industrial systems through recycling, reduction, reuse, and recovery. Drawing on debates about the role of corporations in global environmental governance, this article examines the rise of the circular economy as a dominant corporate sustainability concept, focusing on the flagship example of the circular economy for plastics. It argues that corporations across the plastics value chain have coordinated their efforts to contain the circular economy policy agenda, while extending their markets through developing risky circular economy technologies. These corporate strategies of containment and proliferation represent attempts to “future-proof” capitalism against existential threats to public legitimacy, masking the implications for environmental justice. The paradox of the circular economy is that it seems to offer radical challenges to linear “take-make-waste” models of industrial capitalism, backed by international legislation, but it does not actually give up on unsustainable growth. We need to tackle the plastics crisis at its root, dramatically reducing the global production of toxic and wasteful plastics.","[{""name"": ""Alice Mah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780195372946.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053540"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1pncqx2"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00454"", ""10.1177/0969776411420029"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.12.026"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.05.002"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-05463-2"", ""10.1080/03085147.2015.1013353"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2016.05.012"", ""10.2307/257008"", ""10.1002/fam.810110303"", ""10.1108/S1571-502720170000030003"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.041"", ""10.1039/9781839168888"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-53097-0"", ""10.1162/152638002320980632"", ""10.1002/bse.1817"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.04.017"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2018.10.162"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2744602"", ""10.1111/jiec.12597"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2693-2"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7479.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350218826"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2017.07.044"", ""10.1080/00130095.2020.1794809"", ""10.1177/0967010611399616"", ""10.59962/9780774832656""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Environmental Science']","['Strategy and Management', 'Pollution', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)]]"

Here, we provide a guide to help researchers navigate the consequential decisions they need to make before any measure can be produced from the text. We consider, both theoretically and empirically, the effects of such choices using as a running example efforts to measure the tone ofNew York Timescoverage of the economy. We show that two reasonable approaches to corpus selection yield radically different corpora and we advocate for the use of keyword searches rather than predefined subject categories provided by news archives. We demonstrate the benefits of coding using article segments instead of sentences as units of analysis. We show that, given a fixed number of codings, it is better to increase the number of unique documents coded rather than the number of coders for each document. Finally, we find that supervised machine learning algorithms outperform dictionaries on a number of criteria. Overall, we intend this guide to serve as a reminder to analysts that thoughtfulness and human validation are key to text-as-data methods, particularly in an age when it is all too easy to computationally classify texts without attending to the methodological choices therein.","[{""name"": ""Pablo Barberá"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amber E.

10.1093/ser/mwz018,SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology; 0201 Theoretical Economics; 0202 Applied Economics,Unequal policy responsiveness in the Netherlands,"Abstract Scholars have long recognized that equality in policy responsiveness is potentially undermined by the existence of economic inequality. However, there is still a lack of empirical research testing whether and how this actually occurs, especially outside of the USA. This study takes up the question whether unequal representation also exists in a country that is in some ways a least-likely case, namely the Netherlands. It does so by linking public opinion to policy on 291 potential policy changes between 1979 and 2012. This reveals, first, that policy responsiveness is much stronger for high incomes than for low or median incomes. Second, an exploration of the underlying causal mechanisms finds support for the role of political participation of wealthier versus poorer citizens, while the socioeconomic background of parliamentarians relative to the broader public does not seem to matter. Corporate lobbying may also contribute to unequal responsiveness.","[{""name"": ""Wouter Schakel"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands""]}]","[""10.4159/9780674984769"", ""10.1007/s11109-016-9368-2"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1308695"", ""10.1086/320036"", ""10.1257/jep.27.3.103"", ""10.1002/polq.12577"", ""10.1111/lsq.12110"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226075952.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400866939"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050311-165552"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226087283.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000533"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-010814-104523"", ""10.1177/1065912911427450"", ""10.1007/s41358-017-0097-9"", ""10.1017/S1537592715002315"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226162010.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.soscij.2012.09.006"", ""10.1089/elj.2013.0223"", ""10.2753/IJS0020-7659370401"", ""10.1016/0049-089X(92)90017-B"", ""10.1080/00344893.2012.653238"", ""10.1017/S1537592715002327"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001595"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00357.x"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001637"", ""10.1017/S000712341000013X"", ""10.1177/0010414006297169"", ""10.1017/S0003055406062083"", ""10.2307/2130588"", ""10.1057/iga.2012.20"", ""10.5771/9783845216515"", ""10.1017/S153759271200360X"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226509013.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.973260"", ""10.1177/0010414008330595"", ""10.1111/ajps.12007"", ""10.1017/S1537592715000079"", ""10.1017/S1755773918000036"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691154848.001.0001"", ""10.1093/poq/nfr053"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804908"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00478.x"", ""10.1017/psrm.2013.4"", ""10.1177/017084069201300402"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2004.00016.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511793806"", ""10.1017/S1537592709991770""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz241,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Japan 'Indo-Pacific' question: countering China or shaping a new regional order?,"Abstract Japan's primary objective of the ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ (FOIP) strategy is to shape and consolidate regional order in the Indo-Pacific region based on the existing rules-based international order. The concept initially aimed to achieve two different objectives—shaping a regional order in the Indo-Pacific and ensuring the defence of Japan; however, Japan has gradually shifted its strategic focus onto the former, separating national defence from the FOIP concept, which reflects a change in the degree of its commitment to the two objectives. On the one hand, as its overall security strategy, Japan has determined to steadily enhance its national defence by increasing its own defence capabilities and strengthening the US–Japan alliance, while transforming its partnerships with like-minded states, such as Australia and India, into a diplomatic, and potentially military, alignment. This has been brought about by shifts in the regional balance of power, particularly the rise of China and the relative decline of the United States. On the other hand, as part of its FOIP strategy, Japan's attempts to build a new regional order in the Indo-Pacific region aim to defend the existing rules-based order established by the United States from challengers, particularly China. Yet, given the strategic uncertainty over Japan's international coalition-building efforts to create a new regional order, Japan has made its approach flexible; Tokyo is using its ambiguous FOIP concept to gauge other states' responses, understand their perspectives, and change its strategic emphases accordingly—so-called ‘tactical hedging’. Japan has pursued similar means to achieve the two key objectives. Nevertheless, the country's core interest, the defence of Japan, is more imperative than building a regional order in the Indo-Pacific region, and Japan faces different types of challenges in the future.","[{""name"": ""Kei Koga"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0007123417000655,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,"Violence, Empathy and Altruism: Evidence from the Ivorian Refugee Crisis in Liberia","In regions plagued by reoccurring periods of war, violence and displacement, how does past exposure to violence affect altruism toward members of different ethnic or religious groups? Drawing on theories of empathy-driven altruism in psychology, this article proposes that violence can increase individuals’ capacity to empathize with others, and that empathy born of violence can in turn motivate helping behavior across group boundaries. This hypothesis is tested using data on the hosting behavior of roughly 1,500 Liberians during the 2010–11 Ivorian refugee crisis in eastern Liberia, a region with a long history of cross-border, inter-ethnic violence. Consistent with its theoretical predictions, the study finds that those who experienced violence during the Liberian civil war host greater numbers of refugees, exhibit stronger preferences for distressed refugees and less bias against outgroup refugees, and host a higher proportion of non-coethnic, non-coreligious and distressed refugees. These findings suggest that violence does not necessarily lead to greater antagonism toward outgroups, as is often assumed, and that in some circumstances it can actually promote inter-group co-operation.","[{""name"": ""Alexandra C.

Results from the cross‐quantilogram approach indicate that bitcoin and gold are weak hedges. Analysis from the recursive sampling shows that each of bitcoin, gold and VIX futures has a time‐varying hedging role in some BRICS countries, which has been shaped by the COVID‐19 outbreak. Results from the conditional diversification benefits show appealing roles for the three alternative assets for investors in BRICS stock markets. However, gold appears to have higher and more stable diversification benefits in China, especially during the COVID‐19 outbreak.

10.1017/S0260210519000317,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,"Images, emotions, and international politics: the death of Alan Kurdi","AbstractHow are images, emotions, and international politics connected? This article develops a theoretical framework contributing to visuality and emotions research in International Relations. Correcting the understanding that images cause particular emotional responses, this article claims that emotionally laden responses to images should be seen as performed in foreign policy discourses. We theorise images as objects of interpretation and contestation, and emotions as socially constituted rather than as individual ‘inner states’. Emotional bundling – the coupling of different emotions in discourse – helps constitute political subjectivities that both politicise and depoliticise. Through emotional bundling political leaders express their experiences of feelings shared by all humans, and simultaneously articulate themselves in authoritative and gendered subject positions such as ‘the father’. We illustrate the value of our framework by analysing the photographs of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian-Kurdish boy who drowned in September 2015. ‘Kurdi’ became an instant global icon of the Syrian refugee crisis. World leaders expressed their personal grief and determination to act, but within a year, policies adopted with direct reference to Kurdi's tragic death changed from an open-door approach to attempts to stop refugees from arriving. A discursive-performative approach opens up new avenues for research on visuality, emotionality, and world politics.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Adler-Nissen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katrine Emilie Andersen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lene Hansen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1354066117745365"", ""10.1177/0891243205278639"", ""10.1177/0163443717726163"", ""10.1080/14616742.2016.1207463"", ""10.1080/15295036.2017.1408958"", ""10.1177/0163443717729212"", ""10.1177/0163443717725572"", ""10.21013/jems.v3.n1.p9"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jird.1800091"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1290129"", ""10.1057/9780230244375"", ""10.1080/14616740802567808"", ""10.1093/ips/oly036"", ""10.1002/j.1538-165X.2012.tb00731.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00443.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00655.x"", ""10.1093/isr/vix033"", ""10.1177/0967010607078529"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-65575-8_9"", ""10.1017/S0260210508007821"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy030"", ""10.1080/03050629.2015.1051620"", ""10.1093/isr/vix033"", ""10.1068/d2506jb"", ""10.1017/S0260210517000183"", ""10.4324/9781315856506"", ""10.1111/amet.12558"", ""10.1073/pnas.1613977114"", ""10.1177/0956797617741107"", ""10.1080/14608944.2016.1256982"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316154670"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7717.1994.tb00310.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00627.x"", ""10.1177/1354066110388593"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000144"", ""10.1093/ia/iix048"", ""10.1046/j.0020-8833.2003.00277.x"", ""10.1080/10361146.2013.840769"", ""10.1162/016228800560327""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Does it generate affinity for donor countries and the values they espouse? This article answers these questions in the context of Chinese aid to Africa and the competing aid regime of the United States. The study combines data on thirty-eight African countries from Afrobarometer, AidData, and the Aid Information Management Systems of African finance and planning ministries. The authors use spatial difference-in-differences to isolate the causal effects of Chinese and US aid. The study finds that Chinese aid to Africa does not increase (and may in fact reduce) beneficiaries’ support for China. By contrast, US aid appears to increase support for the United States and to strengthen recipients’ commitment to liberal democratic values, such as the belief in the importance of elections. Chinese aid does not appear to weaken this commitment, and may strengthen it. The study also finds that Chinese aid increases support for the UK, France and other former colonial powers. These findings advance our understanding of the conditions under which competing aid regimes generate soft power and facilitate the transmission of political principles and ideals.","[{""name"": ""Robert A.

10.1111/psj.12254,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Experimentalist Governance with Interactive Central-Local Relations: Making New Pension Policies in China,"Although regional policy experimentation has become a global trend, the distinct features of experimentalist governance in a given country, such as China, remains to be investigated. This article extends policy process theory by proposing the framework of experimentalist governance with interactive central–local relations or Chinese‐style experimentalist governance, which combines three features. First, policy goals and instruments are formed separately and interactively by the central and local governments. Second, the central government is burdened with its own concerns about policy performance for maintaining authority and legitimacy. Third, the evaluation of policy pilots relies primarily on the responses of local governments. We further conceptualize three new patterns of experimentalist governance in China, namely, “comparative trial,” “selective recognition,” and “adaptive reconciliation,” in addition to “hierarchical experimentation.” These patterns are illustrated with case studies on four pension policies in China, which are for public sector employees, urban employees, rural residents, and migrant workers.","[{""name"": ""Xufeng Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hui Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1068/c40m"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000076"", ""10.1353/wp.2007.0005"", ""10.1561/100.00008039"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.882972"", ""10.1177/0020852306064613"", ""10.1086/683210"", ""10.1111/1468-0386.00034"", ""10.1002/pad.1688"", ""10.2307/3182148"", ""10.1007/BF02686277"", ""10.1257/aer.104.10.3038"", ""10.1111/1467-9515.00180"", ""10.1007/s12116-007-9014-4"", ""10.1086/tcj.59.20066378"", ""10.1163/9781684171163"", ""10.1017/S0305741013001057"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510243"", ""10.1007/BF00540219"", ""10.1111/1467-9515.00130"", ""10.1002/pad.1687"", ""10.1257/jep.25.3.17"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-041811-150032"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000580"", ""10.1086/677058"", ""10.1017/S0305741005000500"", ""10.1353/wp.1995.0003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8500.2012.00761.x"", ""10.1111/1467-8500.12033"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808678"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01133.x"", ""10.1002/pad.1682"", ""10.1353/jod.2012.0008"", ""10.2307/4146945"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2008.00415.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199560530.013.0012"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01157.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-246X.2008.00316.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9299.00292"", ""10.1108/01443331011054217"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9515.2006.00533.x"", ""10.1080/17516234.2011.574960"", ""10.1332/147084411X581899"", ""10.1111/1467-9779.00096"", ""10.1017/S0305741014000630"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00185.x"", ""10.1504/IJSD.2012.044039"", ""10.1177/0097700409335381"", ""10.2307/2667589"", ""10.1080/08959420.2012.735159"", ""10.1257/jel.49.4.1076"", ""10.1353/chn.2016.0026"", ""10.1596/9780821388488_CH06"", ""10.1177/0097700409347970"", ""10.1086/671335"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.798028"", ""10.1080/23812346.2016.1166903"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv025""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

We explore the increased centrality of platforms in two ways. First, we measure the extent to which platforms are insinuating themselves into the economy. We accomplish this by analyzing the presence of platforms as intermediating organizations across all US service industries at the six-digit North American Industry Classification System code level. Our results show that 70% of service industries, representing over 5.2 million establishments, are potentially affected by one or more platforms. Secondly, we undertake a detailed firm-level case study of the mega-platform, Amazon, which demonstrates the ways that the aforementioned macro-level data is expressed by a single platform firm. This case study shows that Amazon’s growth trajectory has resulted in it entering and transforming existing industries and sectors. We conclude by reflecting upon the limitations and implications for future research.","[{""name"": ""Martin Kenney"", ""affiliation"": [""Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy (BRIE) and the Department of Human Ecology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Dafna Bearson"", ""affiliation"": [""BRIE and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1234, USA and""]}, {""name"": ""John Zysman"", ""affiliation"": [""BRIE, CITRIS and the Banatao Institute, and the Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1234, USA""]}]","[""10.1287/isre.2016.0648"", ""10.2200/S00193ED1V01Y200905CAC006"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080315-015334"", ""10.1002/smj.935"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2017.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.06.012"", ""10.1080/24701475.2019.1593667"", ""10.1016/j.infoandorg.2018.03.001"", ""10.1002/smj.2904"", ""10.1287/mksc.1110.0656"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.07.056"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsaa001"", ""10.1002/hec.3888"", ""10.1177/1464884917725163"", ""10.1787/53e5f593-en"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1050.0400"", ""10.1177/1461444816661553"", ""10.1177/0032329219838932"", ""10.1111/0022-1082.00200"", ""10.1162/154247603322493212"", ""10.22381/JSME4320161"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1997.tb03810.x"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7<509::AID-SMJ882>3.0.CO;2-Z"", ""10.1287/isre.1100.0323"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190889760.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199970773.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0308518X18778038"", ""10.1509/jmr.15.0204"", ""10.1002/smj.2932""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1162/glep_a_00668,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,The Security-Sustainability Nexus: Lithium Onshoring in the Global North,"Abstract The political economy of lithium, a “critical mineral” for the renewable energy transition, is marked by two striking developments. First, Global North governments that have historically offshored mining are onshoring lithium to enhance “supply chain security.” Second, these governments have committed to “sustainably sourcing” lithium. In this article, I theorize both developments in terms of a novel security–sustainability nexus: an interlocking set of policies and justifications that promote lithium extraction and emphasize the environmental credentials of Global North mining. The security–sustainability nexus evidences an alignment between state and corporate interests. For public officials, onshoring policies counter China’s “dominance” over battery supply chains. For mining and auto firms, onshoring translates into lucrative incentives, supply security, and reputational benefits. However, despite this state–corporate alignment, the tensions within the security–sustainability nexus illuminate the contradictions of green capitalism. I conclude that the geopolitical and socioenvironmental conflicts over the material foundations of the energy transition are reshaping the inequalities linked to extractive sectors.","[{""name"": ""Thea Riofrancos"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/glep_a_00640"", ""10.1016/j.exis.2020.01.008"", ""10.4135/9781848607880.n14"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.09.019"", ""10.4159/9780674989580"", ""10.1111/gec3.12580"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.06.001"", ""10.1177/0309132513493379"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106824"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226297958.001.0001"", ""10.1038/s41467-020-18402-y"", ""10.1016/j.resourpol.2016.12.005"", ""10.4324/9781315687698"", ""10.1126/science.aaz1014"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816677849.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780429434136-14"", ""10.1787/f262b91c-en"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102382"", ""10.1080/03932729.2020.1786926"", ""10.7591/9781501714610"", ""10.1038/s41467-020-18661-9"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120838"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102303"", ""10.1111/polp.12365"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348"", ""10.5382/Rev.18.14"", ""10.1080/13563467.2020.1810215"", ""10.1016/j.exis.2021.100932"", ""10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101912"", ""10.1080/10455758809358356"", ""10.4337/9781788978057.00033"", ""10.1080/13563467.2019.1581152"", ""10.1007/s13563-021-00254-7"", ""10.1017/9781108966009.006"", ""10.1093/jiel/jgz036"", ""10.1111/anti.12539"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102104"", ""10.1016/j.exis.2017.02.003"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-8679-2_2"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/769/4/042018"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112566"", ""10.1016/j.oneear.2020.10.012""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1093/isr/viz033,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,The International Trade Regime and the Quest for Free Digital Trade,"AbstractThe global economy is experiencing the digitalization of production, exchange, and consumption of goods and services. The internet and cross-border data flows are becoming important channels of trade as more products are traded through the web or integrate features that rely on digital connectivity. Reflecting the autonomy states have to enact such policies, national variations in internet governance have expanded over the previous decade, with states increasingly looking to use internet and data policies for economic and trade objectives. These dynamics are having important implications on the international trade regime through challenging existing trade rules and creating demands for new rules. This has resulted in growing debates in the trade arena around “digital trade,” as a number of states, led by the United States, push for rules as a way to discipline national internet policies and support trade in digital goods and services. This paper examines the political economy of this campaign. We argue that the objectives of this campaign go beyond updating rules to better fit the “Internet age” into achieving further liberalization of trade in goods and services. We highlight the technological contingency of existing international rules and show how technological shifts have been a driver of competitive regime creation and forum shifting contributing to processes of fragmentation of the international trade regime.","[{""name"": ""Shamel Azmeh"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Manchester""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher Foster"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Manchester""]}, {""name"": ""Jaime Echavarri"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Sheffield""]}]","[""10.1111/spsr.12059"", ""10.1177/2053168016658919"", ""10.1016/j.npls.2016.01.001"", ""10.1109/SERVICES.2014.83"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2014.06.006"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1269658"", ""10.1080/13501760600837443"", ""10.1177/2053951716679678"", ""10.1177/1465116508095151"", ""10.1017/bap.2017.16"", ""10.1080/00130095.2017.1350104"", ""10.2307/2297852"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027569"", ""10.1017/S1537592709090069"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.927387"", ""10.1093/jiel/jgy024"", ""10.1017/S0020818303574069"", ""10.1093/0195130529.003.0003"", ""10.1002/app5.60"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3005148"", ""10.1007/s11558-014-9188-2"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262014595.001.0001"", ""10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0025"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2004.00636.x"", ""10.1111/twec.12076"", ""10.1057/cep.2012.35"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252039126.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818304582036"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491665"", ""10.1080/13562570701722089"", ""10.1093/yel/24.1.463"", ""10.1162/002081802320005504"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000537"", ""10.4324/9780203607725"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511494543.023"", ""10.1080/13501760600837104""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This review takes stock of political science debates on nationalism to critically assess what we already know and what we still need to know. We begin by synthesizing classic debates and tracing the origins of the current consensus that nations are historically contingent and socially constructed. We then highlight three trends in contemporary nationalism scholarship: ( a) comparative historical research that treats nationalism as a macropolitical force and excavates the relationships between nations, states, constitutive stories, and political conflict; ( b) behavioral research that uses survey data and experiments to gauge the causes and effects of attachment to nations; and ( c) ethnographic scholarship that illuminates the everyday processes and practices that perpetuate national belonging. The penultimate section briefly summarizes relevant insights from philosophy, history, and social psychology and identifies knowledge gaps that political scientists are well-positioned to address. A final section calls for more comparative, cross-disciplinary, cross-regional research on nationalism.","[{""name"": ""Harris Mylonas"", ""affiliation"": [""Elliott School of International Affairs

10.1093/ia/iiz223,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Indonesia and the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific,"Abstract Indonesia has taken a leadership role within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in drafting a common outlook on the Indo-Pacific concept. The widening of Indonesia's geostrategic canvas from the Asia–Pacific to the Indo-Pacific is in line with President Joko Widodo's intent to make Indonesia a Global Maritime Fulcrum (GMF). In view of the rivalry between the US and China and the emergence of various Indo-Pacific initiatives from other countries, Indonesia believes that ASEAN must try to maintain its centrality. The draft of Indonesia's perspective for an ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific: towards a peaceful, prosperous, and inclusive region was submitted for considerations by ASEAN, and after 18 months of intensive lobbying by Indonesia the concept was finally adopted at the ASEAN Summit in June 2019. The ASEAN outlook promotes the principles of openness, inclusiveness, transparency, respect for international law and ASEAN centrality in the Indo-Pacific region. It proposes a building-block approach, seeking commonalities between existing regional initiatives in which ASEAN-led mechanisms will act as a fulcrum for both norm-setting and concrete cooperation. Rather than creating a new regional architecture, the East Asia Summit (EAS) is proposed as the platform for advancing the Indo-Pacific discourse and cooperation. Indonesia's ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific marks its renewed foreign policy activism as a middle power and underlines the continuing importance that Indonesia places on ASEAN as the cornerstone of its foreign policy, emphasising ASEAN's centrality as the primary vehicle for managing relations with the major powers in the Indo-Pacific region.","[{""name"": ""Dewi Fortuna Anwar"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12692,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,How Terrorism Does (and Does Not) Affect Citizens' Political Attitudes: A Meta-Analysis,"AbstractHow does terrorism affect citizens’ political attitudes? Over the years, many scholars have tried to answer this question. This article performs a meta‐analysis on this literature, reviewing about 325 studies conducted between 1985 and 2020 on more than 400,000 respondents. The findings confirm that terrorism is associated—to a small but significant extent—with outgroup hostility, political conservatism and rally‐‘round‐the‐flag effects. At the same time, the effects of terrorism vary widely, with studies on Islamist violence, conducted in the United States or Israel, and using cross‐sectional data yielding stronger results on average. Finally, the review reveals remaining gaps in this field of study, including a lack of research on non‐Islamist violence or conducted in non‐Western contexts. Taken together, this meta‐analysis consolidates existing evidence, determines which results hold across contexts, and identifies key gaps in our current knowledge. Its data can also be accessed interactively via a Shiny App.","[{""name"": ""Amélie Godefroidt"", ""affiliation"": [""Norwegian University of Science and Technology""]}]","[""10.1073/pnas.2007977117"", ""10.1007/s11127-016-0370-3"", ""10.1080/00207594.2012.695075"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aao5948"", ""10.1002/ejsp.43"", ""10.1257/jep.30.3.249"", ""10.1111/jasp.12296"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000957"", ""10.1002/9780470743386"", ""10.1038/s41562-019-0747-7"", ""10.1111/pops.12384"", ""10.1027/1016-9040/a000158"", ""10.1111/asap.12186"", ""10.1177/0146167217752118"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00822.x"", ""10.1002/9781118957813"", ""10.1037/a0032968"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00054.x"", ""10.1111/pops.12025"", ""10.1002/ejsp.294"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2017.09.008"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12362"", ""10.1126/sciadv.1700812"", ""10.1007/s11127-011-9895-7"", ""10.1177/0022002718770522"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990910"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.069"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.58.2.308"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00514.x"", ""10.7312/hoff17476"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990360"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00295"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00144.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12329"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edaa037"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339"", ""10.1521/soco.2017.35.4.324"", ""10.1080/00224545.2015.1119669"", ""10.1080/10781910802589899"", ""10.1162/isec.2006.31.1.49"", ""10.1093/poq/nfm033"", ""10.1037/a0019086"", ""10.1016/bs.aesp.2018.12.001"", ""10.1177/0146167204267988"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12342"", ""10.1177/0022002712459711"", ""10.1086/669605"", ""10.1080/09636412.2019.1551568"", ""10.1111/sjop.12463"", ""10.1177/1474704918764578"", ""10.1177/0022002715595698"", ""10.1111/pops.12571"", ""10.1093/isq/sqaa034"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226520568.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1955610"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2007.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2009.04.013"", ""10.1111/pops.12679"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2019.102047"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619"", ""10.1093/poq/nfl029"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751"", ""10.1111/pops.12190"", ""10.4324/9780429351549-6"", ""10.1080/10510974.2011.533599"", ""10.1037/10478-000"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2014.872023"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.4.681"", ""10.1037/pspp0000169"", ""10.1207/s15324834basp2703_6"", ""10.1177/0002764209338786"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01911"", ""10.1207/s15324834basp2804_11"", ""10.1111/j.1530-2415.2002.00024.x"", ""10.1111/pops.12575"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edz014"", ""10.1017/S0020818319000341"", ""10.3758/s13428-012-0261-6"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12380"", ""10.1080/15205436.2017.1342131"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1177/0956797615615584""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz224,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Evasive balancing: India's unviable Indo-Pacific strategy,"Abstract India has adopted the Indo-Pacific concept with uncharacteristic speed. This article examines India's Indo-Pacific strategy, which evolved out of its earlier ‘Look East’ and ‘Act East’ policies but is much more focused on strategic concerns than on trade or connectivity. As such, the strategy is subset of its China policy, and includes contradictory elements of balancing China by building partnerships with the United States as well as with regional powers, while simultaneously pursuing a reassurance strategy to convince Beijing that India is not really balancing China. The combination of these contradictory elements is characterized as evasive balancing, which is a more useful concept than either pure balancing or hedging for understanding the policies of India and of many other countries in the region that are trying to manage China's rise. However, reassurance strategies rarely work and the combination of balancing and reassurance is even less likely to be viable.","[{""name"": ""Rajesh Rajagopalan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Development']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiaa135,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Why the COVID-19 response needs International Relations,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic affects all countries, but how governments respond is dictated by politics. Amid this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to coordinate advice to states and offer ongoing management of the outbreak. Given the political drivers of COVID-19, we argue this is an important moment to advance International Relations knowledge as a necessary and distinctive method for inclusion in the WHO repertoire of knowledge inputs for epidemic control. Historical efforts to assert technical expertise over politics is redundant and outdated: the WHO has always been politicized by member states. We suggest WHO needs to embrace the politics and engage foreign policy and diplomatic expertise. We suggest practical examples of the entry points where International Relations methods can inform public health decision-making and technical policy coordination. We write this as a primer for those working in response to COVID-19 in WHO, multilateral organizations, donor financing departments, governments and international non-governmental organizations, to embrace political analysis rather than shy away from it. Coordinated political cooperation is vital to overcome COVID-19.","[{""name"": ""Sara E Davies"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clare Wenham"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/isr/viz052,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Is Global Governance Fragmented, Polycentric, or Complex? The State of the Art of the Network Approach","AbstractInternational institutions such as treaties and organizations shape, and are shaped by, the large web-like architecture of global governance. Yet we know little about what this architecture looks like, why certain structures are observed, and how they are linked to the functioning of international institutions as well as the overall effectiveness of global governance. Over the past decade, network science has emerged as a promising and indispensable approach to unraveling structural nuances and complexities of the system of international institutions. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of this emerging field of research and seeks to stimulate its further development. In this article, I draw connections between various network analyses of global governance that are found in different bodies of literature. In so doing, I integrate three separate but overlapping strands of work on institutional fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity and bring much-needed conceptual clarity to the debate. Building on previous studies, I propose a framework for operationalizing fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity in network terms in order to enable systematic and comparative analysis of global governance systems. This article argues that there is much potential in the network approach and makes a case for advancing the “network science of global governance.”","[{""name"": ""Rakhyun E Kim"", ""affiliation"":

10.1017/S0003055420000544,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Which Identity Frames Boost Support for and Mobilization in the #BlackLivesMatter Movement? An Experimental Test,"The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has organized hundreds of disruptive protests in American cities since 2013 (Garza 2014; Harris 2015; Taylor 2016). The movement has garnered considerable attention from the U.S. media and is well recognized by the U.S. public (Horowitz and Livingston 2016; Neal 2017). Social movement scholars suggest that such robust mobilizations are typically predicated on clear social movement frames (Benford and Snow 2000; Snow et al. 1986). Tillery (2019b) has identified several distinct message frames within the social media communications of BLM activists. In this paper, we use a survey experiment to test the effect of three of these frames—Black Nationalist, Feminist, and LGBTQ+ Rights—on the mobilization of African Americans. We find that exposure to these frames generates differential effects on respondents’ willingness to support, trust, canvass, and write representatives about the Black Lives Matter movement. These findings raise new questions about the deployment of intersectional messaging strategies within movements for racial justice.","[{""name"": ""TABITHA BONILLA"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ALVIN B.

10.1111/ajps.12495,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Unprincipled Principals: Co-opted Bureaucrats and Corruption in Ghana,"AbstractIn theory, granting politicians tools to oversee bureaucrats can reduce administrative malfeasance. In contrast, I argue that the political control of bureaucrats can increase corruption when politicians need money to fund election campaigns and face limited institutional constraints. In such contexts, politicians can leverage their discretionary powers to incentivize bureaucrats to extract rents from the state on politicians' behalf. Using data from an original survey of bureaucrats (N = 864) across 80 randomly sampled local governments in Ghana, I show that bureaucrats are more likely to facilitate politicians' corrupt behavior when politicians are perceived to be empowered with higher levels of discretionary control. Using qualitative data and a list experiment to demonstrate the mechanism, I show that politicians enact corruption by threatening to transfer noncompliant officers. My findings provide new evidence on the sources of public administrative deficiencies in developing countries and qualify the presumption that greater political oversight improves governance.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Brierley"", ""affiliation"": [""London School of Economics and Political Science""]}]","[""10.1257/aer.99.4.1278"", ""10.1515/9781400845354-029"", ""10.1515/9781626371118"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr048"", ""10.1080/01621459.2015.1050028"", ""10.1080/14662043.2012.642121"", ""10.1080/02589001.2012.701844"", ""10.1086/687209"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt008"", ""10.1086/345578"", ""10.1353/jod.2008.0029"", ""10.1561/100.00013098"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.2307/2657374"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.2.703"", ""10.1257/aer.101.4.1274"", ""10.1111/gove.12035"", ""10.1525/9780520918665"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139628983"", ""10.1093/pan/mpv034"", ""10.1111/ajps.12186"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065185"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000648"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000502"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00183"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00536"", ""10.1257/pol.20140258"", ""10.1080/714000118"", ""10.4324/9781003000372"", ""10.2307/2110792"", ""10.1257/pol.20140188"", ""10.1017/S0022278X08003224"", ""10.1177/0010414017710268"", ""10.1086/517935"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917"", ""10.1353/jod.2008.0036"", ""10.1257/aer.98.2.201"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.02.006"", ""10.3138/9781487575540"", ""10.1111/ajps.12205"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316412404"", ""10.2307/2118402"", ""10.1257/089533005774357860"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00092-4"", ""10.1080/00220388208421833"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000351""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Recent studies, however, suggest that childhood vaccine misinformation is either more common among Republicans, or is uninfluenced by partisan identification (PID). Uncertainty about the partisan underpinnings of vaccine misinformation acceptance is important, as it could complicate efforts to pursue pro-vaccine health policies. I theorize that Republicans should be more likely to endorse anti-vaccine misinformation, as they tend to express more-negative views toward scientific experts. Across six demographically and nationally representative surveys, I find that—while few Americans think that “anti-vaxxers” are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats—Republican PID is significantly associated with the belief that childhood vaccines can cause autism. Consistent with theoretical expectations, effect is strongly mediated by anti-expert attitudes—an effect which supplemental panel analyses suggest is unlikely to be reverse causal.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Motta"", ""affiliation"": [""Oklahoma State University System, Stillwater, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/pops.12665"", ""10.1017/S0022381608090014"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0823-z"", ""10.1177/2333794X19862949"", ""10.1177/1529100618760521"", ""10.1080/10570314.2018.1510136"", ""10.1007/s10584-012-0403-y"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112407"", ""10.1177/0738894208097666"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9310-z"", ""10.1177/2053168018822174"", ""10.1521/soco.2017.35.4.354"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31558-0"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139094009"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.04.063"", ""10.1177/0003122412438225"", ""10.1093/sf/sov040"", ""10.1177/0002716209351526"", ""10.1017/S1049096512000686"", ""10.1037/hea0000586"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00230"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000604"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.1177/1532673X17745342"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.01.003"", ""10.1080/13669877.2016.1148067"", ""10.1038/nnano.2008.341"", ""10.1086/684611"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.12.022"", ""10.1177/0263276409356001"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2011.01198.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000113"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz053"", ""10.1017/S000842392000058X"", ""10.1111/ajps.12234"", ""10.1177/1532673X17719507"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.060"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-67744-6"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.06.032"", ""10.1080/21565503.2021.1932528"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1002578"", ""10.1177/0002716216662639"", ""10.1111/pops.12741"", ""10.1093/isq/sqv012"", ""10.1177/0891243214532711"", ""10.1177/0146167217741314"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2020.305828"", ""10.37016/mr-2020-007"", ""10.1177/147470491000800406"", ""10.1111/pops.12681"", ""10.1037/ebs0000075""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Additionally, we published an R package to semi-automate this quota sampling process using the Facebook Marketing API. To test the method, we used Facebook advertisements to quota sample 2432 US respondents for a survey on climate change public opinion. We conducted a contemporaneous nationally representative survey asking identical questions using a high-quality online survey panel whose respondents were recruited using probability sampling. Many results from the Facebook-sampled survey are similar to those from the online panel survey; furthermore, results from the Facebook-sampled survey approximate results from the American Community Survey (ACS) for a set of validation questions.

What do we know about how private authority and public policy interact? What are the implications of answering this question for understanding support for, and effects of, policy development generally? The purpose of this article is to reflect on these questions by introducing, and reviewing, a special issue that challenges explicit claims, and implicit methodologies, that treat private and public governance realms as distinct and/or static. We do so by advancing a theoretical and conceptual framework with which to explore how the contributions to this special issue enhance an understanding about governance interactions across a range of empirical, sectoral, and regional domains. We specifically introduce the concept of governance spheres to capture the proliferation of issue domains denoted by highly fluid interactions across public and private governance boundaries.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Cashore"", ""affiliation"": [""Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy National University of Singapore  Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Jette Steen Knudsen"", ""affiliation"": [""The Fletcher School Tufts University  Somerville Massachusetts USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jeremy Moon"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Management, Society and Communication Copenhagen Business School  Frederiksberg Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Hamish van der Ven"", ""affiliation"": [""Bieler School of Environment and Department of Political Science McGill University  Montreal Canada""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139979696"", ""10.1515/9781400830732.44"", ""10.1007/s11558-010-9092-3"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.09.007"", ""10.1162/glep.2010.10.2.25"", ""10.1162/glep.2009.9.2.52"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx014"", ""10.1111/rego.12066"", ""10.1111/rego.12034"", ""10.1111/rego.12075"", ""10.1016/S0895-9935(05)14007-8"", ""10.1086/518871"", ""10.1111/rego.12051"", ""10.1080/09692290903173087"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107281837.009"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262035620.003.0009"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2007.00021.x"", ""10.1017/S0260210516000425"", ""10.1162/glep.2009.9.4.14"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2010.01076.x"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275684"", ""10.1111/1468-0491.00199"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106689"", ""10.1016/j.forpol.2011.12.005"", ""10.1111/rego.12053"", ""10.1525/cmr.2014.56.2.130"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262034951.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9203.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2095101"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i1.794"", ""10.1177/1354066109345056"", ""10.1111/rego.12096"", ""10.1111/rego.12030"", ""10.1068/a45202"", ""10.1111/rego.12055"", ""10.1111/rego.12185"", ""10.1111/rego.12354"", ""10.1515/9781400848669"", ""10.1111/rego.12005"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00353"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001442"", ""10.1017/S0143814X08000755"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0269-8"", ""10.1177/1086026619858874"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu031"", ""10.1017/S1537592710004068"", ""10.1017/9781316224908"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025931"", ""10.1111/rego.12390"", ""10.1002/bse.380"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139381840"", ""10.1162/152638001316881395"", ""10.1111/rego.12356"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198278528.001.0001"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.31193458"", ""10.5465/amr.2019.0348"", ""10.2202/1469-3569.1325"", ""10.4324/9781849774925"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9078.001.0001"", ""10.5840/beq201222333"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12393.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1477-7053.00106"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199592173.003.0010"", ""10.1038/35016500"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01133.x"", ""10.1111/rego.12180"", ""10.4337/9781849809313"", ""10.1017/S0020818304582036"", ""10.1111/rego.12332"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00292"", ""10.1163/19426720-02001002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198295457.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00950.x"", ""10.1111/joms.12203"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3198-3"", ""10.1007/s11077-013-9177-y"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106445"", ""10.1177/0952076716652934"", ""10.1111/rego.12026"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.141706""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"
10.1162/isec_a_00374,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,Paradoxes of Professionalism: Rethinking Civil-Military Relations in the United States,"The U.S. military's prevailing norms of professionalism exhibit three paradoxes that render the organization poorly suited to meet contemporary challenges to its nonpartisan ethic, and that undermine its relations with civilian leaders. These norms, based on Samuel Huntington's objective civilian control model, argue that the military should operate in a sphere separate from the civilian domain of policymaking and decisions about the use of force. The first paradox is that Huntingtonian norms, though intended to prevent partisan and political behavior by military personnel, can also enable these activities. Second, the norms promote civilian leaders’ authority in decisionmaking related to the use of force, yet undermine their practical control and oversight of military activity. Third, they contribute to the military's operational and tactical effectiveness, while corroding the United States’ strategic effectiveness in armed conflict. These tensions in Huntington's norms matter today because of intensifying partisanship in society and in the military, the embrace by civilian leaders of objective control and their concomitant delegation of authority in armed conflict to the military, and growing questions about the causes of the inconclusive outcomes of the United States’ recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is time to develop a new framework for military professionalism.","[{""name"": ""Risa Brooks"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.orbis.2013.05.010"", ""10.1177/0095327X9602300203"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.211"", ""10.1080/00396330600905510"", ""10.1016/j.orbis.2017.11.010"", ""10.1111/psq.12006"", ""10.1177/0095327X17737498"", ""10.1177/0095327X15594450"", ""10.1177/0095327X17715437"", ""10.1177/0095327X7700400107"", ""10.1017/S0003055400124177"", ""10.2307/2953969"", ""10.2307/2127050"", ""10.1080/00396338.2010.522104"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00033"", ""10.1177/0095327X16662541"", ""10.1080/03071847.2016.1236472"", ""10.1177/0095327X17747205"", ""10.1177/0095327X16687067"", ""10.1016/j.orbis.2008.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.orbis.2008.01.005""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1111/rego.12220,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,"Governing sustainable palm oil supply: Disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between state regulations and private standards","AbstractThe global palm oil value chain has grown in complexity; stakeholder relationships and linkages are increasingly shaped by new public and private standards that aim to ameliorate social and environmental costs while harnessing economic gains. Regulatory initiatives in the emerging policy regime complex struggle to resolve sector‐wide structural performance issues: pervasive land conflicts, yield differences between companies and smallholders, and carbon emissions arising from deforestation and peatland conversion. Identifying opportunities for more effective governance of the palm oil value chain and supply landscapes, this paper explores disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between public regulations and private standards, looking at the global, national, and subnational policy domains shaping chain actors’ conduct. Greater complementarities have emerged among transnational instruments, but state regulation disconnects persist and antagonisms prevail between national state regulations and transnational private standards. Emerging experimental approaches, particularly at subnational level, aim to improve coordination to both enhance complementarities and resolve disconnects.","[{""name"": ""Pablo Pacheco"", ""affiliation"": [""World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Washington DC USA"", ""Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) Bogor Indonesia""]}, {""name"": ""George Schoneveld"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) Nairobi Kenya""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Dermawan"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) Bogor Indonesia""]}, {""name"": ""Heru Komarudin"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) Bogor Indonesia""]}, {""name"": ""Marcel Djama"", ""affiliation"": [""CIRAD Agricultural Research for Development, Universiti Putra Malaysia Kuala Lumpur Malaysia""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400830732.44"", ""10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.10.005"", ""10.5751/ES-01465-100209"", ""10.1017/S1537592709090033"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0127963"", ""10.1080/13504509.2015.1090497"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.06.007"", ""10.1002/sd.1639"", ""10.1177/1070496515593775"", ""10.1016/j.forpol.2011.09.004"", ""10.1073/pnas.1412514112"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1xz0km"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000076"", ""10.1111/rego.12030"", ""10.1002/lite.201200199"", ""10.1177/0308518X15599787"", ""10.1007/s10460-017-9816-6"", ""10.1007/s10460-014-9511-9"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.08.012"", ""10.1017/S1537592710004068"", ""10.1111/j.1755-263X.2008.00011.x"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.06.007"", ""10.1146/annurev.energy.31.042605.135621"", ""10.1163/19426720-01901005"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2011.07.012"", ""10.1080/10549811.2015.1036886"", ""10.1002/ldr.1130"", ""10.18352/ijc.374"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.019"", ""10.1163/19426720-01901003"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01133.x"", ""10.1111/rego.12180"", ""10.19103/AS.2017.0018.31"", ""10.2202/1565-3404.1279"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.06.007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8373.2012.01492.x"", ""10.1080/00074918.2016.1228829"", ""10.1016/j.forpol.2017.12.014"", ""10.18352/ijc.593"", ""10.1186/2047-2382-3-4"", ""10.1016/j.gfs.2012.10.003"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35716-9"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.10.017"", ""10.1038/nclimate3008"", ""10.1073/pnas.1716695115"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199596751.001.0001"", ""10.5716/WP17366.PDF"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0159668"", ""10.1177/1070496516640857"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198724506.001.0001""]","['Environmental Science', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Strategy and Management', 'Ecology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0713 生态学', 0.7889), ('0907 林学', 0.7722)]]"
10.1002/poi3.287,POLICY AND INTERNET,0503 Journalism and Communication; 0302 Political Science,From content moderation to visibility moderation: A case study of platform governance on TikTok,"AbstractTikTok, a short‐video app featuring video content typically between 15 and 60 s long, has become immensely popular around the world in the last few years. However, the worldwide popularity of TikTok requires the platform to constantly negotiate with the rules, norms and regulatory frameworks of the regions where it operates. Failure to do so has had significant consequences. For example, for content‐related reasons, the platform has been (temporarily and permanently) banned in several countries, including India, Indonesia and Pakistan. Moreover, its Chinese ownership and popularity among underage users have made the platform subject to heightened scrutiny and criticism. In this paper, we introduce the notion of visibility moderation, defined as the process through which digital platforms manipulate the reach of user‐generated content through algorithmic or regulatory means. We discuss particular measures TikTok implements to shape visibility and issues arising from it. This paper presents findings from interviews with content creators, which takes a user‐centric approach to understand their sense‐making of and negotiation with TikTok's visibility moderation. Findings from this study also highlight concerns that leave these stakeholders feeling confused, frustrated or powerless, which offer important directions for further research.","[{""name"": ""Jing Zeng"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zurich  Zurich Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""D. Bondy Valdovinos Kaye"", ""affiliation"": [""Queensland University of Technology  Brisbane Australia""]}]","[""10.5334/csci.140"", ""10.1177/2056305120984458"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67256-4_32"", ""10.1177/1461444819854731"", ""10.1177/2056305119897323"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2012.664428"", ""10.1177/1461444812440159"", ""10.1080/17544750.2020.1761848"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674735613"", ""10.1002/itl2.204"", ""10.4135/9781452230153"", ""10.1177/1461444818815684"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2021.1994624"", ""10.1177/1461444814543163"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2021.1874476"", ""10.1145/2207676.2208409"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1534984"", ""10.1386/jdmp.10.1.33_1"", ""10.1177/1461444818776611"", ""10.1177/1461444820912540"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1199721"", ""10.1177/2053951720943234"", ""10.14763/2020.4.1512"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1573914"", ""10.1177/2053951719897945"", ""10.1177/20563051211047667"", ""10.14763/2021.2.1557"", ""10.1177/2053951720919963"", ""10.1177/20563051211012344"", ""10.1080/21670811.2020.1773888"", ""10.1145/3359252"", ""10.1145/3359294"", ""10.1215/00031283-7611213"", ""10.14763/2019.4.1424"", ""10.1177/20563051211036940"", ""10.1177/1461444815608807"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1293130"", ""10.1145/3359174"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479833641.001.0001"", ""10.18653/v1/D17-1117"", ""10.1177/1461444819875990"", ""10.1080/21670811.2020.1765401"", ""10.1017/9781108666428"", ""10.1145/2068816.2068840"", ""10.17645/mac.v1i1.70"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190889760.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1461444818773059"", ""10.1037/ppm0000228"", ""10.1177/0162243915605575"", ""10.1080/17512786.2019.1706622"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2021.1961007"", ""10.1177/2059436419834124"", ""10.1177/1461444820983603""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

It draws on public service logic, which uses value as a lens through which to view public service delivery and presents an ecosystem perspective to understand the interconnectivity and complexity of value creation. To illustrate the conceptual discussion, a contextual case study of the Scottish Social Security Agency and its services is presented. The analysis demonstrates that value creation is enabled and constrained by the congruence of goals among actors, the strategic direction and a participatory approach that combines ‘lived experience’ with expertise. The article adds to theory by understanding value creation from a systemic perspective, emphasising the interplay of participative processes and the wider societal context. For policy and practice, it suggests a change in how value is articulated, promised, created and measured.","[{""name"": ""Kirsty Strokosch"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Edinburgh, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen P.

The standard solution proposed is that politicians resolve this commitment problem with voters through monitoring and enforcement. But there has been startlingly little evidence of individual-level monitoring and enforcement in the recent literature, and many studies now document the use of clientelism even where politicians are aware that the commitment problem remains completely intractable. When read together, recent studies suggest that the focus on resolving the commitment problem is a red herring. Instead, it is increasingly clear that clientelism does not need to be monitored and that the commitment problem does not bind as politicians choose their electoral appeals. New puzzles, motivated by advances in the recent literature, deserve comparatively more attention in future research.","[{""name"": ""Allen Hicken"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA;,""]}, {""name"": ""Noah L.

The concept of a sacrificial international order calls attention to how all international orders have their share of sacrifices—and this includes liberal international orders. International orders can be distinguished by the selection mechanisms used to identify the sacrifices and the meanings attached to them. I call attention to how liberal international orders often rely on markets as a selection mechanism and interpret these deaths as part of progress. Following critical contributions to the study of neoliberalism that show how markets shape the ethics of “giving life” and “letting die,” I illuminate these processes through four concepts: humanitarian governance and the claim that the highest moral principle is saving lives and relieving suffering; moral economy that regulates who has access to basic subsistence goods during periods of crisis; triage, which considers how to prioritize whose lives are valued; and whether all deaths count as sacrifices or whether they are better understood as “those who can be killed.” I conclude by discussing how COVID-19 conjures hierarchies of humanity ignored by the liberal international order and challenges the discipline to consider the sacrifices in world order.","[{""name"": ""Michael Barnett"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9780804764025"", ""10.2307/20028386"", ""10.13109/9783666101458.29"", ""10.1525/california/9780520271166.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350223042"", ""10.1215/08992363-2007-007"", ""10.1183/13993003.01445-2020"", ""10.2307/2708821"", ""10.1093/heapro/das016"", ""10.1177/039219219604417302"", ""10.1017/S0003055401000089"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674416345"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001"", ""10.1353/ken.0.0035"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09096-7"", ""10.1353/hum.2020.0020"", ""10.4159/9780674919808"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1080/17449626.2015.1054557"", ""10.1093/jaarel/LXIV.4.767"", ""10.4159/9780674977501"", ""10.1086/382250"", ""10.2307/j.ctt17kk9p8"", ""10.1525/9780520955189"", ""10.1177/002234337100800201"", ""10.1353/hum.2010.0007"", ""10.1525/aa.2005.107.3.395"", ""10.1353/hum.2020.0010"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195653861.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131642"", ""10.1080/14797589809359290"", ""10.1017/S135824611100004X"", ""10.1093/past/50.1.76"", ""10.1017/S0020860400019872""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/rego.12392,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Assessing the regulatory challenges of emerging disruptive technologies,"AbstractThe past decade has witnessed the emergence of many technologies that have the potential to fundamentally alter our economic, social, and indeed personal lives. The problems they pose are in many ways unprecedented, posing serious challenges for policymakers. How should governments respond to the challenges given that the technologies are still evolving with unclear trajectories? Are there general principles that can be developed to design governance arrangements for these technologies? These are questions confronting policymakers around the world and it is the objective of this special issue to offer insights into answering them both in general and with respect to specific emerging disruptive technologies. Our objectives are to help better understand the regulatory challenges posed by disruptive technologies and to develop generalizable propositions for governments' responses to them.","[{""name"": ""Araz Taeihagh"", ""affiliation"": [""Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy National University of Singapore  Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""M Ramesh"", ""affiliation"": [""Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy National University of Singapore  Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Howlett"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Simon Fraser University  Burnaby British Columbia Canada""]}]","[""10.1111/rego.12335"", ""10.1126/science.aal4321"", ""10.1177/0952076715590697"", ""10.1007/BF00143910"", ""10.1086/258854"", ""10.1515/9781400878789"", ""10.1111/rego.12343"", ""10.1515/9781400835119"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.03.061"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grj013"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1983.tb00793.x"", ""10.1086/466643"", ""10.1017/S0898030600003705"", ""10.1111/rego.12344"", ""10.1111/rego.12387"", ""10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00163-0"", ""10.1093/0198280998.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1754-7121.2000.tb01152.x"", ""10.4324/9780429401046"", ""10.1080/13876988.2013.765618"", ""10.1332/147084414X13992869118596"", ""10.1080/14494035.2018.1504488"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018920"", ""10.1111/rego.12245"", ""10.1177/0306312709346079"", ""10.1111/rego.12341"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.00119"", ""10.3390/en11051277"", ""10.1111/risa.13505"", ""10.1177/0011128793039002002"", ""10.3390/en11051062"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674067547"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1356-7_13"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6688(199923)18:4<625::AID-PAM5>3.0.CO;2-U"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840609"", ""10.1111/rego.12375"", ""10.1002/poi3.102"", ""10.1016/0923-4748(93)90059-R"", ""10.2307/3003160"", ""10.1038/4681029a"", ""10.1177/0169796X17710072"", ""10.1007/s11077-017-9303-3"", ""10.1080/01441647.2018.1494640"", ""10.1068/b38058"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1782627"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-4602-6_9"", ""10.1177/1035304620941272"", ""10.1111/rego.12366"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2011.00551.x""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Information Systems', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1017/S1537592721000049,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Who Do You Trust? The Consequences of Partisanship and Trust for Public Responsiveness to COVID-19 Orders,"Non-uniform compliance with public policy by citizens can undermine the effectiveness of government, particularly during crises. Mitigation policies intended to combat the novel coronavirus offer a real-world measure of citizen compliance, allowing us to examine the determinants of asymmetrical responsiveness. Analyzing county-level cellphone data, we leverage staggered roll-out to estimate the causal effect of stay-at-home orders on mobility using a difference-in-differences strategy. We find movement is significantly curtailed, and examination of descriptive heterogeneous effects suggests the key roles that partisanship and trust play in producing irregular compliance. We find that Republican-leaning counties comply less than Democratic-leaning ones, which we argue underlines the importance of trust in science and acceptance of large-scale government policies for compliance. However, this partisan compliance gap shrinks when directives are given by Republican leaders, suggesting citizens are more trusting of co-partisan leaders. Furthermore, we find that higher levels of social trust increase compliance; yet these gains attenuate or intensify depending upon community-level partisan sentiments. Our study provides a real-world, behavioral measure that demonstrates the influence of partisanship, social trust, and their interaction on citizen welfare. Finally, we argue that our results speak to how trust in government may impact successful containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Daniel A.N.

Focusing on these linkages is crucial in a time when the environment is a core issue of international politics and the number of armed conflicts remains high. This article introduces a special issue with a particular emphasis on environmental opportunities for building and sustaining peace. We first detail the definitions, theoretical assumptions and intellectual background of environmental peacebuilding. The article then provides context for the special issue by briefly reviewing core findings and debates of the first two generations of environmental peacebuilding research. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps that should be addressed in the next generation of research, and to which the articles in this special issue contribute: bottom-up approaches, gender, conflict-sensitive programming, use of big data and frontier technology, and monitoring and evaluation.","[{""name"": ""Tobias Ide"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carl Bruch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander Carius"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ken Conca"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Geoffrey D Dabelko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Richard Matthew"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erika Weinthal"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Reviewing the “state of the art” in foreign policy analysis and comparative politics, this introductory article discusses the changing nature of both international politics and party systems and cleavages in Europe and beyond. It puts forward reasons why we should see different patterns of coalitions and party behavior in security policy, on the one hand, and in international trade and foreign aid, on the other hand. The articles in this Special Issue have been deliberately chosen to capture different elements of “partyness,” from analyzing party positions to actual behavior by legislatures and governments to transnational party networks. Our main argument is that there are genuine ideological differences between political parties and that the impact of these competing ideologies is also discernible in foreign policy decision-making.","[{""name"": ""Tapio Raunio"", ""affiliation"": [""Tampere University""]}, {""name"": ""Wolfgang Wagner"", ""affiliation"": [""Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam""]}]","[""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.111605.105008"", ""10.1093/fpa/orx005"", ""10.4324/9780203123621"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00564.x"", ""10.4135/9781473957978"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-00279-2"", ""10.4324/9780203028179"", ""10.1177/0022002718772352"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2016.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2013.07.002"", ""10.1007/s11558-011-9108-7"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060115"", ""10.7765/9781526140708"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199244003.001.0001"", ""10.1556/aoecon.62.2012.1.4"", ""10.1111/jcms.12477"", ""10.1093/fpa/oraa014"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00622.x"", ""10.1111/psq.12319"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1309038"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.003.0028"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000184"", ""10.1162/0034653053327621"", ""10.1080/09692290.2013.839463"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2006.00030.x"", ""10.1162/002081898753162839"", ""10.1177/0010414017695330"", ""10.1177/1065912917735176"", ""10.1093/fpa/oraa004"", ""10.1093/fpa/oraa006"", ""10.1177/0022002718794848"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000336"", ""10.1017/S0003055400269712"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58693-3"", ""10.1515/9780691214863"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00442"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139245920"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1515/9781400840830"", ""10.1086/230321"", ""10.1057/s41311-016-0002-z"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00366.x"", ""10.1057/s41269-016-0024-y"", ""10.2307/2600889"", ""10.1111/misr.12213"", ""10.4135/9781848608047"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199296316.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022343309339250"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000058"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1093/fpa/oraa003"", ""10.1162/isec.2007.32.2.7"", ""10.1111/psq.12345"", ""10.5771/9783845227924"", ""10.2307/20039647"", ""10.1177/0010414005281932"", ""10.1017/S0007123400000181"", ""10.1057/9781137386519"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00293.x"", ""10.1515/9781400873821"", ""10.1080/13642980701725160"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790751"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12251"", ""10.2307/2600959"", ""10.1590/1981-3861200900020005"", ""10.7765/9781526140708.00012"", ""10.1080/725289044"", ""10.1093/fpa/ory010"", ""10.1007/s11558-009-9066-5"", ""10.1111/j.0000-0000.2001.00192.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1116199"", ""10.7591/9781501729621"", ""10.1177/0022002707300842"", ""10.4337/9781786438850"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1240411"", ""10.1093/fpa/oraa010"", ""10.1080/13523260.2016.1183414"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2006.00032.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1163/9789004336346"", ""10.2307/2586386"", ""10.1016/j.qref.2009.10.003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198846796.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1240413"", ""10.1017/S1755773918000097"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2011.00151.x"", ""10.1177/1369148119883651"", ""10.1017/S1755773912000276""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz254,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Let's talk about the interregnum: Gramsci and the crisis of the liberal world order,"Abstract The liberal international order (LIO) is in crisis. Numerous publications, debates and events have time and again made it clear that we are in the midst of a grand transformation of world order. While most contributions focus on either what is slowly dying (the LIO) or what might come next (China, multipolarity, chaos?), there is less analytical engagement with what lies in between those two phases of world order. Under the assumption that this period could last years or even decades, a set of analytical tools to understand this interregnum is urgently needed. This article proposes an analytical framework that builds on Gramscian concepts of crisis that will help us understand the current crisis of the LIO in a more systematic way. It addresses a gap in the literature on changing world order by elaborating three Gramsci-inspired crisis characteristics—processuality, organicity and morbidity—that sketch the current crisis landscape in a systematic way. Building on this framework, the article suggests different empirical entry points to the study of the crisis of the LIO and calls for a research agenda that takes this crisis seriously as a distinct period of changing world orders.","[{""name"": ""Milan Babic"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000054,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,"What is Islamophobia? Disentangling Citizens' Feelings Toward Ethnicity, Religion and Religiosity Using a Survey Experiment","What citizens think about Muslim immigrants has important implications for some of the most pressing challenges facing Western democracies. To advance contemporary understanding of what ‘Islamophobia’ really is – for example, whether it is a dislike based on immigrants’ ethnic background, religious identity or specific religious behaviors – this study fielded a representative online survey experiment in the UK in summer 2015. The results suggest that Muslim immigrants are not per se viewed more negatively than Christian immigrants. Instead, the study finds evidence that citizens’ uneasiness with Muslim immigration is first and foremost the result of a rejection of fundamentalist forms of religiosity. This suggests that common explanations, which are based on simple dichotomies between liberal supporters and conservative critics of immigration, need to be re-evaluated. While the politically left and culturally liberal have more positive attitudes toward immigrants than right-leaning individuals and conservatives, they are also far more critical of religious groups. The study concludes that a large part of the current political controversy over Muslim immigration is related to this double opposition: it is less about immigrants versus natives or even Muslim versus Christians than about political liberalism versus religious fundamentalism.","[{""name"": ""Marc Helbling"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Richard Traunmüller"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01419870902935963"", ""10.1037/a0025882"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2007.02.004"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edq002"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2906365"", ""10.1177/0010414015612388"", ""10.1177/0010414002250664"", ""10.1017/S000712341700031X"", ""10.1177/1088868309352179"", ""10.1086/297702"", ""10.1111/j.1530-2415.2008.00162.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990372"", ""10.2307/1386664"", ""10.1177/0010414015626448"", ""10.1080/14792779443000058"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090756"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071312-145630"", ""10.1177/0002764211409387"", ""10.4159/9780674088962"", ""10.1126/science.aag2147"", ""10.1086/297869"", ""10.1111/1468-5906.00142"", ""10.1017/S0007123407000257"", ""10.1080/01419870802298454"", ""10.2307/1387609"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00039.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1015550107"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2324280"", ""10.1007/s00148-014-0512-1"", ""10.1207/S15327582IJPR1301_03"", ""10.4135/9781483398075"", ""10.1207/s15327582ijpr0202_5"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.04.001"", ""10.1177/0049124197025003003"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000143"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197263860.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12060"", ""10.2307/1953880"", ""10.2307/1388607"", ""10.1177/1532673X07309601"", ""10.1080/01419870.2012.729674"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00373.x"", ""10.1093/sf/sov054"", ""10.1057/9781403978561"", ""10.1177/1368430207078697"", ""10.1177/0146167211399583"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-102512-194818"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791017"", ""10.1086/694845"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070142"", ""10.1093/esr/jct038"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00433.x"", ""10.2307/2657288"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2014.935307"", ""10.2307/2096296"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2009.02.005"", ""10.1162/003465301750160108"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000388"", ""10.1017/S000305540400098X"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2013.831542"", ""10.1057/pol.2012.30""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055421001301,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Political Legitimacy, Authoritarianism, and Climate Change","Is authoritarian power ever legitimate? The contemporary political theory literature—which largely conceptualizes legitimacy in terms of democracy or basic rights—would seem to suggest not. I argue, however, that there exists another, overlooked aspect of legitimacy concerning a government’s ability to ensure safety and security. While, under normal conditions, maintaining democracy and rights is typically compatible with guaranteeing safety, in emergency situations, conflicts between these two aspects of legitimacy can and often do arise. A salient example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, during which severe limitations on free movement and association have become legitimate techniques of government. Climate change poses an even graver threat to public safety. Consequently, I argue, legitimacy may require a similarly authoritarian approach. While unsettling, this suggests the political importance of climate action. For if we wish to avoid legitimating authoritarian power, we must act to prevent crises from arising that can only be resolved by such means.","[{""name"": ""ROSS MITTIGA"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511817434"", ""10.1111/j.1088-4963.1999.00003.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2006.00256.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.0906865106"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115430"", ""10.1080/09644016.2015.1051324"", ""10.1515/9781400834402"", ""10.1111/j.1088-4963.1996.tb00040.x"", ""10.4324/9781315730042"", ""10.1177/1070496516677365"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511596704"", ""10.1080/09644010903576918"", ""10.1073/pnas.1803222115"", ""10.1007/s11098-020-01539-3"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1444723"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198262138.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198746959.001.0001"", ""10.1111/papa.12132"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198832935.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198746959.003.0008"", ""10.1080/13698230.2014.930783"", ""10.1017/S0265052500002995"", ""10.1086/233944"", ""10.3197/096327114X13947900181996"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92288-1"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2324.003.0011"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2004.00003.x"", ""10.1086/340313"", ""10.1080/09644016.2012.651904"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139208628"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3364.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s00382-014-2075-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198297475.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674042582"", ""10.2307/3234924"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2021.110754"", ""10.1073/pnas.0907998106"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198295457.001.0001""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In the US, President Donald Trump, prominent Republicans, and conservative media initially dismissed the dangers of COVID-19 (Stecula, 2020). The pandemic became politicized from the early days, and even though Trump and Republicans have walked back many of their initial claims, there continue to be media reports of partisan differences in public opinion shaped by that early response.

10.1093/polsoc/puab016,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Digitalization and beyond: the effects of Covid-19 on post-pandemic educational policy and delivery in Europe,"AbstractEducation has been extremely affected by the coronavirus disease crisis, with almost all countries temporarily closing their schools in 2020. After the first stage of the pandemic, in which national governments focused on guaranteeing the academic year’s continuity, key international organizations emphasized the need to adopt structural policy reforms to face the challenges posed by the crisis. Based on international and European countries’ policy documents, this paper analyzes long-term responses articulated in the education sector. The analysis has allowed us to identify three preponderant areas of response: the digitalization of the educational system, educational inequalities, and teachers’ development. The agendas and policy instruments that international organizations have so far pushed for in relation to each of these areas do not differ substantially from the agendas and instruments they promoted in the pre-pandemic era. It is still early to assess the deepness of the transformations in course, but in most cases, prevailing responses represent the intensification of change processes initiated before the pandemic. Nonetheless, the type and intensity of country responses vary among the European Union member states. Although the pandemic represents a common thread, countries have experienced the crisis differently according to the characteristics of their educational systems and the main problems the crisis has revealed.","[{""name"": ""Adrián Zancajo"", ""affiliation"": [""Manchester Institute of Education, University of Manchester , Manchester, United Kingdom""]}, {""name"": ""Antoni Verger"", ""affiliation"": [""Departament de Sociologia, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès , Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Pedro Bolea"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent researcher""]}]","[""10.46661/ijeri.5120"", ""10.4324/9781315630717"", ""10.1111/spol.12207"", ""10.24059/olj.v24i4.2175"", ""10.1007/s11159-020-09860-z"", ""10.1002/9781118468005.ch8"", ""10.1111/j.0033-3298.2003.00371.x"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1787628"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12975."", ""10.1080/02680939.2018.1460493"", ""10.1177/14749041211024781"", ""10.1016/j.mex.2020.100787"", ""10.7249/RRA168-2"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-62911-0"", ""10.1080/09692290420001672796."", ""10.1093/polsoc/puab009"", ""10.24124/c677/20079"", ""10.1080/03055698.2020.1833840."", ""10.3390/educsci11020047"", ""10.1016/j.system.2020.102352"", ""10.1023/A:1007113830879"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511806414"", ""10.3390/su13094850"", ""10.1108/JPCC-05-2020-0017"", ""10.1787/5f07c754-en"", ""10.1787/0a530888-en"", ""10.1787/201dde84-en"", ""10.1080/0305006032000162020"", ""10.1515/9781400841080"", ""10.1002/9781119218456.ch20"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9724-9"", ""10.1177/14749041211021246"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-588-4_8"", ""10.1177/1474904120908751""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Using ethnographic evidence on the remote gig economy in North America, the UK and the Philippines, we argue that labour platforms increase the agency of workers to contract with clients and thus reduce the risk of false self-employment in terms of the worker–client relationship. However, in doing so, platforms create a new source of subordination to the platform itself. We term this phenomenon ‘subordinated agency’, and demonstrate that it entails a ‘structured antagonism’ with platforms that manifests in three areas: fees, competition and worker voice mechanisms. Subordinated agency creates worker desire for representation, greater voice and even unionization towards the platform, while preserving entrepreneurial attitudes towards clients.","[{""name"": ""Alex J Wood"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Management, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Vili Lehdonvirta"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford,1 St Giles’, Oxford OX1 3JS, UK""]}]","[""10.1177/0950017014528403"", ""10.1177/0018726707075880"", ""10.1177/0308518X19894584"", ""10.1177/0950017014559960"", ""10.1145/1357054.1357227"", ""10.1093/ser/mwz022"", ""10.17323/1726-3247-2019-4-70-77"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8543.2007.00602.x"", ""10.1111/1748-8583.12258"", ""10.31269/triplec.v18i1.1133"", ""10.2202/1446-9022.1026"", ""10.1093/ser/mwz019"", ""10.1177/0018726718790002"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.006"", ""10.1177/0018726720915761"", ""10.1108/S0277-283320190000033008"", ""10.1177/095001709263007"", ""10.1145/2818048.2819942"", ""10.1145/2660398.2660403"", ""10.1111/bjir.12084"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsp020"", ""10.1111/j.1748-8583.2004.tb00117.x"", ""10.1111/bjir.12188"", ""10.1177/0950017012464423"", ""10.1177/0950017018760136"", ""10.1145/2470654.2470742"", ""10.1177/001979391406700103"", ""10.1177/0143831X17723712"", ""10.1177/0143831X14559782"", ""10.1353/lab.2005.0011"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.07.056"", ""10.5465/annals.2018.0174"", ""10.1017/9781108604994.006"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-48087-3_4"", ""10.1111/ntwe.12102"", ""10.1177/0149206318786781"", ""10.1177/0003122420979980"", ""10.1111/irel.12251"", ""10.1145/214762.214766"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc773c7"", ""10.1177/0950017019866626"", ""10.1145/2482991.2482999"", ""10.1111/ntwe.12119"", ""10.1111/bjir.12596"", ""10.1257/aer.104.11.3565"", ""10.1177/0950017019897872"", ""10.1177/0950017098124004"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198797012.001.0001"", ""10.1145/358916.361990"", ""10.1162/154247603322493212"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx062"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8543.2011.00850.x"", ""10.1111/bjir.12283"", ""10.1177/0950017006065109"", ""10.1177/2056305120926484"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu036"", ""10.1177/0950017019862954"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054857"", ""10.1111/j.1748-8583.2001.tb00048.x"", ""10.4324/9780203928479"", ""10.4159/9780674726123"", ""10.1111/irj.12103"", ""10.1177/0950017018785616"", ""10.1177/0038038519828906"", ""10.1111/ntwe.12112"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3795375"", ""10.1145/2872427.2883036""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

This introduction seeks to explain why we must transform the public sector in order to spur co-creation, how strategic management and digital platforms can support this transformation, and why we must bring together and synthesize different bodies of theory when studying the complex processes of co-creation and their drivers, barriers and outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Jacob Torfing"", ""affiliation"": [""Roskilde University, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Ewan Ferlie"", ""affiliation"": [""King’s College London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Tina Jukić"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ljubljana, Slovenia""]}, {""name"": ""Edoardo Ongaro"", ""affiliation"": [""The Open University, UK""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Marketing', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

I trace the ongoing evolution of racial classifications and boundaries in the United States and Latin America, two regions that share a history of European colonization, slavery, and high levels of race mixing but that have espoused very different racial ideologies. Traditionally, for many groups in the United States, race was seen as unchangeable and determined by ancestry; in contrast, parts of Latin America have lacked strict classification rules and embraced race mixing. However, recent research has shown that race in the United States can change across time and context, particularly for populations socially defined as more ambiguous, while some Latin American racial boundaries are becoming more stringent. I argue that the fluidity of race has redefined our understanding of racial identities, and propose several directions for future political science scholarship that bridges disciplines and methodological approaches.","[{""name"": ""Lauren Davenport"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA;""]}]","[""10.1093/poq/nfw029"", ""10.1086/687375"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316228050"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051579"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00527"", ""10.1086/592859"", ""10.1515/9780804776264"", ""10.1177/0002764215613400"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.06.006"", ""10.4054/DemRes.2014.31.24"", ""10.1016/j.racsoc.2003.12.008"", ""10.1080/0141987042000268530"", ""10.1093/sf/86.2.821"", ""10.1111/j.1573-7861.2009.01124.x"", ""10.1080/01419870.2015.1084430"", ""10.1353/sof.2006.0007"", ""10.1177/000312240707200505"", ""10.3917/popu.1401.0029"", ""10.1073/pnas.0905362106"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2011.10.005"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000556"", ""10.1177/0003122415623286"", ""10.1017/9781108694605"", ""10.1111/ajps.12100"", ""10.1080/0032472042000272375"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2016.02.006"", ""10.1177/019027250707000409"", ""10.1257/aer.101.3.603"", ""10.1080/01419870.2018.1427881"", ""10.1080/01419870.1995.9993855"", ""10.1353/jhr.2012.0024"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0025107"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2018.03.003"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00457"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2012.12.012"", ""10.1525/sp.2010.57.1.138"", ""10.1073/pnas.100086897"", ""10.1111/jasp.12020"", ""10.2307/3088948"", ""10.2307/2579856"", ""10.1348/014466600164363"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00703.x"", ""10.1177/0190272510361436"", ""10.2307/2648049"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00935.x"", ""10.1037/pspi0000107"", ""10.1177/0956797615596436"", ""10.1037/a0021562"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674735811"", ""10.1017/S0898588X08000047"", ""10.1515/9781400841943"", ""10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00680.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.1080/01419870500092852"", ""10.1086/229819"", ""10.1177/019027250406700201"", ""10.1086/687374"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2013.05.009"", ""10.1186/gb-2008-9-7-404"", ""10.1080/21565503.2017.1288144"", ""10.1177/0002716218760507"", ""10.1177/2332649216632546"", ""10.1007/s13524-016-0461-2"", ""10.1007/s13524-016-0544-0"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199337354.001.0001"", ""10.1177/000312240707200604"", ""10.1037/1076-8971.7.1.98"", ""10.1007/s13524-011-0084-6"", ""10.1177/1065912907313209"", ""10.1093/poq/nfv046"", ""10.1093/socpro/spw014"", ""10.2307/2096434"", ""10.1515/9780804780131"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691169385.001.0001"", ""10.1111/spc3.12392"", ""10.1111/cdev.12592"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02185.x"", ""10.1111/j.1728-4457.2009.00260.x"", ""10.1080/01419870.2015.1031262"", ""10.1177/0003122413476034"", ""10.1177/0002764215613397"", ""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.00243.x"", ""10.1111/cdev.12410"", ""10.1177/0891243202016004005"", ""10.1016/j.racsoc.2003.12.004"", ""10.1177/0956797612450892"", ""10.1007/s11206-005-1897-0"", ""10.1515/9780804782531"", ""10.1080/01419870.2016.1140793"", ""10.1177/0002716218756818"", ""10.1086/697487"", ""10.2307/1389289"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2008.01591.x"", ""10.1353/sof.2006.0141"", ""10.1007/s13524-013-0210-8"", ""10.1086/667722"", ""10.1086/687806"", ""10.1177/000312240707200605"", ""10.1086/685586"", ""10.1080/01419870252932133"", ""10.1515/9781400837434"", ""10.1215/00182168-2210858"", ""10.1086/679252"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134657"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226353159.001.0001"", ""10.1037/a0026845"", ""10.1017/S1742058X14000241"", ""10.1177/0003122410378232"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_625258"", ""10.1525/9780520354616"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9152-7"", ""10.3998/mpub.17441"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.94.6.1033"", ""10.1086/522803"", ""10.2307/2580724""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

I survey the varieties of populism, the sources of their support and the different ways that they appeal to voters. I use data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey to explore whether populist parties are intensifying competition on the cultural dimension, accelerating the decline of mainstream parties, and increasing polarization. I argue that while left and center populist parties have upended existing structures of competition, it is longstanding conservative parties, remodeled using ethnopopulism, that have been the most consequential for the substance of political competition and the trajectory of domestic politics. I consider the behavior of incumbents and argue that varieties of populism should shape our expectations of what happens when populists rule: While left populist parties in power over the last decade have tended to become more ordinary, sometimes even shedding antiestablishment and anti-EU positions, ethnopopulist parties in power have used harsh “us-versus-them” appeals, misinformation, and democratic backsliding in their pursuit of more power.","[{""name"": ""Milada Anna Vachudova"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA;""]}]","[""10.1080/10758216.2019.1643249"", ""10.1002/epa2.1103"", ""10.1017/9781108381413"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976254"", ""10.1017/S1537592720001292"", ""10.1177/1354068812462931"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1701534"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i3.2922"", ""10.1080/21599165.2021.1871896"", ""10.1086/705378"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1017/9781108697248"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3424"", ""10.1177/0888325418791723"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1017/S1755773920000260"", ""10.1177/1354068807075943"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793380.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1465116511434788"", ""10.2307/j.ctvt9k3d3"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1491840"", ""10.1080/19448953.2017.1280981"", ""10.1080/13510347.2020.1713106"", ""10.1080/10758216.2015.1113883"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787162"", ""10.22215/cjers.v13i2.2619"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0062"", ""10.1017/gov.2019.17"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052217-104957"", ""10.1177/0958928714556970"", ""10.1057/s41253-017-0044-7"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12225"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0067"", ""10.1086/705570"", ""10.1017/9781108957809"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1354068814550438"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1493457"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198812920.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10758216.2019.1580590"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1225785"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu001"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.919"", ""10.1017/9781108652780"", ""10.1515/9780691186740"", ""10.1111/spsr.12278"", ""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532635"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.919336"", ""10.1017/S1755773920000259"", ""10.1177/1465116515616196"", ""10.1177/1354068895001001001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1712455"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511622014"", ""10.1057/9781403920072_10"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199375134.003.0002"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000526"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-54674-8"", ""10.1086/705569"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000046"", ""10.1515/9786155513558"", ""10.4324/9780429331688-2"", ""10.1177/0002764218759576"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510298"", ""10.1177/0010414020938081"", ""10.1111/jcms.12793"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1080/23248823.2020.1743472"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-033542"", ""10.1177/0192512107088390"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190936143.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198837886.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315733159"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1281261"", ""10.1177/2053168016686915"", ""10.1017/S0043887110000043"", ""10.1515/9781400887828"", ""10.1086/705377"", ""10.1017/S1755773917000145"", ""10.1177/1465116511435822"", ""10.1177/1354068815602588"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12356"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198840503.001.0001"", ""10.1111/gove.12049"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12331"", ""10.1080/13569310701822289"", ""10.1080/13569317.2014.909266"", ""10.1007/s12116-019-09297-y"", ""10.1017/nps.2019.91"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0039"", ""10.1177/0002716218809322"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070753"", ""10.1093/0199241198.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501760802196614"", ""10.1086/705704"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787163"", ""10.1057/cep.2008.9"", ""10.1177/0888325414567128"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628"", ""10.1332/204378919X15470487645420""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

I hypothesize that local news coverage mitigates nationalization by providing voters with information that allows them to assess down-ballot candidates separately from their national, partisan assessment. The geography of media markets places some voters in a neighboring state’s market and others in in-state markets. I demonstrate that residents of in-state markets have access to vastly more local television news coverage of their governor and U.S. senators, and this increased coverage translates into greater knowledge of these officeholders. Further, access to in-state television news substantially increases split-ticket voting in gubernatorial and senatorial races.

While IR scholars routinely base their assumptions regarding the centrality of fear and self-help behavior on the Hobbesian state of nature, they overlook the Hobbesian emphasis on anxiety as the human condition that gives rise to the state of nature. The first section of the article turns to existentialist philosophy to explicate anxiety's relation to fear, multiple forms, and link to agency. The second section draws on some recent interpretations to outline the role that anxiety plays in Hobbesian thought. Finally, I argue that an ontological security (OS) perspective that is enriched by insights from existentialism provides the most appropriate theoretical venue for integrating anxiety into IR theory and discuss the contributions of this approach to OS studies and IR theory.","[{""name"": ""Bahar Rumelili"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09636412.2011.549023"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000039"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316534540"", ""10.1353/book.26766"", ""10.1080/13569310220137566"", ""10.1353/tae.2001.0007"", ""10.1017/S002081830002854X"", ""10.1057/jird.2012.19"", ""10.1177/0967010615574766"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139963169"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1177/0010836716641137"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00396.x"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000135"", ""10.1177/030437540202700305"", ""10.1177/0304375412449789"", ""10.1177/0090591789017003003"", ""10.1111/phc3.12236"", ""10.1017/S0008423907070023"", ""10.2307/2585832"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195157024.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S026021051600019X"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000098"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000123"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000111"", ""10.1080/1600910X.2011.579487"", ""10.1177/0010836716653161"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000147"", ""10.2307/3234689"", ""10.1177/0010836716653162"", ""10.1017/S175297192000010X"", ""10.4324/9781315712147"", ""10.1111/ips.12103"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000830"", ""10.1057/jird.2013.22"", ""10.1177/0967010617695715"", ""10.1017/S0260210505006613"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.3366/jipt.2013.0053""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Underlying performance measurement's popularity is the assumption that it injects performance information (PI) into decision‐making, thus rationalizing the ensuing decisions. Despite its popularity, performance measurement is criticized. In part, this criticism results from the limited knowledge of the conditions under which PI is purposefully used by politicians. We conducted a survey experiment based on real PI with 1,240 politicians. We hypothesized that PI has a positive impact on performance information use (PIU) when PI is benchmarked with coercive, mimetic or normative pressures. Moreover, due to negativity bias we expected this positive impact to be stronger when PI signals low performance. We found that normative pressures had a positive impact on actual PIU while coercive pressures positively affected intended PIU. Negativity bias is only relevant when linked to coercive pressures and intended PIU for analysing the organization's finances.","[{""name"": ""Bert George"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Public Administration Erasmus University Rotterdam  Rotterdam The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Baekgaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Aarhus  Aarhus Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Adelien Decramer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Human Resource Management and Organizational Behaviour University of Gent  Gent Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Mieke Audenaert"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Human Resource Management and Organizational Behaviour University of Gent  Gent Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Stijn Goeminne"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Public Finance, Governance and Management University of Gent  Gent Belgium""]}]","[""10.1002/ejsp.2420150306"", ""10.1177/0734371X17697248"", ""10.1177/1094428114547952"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum038"", ""10.1080/10967490802649395"", ""10.1080/10967494.2015.1024905"", ""10.1016/S0024-6301(97)00032-0"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.5.4.323"", ""10.2307/977379"", ""10.2307/977181"", ""10.1080/01900692.2013.865645"", ""10.1111/1467-9299.00324"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.2012.00820.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00461.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0142390"", ""10.1177/0095399716647153"", ""10.1080/09540962.2016.1194073"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1210905"", ""10.1177/0734371X17698189"", ""10.1111/puar.12433"", ""10.1080/03003930.2013.790813"", ""10.1111/puar.12609"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00779.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-00305-8"", ""10.1111/padm.12066"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00140"", ""10.2307/976376"", ""10.1080/15309576.2015.1006469"", ""10.1080/10967490701683586"", ""10.1007/BF00986969"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02482.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9299.00346"", ""10.1080/14719037.2010.532970"", ""10.1086/226550"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq004"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut051"", ""10.1080/14719037.2012.657835"", ""10.1080/14719030600853022"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu011"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100452"", ""10.1111/puar.12076"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1203013"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226185941.001.0001"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2"", ""10.1007/s11186-008-9067-z"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00413.x"", ""10.2307/975334"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01802.x"", ""10.1111/j.0267-4424.2004.00387.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.13.080187.002303""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Administration', 'Management Information Systems', 'Safety Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Democratic Support as Thermostatic Opinion,"Public support has long been thought crucial for the vitality and survival of democracy. Existing research has argued that democracy also creates its own demand: through early-years socialization and later-life learning, the presence of a democratic system coupled with the passage of time produces widespread public support for democracy. Using new panel measures of democratic mood varying over 135 countries and up to 30 years, this article finds little evidence for such a positive feedback effect of democracy on support. Instead, it demonstrates a negative thermostatic effect: increases in democracy depress democratic mood, while decreases cheer it. Moreover, it is increases in the liberal, counter-majoritarian aspects of democracy, not the majoritarian, electoral aspects that provoke this backlash from citizens. These novel results challenge existing research on support for democracy, but also reconcile this research with the literature on macro-opinion.","[{""name"": ""CHRISTOPHER CLAASSEN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0192512110382029"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1080/13608746.2010.513609"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0075"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00245.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12024"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i1.1214"", ""10.56021/9780801851575"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00089"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001229"", ""10.1093/0198295685.003.0002"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00301.x"", ""10.2307/2991731"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060106.095434"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199297252.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139600002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199268436.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006967"", ""10.1086/323576"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00283.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00307.x"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr028"", ""10.1111/ajps.12452"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.32"", ""10.1007/BF02687334"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00007"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0060"", ""10.1353/jod.2010.0006"", ""10.1017/S0007123400007328"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00007856"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0049"", ""10.1353/jod.1991.0016"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0000"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0026"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139540919"", ""10.2307/2111666"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195335354.003.0015"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174916"", ""10.56021/9780801860379"", ""10.1017/S0022216X0400745X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818431"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000473"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-071510-103222"", ""10.1017/S0007123401000175"", ""10.2307/1951731"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.t01-1-00001"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0009"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00002"", ""10.2307/448773"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12046"", ""10.1515/9781626375567"", ""10.1007/s11205-010-9693-5""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Candidate characteristics can shape how leaders use—and how voters react to—nonverbal cues. Drawing on role congruity expectations, we study how the use of and reactions to facial, vocal, and textual communication in political debates varies by candidate gender. Relying on full-length videos of four German federal election debates (2005–2017) and a minor party debate, we use video, audio, and text data to measure candidate facial displays of emotion, vocal pitch, and speech sentiment. Consistent with our expectations, Angela Merkel expresses less anger than her male opponents, but she is just as emotive in other respects.

10.1093/ia/iiaa220,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Far-right populism and foreign policy identity: Jair Bolsonaro's ultra-conservatism and the new politics of alignment,"Abstract In the last two decades, far-right populists have formed governments all over the world. However, systematic analyses on how far-right leaders recreate their countries' foreign policy identity are still underdeveloped. In this article, we analyse how far-right populist leaders use their conservative identity-set to align with other right-wing governments and how they use the same conservative repertoire to deal with ideological rivals. More precisely, we argue that these leaders tend to overemphasize a deep conservative identity-set towards other far-right populist governments, something we call ‘thick conservative identity’. This profoundly conservative identity-set is composed of three national role conceptions: anti-globalism, nationalism and anti-foe. However, they do not repeat this identity-set towards ideological rivals, preferring to use a more nuanced and contradictory one, something we call ‘thin conservative identity’. The trigger of such difference is the anticipated mutual expectation of conservatism between Ego and Alter, in which Ego mimics Alter's deep conservatism. We use Jair Bolsonaro's alignment with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro's relationship with China as illustrative cases. We use the main concepts of role theory to understand both how conservative alignments are created and how far-right governments deal with ideological rivals.","[{""name"": ""Feliciano De Sá Guimarães"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Irma Dutra De Oliveira E Silva"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/psrm.2021.6,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Crisis signaling: how Italy's coronavirus lockdown affected incumbent support in other European countries,"AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic is an unparalleled global crisis. Yet, despite the grave adversity faced by citizens, incumbents around the world experienced a boost in popularity during the onset of the outbreak. In this study, we examine how the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in one country affected incumbent support in other countries. Specifically, we leverage the fact that the first country-wide lockdown on European soil, in Italy on 9 March 2020, happened during the fieldwork of surveys conducted in four other European countries, France, Germany, Poland and Spain. This allows us to examine how an event abroad that alerted citizens to an imminent crisis—prior to a similar domestic government response—influenced incumbent support. Our results indicate a crisis signal effect of Italy's COVID-19 lockdown, as support for the incumbent increased domestically in other European countries after the lockdown. Importantly, these findings suggest that incumbents can benefit from a crisis unfolding in other countries, even when their own performance in response to the same crisis is not yet fully clear. They illustrate the importance of developments abroad for incumbent approval and the difficulty facing citizens seeking to disentangle performance signals from exogenous shocks.","[{""name"": ""Catherine E.

10.1162/isec_a_00383,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,"China's Grand Strategy under Xi Jinping: Reassurance, Reform, and Resistance","China's grand strategy under Xi Jinping is clearly distinctive. It does not, however, fundamentally break with the grand strategy that China has embraced since the early 1990s—one that aims to realize what is now labeled “the dream of national rejuvenation.” Leaders in Beijing have implemented three different approaches to this strategy. In 1992, the approach to rejuvenation followed Deng Xiaoping's admonition for China to hide its capabilities and bide its time. In 1996, Beijing shifted to a more proactive approach, peaceful rise, seeking to reassure others that a stronger and wealthier China would not pose a threat. In 2012, Xi again recast the grand strategy of rejuvenation to realize the Chinese dream. His approach is distinguished by its combination of three efforts: (1) continuing earlier attempts to reassure others about the benign intentions of rising China, (2) moving China from rhetoric to action in promoting reform of an international order that has facilitated China's rise, and (3) resisting challenges to what the Chinese Communist Party defines as the country's core interests. Xi's bolder approach has further clarified China's long-standing international aspirations and triggered reactions abroad that raise doubts about the prospects for his approach to realizing the goal of national rejuvenation.","[{""name"": ""Avery Goldstein"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00396338.2019.1589096"", ""10.1142/S0219747211000136"", ""10.1080/01402390.2017.1288109"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00107"", ""10.1162/01622880151091880"", ""10.2307/2539357"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00114"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00274"", ""10.2307/2009187"", ""10.2307/2009958"", ""10.2307/2645650"", ""10.1162/016228800560462"", ""10.1162/016366002760252509"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00115"", ""10.1080/14799855.2013.795549"", ""10.1093/cjip/pou027"", ""10.1080/14781158.2015.993958"", ""10.1007/s11366-019-09610-5"", ""10.1007/s11366-016-9401-7"", ""10.1080/09636412.2016.1134193"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00343"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00342"", ""10.1080/10670564.2019.1580428"", ""10.1080/01436597.2018.1559046"", ""10.1093/global/guw010"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00248"", ""10.1007/s11366-011-9140-8"", ""10.1007/BF02876947"", ""10.1177/0010414007308020"", ""10.1080/0163660X.2019.1666355"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00066"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2018.01.002"", ""10.1126/science.362.6412.276""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/isr/viz044,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Against Sovereignty in Cyberspace,"AbstractIn discussing the historical origins of sovereignty, Jens Bartelson (2018, 510) wrote, “Making sense of sovereignty . . . entails making sense of its component terms—supreme authority and territory—and how these terms were forged together into a concept.” The question of sovereignty in cyberspace, however, inverts this historical “forging together,” as territoriality and authority are sundered in cyberspace. This paper argues that attempts to apply sovereignty to cyberspace governance are inappropriate to the domain. It develops a technically grounded definition of “cyberspace” and examines its characteristics as a distinct domain for action, conflict, and governance, while clarifying its relationship to territoriality. It reviews the literature on cyberspace and sovereignty since the early 1990s, showing the emergence of explicitly pro-sovereigntist ideas and practices in the last ten years. The cyber-sovereignty debate is linked to IR research on the historical emergence of sovereignty, demonstrating how technologies routinely change the basis of international order and challenging the presumption that territorial sovereignty is a stable and uniform principle of international organization that can be presumptively applied to the internet. The paper also links the conceptual debate over cyber-sovereignty to the real-world geopolitical struggle over the governance of the internet, showing how different conceptions of sovereignty serve the interests of different powers, notably the United States, Russia, and China. The paper explores the relevance of an alternative governance model for cyberspace based on the global commons concept. It refutes the arguments made against that model and then explains what difference it might make to governance if we conceive of cyberspace in that way.","[{""name"": ""Milton L Mueller"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA""]}]","[""10.1145/2043164.2018460"", ""10.4018/ijcwt.2012070103"", ""10.37514/RNT-J.1996.3.6.21"", ""10.1177/0967010613478323"", ""10.17487/rfc2026"", ""10.4159/9780674028791"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1586643"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11373.001.0001"", ""10.1080/07075332.1999.9640869"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7617.001.0001"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300181357.001.0001"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2354377"", ""10.1353/sais.2016.0005"", ""10.2307/1373113"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00211"", ""10.2307/1229390"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1trkjd1"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0024"", ""10.1086/422984"", ""10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0023"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262014595.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12189"", ""10.1162/00208180151140577"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807763"", ""10.3998/mpub.9739"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2012.02.001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169288"", ""10.1017/9781316822524"", ""10.1163/9789004212589"", ""10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0029""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

A multiple linear regression analysis with SPSS was used to test the proposed hypotheses such as the inverted U-shaped moderating effect of the cognitive conflict.FindingsIn the Chinese context, DTS has a positive relationship on the short- and long-term financial performance. Moreover, this relationship was moderated by cognitive conflict such that the relationship between DTS and short-term financial performance could be further enhanced under the moderate cognitive conflict; however, the relationship between DTS and long-term financial performance was considerably influenced for higher cognitive conflict.Originality/valueBased on the co-evolution of the information technology/information system (IT/IS) and business strategy, this study clarified the relationships among DTS, digital strategy and business and information technology strategies. By focusing on corporate strategy, this study further examined the effect of digital transformation on both short- and long-term financial performance. To further reveal the micro-psychological mechanisms underlying the effect of DTS on organizational performance, this study confirmed the inverted U-shaped moderating effect of the top management team’s cognitive conflict. Therefore, this research provides a new theoretical perspective for future research in the field of IT/IS, DTS and digital strategy.","[{""name"": ""Hecheng Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Junzheng Feng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hui Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xin Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/ejis.2010.21"", ""10.2307/256633"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.1.139"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2014.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2011.06.001"", ""10.2307/249029"", ""10.2308/accr.2000.75.1.65"", ""10.1108/02635571311289700"", ""10.1097/00007632-200012150-00014"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2018.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2012.05.001"", ""10.2307/3250983"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2013/37:2.3"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2018.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.jcps.2014.05.003"", ""10.1002/smj.2741"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.5.1300"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.03.035"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2018.11.003"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-02-2018-0029"", ""10.2308/bria.2004.16.1.19"", ""10.1057/palgrave.emr.1500012"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02023.x"", ""10.1177/0149206305277795"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.4.741"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.6.1191"", ""10.1037/a0024844"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2013.07.002"", ""10.1080/13594320444000254"", ""10.1037/a0020015"", ""10.1177/1046496408317793"", ""10.2307/41166112"", ""10.1177/0170840604040675"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2008.00250.x"", ""10.1007/s10726-008-9107-0"", ""10.1007/s10490-007-9083-y"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2013/37.2.03"", ""10.1177/002224379903600201"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.82.5.706"", ""10.1007/s12599-015-0401-5"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2013/37.2.09"", ""10.1111/etap.12254"", ""10.1504/IJTM.2008.018066"", ""10.1002/smj.686"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.02.006"", ""10.2307/2667029"", ""10.2307/1556406"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2004.00468.x"", ""10.1177/014920638601200408"", ""10.1016/S0148-2963(02)00490-3"", ""10.1016/S0148-2963(99)00071-5"", ""10.2308/jmar.2003.15.1.193"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0079310"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2013/37.2.11"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.85.1.102"", ""10.1037/apl0000059"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2017/41.1.12"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2016.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2013.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2019.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2018.12.001"", ""10.1177/0170840606064101"", ""10.1002/job.258"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2017.09.001"", ""10.1177/0149206311406265"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000080"", ""10.1177/0018726707075703""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Federalism, policy instruments, and counter-cyclical responses to COVID-19 in the United States","ABSTRACTFederalism plays a foundational role in structuring public expectations about how the United States will respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, as both an unprecedented public-health crisis and an economic recession. As in prior crises, state governments are expected to be primary sites of governing authority, especially when it comes to immediate public-health needs, while it is assumed that the federal government will supply critical counter-cyclical measures to stabilize the economy and make up for major revenue shortfalls in the states. Yet there are reasons to believe that these expectations will not be fulfilled, especially when it comes to the critical juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the federal government has the capacity to engage in counter-cyclical spending to stabilize the economy, existing policy instruments vary in the extent to which they leverage that capacity. This leverage, we argue, depends on how decentralized policy arrangements affect the implementation of both discretionary emergency policies as well as automatic stabilization programs such as Unemployment Insurance, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Evidence on the US response to COVID-19 to date suggests the need for major revisions in the architecture of intergovernmental fiscal policy.","[{""name"": ""Philip Rocco"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Marquette University, Milwaukee, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Béland"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Alex Waddan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01594.x"", ""10.1177/152397211901900202"", ""10.1177/0160323X18824514"", ""10.1093/publius/pjz015"", ""10.1093/cjres/rst018"", ""10.3998/mpub.5208733""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

We claim that in various cases one must consider street‐level policy entrepreneurship in order to fully understand policy processes. Therefore, we call on public policy and administration scholars to devote more resources to this important link. The symposium will promote our understanding of this still underresearched area. We will explore both theoretically and empirically how bureaucrats who interact with the public on a daily basis not only implement policy but also influence how it is designed. We will also assess the contribution of the symposium papers in light of the existing scholarly debate. We will conclude by reflecting on the challenges of studying street‐level policy entrepreneurship and suggest future avenues for research in this field.","[{""name"": ""Nissim Cohen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Public Administration and Policy The University of Haifa  Haifa Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Neomi F.

The current study examines two distinct sets of factors that potentially reduce affective polarization, drawn respectively from a group‐based and a policy‐based model of its origins. Specifically, we contrast the degree to which warm social relations and policy compromise reduce affective polarization. In two experimental studies (N = 937), respondents read a mock news story about an observed interaction between Chuck Schumer, Senate minority leader, and Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader. The leaders either interact in a warm or hostile manner and independently compromise, or fail to compromise, on immigration matters. In both studies, warm leader relations reduced affective polarization whereas policy compromise did not. We consider the implications of these findings for the study of affective polarization and its reduction.","[{""name"": ""Leonie Huddy"", ""affiliation"": [""Stony Brook University""]}, {""name"": ""Omer Yair"", ""affiliation"": [""Hebrew University of Jerusalem""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400882731"", ""10.1086/697253"", ""10.1017/9781108227643"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2018.09.009"", ""10.1007/s11109-016-9377-1"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(05)37005-5"", ""10.1177/2053168015622072"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.10"", ""10.1086/699912"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1017/psrm.2020.27"", ""10.1111/hcre.12028"", ""10.1111/pops.12532"", ""10.1111/lsq.12048"", ""10.1108/S0882-614520150000032007"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(03)01001-3"", ""10.5465/amr.2010.0221"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000604"", ""10.1111/pops.12487"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3272468"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316471050"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226069159.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.737435"", ""10.1086/693987"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1038455"", ""10.1111/ajps.12089"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12485"", ""10.1177/1368430210390533"", ""10.1111/ajps.12498"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw089"", ""10.1177/0146167218757466"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9323-7"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000760"", ""10.1177/1940161217740697"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.45.5.961"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132"", ""10.1080/10584609.2020.1760406"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1080/14494035.2021.1965379,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Procedural policy tools in theory and practice INTRODUCTION,"ABSTRACTPolicy tools are a critical part of policy-making, providing the ‘means’ by which policy ‘ends’ are achieved. Knowledge of their different origin, nature and capabilities is vital for understanding policy formulation and decision-making, and they have been the subject of inquiry in many policy-related disciplines and sector-specific studies. Yet many crucial aspects of policy tools remain unexplored. Existing studies on policy tools used in policy formulation tend to focus on ‘substantive’ tools – those used to directly affect policy outcomes such as regulation or subsidies – and largely neglect ‘procedural’ tools used to indirectly but significantly affect policy processes and outcomes. A key aim of this special issue is to fill this knowledge gap in the field. This article introduces the issue by establishing that procedural tools play a more determining role in public policy-making than is generally acknowledged and deserve a more systematic inquiry into their workings, their impact on the policy process and the organization and delivery of public and private goods and services.","[{""name"": ""Azad Singh Bali"", ""affiliation"": [""Australian National University, Canberra, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Howlett"", ""affiliation"": [""Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Jenny M Lewis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""M Ramesh"", ""affiliation"": [""National University of Singapore, Singapore""]}]","[""10.1007/978-1-137-00724-7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.1980.tb00203.x"", ""10.1080/17516234.2021.1907653"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-21599-7"", ""10.1017/S0143814X0000115X"", ""10.2307/3551256"", ""10.1177/2158244019900568"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9267-8"", ""10.4135/9781446217658.n7"", ""10.3138/9781442679184"", ""10.1016/S1462-9011(03)00036-4"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00036.x"", ""10.3138/9781442603066"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2013.10.012"", ""10.1080/01441647.2012.744779"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.071105.094536"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.1994.tb00132.x"", ""10.1016/S0301-4215(03)00163-0"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00347.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02223.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1991.tb01878.x"", ""10.1111/j.1754-7121.2000.tb01152.x"", ""10.1007/s11077-009-9079-1"", ""10.1177/0263774X15610059"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1998.tb01913.x"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i2.928"", ""10.1515/9780773595873-003"", ""10.1080/10361140701595775"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1995.tb00837.x"", ""10.1080/14719030500518915"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00342.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006244"", ""10.2307/974990"", ""10.1017/S0143814X1200013X"", ""10.1007/s11077-014-9203-8"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2011.07.001"", ""10.1177/106591299604900107"", ""10.1177/019251219201300204"", ""10.1515/9780773581708-006"", ""10.1068/c120071"", ""10.1353/book4898"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00250"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.1068/b38058"", ""10.1016/0144-8188(82)90012-6"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9256.2010.01397.x"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.923625"", ""10.1111/puar.12412"", ""10.1017/S0008423900055141"", ""10.3138/utlj.58.2.153"", ""10.1007/s11077-013-9186-x"", ""10.1080/25741292.2019.1638697""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

We introduce an original comparative data set that contains experts’ information about campaigning strategies of 172 candidates competing in 35 national elections worldwide between June 2016 and May 2017. Analyses reveal several trends: incumbents run positive campaigns but are especially likely to attract attacks, candidates far from the ideological centre are more likely to ‘go negative’, candidates tend to attack frontrunners and rivals that are far from them ideologically, but they also engage in a logic of attack reciprocity with selected candidates. The comparative nature of the data also allows us to test whether variations in the context affect the use of campaign negativity; we find that the context matters mostly indirectly, by altering the effects of individual characteristics.","[{""name"": ""Alessandro Nai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1081180X00005004003"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00626.x"", ""10.1006/game.1996.0103"", ""10.2307/2111699"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02060.x"", ""10.1177/2053168016686915"", ""10.1080/00344890701869082"", ""10.1017/S1755773909990269"", ""10.1177/107769909206900111"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00130.x"", ""10.1177/0146167205284282"", ""10.1080/15377857.2015.1058310"", ""10.2307/2991771"", ""10.1080/10641734.2000.10505099"", ""10.1177/0010414013488543"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226202334.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2082710"", ""10.3726/b18545"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.071905.101448"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00618.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9065-x"", ""10.1177/1354068811436050"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195090635.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1940161210374122"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2008.00213.x"", ""10.2307/2586118"", ""10.1017/S000305540400108X"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00386.x"", ""10.1080/17457289.2018.1441848"", ""10.1002/per.389"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.06.010"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226285009.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2017.09.020"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.1993.tb01106.x"", ""10.1177/1354068815610966"", ""10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00105-3"", ""10.1080/1352726042000315423"", ""10.1177/1065912908317031"", ""10.1057/ap.2013.5"", ""10.1080/00913367.1997.10673515"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2006.04.008"", ""10.1177/1532673X11414791"", ""10.1177/1354068809341051"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00870.x"", ""10.1017/S1468109911000181"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.06.004"", ""10.1177/106591290205500309"", ""10.1177/1940161215626566"", ""10.1080/10584600903502607"", ""10.1177/0267323113510274"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-032211-212920"", ""10.4135/9781446201015.n15"", ""10.1177/106591299805100307"", ""10.1093/poq/nfq011"", ""10.1057/fp.2014.13"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01540.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9221-9"", ""10.1177/001041407901200101"", ""10.1177/1354068801007001004"", ""10.2307/2111526"", ""10.1177/0002716216662639"", ""10.1080/15295036.2016.1266686"", ""10.2307/2647730"", ""10.2307/2586119"", ""10.1111/j.1747-1346.2007.00059.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Yet this surge of interest leaves at least two important questions unanswered. Where was nationalism before its apparent resurgence? Are contemporary forms of nationalism different from their predecessors, and can these changes be linked to digital technologies? To answer these questions, we argue for the importance of understanding the less visible ways in which digital technologies reproduce our sense of belonging to a world of nations. We discuss three such mechanisms: the architecture of internet domains, the bias of algorithms and the formation of national digital ecosystems. Next, we examine three characteristics of contemporary nationalism that can be partly linked to recent shifts in the global communication ecology: diversification, fragmentation and commodification. We conclude by considering the implications of our arguments for future research in the field.","[{""name"": ""Sabina Mihelj"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Social Sciences and Humanities Loughborough University Loughborough UK""]}, {""name"": ""César Jiménez‐Martínez"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Journalism, Media and Culture Cardiff University Cardiff UK""]}]","[""10.1177/0267323115614485"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199752164.001.0001"", ""10.1093/joc/jqx017"", ""10.1163/1871191X-14011032"", ""10.1111/nana.12480"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70123-3"", ""10.1177/1940161219862988"", ""10.1177/1469540517690570"", ""10.1080/15405702.2013.751855"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2012.698204"", ""10.1080/10304310903026594"", ""10.1515/popets-2015-0007"", ""10.1177/1748048519880731"", ""10.4159/9780674030305"", ""10.1177/1940161218790035"", ""10.1080/14616700306488"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1428656"", ""10.1017/9781316800058"", ""10.1111/cccr.12152"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00273.x"", ""10.1177/1468796808088925"", ""10.1177/1461444809342738"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262525374.003.0009"", ""10.1007/s00146-016-0644-9"", ""10.1177/14614440022225689"", ""10.1177/1750481318771448"", ""10.1080/19392397.2016.1218292"", ""10.1017/9781316534168"", ""10.1017/9781316534168.002"", ""10.1075/jlp.17032.kre"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_14"", ""10.1080/14672715.2017.1341188"", ""10.4324/9780429447754"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479895120.001.0001"", ""10.28945/3331"", ""10.1017/9781108589451"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04405-3"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-34529-4"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-06147-8"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1080/17544750.2019.1572633"", ""10.1177/0196859917754053"", ""10.1177/1461444814535724"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190876791.001.0001"", ""10.2202/1944-2866.1075"", ""10.1111/comt.12028"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7"", ""10.1111/comt.12001"", ""10.1177/1527476416655384"", ""10.1177/1367877919887757"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755509.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400884711"", ""10.1145/2447976.2447990"", ""10.1177/1461444814530096"", ""10.1177/1367549417751148"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551"", ""10.1177/0163443712468605"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190889760.001.0001"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu089"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328521"", ""10.1108/13563280510614483"", ""10.1093/hcr/hqx010""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1093/ser/mwab038,SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,0303 Sociology; 0201 Theoretical Economics; 0202 Applied Economics; 0302 Political Science,"Between mutuality, autonomy and domination: rethinking digital platforms as contested relational structures","Abstract This Special Issue advances a new understanding of digital platforms as dynamic and relational. An archetypal transaction platform, we argue, is comprised of three canonical social relationships which exist in tension with each other. The first is mutuality—the practices of sharing and reciprocity which animated the early days of the ‘sharing economy’. The second is autonomy—representing the desire for freedom and independence attracting many earners to platforms. The third is domination—the exercise of power and control which drives many platform owners and managers. As we argue below, these three social relationships are present in varying degrees on all platforms. By conceptualizing platforms as contested relational structures, we aim to bridge prior attempts to classify ‘what platforms are’ with diverse empirical studies of ‘what platforms do’ in different contexts. In our view, platforms can do different things at the same time because they are different things at the same time.","[{""name"": ""Elke Schüßler"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Organization Science, Johannes Kepler University, Linz 4040, Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Will Attwood-Charles"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology and Gerontology, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Stefan Kirchner"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Sociology, Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin 10587, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Juliet B Schor"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Boston, MA 02467, USA""]}]","[""10.1108/S0733-558X20200000066006"", ""10.1177/0170840614544557"", ""10.1177/1350508410376256"", ""10.1177/1470593115572669"", ""10.1177/0032329216638053"", ""10.1080/09505439609526455"", ""10.4159/9780674545878"", ""10.1080/09720073.2014.11891518"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsw045"", ""10.3384/vs.2001-5992.131183"", ""10.1177/0001839217704811"", ""10.1177/1461444817729149"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.10.005"", ""10.1177/0010414019852687"", ""10.5465/amd.2020.0091"", ""10.5465/amp.2015.0067"", ""10.1177/2631787721995198"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199970773.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190889760.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11614-019-00353-4"", ""10.1111/anti.12641"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3488009"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080315-015334"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2793021"", ""10.3386/w11603"", ""10.1177/2631787721995205"", ""10.1177/1476127017706610"", ""10.1093/ser/mwy003"", ""10.1177/0007650317727540"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X20200000066005"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.006"", ""10.1111/jpim.12105"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1573914"", ""10.1177/0308518X20916507"", ""10.5465/amr.2019.0178"", ""10.1177/2378023119870041"", ""10.1111/joms.12701"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198866176.003.0001"", ""10.1111/ntwe.12157"", ""10.1080/24701475.2019.1593667"", ""10.1002/smj.2904"", ""10.5465/annals.2018.0174"", ""10.1080/13662716.2019.1602514"", ""10.1108/S0277-283320190000033003"", ""10.1017/9781108604994.006"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X20200000066010"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2017.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.224"", ""10.2218/finsoc.v3i1.1936"", ""10.2307/2391211"", ""10.1177/0003122420979980"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.05.023"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.05.024"", ""10.2307/2392231"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X20200000066008"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2019.02.003"", ""10.1177/0032329219838932"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcwp0kc"", ""10.1177/0950017020928248"", ""10.1162/154247603322493212"", ""10.1525/9780520970632"", ""10.1111/soc4.12493"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-082620-031411"", ""10.1177/1461444817738236"", ""10.1016/j.jocm.2020.100254"", ""10.1177/1024258917711375"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-37003-7"", ""10.1177/0950017019862954"", ""10.1017/S1537592718001081"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816260.006"", ""10.5465/amp.2011.0105"", ""10.1177/1350508420968184"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226817439.001.0001"", ""10.5465/amd.2016.0153"", ""10.1177/1095796018817059"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054857"", ""10.1177/1056492619832119"", ""10.1177/2631787720977052"", ""10.1177/0007650317718185"", ""10.1177/0950017018785616"", ""10.2307/2786661""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12421,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Between governance-driven democratisation and democracy-driven governance: Explaining changes in participatory governance in the case of Barcelona,"AbstractScholars of participatory democracy have long noted dynamic interactions and transformations within and between political spaces that can foster (de)democratisation. At the heart of this dynamism lie (a) the processes through which top‐down “closed” spaces can create opportunities for rupture and democratic challenges and (b) vice‐versa, the mechanisms through which bottom‐up, open spaces can be co‐opted through institutionalisation. This paper seeks to unpick dynamic interactions between different spaces of participation by looking specifically at two forms of participatory governance, or participatory forms of political decision making used to improve the quality of democracy. First, Mark Warren's concept of ‘governance‐driven democratization’ describes top‐down and technocratic participatory governance aiming to produce better policies in response to bureaucratic rationales. Second, we introduce a new concept, democracy‐driven governance, to refer to efforts by social movements to invent new, and reclaim and transform existing, spaces of participatory governance and shape them to respond to citizens’ demands. The paper defines these concepts and argues that they co‐exist and interact in dynamic fashion; it draws on an analysis of case study literature on participatory governance in Barcelona to illuminate this relationship. Finally, the paper relates the theoretical framework to the case study by making propositions as to the structural and agential drivers of shifts in participatory governance.","[{""name"": ""ADRIAN BUA"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics, People and Place De Montfort University UK""]}, {""name"": ""SONIA BUSSU"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of History, Politics and Philosophy Manchester Metropolitan University UK""]}]","[""10.1257/aer.91.4.938"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1515/9781503625129"", ""10.1515/9781503600775"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qgrqs"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9558.2010.01369.x"", ""10.1016/j.ccs.2016.11.001"", ""10.1080/03003930500031959"", ""10.1080/03003930902854289"", ""10.1080/07352166.2018.1559648"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00361"", ""10.1007/s10767-006-9006-9"", ""10.4337/9781786433862.00030"", ""10.4324/9781315306278-19"", ""10.1080/25741292.2018.1469242"", ""10.1080/03003930.2015.1030013"", ""10.4337/9781786433862.00012"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66592-4_11"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3359268"", ""10.4135/9781446213551"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199242511.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qgt2h"", ""10.1080/00344893.2019.1624600"", ""10.2307/2095101"", ""10.1080/17535069.2018.1426782"", ""10.1080/13621025.2017.1307609"", ""10.4337/9781786433862"", ""10.1080/07907184.2012.745274"", ""10.4324/9781315160733"", ""10.1177/0095399719833628"", ""10.4324/9781351025188-28"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100134"", ""10.1111/puar.12361"", ""10.1177/0032329213483109"", ""10.1080/03003930902999522"", ""10.1086/226707"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican1057-33"", ""10.1080/09644019908414477"", ""10.1080/04353684.1989.11879583"", ""10.4337/9781785364358.00006"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.43"", ""10.1080/1464935042000293170"", ""10.4324/9780203830789"", ""10.1111/jopp.12031"", ""10.1162/DAED_a_00449"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479847273.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199243570.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14742837.2019.1629277"", ""10.1177/0042098016669452"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/aaaa75"", ""10.1080/14719030600853022"", ""10.4337/9781785367885"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511720444"", ""10.1017/S1537592711004877"", ""10.1080/13604813.2012.734071"", ""10.1111/1467-8330.00247"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb01747.x"", ""10.1111/anti.12520"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2012.00962.x"", ""10.1177/0032329218789888"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2010.01072.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-79955-6_4"", ""10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110002"", ""10.1080/00420980500279869"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107296954.002""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Public Administration', 'Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/pops.12671,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,The Volatility of Collective Action: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Data,"Collective action is volatile: characterized by swift, unexpected changes in intensity, target, and forms. We conduct a detailed exploration of four reasons that these changes occur. First, action is about identities which are fluid, contested, and multifaceted. As the content of groups’ identities change, so do the specific norms for the identities. Second, social movements adopt new tactics, or forms of collective action. Tactical changes may arise from changes in identity, but also changes in the target or opponent groups, and changes in the relationships with targets and with other actors. Factions or wings of a group in conflict may in turn form identities based on opposition or support for differing tactics. Third, social movements change because participant motivation ebbs, surges, and also changes in quality (e.g., becoming more subjectively autonomous, or self‐determined). Finally, political social change occurs within socio‐political structures; these structures implicate higher‐level norms, which both constrain and emerge from actions (e.g., state openness or repression). Our analysis presents idealized and descriptive models of these relationships, and a new model to examine tactical changes empirically, the DIME model. This model highlights that collective actors canDisidentify after failure (giving up and walking away); they canInnovate, or try something new; and they can commit harder, convinced that they are right, with increased moral urgency (Moralization) and redoubled efforts (Energization).","[{""name"": ""Winnifred Louis"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Queensland""]}, {""name"": ""Emma

However, as the backsliding narrative gained traction, the term has been applied to the rest of the post-communist region, including the Czech Republic and Slovakia. We suggest that this diagnosis is in part based on conceptual stretching, and set out to rescue the concept as an analytical tool. We then assess the extent of backsliding in the four Visegrád countries, explaining backsliding (and the relative lack of it) in terms of motive, opportunity, and the strength or weakness of opposing or constraining forces. We conclude that the situation is not as desperate as some commentators would have it: democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland was contingent on a few exceptional factors, and EU leaders therefore need not be paralysed by the fear of contagion when they contemplate forceful action against backsliding member states.","[{""name"": ""Elisabeth Bakke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nick Sitter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0007"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1332/030557319X15487805848586"", ""10.1353/jod.2007.a223236"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-72559-8"", ""10.1080/23745118.2016.1256027"", ""10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0046"", ""10.1353/sais.2007.0021"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1491401"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i1.1428"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0026"", ""10.1111/eulj.12124"", ""10.1177/0888325418791723"", ""10.1080/0966813032000141114"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2004.00157.x"", ""10.1080/13510347.2019.1582029"", ""10.1353/jod.2007.a223242"", ""10.1017/heq.2018.25"", ""10.1017/cel.2017.9"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1229358"", ""10.1177/0022002712446132"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1493457"", ""10.1086/705570"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3374080)"", ""10.1353/jod.2007.a223228"", ""10.1515/9786155513558"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1076214"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0075"", ""10.1353/jod.1996.0047"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0000"", ""10.1086/705704"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198832775.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.07.006"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.1156"", ""10.1017/S1537592718002165"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0047"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2017.12.001"", ""10.1007/s40803-019-00086-2"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2018.07.005"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12225"", ""10.1080/13569771003593839"", ""10.1111/jcms.12845"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0015"", ""10.1353/wp.2002.0004"", ""10.1111/jcms.12082"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i3.1414"", ""10.1111/padm.12254"", ""10.1017/S1574019619000336"", ""10.1093/0199241198.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0045""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

What were the ideological underpinnings of the Bolsonaro vote? Was his support based exclusively on resentment toward the Workers’ Party? This article uses a unique public opinion dataset, the 2018 Brazilian Electoral Panel Study, to explore how positions on divisive issues related to social, political, and cultural factors influenced vote choice andBolsonarismo—affection toward Bolsonaro supporters—in the 2018 Brazilian presidential elections. Results indicate that in addition to resentment against the Workers’ Party, a cultural backlash perspective, and strict views on law and order, as well as economic liberalism and rejection of social policies, were the characteristics of support for Bolsonaro.","[{""name"": ""Lucio R.

10.1093/jopart/muaa019,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Representative Bureaucracy and Attitudes Toward Automated Decision Making,"AbstractThe theory of representative bureaucracy posits that citizens will view policy and service delivery more favorably if public servants share their background characteristics. However, automation is changing public service delivery, limiting human involvement in the process. We examine attitudes toward automated decision making through the lens of representative bureaucracy, generating expectations about how a lack of passive representation will affect views toward automated versus human decision making in government. Using a survey experiment, we find evidence that black citizens are more likely to rate automated decision making higher, compared with police officers, on fairness and preference when exposed to a lack of passive representation in a police agency. We do not find evidence of this relationship for white citizens. Our findings provide insight into the way in which passive representation conditions minority citizens’ views toward automation, highlighting the importance of considering representation, or lack thereof, as governments contemplate the adoption of automated services.","[{""name"": ""Susan M Miller"", ""affiliation"": [""University of South Carolina""]}, {""name"": ""Lael R Keiser"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Missouri""]}]","[""10.1086/268636"", ""10.1007/s00146-019-00931-w"", ""10.1017/9781108553599"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00482.x"", ""10.2307/1963525"", ""10.2307/2096302"", ""10.1080/10999922.2018.1455488"", ""10.1177/0275074010367823"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11022.001.0001"", ""10.1108/13639510210437032"", ""10.3233/IP-170050"", ""10.3758/s13428-019-01273-7"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.10"", ""10.1073/pnas.1808083115"", ""10.1111/pops.12612"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui057"", ""10.3102/0162373717714056"", ""10.1177/1098611115586174"", ""10.1177/0022427804272725"", ""10.1111/ajps.12156"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226114040.001.0001"", ""10.1111/puar.12702"", ""10.1080/15389588.2019.1654605"", ""10.1177/009539979102200401"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus030"", ""10.1198/016214506000001040"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.3763"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00025"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2012.09.001"", ""10.2307/2132344"", ""10.1111/j.1751-2409.2011.01039.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur064"", ""10.1111/puar.12629"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux012"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990360"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00338.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa012"", ""10.1093/abm/kay059"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy009"", ""10.1177/1948550616633505"", ""10.1080/00913367.2016.1269304"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000321"", ""10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.05.005"", ""10.1177/2053951718756684"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00572.x"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aaz0652"", ""10.2307/2647821"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00234.x"", ""10.1177/1078087406297026"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00653.x"", ""10.2307/974854"", ""10.56021/9780801883569"", ""10.2307/2647552"", ""10.1007/s11292-018-9332-8"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000837"", ""10.3141/2213-02"", ""10.1111/puar.12734"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000448"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy023"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu006"", ""10.1111/puar.12401"", ""10.1177/0275074016686420"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990491"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2014.08.016"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2016/40.2.14"", ""10.1177/009365000027006001"", ""10.1111/j.1745-9125.2012.00291.x"", ""10.2307/2657265"", ""10.1093/jopart/mun006"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.08.038"", ""10.1002/bsl.438"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1195009"", ""10.1093/jopart/muz024"", ""10.1111/j.1745-9125.2004.tb00524.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00905.x"", ""10.1177/0095399708326332""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1017/S0007123419000620,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Elite Communication and the Popular Legitimacy of International Organizations,"AbstractThis article offers the first systematic and comparative analysis of the effects of elite communication on citizen perceptions of the legitimacy of international organizations (IOs). Departing from cueing theory, it develops novel hypotheses about the effects of elite communication under the specific conditions of global governance. It tests these hypotheses by conducting a population-based survey experiment among almost 10,000 residents of three countries in relation to five IOs. The evidence suggests four principal findings. First, communication by national governments and civil society organizations has stronger effects on legitimacy perceptions than communication by IOs themselves. Secondly, elite communication affects legitimacy perceptions irrespective of whether it invokes IOs’ procedures or performance as grounds for criticism or endorsement. Thirdly, negative messages are more effective than positive messages in shaping citizens' legitimacy perceptions. Fourthly, comparing across IOs indicates that elite communication is more often effective in relation to the IMF, NAFTA and WTO, than the EU and UN.","[{""name"": ""Lisa M.

This article explores how and under what conditions this transnationalism has arisen, as well as its implications for world politics. It considers what effects transnational actors and governance have had on political outcomes, their relation to states and intergovernmental institutions, and normative questions around their legitimacy and accountability. The critical role of transnational actors and institutions in environmental politics has made the field a laboratory for broader questions concerning the evolution of global governance in world politics more generally. As global environmental challenges continue to magnify and affect other spheres of political activity, understanding these dynamics will become increasingly important.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Hale"", ""affiliation"": [""Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, Oxford OX2 6GG, United Kingdom;""]}]","[""10.1068/c11127"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000338"", ""10.1162/inov_a_00209"", ""10.1515/9781400830732.44"", ""10.1162/glep.2010.10.2.25"", ""10.1017/9781316694015"", ""10.1162/glep.2009.9.2.52"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx014"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300190533.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511845369"", ""10.1177/1354066106069321"", ""10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.74"", ""10.1080/09644016.2017.1323579"", ""10.1080/09644016.2017.1327485"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2016.1150777"", ""10.1111/ropr.12215"", ""10.2202/1469-3569.1321"", ""10.1163/19426720-01202004"", ""10.1126/science.1217255"", ""10.1162/glep.2009.9.4.14"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-04600-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706033"", ""10.1017/9781108284646.005"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115430"", ""10.1038/s41893-019-0349-4"", ""10.1002/pam.20546"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1220162"", ""10.1002/wcc.572"", ""10.1080/14693062.2016.1248343"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12294"", ""10.1163/19426720-00403004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511550300"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511586361.003"", ""10.4324/9781315634418"", ""10.1057/s41309-019-00068-7"", ""10.1002/wcc.496"", ""10.1177/0032321716684356"", ""10.1057/9780230590144"", ""10.1177/1354066109345056"", ""10.1080/03050629.2017.1226668"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262162500.003.0009"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042010-164946"", ""10.1162/glep.2006.6.2.55"", ""10.1126/science.aaw7287"", ""10.1038/s41558-019-0484-y"", ""10.1057/9780230283220_8"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1210943"", ""10.1017/S2047102516000121"", ""10.1017/S1049096516003024"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001442"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316105542"", ""10.1163/19426720-01401006"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00362"", ""10.1111/j.1758-5899.2011.00128.x"", ""10.1007/s11558-013-9174-0"", ""10.4324/9781315100524-12"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491238"", ""10.1017/S1537592714000784"", ""10.1017/9781108284646"", ""10.1007/s10584-015-1506-z"", ""10.1017/S1049096514001541"", ""10.1017/S1537592710004068"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00350"", ""10.1111/ropr.12213"", ""10.1002/wcc.497"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-030119"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1705.001.0001"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00228"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199235001.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316423240.011"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511529436"", ""10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.122"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-020911-094659"", ""10.1017/S0020818300026187"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3808.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262015912.001.0001"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00182"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-5095"", ""10.1177/0010414013509575"", ""10.1177/1070496505280062"", ""10.1017/9781108284646.011"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12669"", ""10.4324/9781315697468"", ""10.1080/13569775.2017.1343219"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00188.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511617683"", ""10.1017/S0020818304582036"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09362-0"", ""10.1093/isr/viw001"", ""10.1080/03050629.2017.1252248"", ""10.1163/19426720-00704003"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1418759"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00121.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921476"", ""10.4337/9781785364648"", ""10.1126/science.1259855"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559143"", ""10.1017/S000712341500037X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107325135"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000149"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791055"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791055"", ""10.1080/14693062.2017.1406843"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.141706"", ""10.1515/9781400830732.151"", ""10.1111/ropr.12217"", ""10.1002/wcc.396"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3807.001.0001"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00180"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198819974.001.0001""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"
10.1017/S1743923X20000045,POLITICS & GENDER,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,The Conservative Backlash against Gender in Latin America,"Gender is central to the political disputes in Latin America today. Although conflicts concerning women and LGBTQ rights are not new, only recently have they become a dividing line in the public identities of parties, politicians, and candidates. The second decade of the 2000s brought the opposition to gender forward in the platforms of far-right movements and leaders, raising popular support as they mobilized conservative frameworks and antagonized feminist and LGBTQ activism. Their promises to protect the family from a supposed moral disorder made gender a popular category, strategically presented as an “ideology” threatening children, marriage, the natural order, and national values. Elections such as those in Brazil and Costa Rica in 2018 indicate that conflicts concerning gender and sexuality can also produce new electoral cleavages.","[{""name"": ""Flávia Biroli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mariana Caminotti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/sp/jxx016"", ""10.1017/S1743923X20000045"", ""10.12957/dep.2016.25164""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055421000605,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Reconsidering the Link Between Self-Reported Personality Traits and Political Preferences,"Research on personality and political preferences generally assumes unidirectional causal influence of the former on the latter. However, there are reasons to believe that citizens might adopt what they perceive as politically congruent psychological attributes, or at least be motivated to view themselves as having these attributes. We test this hypothesis in a series of studies. Results of preregistered panel analyses in three countries suggest reciprocal causal influences between self-reported personality traits and political preferences. In two two-wave survey experiments, a subtle political prime at the beginning of a survey resulted in self-reported personality traits that were more aligned with political preferences gauged in a previous assessment. We discuss how concurrent assessment within the context of a political survey might overestimate the causal influence of personality traits on political preferences and how political polarization might be exacerbated by political opponents adopting different personality characteristics or self-perceptions thereof.","[{""name"": ""BERT N.

These gender differences are expected to be especially pronounced during non-campaign periods. To test these expectations, a large-scale automated content analysis of all Dutch national newspapers from September 2006 to September 2012 was conducted. The results show that male politicians received more media coverage on leadership traits in general, although the male and female leader stereotypes explain most of the variation in gender bias between leadership traits. These gender effects are found during seldom-studied routine periods but not during campaigns. As leadership trait coverage has electoral consequences, this gender-differentiated coverage likely contributes to the under-representation of women in politics.","[{""name"": ""Loes Aaldering"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daphne Joanna Van Der Pas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/0199253137.003.0006"", ""10.1177/1940161217740696"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.60.4.509"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01540.x"", ""10.1017/S1537592714003156"", ""10.1111/pops.12268"", ""10.1515/COMM.2009.011"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674865723"", ""10.1177/1940161208319097"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.149"", ""10.1057/9781137275844"", ""10.1017/S1743923X16000106"", ""10.1111/ajps.12189"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01621.x"", ""10.3998/mpub.6200859"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316336007"", ""10.1177/1940161212473508"", ""10.1080/10584600591006564"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199595365.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1990.tb02265.x"", ""10.1007/BF00990172"", ""10.2307/2647824"", ""10.1111/pops.12040"", ""10.2307/1958272"", ""10.1177/00027640121958456"", ""10.1057/9781403920126"", ""10.1086/269251"", ""10.1080/105846097199236"", ""10.1177/1748048508100913"", ""10.1177/0192512110378902"", ""10.2307/1959647"", ""10.1163/156913302100418628"", ""10.1017/S1743923X08000330"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0501_4"", ""10.1037/a0023557"", ""10.1111/j.1747-1346.2012.00350.x"", ""10.1177/1354068812472570"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199660124.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11135-015-0242-9"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00005.x"", ""10.2990/32_1_22"", ""10.1177/0267323101016003003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856X.2011.00495.x"", ""10.1177/1940161215596730"", ""10.1177/1065912907308098"", ""10.7910/DVN/HS4W33"", ""10.2307/2132350"", ""10.2307/2082979"", ""10.1177/107769909707400404"", ""10.1111/j.1747-1346.2006.00030.x"", ""10.1177/1081180X07307383"", ""10.1007/s11199-004-0715-0"", ""10.1177/107769900207900212""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

This article argues that out-group cues from Democratic elites caused a backlash that resulted in greater climate skepticism. The authors construct aggregate measures of climate skepticism from nearly 200 public opinion polls at the quarterly level from 2001 to 2014 and at the annual level from 1986 to 2014. They also build time-series measures of possible contributors to climate skepticism using an automated media content analysis. The analyses provide evidence that cues from party elites – especially from Democrats – are associated with aggregate dynamics in climate change skepticism, including among supporters of the Republican Party. The study also involves a party cue survey experiment administered to a sample of 3,000 Americans through Amazon Mechanical Turk to provide more evidence of causality. Together, these results highlight the importance of out-group cue taking and suggest that climate change skepticism should be examined through the lens of elite-led opinion formation.","[{""name"": ""Eric Merkley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominik A.

10.1080/14494035.2020.1769288,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,How does collaborative governance evolve? Insights from a medium-n case comparison,"Abstract Understanding the performance of collaborative governance regimes (CGRs) necessitates an understanding of how stakeholders and their interactions evolve over time. However, few studies assess the evolution of the structure or process dynamics of CGRs over time. This paper contributes to our understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of CGRs. We apply a modified grounded theory approach to a dataset of collaboration case studies to develop empirically-based theory about how often CGRs persist over time, how different components of CGRs evolve over time, what conditions support or hinder this evolution, and how different developmental trajectories lead to differences in the outputs and outcomes achieved by these groups. We find that CGRs follow a variety of trajectories, from failing to initiate, to achieving their work in a relatively quick time, to sustaining their operations for decades, to incurring slow or rapid declines in health. Additionally, many characteristics of CGRs, including leadership, collaborative process, accountability, and outputs/outcomes, peak at the midpoint of the observed time, suggesting that at some point, even stable and healthy collaborations incur some decline in their robustness.

Efforts to build green industry have raised the economic and geopolitical stakes of environmental issues as states seek to position their firms in global value chains and reshore strategic industries. This could help to generate the technologies and political momentum needed to accelerate global decarbonization. At the same time, these green interventions confront status quo interests and a variety of industrial policies that support fossil fuel-based industries. To help make sense of this new landscape, this introduction to the special issue defines green industrial policy and situates it within domestic political economy, social policy, and global geopolitics. We present six new studies that demonstrate and explore the global politics of green industrial policy. To illustrate the kinds of effects and implications of green industrial policy we are interested in exploring, we show how green industrial policy has transformed climate politics. Changes in state practice, ideas about the environment and economy, and technological cost declines came together to produce a new opportunistic and competitive climate politics. We then identify areas for further investigation as we call for a new climate politics research agenda, integrating green industrial policy more intentionally into studies of global environmental politics.","[{""name"": ""Bentley Allan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joanna I.

10.1111/ajps.12557,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Gender Quotas and International Reputation,"AbstractThe global spread of electoral gender quotas has been characterized as one of the most significant institutional developments of the last 30 years. Many of the countries that have adopted these laws designed to increase women's political representation are electoral autocracies that have otherwise‐stark gender inequalities. Some scholars argue that electoral authoritarian states have adopted quotas as a strategy for improving their international reputations for democracy. This article represents the first exploration of whether quotas really generate reputational boosts. Using large‐scale survey experiments in Sweden and the United States concerning hypothetical developing countries, we find that they do. In particular, audiences perceived electoral autocracies as more democratic and were more likely to support giving them foreign aid when women's descriptive representation was greater. Beyond its contribution to our understanding of gender quotas and women's representation, this article contributes to broader debates about international reputation, human rights, and foreign aid attitudes.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Sunn Bush"", ""affiliation"": [""Yale University""]}, {""name"": ""Pär Zetterberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Uppsala University""]}]","[""10.1080/14616740701259846"", ""10.1257/0002828054825655"", ""10.1080/14754835.2015.1129603"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000549"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.06.008"", ""10.1086/685379"", ""10.1017/9781108236003"", ""10.1257/aer.20160080"", ""10.1057/9781137296740"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.10"", ""10.1017/S1755048318000093"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000188"", ""10.1093/afraf/adn024"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000287"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706934"", ""10.5129/001041517820201323"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00539.x"", ""10.1086/697251"", ""10.1017/S1537592711000880"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00711.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-071112-213421"", ""10.1080/00344890701363227"", ""10.1080/1461674042000324673"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2011.613709"", ""10.1017/XPS.2019.12"", ""10.1016/S0167-2681(01)00169-X"", ""10.1177/0010414018797954"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy001"", ""10.1080/13510347.2016.1278209"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.12.004"", ""10.1177/0003122412443365"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990752"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199830091.003.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00349.x"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw006"", ""10.1080/13510340903453716"", ""10.1017/S0022278X02004032"", ""10.1080/03050629.2014.899227"", ""10.1353/jod.2007.0009"", ""10.1177/1354066102008003002"", ""10.1086/428442"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511813146.010"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000503"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx081"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615627"", ""10.1017/9781108277891"", ""10.1111/isqu.12190"", ""10.5129/001041519X15647434969795"", ""10.1093/sf/sov003"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801449666.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pa/gsw011"", ""10.1177/0010414008324993"", ""10.1017/S1537592717002225"", ""10.1111/ajps.12158"", ""10.1017/9781108186100"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00704.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195375671.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1515/9781626371255-008"", ""10.1162/0163660042518189"", ""10.1080/14616740802185650"", ""10.1515/9781400873821"", ""10.1177/1065912911414590"", ""10.1111/isqu.12142"", ""10.1093/isq/sqz096"", ""10.1111/ajps.12335"", ""10.1080/14616740802185700"", ""10.1080/13510340701398352"", ""10.1515/9781685857479"", ""10.1177/1065912907313077"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511779930"", ""10.1080/13510340701398261"", ""10.1017/9781108348621"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190936198.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414018758762"", ""10.1515/9781685851330"", ""10.1177/1065912908322411""]",['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Identifying the Effect of High-Level Visits,"Although many governments invest significant resources in public-diplomacy campaigns, there is little well-identified evidence of these efforts’ effectiveness. We examine the effects of a major type of public diplomacy: high-level visits by national leaders to other countries. We combine a dataset of the international travels of 15 leaders from 9 countries over 11 years, with worldwide surveys administered in 38 host countries. By comparing 32,456 respondents interviewed just before or just after the first day of each visit, we show that visiting leaders can increase public approval among foreign citizens. The effects do not fade away immediately and are particularly large when public-diplomacy activities are reported by the news media. In most cases, military capability differentials between visiting and host countries do not appear to confer an advantage in the influence of public diplomacy. These findings suggest that public diplomacy has the potential to shape global affairs through soft power.","[{""name"": ""BENJAMIN E.

10.1017/S0003055420000180,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Democracy by Mistake: How the Errors of Autocrats Trigger Transitions to Freer Government,"How does democracy emerge from authoritarian rule? Certain influential theories contend that incumbents deliberately choose to share or surrender power. They do so to prevent revolution, motivate citizens to fight wars, incentivize governments to provide public goods, outbid elite rivals, or limit factional violence. Examining the history of all democratizations since 1800, I show that such deliberate-choice arguments may help explain up to about one-third of the cases. In more than two-thirds, the evidence suggests that democratization occurred not because incumbents chose it but because, while trying to prevent it, they made mistakes that weakened their hold on power. Rather than being granted by farsighted elites or forced on them by the rise of new classes, democracy appears to have spread most often because of incumbents’ missteps that triggered previously latent factors.","[{""name"": ""DANIEL TREISMAN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781107045279"", ""10.1353/wp.0.0013"", ""10.1111/ajps.12135"", ""10.1177/0010414015581050"", ""10.1017/S0022278X15000361"", ""10.2307/421307"", ""10.1057/9781137271327"", ""10.2307/2096410"", ""10.1017/S1537592713002090"", ""10.7591/9780801455247"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815331.008"", ""10.1257/000282805774670059"", ""10.3998/mpub.10678"", ""10.1177/0951629811423121"", ""10.1017/S1537592712002873"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804946"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.041007.155222"", ""10.2307/2010470"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2014.08.001"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000146"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.537"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000434"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000162"", ""10.2307/2095882"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176040"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000635"", ""10.2307/2167062"", ""10.1177/0049124118769107"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00463.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.115"", ""10.3998/mpub.6576809"", ""10.1353/wp.1996.0023"", ""10.1016/0191-8869(93)90309-Q"", ""10.1515/9780804784931"", ""10.1177/0010414012463905"", ""10.1177/0022343314531004"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2004.03.002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511843686"", ""10.1353/wp.2003.0019"", ""10.1002/j.1662-6370.2008.tb00105.x"", ""10.1086/530560"", ""10.1177/0010414010370431"", ""10.2307/jj.12124966"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625626"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000134"", ""10.3917/polaf.078.0157"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060106.095434"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.05.003"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000287"", ""10.1057/9780333983362"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139225724"", ""10.5040/9798216972815"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817809"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000122"", ""10.1080/09636412.2015.1070602"", ""10.1162/0033553041382175"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511761836.002"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00595.x"", ""10.1007/s11135-016-0391-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139172493""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz227,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Consigned to hedge: south-east Asia and America's 'free and open Indo-Pacific' strategy,"Abstract This article assesses how south-east Asian countries and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have responded to the ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ (FOIP) strategies promoted by the United States and the other countries in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the ‘Quad’: US, Japan, Australia and India). Their nuanced ripostes imply a persistent commitment to hedging and shifting limited alignments in the face of growing great rivalry and the lack of a clear FOIP vision among Quad members. In the face of external pressure to take sides, the ASEAN states are likely to keep hedging through working selectively with China and the United States. Given the United States' apparent preference to balance China and Trump's disregard for multilateralism, ASEAN's ability to maintain its centrality in the evolving regional architecture is in doubt—despite the Quad countries' (belated) accommodation of ASEAN in their FOIP strategies. However, the success of the US strategy depends on Washington's ability to build and sustain the requisite coalition to balance Beijing. ASEAN has undertaken efforts to enhance bilateral security collaboration with China and the United States respectively. In doing so, ASEAN is arguably seeking to informally redefine its centrality in an era of Great Power discord and its ramifications for multilateralism.","[{""name"": ""See Seng Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Our paper contributes to this discussion by analyzing the formal representation of small disadvantaged communities in the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in California. Employing primary and secondary data, we model the likelihood of representation in the state's new Groundwater Sustainability Agencies based on key attributes of both the communities and governance settings. We find that the overall collaborative governance is associated with increased representation of these marginalized stakeholders. Importantly, however, even in collaborative settings representation of the smallest, most low‐income communities and those lacking political recognition via incorporated cities or public water districts still lags far behind their more advantaged counterparts. In fact, disparities in representation along these lines increased. Using a uniquely interdisciplinary approach our analysis highlights the opportunity afforded by integrating collaborative governance and environmental justice in the shared pursuit of effective and equitable institutions and the inter‐related goals of equity and sustainability.","[{""name"": ""Kristin B.

The current study investigated whether participants reduce their support of Republican and Democratic politicians when the prevalence of misinformation disseminated by the politicians appears to be high in comparison to the prevalence of their factual statements. We presented U.S. participants either with (1) equal numbers of false and factual statements from political candidates or (2) disproportionately more false than factual statements. Participants received fact‐checks as to whether items were true or false, then rerated both their belief in the statements as well as their feelings towards the candidate. Results indicated that when corrected misinformation was presented alongside equal presentations of affirmed factual statements, participants reduced their belief in the misinformation but did not reduce their feelings towards the politician. However, if there was considerably more misinformation retracted than factual statements affirmed, feelings towards both Republican and Democratic figures were reduced—although the observed effect size was extremely small.","[{""name"": ""Briony Swire‐Thompson"", ""affiliation"": [""Northeastern University""]}, {""name"": ""Ullrich K.

To answer this question, this article introduces a new empirical strategy for determining the effects of IMF programs that exploits the heterogeneous effect of IMF liquidity on loan allocation based on a difference-in-differences logic. The results show that IMF programs increase income inequality. An analysis of decile-specific income data shows that this effect is driven by absolute income losses for the poor and not by income gains for the rich. The effect persists for up to 5 years, and is stronger for IMF programs in democracies, and when policy conditions, particularly those that demand social-spending cuts and labor-market reforms, are more extensive.

Reviewing the IR literature on cyberspace and internet governance, this paper demonstrates that these debates rest on very traditional understandings of territory and the state, focusing on ways that hard-shelled “power containers” are recreated in cyberspace. Using a practice-oriented conceptual framework drawing on insights from critical geography, the paper highlights how state, corporate, and private actors deterritorialize and reterritorialize cyberspace. Results indicate that there are multiple ways to territorialize cyberspace beyond the reconstruction of the “national territory” and that a multitude of actors engage in territorializing practices. This allows for a more nuanced reevaluation of the “internet fragmentation” discourse.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Lambach"", ""affiliation"": [""Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main""]}]","[""10.1093/jogss/ogv003"", ""10.1017/S175297191000031X"", ""10.1080/14650049808407607"", ""10.1002/9780470773321"", ""10.1017/9781316534168.005"", ""10.1017/eis.2016.8"", ""10.37514/RNT-J.1996.3.6.21"", ""10.7228/manchester/9781526107459.003.0003"", ""10.2307/3312952"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199561131.003.0002"", ""10.1007/978-94-6265-207-1_6"", ""10.2307/202060"", ""10.1177/1354066110383997"", ""10.1023/A:1006996806674"", ""10.1177/0263276409350357"", ""10.1080/21622671.2017.1297253"", ""10.1177/0305829814562655"", ""10.1080/14747731.2014.887387"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7736.001.0001"", ""10.1017/aju.2017.57"", ""10.1177/030437549902400301"", ""10.1177/03058298030320030801"", ""10.1163/19426720-01803006"", ""10.1353/jod.2010.0010"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300181357.001.0001"", ""10.2307/20202392"", ""10.1111/misr.12023"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2005.00148.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226041285.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.01841.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2007.00243.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818303572022"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.060804.162744"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-030810-110815"", ""10.1017/S0002930000016894"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12310"", ""10.1111/polp.12093"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195152661.001.0001"", ""10.1111/geoj.12009"", ""10.1080/10630732.2011.578412"", ""10.1191/030913298671334137"", ""10.4324/9780203160787.pt3"", ""10.1177/03058298030320031001"", ""10.2307/2009421"", ""10.1177/1461444816639975"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12286"", ""10.1068/d9107"", ""10.2307/1229390"", ""10.1177/0309132513506270"", ""10.1017/9781316534168.002"", ""10.1177/0047117818763006"", ""10.1057/9780230101555"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199691586.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52168-8_2"", ""10.1177/1461444818757204"", ""10.4159/9780674973909"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00592.x"", ""10.14763/2016.3.425"", ""10.1068/d9107d"", ""10.1080/14650045.2012.738729"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262014595.001.0001"", ""10.1111/misr.12024"", ""10.1177/0162243914553803"", ""10.1191/0309132506ph599xx"", ""10.1177/1461444804041445"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8306.1994.tb01866.x"", ""10.1177/135485650501100102"", ""10.1080/14650049808407608"", ""10.1002/9780470998946.ch8"", ""10.1016/S0016-7185(00)00011-7"", ""10.1080/01402390.2011.608939"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68207-5_12"", ""10.4337/9781783472185.00007"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37481-4_11"", ""10.1017/9781316822524"", ""10.1080/13523260.2012.659597"", ""10.1080/01402390.2012.730485"", ""10.5235/JPRIVINTL.8.3.473"", ""10.2966/scrip.110214.153"", ""10.1017/9781316534168.009"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0328-0"", ""10.1177/030913259501900101"", ""10.1177/1461444812462850"", ""10.1007/s11077-013-9174-1"", ""10.1080/14650040903141356"", ""10.1007/s12399-016-0557-1"", ""10.1017/9781316534168.011"", ""10.1080/02684527.2012.708530"", ""10.1017/9781316534168.006"", ""10.1126/science.aaf5062"", ""10.1068/b3311""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

But it represents a minor challenge compared to the permanent havoc that runaway climate change threatens. Politicians and governments—some at least—are beginning to recognise the scale of the danger.In this article we assess the evolution of policy thinking on how to make climate transitions happen; the potential of the European Green Deal; and how progressives need to shape it and any UK counterpart to meet the challenges of modern society. The European initiative arises from a broad coalition spanning the political spectrum. Yet, its central thrust of active government offers the prospect of reviving a battered social democracy. We indicate the openings here for a pluralist, ecological left. The run‐up to the next global climate conference—COP26—will be a vital period which will show whether parties and governments across the world are prepared to meet the climate change challenge.","[{""name"": ""Jon Bloomfield"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fred Steward"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1162/isec_a_00377,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,The Political Power of Proxies: Why Nonstate Actors Use Local Surrogates,"Studies of conflicts involving the use of surrogates focus largely on states, viewing the relationship between sponsors and proxies primarily as one in which states utilize nonstate actors as proxies. They have devoted far less attention to sponsor-proxy arrangements in which nonstate actors play super-ordinate roles as sponsors in their own right. Why and how do nonstate actors sponsor proxies? Unlike state sponsors, which value proxies primarily for their military utility, nonstate sponsors select and utilize proxies mainly for their perceived political value. Simply put, states tend to sponsor military surrogates, whereas nonstate actors sponsor political ancillaries. Both endogenous actor-based traits and exogenous structural constraints account for these different approaches. An analysis of three case studies of nonstate sponsors that differ in terms of ideology and capacity—al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the People's Protection Units in Syria, and Hezbollah in Lebanon—confirms this argument, but also suggests that the ability and desire to control proxies varies with the sponsor's capacity. High-capacity nonstate sponsors such as Hezbollah behave similarly to state sponsors, but remain exceptional. Most nonstate sponsors are less dominant, rendering the relationships to their proxies more transactional and pragmatic, and ultimately less enduring than those of state sponsors and their clients.","[{""name"": ""Assaf Moghadam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michel Wyss"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09592318.2015.1129172"", ""10.1080/09592318.2015.1129171"", ""10.1080/14678800200590618"", ""10.1162/jcws.2006.8.4.98"", ""10.1080/09592318.2018.1455328"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000032"", ""10.2307/1964013"", ""10.2307/222714"", ""10.2307/2082512"", ""10.1080/03071848108523403"", ""10.1177/0047117818802436"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00473.x"", ""10.1177/002234338101800404"", ""10.1177/001083678401900405"", ""10.1111/j.1528-3585.2009.00389.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818311000233"", ""10.1080/03050629.2017.1414811"", ""10.1177/0022002715576747"", ""10.1080/09636412.2018.1508862"", ""10.1080/09546553.2015.1092437"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1243921"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.090803.161821"", ""10.1007/s10784-014-9243-8"", ""10.1080/09592318.2017.1322333"", ""10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331"", ""10.1080/13698249.2015.1115573"", ""10.1080/09592318.2017.1322337"", ""10.1080/13698249.2015.1115575"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogz005"", ""10.1080/13523260903077296"", ""10.1177/0022002798042003004"", ""10.2307/421717"", ""10.1162/isec.2006.31.1.49"", ""10.1080/09592318.2017.1322328"", ""10.1080/10576100801931321"", ""10.1080/07388940701860318"", ""10.1353/sais.2015.0023"", ""10.1080/14683857.2016.1246529"", ""10.6017/lev.v1i1.2151"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2012.720238""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055419000716,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Relational State Building in Areas of Limited Statehood: Experimental Evidence on the Attitudes of the Police,"Under what conditions does state expansion into limited statehood areas improve perceptions of state authority? Although previous work emphasizes identity or institutional sources of state legitimacy, I argue that relationships between state agents and citizens drive positive attitude formation, because these relationships provide information and facilitate social bonds. Moreover, when state agents and citizens share demographic characteristics, perceptional effects may improve. Finally, citizens finding procedural interactions between state agents and citizens unfair may adopt negative views about the state. I test these three propositions by randomizing household visits by male or female police officers in rural Liberia. These visits facilitated relationship building, leading to improved perceptions of police; shared demographic characteristics between police and citizens did not strengthen this effect. Perceptions of unfairness in the randomization led to negative opinions about police. The results imply that relationship building between state agents and citizens is an important part of state building.","[{""name"": ""SABRINA KARIM"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0003975600004239"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000837"", ""10.1177/1098611104271105"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1111/1540-5893.3703002"", ""10.1017/S0047404500018054"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316678527"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.03.001"", ""10.1007/s12116-008-9031-y"", ""10.1177/0002764209338795"", ""10.1515/9781400828609"", ""10.1080/17502977.2018.1504855"", ""10.2307/1959084"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7scrg"", ""10.1348/014466605X49618"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000121"", ""10.1037/a0011989"", ""10.1515/9781685853907"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000035"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.616"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000321"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1111/gove.12208"", ""10.1007/s12116-008-9028-6"", ""10.4324/9781315546681"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.3.1133"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790836"", ""10.1177/1557085108327659"", ""10.1080/17502977.2018.1531649"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00653.x"", ""10.1177/0002764209338797"", ""10.1126/science.aad9713"", ""10.1086/225197"", ""10.7591/9781501703836"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.01.003"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000493"", ""10.1177/1098611104271085"", ""10.1007/BF02887451"", ""10.1080/17502977.2018.1482126"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2009.01066.x"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751"", ""10.1111/gove.12091"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.40.1.99"", ""10.1080/13533312.2015.1059285"", ""10.1111/gove.12065"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-041916-023610"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000270"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316182468"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0262.2007.00733.x"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx015"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65"", ""10.1525/9780520340503"", ""10.1017/S000712341600017X""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Logistic regression was utilized to analyze the responses.ResultsWe found positive, statistically significant, and substantively impactful effects for trust in government and trust in physicians on the likelihood of COVID‐19 vaccine uptake, and null results for interpersonal trust.ConclusionsOur findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between trust and COVID‐19 vaccine uptake, and suggest that public health official as well as physicians should strive to increase the public's trust in the medical community.","[{""name"": ""Filip Viskupič"", ""affiliation"": [""The SDSU Poll, School of American and Global Studies South Dakota State University  Brookings South Dakota USA""]}, {""name"": ""David L.

10.1093/isr/viac003,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Taking Love and Care Seriously: An Emergent Research Agenda for Remaking Worlds in the Wake of Violence,"AbstractWhile research on armed conflict focuses primarily on violence and suffering, this article explores the practices of love and care that sit alongside these experiences of harm. Motivated by our omissions to pay sufficient attention to love and care in our research to date, we ask: How can centering practices of love and care illuminate different pathways for understanding the remaking of worlds in the wake of violence? Building on interdisciplinary literature, we conceptualize love and care as practices and potential sites of politics that shape how people survive and make sense of violence as well as imagine and enact lives in its wake. Drawing from our respective research in Colombia and Uganda, we argue that paying attention to love and care expands scholarly understandings of the sites associated with remaking a world, draws attention to the simultaneity of harms and care, sheds light on the textured meanings of politics and political work, and highlights ethical and narrative dilemmas regarding how to capture these political meanings without reducing their intricacies. For each of the pillars of our argument, we propose a set of questions and avenues that can shape emergent research agendas on taking love and care seriously in contexts of armed conflict.","[{""name"": ""Roxani Krystalli"", ""affiliation"": [""University of St Andrews School of International Relations, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Philipp Schulz"", ""affiliation"": [""GBUniversity of Bremen, Germany""]}]","[""10.1515/9780748691142"", ""10.14506/ca31.2.05"", ""10.1111/gwao.12459"", ""10.1177/0022343313519666"", ""10.1017/9781316480342"", ""10.1086/448875"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2011.01120.x"", ""10.1177/03058298211033027"", ""10.1525/california/9780520273788.001.0001"", ""10.2307/3207893"", ""10.1093/isr/vix005"", ""10.1177/1354066120946479"", ""10.1525/9780520924857"", ""10.1093/jrs/fey022"", ""10.1525/9780520938519"", ""10.1177/0022343309353097"", ""10.1177/0022343317714300"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70202-5_2"", ""10.14506/ca36.2.02"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2011.01119.x"", ""10.3998/mpub.170440"", ""10.1215/01642472-7971067"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000232"", ""10.4324/9781003025979"", ""10.1017/S1537592718002116"", ""10.1017/9781316711262"", ""10.4337/9781788114691.00019"", ""10.1080/14616742.2020.1861961"", ""10.1177/0964663920974072"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479881147.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315180458"", ""10.4324/9780429024160-4"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000426"", ""10.1111/AN.1073"", ""10.1093/jrs/feaa014"", ""10.1093/ijtj/ijr025"", ""10.1111/1467-9655.12044"", ""10.1177/030437549702200105"", ""10.1177/1755088213507183"", ""10.1353/hrq.2019.0032"", ""10.1093/jhuman/huz006"", ""10.1525/9780520972865"", ""10.1017/9781108919500.006"", ""10.1093/jrs/feaa109"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226230665.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203100943"", ""10.1093/ijtj/ijm011"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226113555.003.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520950535"", ""10.1177/0081176917712874"", ""10.1177/0967010620929176"", ""10.17763/haer.79.3.n0016675661t3n15"", ""10.1080/14616742.2013.876301"", ""10.1080/21647259.2019.1588453"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511596711.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511617690.004""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055422000806,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Rationalizing Democracy: The Perceptual Bias and (Un)Democratic Behavior,"Democracy often confronts citizens with a dilemma: stand firm on democracy while losing out on policy or accept undemocratic behavior and gain politically. Existing literature demonstrates that citizens generally choose the latter—and that they do so deliberately. Yet there is an alternative possibility. Citizens can avoid this uncomfortable dilemma altogether by rationalizing their understandings of democracy. When a politician advances undesired policies without violating democratic rules and norms, people find ways to perceive the behavior as undemocratic. When a politician acts undemocratically to promote desired policies, citizens muster up arguments for considering it democratic. Original survey experiments in the United States, and 22 democracies worldwide, provide strong support for this argument. It is thus not deliberate acceptance, but a fundamentally different perceptual logic that drives the widespread approval of undemocratic behavior in today’s democracies.","[{""name"": ""SUTHAN KRISHNARAJAN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/psrm.2021.51"", ""10.1353/jod.2007.a223229"", ""10.1080/13510347.2020.1842361"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1177/0010414013489081"", ""10.7910/DVN/WGPHFT"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S153759271900001X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1093/pan/mpn018"", ""10.1353/jod.1991.0033"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198766902.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1952868"", ""10.1561/100.00013140"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1094460"", ""10.18352/erlacs.9682"", ""10.2307/1960325"", ""10.1017/9781108688079"", ""10.1007/s11205-020-02517-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174046"", ""10.2307/2127359"", ""10.1080/13510347.2019.1590814"", ""10.1017/9781108347860"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226728827.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0000"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000052"", ""10.1080/13510347.2019.1582029"", ""10.1080/13510347.2021.1922390"", ""10.1177/1369148118768140"", ""10.1080/13510347.2021.1897109"", ""10.1177/1948550613476096"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000807"", ""10.1080/17457289.2020.1790577"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000801"", ""10.1177/0956797612447820"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00681.x"", ""10.1177/2053168019900822"", ""10.1016/j.cobeha.2020.01.003"", ""10.1111/pops.12582"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000459"", ""10.1515/9781503620766"", ""10.1017/S1537592711000880"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000149"", ""10.1177/1745691618767324"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3602209"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i3.1414"", ""10.1080/13510347.2021.1891413"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0045"", ""10.1017/S0007123400005305"", ""10.1037/xge0000974"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00601.x"", ""10.1353/wp.1997.0009"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793717.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.116.1.117"", ""10.1093/aristotelian/56.1.167"", ""10.1086/688343"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00926.x"", ""10.1037/h0057880"", ""10.1111/ajps.12628""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In this article, we use experiments to study American public reactions to revelations of foreign electoral intervention. We find that even modest forms of intervention polarize the public along partisan lines. Americans are more likely to condemn foreign involvement, lose faith in democracy, and seek retaliation when a foreign power sides with the opposition, than when a foreign power aids their own party. At the same time, Americans reject military responses to electoral attacks on the United States, even when their own political party is targeted.

New Evidence from Eighteen Consolidated Democracies, 1981-2018","AbstractDemocracies without democrats are not sustainable. Yet, recent studies have argued that Western citizens are turning their backs on the system of self-governance, thereby eroding the societal foundations of consolidated democracies. This study contributes to discussions about citizen support of democracy by (1) analyzing new cross-national survey data in 18 European countries that facilitate assessments of the temporal and geographical generalizability of previous findings, (2) disentangling age, cohort and period effects, thereby aligning the analytical methods with the theoretical arguments and (3) transparently reporting all evidence derived from pre-registered analyses to avoid cherry-picked findings. The findings show that citizens of consolidated democracies continue to endorse self-governance. Yet in some (but not all) countries, there is evidence of a growing number of ‘democrats in name only’, particularly among the young generation. These findings suggest a second phase in research on democratic fatigue that broadens the analytical scope for the multi-faceted nature of democratic support.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Wuttke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Konstantin Gavras"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Harald Schoen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000538"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-20484-0_10"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.06.003"", ""10.3998/mpub.13123"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1177/2053168018814332"", ""10.1177/2053168019900822"", ""10.1515/9781626375567"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.77"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0069"", ""10.4159/9780674984776"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0049"", ""10.1177/0002716218818058"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0014"", ""10.4232/1.13314"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0053"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00602.x"", ""10.1353/jod.1996.0031"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1007/s11135-017-0488-5"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000052"", ""10.3389/fevo.2018.00149"", ""10.1515/9781626375567"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0000"", ""10.1093/sf/soy114""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Gasol offers a wide variety of cost models that allow inferring the gas consumption associated to selected types of EVM instructions and/or inferring the number of times that such types of bytecode instructions are executed. Among others, we have cost models to measure only storage opcodes, to measure a selected family of gas-consumption opcodes following the Ethereum’s classification, to estimate the cost of a selected program line, etc. After choosing the desired cost model and the function of interest, Gasol returns to the user an upper bound of the cost for this function. As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions that access the storage, Gasol uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the selected function. Our tool can be used within an Eclipse plugin for which displays the gas and instructions bounds and, when applicable, the gas-optimized function.","[{""name"": ""Elvira Albert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesús Correas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Gordillo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guillermo Román-Díez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Rubio"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_46"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69166-2_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_30"", ""10.1145/3167084"", ""10.1145/2993600.2993611"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.1109/SANER.2017.7884650"", ""10.1145/3276486"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89722-6_10"", ""10.1145/3158136"", ""10.14722/ndss.2018.23082"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330560"", ""10.1145/2976749.2978309"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03427-6_33"", ""10.1145/3274694.3274743"", ""10.1145/3360611"", ""10.1145/3243734.3243780""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

At the same time, auditing has dramatically increased in scope and depth, and has also, to some extent, come to fill the role in policymaking previously played by evaluation studies. This article reviews this development from the perspective of policymaking and institutional change or “drift.” Specifically, we look at the types of information and knowledge that are lost and gained as a result of these developments. We apply a cross‐national approach, drawing on the examples from the European and North American contexts.","[{""name"": ""B.

We address this question by analyzing the actions of technocratic populists in power during the first wave of the novel coronavirus crisis in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. We identify three features of the populist pandemic response. First, populists bypassed established, institutionalized channels of crisis response. Second, they engaged in erratic yet responsive policy making. These two features are ubiquitous to populism. The third feature, specific to technocratic populism, is the politicization of expertise in order to gain legitimacy. Technocratic populists in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia weaponized medical expertise for political purposes.","[{""name"": ""Lenka Buštíková"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pavol Baboš"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3370"", ""10.1111/spsr.12232"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0038"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787160"", ""10.1177/0888325419900244"", ""10.1080/13698230.2014.995504"", ""10.1017/nps.2020.35"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787161"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2008.03.006"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.1156"", ""10.1177/0888325418791723"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2009.10.007"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1598062"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107446663"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0047"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226184807.001.0001"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787162"", ""10.1086/705570"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3420"", ""10.3167/dt.2020.070207"", ""10.1080/21599165.2018.1493457"", ""10.1080/10758216.2019.1580590"", ""10.1017/9781108644655"", ""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532635"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12597"", ""10.1177/001041400003300607"", ""10.1080/10758216.2016.1200952"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510298"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.13"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0026"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3412"", ""10.1057/s41269-016-0032-y"", ""10.1017/S0043887110000043"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12356"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070753"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787163"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3348"", ""10.1017/S1537592719003955"", ""10.1017/gov.2019.21""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Why, then, has the EU recently embraced open strategic autonomy as the conceptual cornerstone of its renewed trade policy? In this article, we argue that this move away from neoliberalism has to be understood against the background of a changing global environment. The geopoliticization of trade in particular has changed the Commission's view about how to best serve European interests (and values) but also provided an opening for neo‐mercantilist and socially oriented actors to challenge Europe's embedded neoliberal compromise. Using document analysis, interviews and discourse network analysis, we show how the Commission used open strategic autonomy as a coalition magnet to mobilize support for its new doctrine of qualified openness. Our paper contributes to understanding the ideational and coalitional politics behind the recent evolution of EU trade policy as well as broader debates around European autonomy and sovereignty.","[{""name"": ""Luuk Schmitz"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political and Social Science European University Institute  Fiesole Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Timo Seidl"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for European Integration Research University of Vienna  Vienna Austria""]}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.3873804"", ""10.4324/9780203166802"", ""10.1093/cjip/poac009"", ""10.1080/17530350.2019.1574867"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1115533"", ""10.1177/1354066115612558"", ""10.1080/13563467.2020.1806222"", ""10.2307/j.ctvrs8zfp"", ""10.54648/EERR2022012"", ""10.1215/9780822381815-003"", ""10.2307/422246"", ""10.54648/EERR2022010"", ""10.1111/jcms.13348"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.818325"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-01968-5_3"", ""10.1111/jcms.13184"", ""10.4324/9781351047647"", ""10.1111/jcms.12932"", ""10.2307/2010572"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198295457.001.0001"", ""10.1162/002081801551414"", ""10.1080/13501763.2021.1881589"", ""10.1057/9781137331663"", ""10.4159/9780674919808"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-01968-5_4"", ""10.1111/1467‐856X.12022"", ""10.4337/9781785367472.00022"", ""10.4324/9781315189871""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Previous research suggests that perceptions of public opinion are often distorted. However, it remains unclear (1) why reelection-seeking officials misperceive public preferences and (2) how to mitigate these distorted beliefs. I argue that misperceptions result from unequal exposure to different subconstituencies and a tendency of legislators to project their own preferences on voters. I find support for these arguments in a six-wave panel of Swedish MPs combined with mass surveys. Elite beliefs disproportionately reflect the preferences of privileged voters and the personal positions of legislators. Additionally, an experiment with Swiss representatives leveraging real political events reveals how misperceptions can be reduced by encouraging a more balanced exposure to voters. The study concludes that economic and political inequalities are rooted in elite beliefs about the electorate and reveals ways to bolster the links between voters and their representatives.","[{""name"": ""MIGUEL M.

Breadwinning, Motherhood, and Women's Decisions to Run for Office","Women’s underrepresentation in American politics is often attributed to relatively low levels of political ambition. Yet scholarship still grapples with a major leak in the pipeline to power: that many qualified and politically ambitious women decide against candidacy. Focusing on women with political ambition, we theorize that at the final stage of candidate emergence, household income, breadwinning responsibilities, and household composition are interlocking obstacles to women’s candidacies. We examine these dynamics through a multimethod design that includes an original survey of women most likely to run for office: alumnae of the largest Democratic campaign training organization in the United States. Although we do not find income effects, we provide evidence that breadwinning—responsibility for a majority of household income—negativelyaffects women’s ambition, especially for mothers. These findings have important implications for understanding how the political economy of the household affects candidate emergence and descriptive representation in the United States.","[{""name"": ""RACHEL BERNHARD"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SHAUNA SHAMES"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""DAWN LANGAN TEELE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0003055411000293"", ""10.2307/2110091"", ""10.1111/lsq.12075"", ""10.31235/osf.io/7uy8w"", ""10.2307/2111628"", ""10.1177/106591296902200204"", ""10.1086/711176"", ""10.2307/2130975"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000551"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv001"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9498-9"", ""10.1561/100.00014087"", ""10.1111/ajps.12158"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1bj4rv1"", ""10.2307/2647774"", ""10.2307/1959283"", ""10.1017/S0003055406062101"", ""10.2307/2083079"", ""10.1007/s13524-015-0440-z"", ""10.1111/pops.12268"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00069.x"", ""10.1177/106591290605900206"", ""10.1561/100.00015126"", ""10.1093/sf/sos120"", ""10.1111/ajps.12351"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2014.955406"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00146"", ""10.1111/ajps.12300"", ""10.1080/21565503.2016.1208105"", ""10.2307/j.ctvj7wkxt"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00467.x"", ""10.1080/21565503.2018.1541417"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199322428.001.0001"", ""10.1080/17457289.2010.511806"", ""10.1257/jel.50.4.1051"", ""10.1080/21565503.2018.1557057"", ""10.1086/267222"", ""10.1017/9781108869287"", ""10.2307/2110733"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000217"", ""10.2307/2111039"", ""10.1080/21565503.2015.1066689"", ""10.7560/745643"", ""10.2307/2110769"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00166.x"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2014.955403"", ""10.2307/2128831"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00098"", ""10.1080/21565503.2018.1531772"", ""10.2307/2110294"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000606"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000404"", ""10.2307/2952362"", ""10.1177/0010414012463884"", ""10.1080/21565503.2015.1031802"", ""10.2307/2129937"", ""10.2307/2132069"", ""10.1080/21565503.2018.1532917"", ""10.1080/21565503.2014.992792"", ""10.1086/708644"", ""10.1023/A:1021431114955"", ""10.1086/693984"", ""10.1111/ajps.12391"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2015.04.019"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00147.x"", ""10.2307/2647821"", ""10.1515/9781685854515"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001473"", ""10.5040/9798216009023"", ""10.1111/jomf.12351"", ""10.4159/9780674029088""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Their results reveal an extraordinary relationship between peacekeepers and peace, notwithstanding a number of well-known problems. This review article has three goals. The first is to summarize the results of past empirical research to move the debate beyond the question ofwhetherpeacekeeping works to the more pressing questions of how, when and why it works. The second is to reveal the limitations of the current quantitative research in order to identify areas in which scholars can make big, new contributions to the field. The final goal is to propose a new research agenda that is heavily evaluative – one that informs policy makers about the specific practices, mission compositions, and mandates that work, and identifies the local, regional, and international conditions that amplify or diminish peacekeeping's effectiveness. This type of research could help reduce the costs of peacekeeping operations, eliminate some of the negative consequences of interventions and save even more lives.","[{""name"": ""Barbara F.

10.1093/ser/mwz025,SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology; 0201 Theoretical Economics; 0202 Applied Economics,Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Black-White child poverty gap in the United States,"AbstractBlack children in the USA are more than twice as likely as white children to live in poverty. While past research has primarily attributed this phenomenon to the family structure of black children, this article investigates how state-level heterogeneity in social assistance programs contributes to the black–white child poverty gap. I find that racial inequities in states’ administration of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program contributed to the impoverishment of approximately 256 000 black children per year from 2012–2014. State-year panel data demonstrates that states with larger percentages of black residents are less likely to prioritize the ‘provision of cash assistance’, but more likely to allocate funds toward the ‘discouragement of lone motherhood’. Neutralizing inequities in states’ TANF spending priorities would reduce the black–white child poverty gap by up to 15%—comparable to the reduction effect of moving all children in single-mother households to two-parent households.","[{""name"": ""Zachary Parolin"", ""affiliation"": [""Columbia University, New York, USA""]}]","[""10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00032-6"", ""10.4135/9781412993869"", ""10.1136/jech.2007.064295"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.7"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195385878.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0003122413501859"", ""10.1086/693678"", ""10.1086/674005"", ""10.1177/0003122413476712"", ""10.1177/0731121416656843"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00075.x"", ""10.1086/422587"", ""10.3386/w19789"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226293660.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2011.10.016"", ""10.1177/001979390305600208"", ""10.1177/153244000100100103"", ""10.1177/1532673X17701222"", ""10.1093/esr/jcn064"", ""10.7591/9781501728822"", ""10.1002/pam.1003"", ""10.1086/690118"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195079197.001.0001"", ""10.1002/pam.10075"", ""10.3998/mpub.11932"", ""10.2307/2669347"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00328.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226768786.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16171-3"", ""10.2307/2657265""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Under specified conditions, initial increases in polarization may change the meso-environment, including such features as state parties, the structure of media, and the configuration of interest groups. These shifts can in turn influence other aspects of politics, leading to a further intensification of polarization. This analysis has four important benefits: ( a) It directs our attention to the meso-institutional environment of the American polity; ( b) it clarifies the features of the polity that have traditionally limited the extent and duration of polarization, and the reasons why their contemporary impact may be attenuated; ( c) it helps us analyze asymmetrical, or party-specific, aspects of polarization; and ( d) it provides an analytic foundation that connects discussions of American politics to the comparative politics literature on democratic backsliding.","[{""name"": ""Paul Pierson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA;,""]}, {""name"": ""Eric Schickler"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA;,""]}]","[""10.1515/9780804778923-006"", ""10.1177/0002716216662604"", ""10.1017/S1537592712001624"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123407000269"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226307312.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11127-018-0543-3"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy051"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199891702.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a037411"", ""10.1017/S0003055404041395"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190626594.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S153759271700425X"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001637"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226609607.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315544427"", ""10.1017/S0898588X18000081"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000501"", ""10.1017/9781108123594"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226530406.001.0001"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226626130.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812620"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316091906.015"", ""10.1017/9781108673266"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316471050"", ""10.1017/S0898588X17000104"", ""10.3998/ump.13855466.0001.001"", ""10.2307/1950835"", ""10.1017/S000305541000016X"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.070204.105138"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226470771.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-072012-113747"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226409184.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592718002128"", ""10.1177/106591290505800102"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003286"", ""10.1353/jod.2005.0026"", ""10.1525/9780520329294"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226555812.001.0001"", ""10.1257/aer.20160812"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1093/wentk/9780190867782.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv941trn"", ""10.1515/9781400837502-006"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12323"", ""10.1017/9781108692793.007"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199559947.003.0023"", ""10.1515/9781400880973"", ""10.1017/9781108667357.006"", ""10.2307/3124674"", ""10.1515/9781400837502-007"", ""10.1017/S1537592716001122"", ""10.1017/S0898588X05000106"", ""10.1177/1532673X18788050""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

However, producing such products is knowledge‐intensive and requires quality intermediate inputs and advanced technologies. Integration into global trade networks is increasingly argued to be among the pathways to obtain such inputs and technologies, although not all countries may benefit equally from such integration. This paper builds on these arguments and investigates how participation in the global value chain (GVC) affects the quality of exported products. Using a highly disaggregated product‐level export data from 122 countries, we find that participation in (backward and forward) GVC impacts positively on the quality of exported products and brings the quality level closer to the quality frontier. While this result persists in the sub‐sample comprising developed countries, developing countries only benefit from backward GVC participation. Overall, the results indicate that GVC participation matters to export upgrading but points to a potential heterogeneity on the channel of impact across countries at different levels of development.","[{""name"": ""Gideon Ndubuisi"", ""affiliation"": [""UNU MERIT/Maastricht University Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Solomon Owusu"", ""affiliation"": [""UNU MERIT/Maastricht University Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.010"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.05.021"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00271"", ""10.5089/9781484311493.001"", ""10.1111/twec.12189"", ""10.5089/9781513542300.001"", ""10.1007/s10290‐013‐0175‐0"", ""10.1162/qjec.2006.121.2.541"", ""10.1111/twec.12882"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐9701.2007.01042.x"", ""10.1111/twec.12801"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2016.10.005"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00524"", ""10.2307/4621668"", ""10.1016/S0022‐1996(98)00075‐0"", ""10.1080/09692290.2012.756414"", ""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.4.1727"", ""10.1257/aer.98.5.1978"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2005.04.001"", ""10.1257/aer.20150443"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00226"", ""10.1007/s10887‐006‐9009‐4"", ""10.1057/s41308‐020‐00110‐8"", ""10.1016/S0022‐1996(00)00093‐3"", ""10.1257/0002828054201396"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.07.001"", ""10.1093/wbro/lku010"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2012.08.005"", ""10.1111/j.1467-937X.2010.00602.x"", ""10.1257/aer.103.6.2169"", ""10.1257/aer.104.2.459"", ""10.1016/0305‐750X(92)90097‐F"", ""10.1080/09535314.2013.769938"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2017.08.006"", ""10.1080/13600810701848144"", ""10.1086/661218"", ""10.1080/00220388.2019.1702159"", ""10.5089/9781513519227.001"", ""10.1504/IJTLID.2008.021964"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.05.013"", ""10.1016/S0022‐1996(98)00009‐9"", ""10.1111/j.1749-124X.2006.00038.x"", ""10.1007/s10290‐012‐0139‐9"", ""10.5089/9781513583709.001"", ""10.1093/jeg/lby056"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.2.489"", ""10.1016/j.eneco.2019.104561"", ""10.1111/ecot.12155"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.05.017""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1017/S0007123417000448,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,How Exposure to Violence Affects Ethnic Voting,"How does wartime exposure to ethnic violence affect the political preferences of ordinary citizens? Are high-violence communities more or less likely to reject the politicization of ethnicity post-war? We argue that community-level experience with wartime violence solidifies ethnic identities, fosters intra-ethnic cohesion and increases distrust toward non-co-ethnics, thereby making ethnic parties the most attractive channels of representation and contributing to the politicization of ethnicity. Employing data on wartime casualties at the community level and pre- as well as post-war election results in Bosnia, we find strong support for this argument. The findings hold across a number of robustness checks. Using post-war survey data, we also provide evidence that offers suggestive support for the proposed causal mechanism.","[{""name"": ""Dino Hadzic"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Carlson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Margit Tavits"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1469-8219.00075"", ""10.1177/0032329211424721"", ""10.1177/1468796809354153"", ""10.1177/0022343316668390"", ""10.1257/jel.48.1.3"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2005.00381.x"", ""10.1080/00045600903260671"", ""10.1017/S002081831500020X"", ""10.5129/001041508X12911362383390"", ""10.1177/0022002712459714"", ""10.1111/ajps.12067"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107478046"", ""10.1177/0022343301038001002"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2015.08.001"", ""10.1257/aer.102.2.941"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.082103.104832"", ""10.1093/oep/gpv036"", ""10.1162/003355399556269"", ""10.1177/0022343301038002002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510458"", ""10.1126/science.1202599"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.08.008"", ""10.1162/002081800551398"", ""10.1080/13510340701245777"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000103"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000216"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2009.00363.x"", ""10.1057/9781403919823_5"", ""10.1017/S002238161300131X"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.07.012"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090212"", ""10.1007/s10887-013-9091-3"", ""10.1177/0022002702046001004"", ""10.1017/9781108573481"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199893157.001.0001"", ""10.1006/juec.1996.2035"", ""10.1177/0022343312439202"", ""10.1080/13510347.2012.688032"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.02.012"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00444.x"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00275"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808661"", ""10.1093/restud/rdt003"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000038"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808685"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2008.00135.x"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2015.05.007"", ""10.1111/ajps.12144"", ""10.1080/09668130903506839"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00273.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

After reviewing existing literature on health diplomacy, I argue for the utility of distinguishing states’ aims from their practices of health diplomacy in advancing our understanding of when states engage in health diplomacy with a bilateral, regional, or global scope. The recent history of twenty-first century infectious disease outbreaks suggests a possible move away from health diplomacy with global participation. COVID-19 provides numerous examples, from widespread criticism of the World Health Organization to increased bilateral health aid and the creation of a regional vaccine initiative. As pandemics become more frequent, however, more localized health diplomacy is likely to be less effective, given the necessity of global mitigation and containment.","[{""name"": ""Tanisha M.

I show how the Islamically rooted Justice and Development Party governments and their allies used women's rights in constructing authoritarian rule and promoting a conservative gender agenda. The governing elites had different needs at different political stages and instrumentalized women's rights to meet those needs. First, they needed to legitimize their rule in a secular context, so they expanded liberal laws on women's rights. Second, in the process of backsliding, they sought to construct and legitimize their conservative ideology, so they reinterpreted existing laws to promote conservative goals. Finally, they wanted to mobilize conservative women in support of the newly authoritarian regime, so they built new institutions and marginalized existing women's NGOs. The article contributes to the literature on regime types and gender rights by shifting the focus from regime type to regime change.","[{""name"": ""Yeşim Arat"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/sp/jxx011"", ""10.1080/13608746.2011.571919"", ""10.1080/14683849.2018.1539622"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1373096"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i3.1423"", ""10.1017/9781108638906"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190936198.001.0001"", ""10.1093/sp/jxp014"", ""10.1080/13510347.2016.1256285"", ""10.1017/npt.2018.10"", ""10.1080/13608740600856561"", ""10.1080/03932729.2015.1020651"", ""10.1080/19448950903507388"", ""10.1111/ajps.12557"", ""10.1080/13608740500037916"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00095"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628"", ""10.1080/23760818.2016.1201242"", ""10.1080/13510347.2011.584732"", ""10.1080/13608746.2011.600555"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199751457.013.0020"", ""10.1080/14616740701259846"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2016.1198656"", ""10.5040/9780755607471"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1135732"", ""10.1177/1350506816679003"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0026"", ""10.1080/13510347.2020.1753701"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815089"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521620963.016"", ""10.1080/14683857.2017.1379148"", ""10.1177/0010414018797954"", ""10.1017/9781108348621"", ""10.1017/S1743923X1500001X"", ""10.1080/19448953.2017.1328887"", ""10.1353/jod.1996.0047"", ""10.1080/13608740500037973"", ""10.1017/9781139022385"", ""10.1093/sp/jxt018"", ""10.1353/jod.2003.0042"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2012.10.001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

In this article, we conceptualize the so‐called gig economy along four dimensions, namely, online intermediation, independent contractors, paid tasks, and personal services. Using this framework, it is possible to derive both a narrow definition of the gig economy, as ex ante specified, paid tasks carried out by independent contractors mediated by online platforms, and broader definitions that include offline alongside online intermediation, employees alongside independent contractors, unpaid tasks alongside paid tasks, and asset sharing alongside performing gigs. The four dimensions also span four key regulatory questions: How should online platforms be classified and regulated; how should gig workers be classified and regulated; what should count as paid and unpaid work; and should we treat earnings from performing gigs differently than earnings from sharing assets? We conclude that the positions taken on these regulatory issues are essentially contingent upon political choices and will determine how the gig economy evolves in the future.","[{""name"": ""Nikos Koutsimpogiorgos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jaap van Slageren"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea M.

10.1017/S1752971920000111,INTERNATIONAL THEORY,0302 Political Science,"Anxiety, time, and agency","AbstractThis article scrutinizes two concepts central to the ontological security framework, agency and anxiety. Its point of departure is the view that conceptions of agency are expressed in the attempt to become ontologically secure, which requires a more careful look at how humans try to satisfy the need for a ‘stable sense of Self’ by putting in place ‘anxiety controlling mechanisms’. This, in turn, raises the question what these mechanisms are supposed to control, which shifts attention to the concept of ‘anxiety’. Going back to Kierkegaard's original treatment and Heidegger's existential phenomenology, the article reviews the emergence of anxiety as a core feature of the human condition and highlights what it calls the ‘anxiety paradox’: the tendency of reflexive humans facing the freedom of being in time to attach themselves to constructs that provide a sense of temporal continuity, or certainty. The article argues that the existing ontological security literature is trapped in this paradox and therefore cannot account for radical forms of agency.","[{""name"": ""Felix Berenskötter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0305829817741255"", ""10.1017/S0260210505006613"", ""10.1111/isqu.12091"", ""10.1023/B:MAWO.0000003937.47171.a9"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000093"", ""10.1080/14747731.2014.971542"", ""10.1177/1354066196002004002"", ""10.1080/09636412.2011.549023"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1177/0305829813500371"", ""10.1177/030437549401900404"", ""10.3998/mpub.155507"", ""10.1177/1354066198004002004"", ""10.1017/S0260210510001166"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000135"", ""10.1215/9780822386551"", ""10.1177/1354066109350055"", ""10.1086/231294"", ""10.1080/13523260.2012.693776"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139226578"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000147"", ""10.1177/0010836716653161"", ""10.1177/1354066117739096"", ""10.1177/1354066112445290"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00669.x"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.1080/09636412.2010.505128"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719073021.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1354066105055482"", ""10.1017/S026021051600019X"", ""10.1111/ips.12103"", ""10.1177/1354066197003003004"", ""10.1177/030437540202700305"", ""10.1017/S002081830002751X"", ""10.7591/9781501716980"", ""10.1177/0010836716653158"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511819766"", ""10.4324/9780203998014"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000123"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000222"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000039""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

How often do they disclose this fact? By suppression effects, we mean control-variable-induced increases in estimated effect sizes. Researchers generally scrutinize suppression effects as they want reassurance that authors have a strong explanation for them, especially when the statistical significance of the key finding depends on them. In a reanalysis of observational studies from a leading journal, we find that over 30% of articles depend on suppression effects for statistical significance. Although increases in key effect estimates from including control variables are of course potentially justifiable, none of the articles justify or disclose them. These findings may point to a hole in the review process: journals are accepting articles that depend on suppression effects without readers, reviewers, or editors being made aware.","[{""name"": ""Gabriel S.

It thereafter draws on the disproportionate policy perspective to ascertain the ideas and sensitivities that placed key policy responses on trajectories which prioritized differential policy responses over general, nation-wide solutions (and vice versa), even though data in the public domain supported the selection of opposing policy solutions on epidemiological or social welfare grounds. The article also gauges the consequences and implications of the policy choices made in the fight against COVID-19 for the disproportionate policy perspective. It argues that Prime Minister Netanyahu employed disproportionate policy responses both at the rhetorical level and on the ground in the fight against COVID-19; that during the crisis, Netanyahu enjoyed wide political leeway to employ disproportionate policy responses, and the general public exhibited a willingness to tolerate this; and (iii) that ascertaining the occurrence of disproportionate policy responses is not solely a matter of perception.","[{""name"": ""Moshe Maor"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Raanan Sulitzeanu-Kenan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science & the Federmann School of Public Policy, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel""]}, {""name"": ""David Chinitz"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Health, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-8500.2010.00694.x"", ""10.1001/rhc3.12193"", ""10.1017/S0143814X1200013X"", ""10.1007/s11077-014-9203-8"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9259-8"", ""10.1332/030557317X14843233064353"", ""10.1017/S0143814X19000278"", ""10.1332/030557320X15894563823146"", ""10.1101/2020.05.21.20104521"", ""10.1007/s11077-020-09381-4""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Yet prior framing studies have reached mixed conclusions, and few have provided systematic cumulative evidence. This study evaluates the overall efficacy of different types of framing effects in the political domain by systematically meta-analyzing this large and diverse literature. A combined analysis of 138 experiments reveals that when examined across contexts, framing exerts medium-sized effects on citizens' political attitudes and emotions. However, framing effects on behavior are negligible, and small effects are also found in more realistic studies employing frame competition. These findings suggest that although elites can influence citizens by framing issues, their capacity to do so is constrained. Overall, citizens appear to be more competent than some scholars envision them to be.","[{""name"": ""Eran Amsalem"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alon Zoizner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1006/obhd.1998.2781"", ""10.1515/commun-2013-0011"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000253"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.3.515"", ""10.1002/9780470743386"", ""10.1023/A:1015006907312"", ""10.1093/poq/nfx019"", ""10.1177/0002716214555066"", ""10.1177/1077699011430064"", ""10.4135/9781412985031"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.4135/9781412976046.n14"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00100"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02784.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107477971"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00582.x"", ""10.1080/10810730701615198"", ""10.1177/107769900908600206"", ""10.1017/XPS.2017.1"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000363"", ""10.1037/a0020142"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9418-4"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452.004"", ""10.1002/jrsm.5"", ""10.1177/2053168018783370"", ""10.1111/jcom.12184"", ""10.1073/pnas.98.3.831"", ""10.2307/1962487"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00573.x"", ""10.1007/s10584-017-1952-x"", ""10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00455.x"", ""10.1177/1532673X18772276"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226388533.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jcom.12134"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00353.x"", ""10.2307/2952075"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9114-0"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054"", ""10.1515/9780691188386-007"", ""10.1177/0093650209333028"", ""10.1037/amp0000364"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000216"", ""10.1080/10584609.2011.568041"", ""10.4135/9781412976046.n15"", ""10.1017/xps.2014.2"", ""10.1080/15205436.2015.1068811"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000410"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9056-y"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070554"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033600"", ""10.1023/A:1015063108221"", ""10.1037/a0033242"", ""10.1080/23808985.2013.11679151""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiaa230,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,"Populism, nationalism and revisionist foreign policy","Abstract Over the past decade, we have seen the rise of populist nationalist heads of state across a number of important electoral democracies—all of whom have made some version of the promise to make their countries ‘great again’. However, scholars are divided over whether these leaders' sometimes bombastic rhetoric has consistent or predictable effects on state foreign policy. This article introduces a framework for mapping the effects of populism and nationalism in foreign policy. In doing so, it draws on Essex School discourse analysis and sociological frame analysis to argue that representational crises at the sub-state level increase the popular resonance of ‘sovereigntist frames’ that diagnose the causes of perceived gaps in representation of the ‘authentic’ sovereign community at the international level and enjoin chief executives to resolve these gaps through revisionist foreign policy practices. The ethno-nationalist master frame prescribes policies and practices of lateral revisionism (conflict with neighbours or rival states), the populist frame prescribes systemic revisionism (conflict with allies and the international ‘establishment’), while the ethno-populist frame prescribes omni-revisionism (conflict with both). The article illustrates the effects of these disparate sovereigntist movements across three paired case-studies drawn from Europe, Latin America and the United States. It concludes that nationalism has greater destructive effects for the international system when combined with populism, demonstrating the importance of distinguishing nationalism and populism conceptually in order to isolate their separate and combined effects on foreign policy.","[{""name"": ""Erin K Jenne"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

However, the US has a decentralized form of federalism that administers democratic institutions at the state level. Using 51 indicators of electoral democracy from 2000 to 2018, I develop a measure of subnational democratic performance, the State Democracy Index. I then test theories of democratic expansion and backsliding based in party competition, polarization, demographic change, and the group interests of national party coalitions. Difference-in-differences results suggest a minimal role for all factors except Republican control of state government, which dramatically reduces states’ democratic performance during this period. This result calls into question theories focused on changes within states. The racial, geographic, and economic incentives of groups innationalparty coalitions may instead determine the health of democracy in the states.","[{""name"": ""JACOB M.

In this research note, we explore the determinants of implementing stay-at-home orders, focusing on governors’ characteristics in the early stage of the pandemic. In our most conservative estimate, being a Democratic governor increased the probability of implementing a stay-at-home order by more than 50%. Moreover, we found that the probability of implementing a statewide stay-at-home order was about 40% more likely for governors without term limits than governors with term limits. We also found that Democratic governors and governors without term limits were significantly faster to adopt statewide orders than Republican governors and governors with term limits.

10.1093/jogss/ogz075,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES,0302 Political Science,Authoritarian Powers and Norm Contestation in the Liberal International Order: Theorizing the Power Politics of Ideas and Identity,"AbstractAre rising authoritarian powers such as China and Russia converging towards or challenging the normative structures of the liberal international order? This article argues that scholarship on norm contestation provides a fruitful theoretical avenue for addressing this question. It finds, however, that this literature has problematically tended to either overlook or externalize power dynamics from norm contestation. The article therefore proposes and develops a power political approach to norm contestation that, informed by a realpolitik sensibility, more explicitly and consistently makes power central to the analysis. A power political perspective conceptualizes norm contestation as the expression of battles for influence in world politics that take place at the ideational level and through symbolic instruments. It understands these struggles as occurring in the context of an international system profoundly marked by conflicting interests, cultural pluralism, hierarchical structures, and power asymmetries. This power political lens is then used to identify four modes of contestation that Russian and Chinese actors are engaged in: liberal performance, liberal mimicry, civilizational essentialization, and counter-norm entrepreneurship. It empirically explores how these contestatory practices express themselves at different intensity levels—applicatory, meaning, and validity—and display specific power political logics—fragmenting and integrative—with the goal of undermining the ideational hegemony of liberal Western-based actors and structures in world politics, and advancing alternative non-liberal visions of domestic and international order. Along with contributing to the literature on norms, this article also makes a broader intervention in current debates about rising powers and the future of the liberal international order.","[{""name"": ""Gregorio Bettiza"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Exeter""]}, {""name"": ""David Lewis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Exeter""]}]","[""10.1017/S0020818304582024"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00637.x"", ""10.1111/isqu.12171"", ""10.1080/01436597.2016.1154433"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2005.00532.x"", ""10.1080/10286632.2015.1042471"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000267"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199590636.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750410"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050010"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691173047.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203944691"", ""10.1111/misr.12100"", ""10.1177/1354066114542663"", ""10.2307/778467"", ""10.1177/0305829817702446"", ""10.1017/S026021051500025X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139031042"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy037"", ""10.1080/13600826.2015.1092424"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00830.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12088"", ""10.1177/2057891116647806"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2017.1293394"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00112"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050289"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0049"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy041"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197265529.001.0001"", ""10.1353/chn.2014.0006"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000219"", ""10.1111/j.1528-3585.2012.00458.x"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000402"", ""10.1177/1354066115601200"", ""10.1007/s11366-015-9344-4"", ""10.1080/135017699343342"", ""10.7591/9781501707384"", ""10.1017/S0043887109000082"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1017/S0260210506007017"", ""10.1162/isec.2009.33.3.110"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogv007"", ""10.1080/14672715.2016.1263803"", ""10.4324/9780203071748"", ""10.1177/1354066115578952"", ""10.1002/j.1538-165X.2011.tb00700.x"", ""10.1162/isec.23.1.171"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1184230"", ""10.2307/20045621"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2006.00512.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7rjt2"", ""10.1093/ia/iix277"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0100-6"", ""10.1017/S1537592713002107"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559044"", ""10.1177/1354066107074284"", ""10.1177/1354066110380963"", ""10.1080/14678802.2014.930589"", ""10.1080/17502977.2016.1276677"", ""10.1515/pce-2016-0002"", ""10.1017/S0260210510001580"", ""10.1080/00396338.2014.920144"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00353"", ""10.1177/03058298050330031601"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000126"", ""10.1177/0047117808100607"", ""10.1093/cjip/poq016"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1017/S0260210516000188"", ""10.1177/1354066111407690"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001582"", ""10.1162/002081898550671"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy040"", ""10.2307/20044496"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12104"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000261"", ""10.1162/002081800551109"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777.002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195337235.001.0001"", ""10.1162/002081801551414"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy036"", ""10.1080/00905992.2014.917075"", ""10.4324/9781315560991"", ""10.1080/14650040600598585"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jird.1800130"", ""10.1080/01436590902867300"", ""10.1162/isec.2005.29.4.5"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1095736"", ""10.1017/S0021911815001187"", ""10.1080/10758216.2015.1113884"", ""10.1017/S0305741015000855"", ""10.1080/13698230601122412"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-55235-9"", ""10.1086/690100"", ""10.1017/S0020818304040202"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000534"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000141"", ""10.1080/13504630600555559"", ""10.1057/9780230337589""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0143814X21000088,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Are policymakers responsive to public demand in climate politics?,"AbstractNormative theories of democracy agree that public demand should be the main guide in policymaking. But positive theories and related empirical research disagree about the extent to which this holds true in reality. We address this debate with an empirical focus on climate change policy. Specifically, we are interested in whether observable variation in public demand for climate change mitigation can help explain variation in adopted national climate policies. Using our own data to approximate public demand, we estimate the responsiveness of policymakers to changes in public demand in six OECD countries from 1995 to 2010. We find that policymakers are responsive and react in predicted ways to variation in our opinion component of measured public demand, rather than to the mere salience of the climate issue. The effect of issue salience is strongest in combination with our opinion measure as this creates a scope for action. The results underscore the importance and usefulness of our concept and empirical measures for public demand, as well as of our disaggregated analysis of climate policy outputs in this area.","[{""name"": ""Lena Maria Schaffer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bianca Oehl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Bernauer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10584-012-0403-y"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2430107"", ""10.1126/science.162.3859.1243"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990050"", ""10.1038/s41558-020-0831-z"", ""10.1093/ijpor/5.2.167"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-91773-3_2"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt017"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106496"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a029854"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00360.x"", ""10.2307/2585576"", ""10.1017/S0008423904030094"", ""10.1111/ropr.12104"", ""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00292.x"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.03.002"", ""10.1007/s10584-006-9059-9"", ""10.1017/S0143814X16000155"", ""10.1080/09644016.2019.1655188"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.020"", ""10.1111/ropr.12189"", ""10.1177/153244000900900205"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2004.02.008"", ""10.3998/mpub.9739"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-062011-154926"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139628723"", ""10.1038/nclimate2728"", ""10.1111/ajps.12002"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0217608"", ""10.1017/S002081830808020X"", ""10.1016/S0921-8009(03)00012-0"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.923639"", ""10.1353/sof.2007.0059"", ""10.3929/ethz-a-010432416)"", ""10.1177/1748048513504169"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aax3323"", ""10.1093/poq/nfr053"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2015.06.014"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12097"", ""10.2307/2600801"", ""10.2307/2111666"", ""10.2307/2131309"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1994.tb02178.x"", ""10.1126/science.1113180"", ""10.1177/106591298503800207"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1177/0010414011434007"", ""10.1162/glep.2007.7.4.1"", ""10.2307/2082973"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00385.x"", ""10.1007/s10584-012-0690-3"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2012.00563.x"", ""10.1093/pan/mpv009"", ""10.3929/ethz-a-"", ""10.1515/9781400831456"", ""10.7910/DVN/WPRN15"", ""10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z"", ""10.1021/es403362m"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090092"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.12.064"", ""10.1177/106591290305600103"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0159774"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.01.001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00537.x"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111385"", ""10.1080/01402382.2012.713752"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2005.00534.x"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-68930-2_4"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000533"", ""10.1093/publius/pjr017"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.057"", ""10.1017/S0143814X18000375"", ""10.1353/sof.2006.0083"", ""10.4135/9781412993869"", ""10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651"", ""10.1080/09644016.2011.589577"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/aa8f80"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2011.01198.x""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz226,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,The recalibration of Chinese assertiveness: China's responses to the Indo-Pacific challenge,"Abstract In response to the changing geopolitical landscape in Asia, both China and the United States attempt to alter the regional order in their own favour, both in the economic and security realms. This article shows how diverging views on future arrangements are leading to strategic shifts and increasing tension between these two Great Powers. As part of its quest for Great-Power status, China has been actively pushing its regional initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), as well as adopting assertive security policies towards its neighbours. In contrast, in order to counter China's growing influence America's regional strategy is undergoing a subtle shift from ‘rebalancing to Asia’ to focusing on the ‘Indo-Pacific’ region. However, amid an intensifying trade war and other challenges facing the region, China has chosen to moderate its proactive foreign policy-orientation in the past few years. In particular, China has made attempts to downplay its domestic rhetoric, rebuild strategic relationship with India and Japan, and to reassure ASEAN states in the South China Sea. In response to the Indo-Pacific strategy, it would be more effective for China to articulate a more inclusive regional vision and promote an institutional framework that also accommodates a US presence in the region.","[{""name"": ""Feng Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Development']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)]]"

Most studies of policy diffusion—which is the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking in other governments—have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the issue‐definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative justifications are not. Our approach and findings open the way for a new perspective to studying policy diffusion in many different areas.","[{""name"": ""Fabrizio Gilardi"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zurich""]}, {""name"": ""Charles R.

Specifically, the authors tested two distinct mediating mechanisms, namely, WW and EE that have received less attention in testing the JI and WFC linkage. The authors also tested the variable of perceived organizational justice (POJ) to moderate these relationships.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data collected at Time 1 and Time 2 included 206 professionals from different occupational sectors. The authors study independent variable (i.e. JI), moderator (POJ) and mediator (WW) were measured at Time-1, whereas the other mediator (EE) and outcome (WFC) were tapped by the same respondent at Time-2 with a time interval of one month between them.FindingsThe findings suggest that subordinates’ EE and WW mediate the relationship between JI and WFC. Further, the authors found that EE is a relatively more effective mechanism than WW in explaining how and why JI translates into WFC. The results of the moderated mediation analysis revealed that the indirect effect of JI on WFC is strengthened when POJ is low.Practical implicationsJI has adverse consequences on the employees’ well-being and a cost to the organization in terms of WW. HR and top management should anticipate the negative influence of WW and EE and should focus on nurturing positive work–family climates to help reduce WFCs. Managers should give employees opportunities for participation and foster a climate of fairness in the organization to mitigate the harmful consequences of JI.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the employees’ burnout, counter work behavior and the WFC literature. By introducing EE and WW as underlying mechanisms and identifying POJ as a work contextual variable to explain the JI – WFC relationship, the authors extend the nomological network of JI. The authors respond to the calls by prior researchers as little research has examined how perceived fairness (unfairness) can induce WFC.","[{""name"": ""Shazia Nauman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Connie Zheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saima Naseer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0149206312455243"", ""10.1037/a0013203"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411"", ""10.1177/001872679204500804"", ""10.1002/job.4030130604"", ""10.1037/1076-8998.4.4.347"", ""10.1111/1468-232X.00287"", ""10.1080/09585192.2011.573967"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.06.029"", ""10.1037/1072-5245.13.1.64"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2004.08.009"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2012.05.003"", ""10.1177/0149206310363613"", ""10.1006/jvbe.1999.1713"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.2007.00312.x"", ""10.1006/obhd.2001.2958"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00864.x"", ""10.1080/02678373.2017.1330781"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.1.160"", ""10.1179/096979511798967133"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.2008.00332.x"", ""10.1348/096317905X53660"", ""10.1080/00050069508259607"", ""10.1016/S0001-8791(03)00030-7"", ""10.5465/amr.2000.2791609"", ""10.1002/smi.1371"", ""10.1006/jvbe.2001.1803"", ""10.1006/jvbe.1996.1577"", ""10.5465/amr.1984.4279673"", ""10.2753/IMO0020-8825400101"", ""10.5465/amr.1985.4277352"", ""10.1016/S0001-8791(02)00042-8"", ""10.1016/S0749-5978(02)00519-8"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1134"", ""10.1177/0149206314527130"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.1.93"", ""10.1348/096317908X401723"", ""10.1023/A:1022820609967"", ""10.1002/job.184"", ""10.1080/135943299398311"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.1.228"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.44.3.513"", ""10.1111/1464-0597.00062"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.6.4.307"", ""10.1177/0149206318773853"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.1984.tb01451.x"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.89.3.395"", ""10.1111/peps.12009"", ""10.1002/job.339"", ""10.1177/0143831X09358366"", ""10.1177/105960118901400403"", ""10.1177/0149206307300816"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032117-104651"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.77.3.309"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1554-5"", ""10.1108/PR-04-2018-0138"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.4.1159"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2015.09.005"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.81.4.400"", ""10.1002/job.754"", ""10.1097/01445442-199609000-00012"", ""10.1080/02678373.2015.1075624"", ""10.3758/BF03206553"", ""10.1037/1076-8998.10.4.320"", ""10.2753/IMO0020-8825400105"", ""10.1177/0143831X09358370"", ""10.1007/s00420-014-0941-x"", ""10.2307/3094827"", ""10.1002/job.2172"", ""10.1108/01437721011057029"", ""10.1177/0143831X10365924"", ""10.1177/0149206307305560"", ""10.1348/096317908X401912"", ""10.1037/1076-8998.7.3.242"", ""10.1002/smi.1056"", ""10.5465/amj.2008.30764063"", ""10.5465/amj.2011.1072"", ""10.1080/02678370802393672"", ""10.1177/0143831X09358372"", ""10.1037/1076-8998.10.4.491"", ""10.1037/a0038330"", ""10.1071/WR16178"", ""10.1002/job.2174"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.84.5.786"", ""10.1002/job.91"", ""10.1037/1072-5245.11.4.413"", ""10.1080/10615800108248346"", ""10.1080/135943299398302"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.83.3.486"", ""10.1037/a0034413""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/1467-9477.12194,SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,"Ideological Tripolarization, Partisan Tribalism and Institutional Trust: The Foundations of Affective Polarization in the Swedish Multiparty System","Currently, very little is known about the individual level foundations of affective polarization outside the US context. This paper addresses this research gap by exploring the predictors of affective polarization in Sweden, using nationally representative survey data. From 2010 till the 2018 elections, the Swedish multiparty system was divided into two affectively converged mainstream party blocs that were moderately polarized between each other, and an asymmetrically polarized populist right party that invoked significantly more hostility from the supporters of mainstream parties than vice versa. To unpack the foundations of affective polarization in such a tripolar configuration, we employ a methodological approach that distinguishes not just between in‐ and outparties but also in‐ and out‐blocs, and separates different conflict dimensions. We find that: (1) voters with stronger partisan identities and more extreme political attitudes exhibit higher levels of affective polarization. The latter, however, is a better predictor of direct dislike towards political opponents; (2) the effects of political attitudes correspond to the tripolar nature of the party system: while affective polarization between the centre‐right and ‐left blocs is mostly driven by socioeconomic positions, the hostility towards Sweden Democrats links predominantly to cultural issues, most notably immigration; (3) institutional trust has a two‐edged relationship with affective polarization: populist right voters that trust the country’s central institutions more, are less polarized towards mainstream blocs, whereas among centre‐right voters, higher trust associates with stronger animosity towards Sweden Democrats. We believe that these findings could have broad implications for affective polarization research in multiparty systems.","[{""name"": ""Andres Reiljan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political and Social Sciences European University Institute""]}, {""name"": ""Alexander Ryan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSV) Mid Sweden University""]}]","[""10.1080/01402380701276477"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.1000651"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1583885"", ""10.3386/w26669"", ""10.1057/ap.2016.3"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.08501010.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1389440"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1674578"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2011.01357.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226299358.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1111/pops.12482"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1177/1536867X1401400402"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.12147"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01934.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.12186"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1177/0002764218759581"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.18"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01930.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12089"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i3.2896"", ""10.1177/2053168016686636"", ""10.1177/0010414013488560"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.41"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.2307/1963849"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.77"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102199"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12130"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12228""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

These differences stem from cross-national variation in men’s attitudes. Men, more than women, tend to be less concerned about climate change when countries are wealthier. This article develops a new theory about the perceived costs and benefits of climate mitigation policy to explain this pattern. At the country level, the perceived benefits of mitigation tend to decrease with economic development, whereas the perceived costs increase. At the individual level, the perceived costs of mitigation tend to increase with economic development for men more than for women. Evidence from existing surveys from every world region, an original 10-country survey in the Americas and Europe, and focus groups in Peru and the United States support the theory.","[{""name"": ""SARAH SUNN BUSH"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""AMANDA CLAYTON"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1740-1461.2007.00097.x"", ""10.1177/1086026606292571"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003"", ""10.1073/pnas.1306374110"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00166.x"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2009.08.010"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190651824.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0192512100214007"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12393.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0013916596283003"", ""10.1177/1532440019842175"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.03.009"", ""10.1111/ajps.12220"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090158"", ""10.1177/0022002716669207"", ""10.1017/S1355770X05002755"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000205"", ""10.1111/ajps.12079"", ""10.1126/science.aan0568"", ""10.1177/0305829818775817"", ""10.1080/09692290.2018.1563559"", ""10.1111/ajps.12103"", ""10.1007/s11111-010-0113-1"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2016.1192428"", ""10.1080/08941929209380772"", ""10.1017/S0003055422000223"", ""10.1007/s10584-008-9429-6"", ""10.1111/isqu.12170"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000374"", ""10.1086/668417"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09374-w"", ""10.1017/S1743923X18000144"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1380092"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9391-y"", ""10.7910/DVN/0Y8IKW"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022857"", ""10.1007/s10584-021-03193-y"", ""10.1017/S000305541000050X"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000156""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000534,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Beyond Positive and Negative: New Perspectives on Feedback Effects in Public Opinion on the Welfare State,"AbstractThe study of policy feedback on public attitudes and policy preferences has become a growing area of research in recent years. Scholars in the tradition of Pierson usually argue that positive, self-reinforcing feedback effects dominate (that is, attitudes are commensurate with existing institutions), whereas the public thermostat model developed by Wlezien and Soroka expects negative, self-undermining feedback. Moving beyond the blunt distinction between positive and negative feedback, this article develops and proposes a more fine-grained typology of feedback effects that distinguishes between accelerating, self-reinforcing and self-undermining, specific and general, as well as long- and short-term dynamic feedback. The authors apply this typology in an analysis of public opinion on government spending in different areas of the welfare state for twenty-one OECD countries, employing a pseudo-panel approach. The empirical analysis confirms the usefulness of this typology since it shows that different types of feedback effects can be observed empirically.","[{""name"": ""Marius R Busemeyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aurélien Abrassart"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roula Nezi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669769.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2111666"", ""10.2307/2950710"", ""10.1515/9781400841080"", ""10.1017/S1537592704000623"", ""10.4337/9781782545491"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9515.2004.00381.x"", ""10.1093/esr/jcs059"", ""10.1111/gove.12101"", ""10.1016/S1053-5357(97)90010-X"", ""10.1093/esr/19.5.415"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090537"", ""10.1111/ajps.12001"", ""10.1093/esr/jcn079"", ""10.4337/9781782545491"", ""10.1093/esr/jcs085"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.esr.a018219"", ""10.1017/S0007123405000347"", ""10.1046/j.1468-2508.2004.00139.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805288"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226075952.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2082973"", ""10.1177/0958928712471224"", ""10.1177/000169930104400401"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2008.00211.x"", ""10.1017/S0043887111000037"", ""10.1080/21699763.2017.1302892"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804782524.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123410000463"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750588"", ""10.1177/1065912912437162"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1007/s11205-011-9915-5"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000310"", ""10.1177/0958928706059829"", ""10.1093/esr/jcp023"", ""10.1111/psj.12190"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791529"", ""10.1017/S1755773909990257"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00614.x"", ""10.2307/1956018"", ""10.2307/2111407"", ""10.1080/01402382.2012.713752"", ""10.1023/A:1025931414917"", ""10.4159/9780674043725"", ""10.1177/0010414012463904"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000603"", ""10.1093/esr/17.4.337"", ""10.1177/0958928712471225"", ""10.1093/esr/jci049"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.06.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598449"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.12.005"", ""10.1017/S0143814X10000061"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00472.x"", ""10.2307/2586011"", ""10.2307/3235246""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Macro-level approaches, grounded in the international relations subfield, focus on variation across countries or conflicts, while micro-level approaches, more influenced by the comparative politics subfield, focus on variation within countries or conflicts. However, some of the recent research on civilian targeting does not fit neatly into this dichotomy—such as research comparing subnational units or armed groups across conflicts or research relying on geo-referenced event data for multiple conflicts. We review the literature and advocate moving beyond the language of the micro- and macro-level divide, instead focusing on the determinants of violence against civilians at five different levels of analysis: international, domestic, subnational, organizational, and individual. While acknowledging significant advances in the field, we argue for continued research aimed at developing a more integrated theoretical understanding of the multiple actors and interactive social processes driving violence against civilians.","[{""name"": ""Laia Balcells"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA;""]}, {""name"": ""Jessica A.

We track the online news consumption of a national sample during the 2016 presidential campaign. We find levels of partisan isolation in news exposure are two to three times greater than in prior studies, although the absolute level of isolation remains modest. The partisan divide for election-related news exceeds the divide for non-political news. This tendency of partisans to follow like-minded news providers occurs despite the relatively small differences in the partisan slant of the content offered by the majority of sources they visited. Finally, we find that partisans who gravitated to congenial news providers did not shift their evaluations of the presidential candidates during the campaign.","[{""name"": ""Erik Peterson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sharad Goel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shanto Iyengar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.218"", ""10.1086/267513"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006682"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy014"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139878425"", ""10.1086/685584"", ""10.1126/science.aaa1160"", ""10.1111/hcre.12028"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420240603"", ""10.1111/jcom.12110"", ""10.1017/S1537592709992714"", ""10.1093/qje/qjr044"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pan/mpu010"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226069159.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781503620766"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01497.x"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw006"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090781"", ""10.31235/osf.io/2a7q9"", ""10.1037/10628-000"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.77.1.135"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw007"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000363"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01402.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000363,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Pandemic Response as Border Politics,"AbstractPandemics are imbued with the politics of bordering. For centuries, border closures and restrictions on foreign travelers have been the most persistent and pervasive means by which states have responded to global health crises. The ubiquity of these policies is not driven by any clear scientific consensus about their utility in the face of myriad pandemic threats. Instead, we show they are influenced by public opinion and preexisting commitments to invest in the symbols and structures of state efforts to control their borders, a concept we callborder orientation. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, border orientation was already generally on the rise worldwide. This trend has made it convenient for governments to “contain” the virus by externalizing it, rather than taking costly but ultimately more effective domestic mitigation measures. We argue that the pervasive use of external border controls in the face of the coronavirus reflects growing anxieties about border security in the modern international system. To a great extent, fears relating to border security have become a resource in domestic politics—a finding that does not bode well for designing and implementing effective public health policy.","[{""name"": ""Michael R.

10.1093/ser/mwab028,SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology; 0201 Theoretical Economics; 0202 Applied Economics,Odds stacked against workers: datafied gamification on Chinese and American food delivery platforms,"AbstractThis article presents a cross-national comparative study examining how American and Chinese platform companies approach the gamification of on-demand food delivery. The study, based on ethnographic fieldwork in New York City and Beijing, shows how couriers in these cities negotiate the gamified app-based systems designed to convince them to log in and keep working. We argue that such systems are not only a salient form of ‘algorithmic management’—as has been argued before—but also demonstrate the central importance of datafication within the organizational strategies of food delivery companies operating under conditions of financialized platform capitalism. Indeed, the deeply financialized nature of the on-demand food delivery industry creates conditions in which companies experiment with data-driven gamification techniques in an effort to manipulate their flexible labor supply in an agile and cost-effective way—to thereby elicit higher productivity and meet expectations of investors and shareholders. Our comparative analysis challenges assumptions of a universal mode of gamification and highlights the differences between such situated techniques and their impacts on workers, identifying two distinct design approaches that we term ‘Deal or No Deal’ in New York and ‘Grab-and-Stack’ in Beijing.","[{""name"": ""Niels van Doorn"", ""affiliation"": [""New Media and Digital Culture, Department of Media Studies, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Julie Yujie Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology and Faculty of Information, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S, Canada""]}]","[""10.1080/01972243.1994.9960162"", ""10.1177/1461444817729149"", ""10.1177/1461444820913567"", ""10.1177/0950017015617676"", ""10.1177/1056492618790912"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2006.08.003"", ""10.1111/anti.12641"", ""10.1515/9781400834655"", ""10.1177/2378023119870041"", ""10.1177/0097700417693590"", ""10.1177/0003122420979980"", ""10.1177/0267323103184003"", ""10.1111/ntwe.12128"", ""10.13169/workorgalaboglob.11.2.0007"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcwp0kc"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9788.003.0019"", ""10.1177/1461444817738236"", ""10.1080/17544750.2019.1583676"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054857"", ""10.1177/0950017019836911"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.09.011"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-07127-5_23""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

A meta-analysis,"AbstractA large volume of econometric literature has studied the impact of economic globalisation on income inequality around the world. However, reported econometric estimates vary substantially, which makes it difficult to draw valid conclusions. This paper presents a quantitative summary and analysis of existing estimates regarding the globalisation–inequality relationship. We use a new data set consisting of 1,254 observations from 123 primary studies. By applying meta‐analysis and meta‐regression methods, we obtain several main findings. First, globalisation has a (small‐to‐moderate) inequality‐increasing effect. Second, while the effect of trade globalisation is small, financial globalisation shows a more sizeable and significantly stronger inequality‐increasing impact. Third, we find an average inequality‐increasing impact of globalisation in both advanced and developing countries. Fourth, education and technology moderate the impact of globalisation on income inequality.","[{""name"": ""Philipp Heimberger"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for the Comprehensive Analysis of the Economy Johannes Kepler University Linz Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies Linz, Vienna Austria""]}]","[""10.1111/joes.12056"", ""10.2307/2971707"", ""10.4159/9780674984769"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.04.003"", ""10.1257/aer.20180310"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199243310.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.econmod.2013.09.051"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9396.2011.00967.x"", ""10.1007/s10887-007-9010-6"", ""10.1162/003355398555892"", ""10.1111/twec.12128"", ""10.1177/000312240507000603"", ""10.1257/app.20150044"", ""10.1086/342055"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0327.2008.00209.x"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2007.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2017.04.007"", ""10.3998/mpub.9690073"", ""10.1093/rof/rft039"", ""10.1086/261860"", ""10.1146/annurev.financial.050808.114334"", ""10.1111/twec.12638"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2005.04.006"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-74069-0"", ""10.1016/S0022-1996(96)01475-4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01397.x"", ""10.1111/joes.12241"", ""10.1257/jel.45.1.39"", ""10.1111/twec.12518"", ""10.1111/j.0950-0804.2004.00229.x"", ""10.1086/261720"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09344-2"", ""10.1016/j.asieco.2011.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2011.12.006"", ""10.1146/annurev.economics.102308.124451"", ""10.1515/gej-2015-0068"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx027"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.07.001"", ""10.1057/imfer.2013.7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2006.00812.x"", ""10.1177/0010414099032003004"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2008.06.002"", ""10.1093/wber/lhi003"", ""10.1093/esr/jcn046"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.02.003"", ""10.1787/9789264235120-en"", ""10.1017/S000712340200011X"", ""10.1111/twec.12174"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(03)00125-9"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.00334"", ""10.1177/0010414003036005004"", ""10.1111/1467-9701.00305"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2003.06.003"", ""10.1086/250038"", ""10.1515/9781400829354"", ""10.1111/roiw.12153"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00320.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2007.01019.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0084.2007.00487.x"", ""10.4324/9780203111710"", ""10.1002/sim.6481"", ""10.2307/2967638"", ""10.2307/2991830"", ""10.1257/002205104773558056""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Insights from a choice experiment on policies against vehicle emissions,"AbstractPublic support is usually a precondition for the adoption and successful implementation of costly policies. We argue that such support is easier to achieve with policy-packages that incorporate primary and ancillary measures. We specifically distinguish command-and-control and market-based measures as primary measures and argue that the former will usually garner more public support than the latter given the low-visibility tendency of costs associated with command-and-control measures. Nevertheless, if included in a policy-package, ancillary measures are likely to increase public support by reducing negative effects of primary measures. Based on a choice experiment with a representative sample of 2,034 Swiss citizens, we assessed these arguments with respect to political efforts to reduce vehicle emissions. The empirical analysis supported the argument that policy-packaging affects public support positively, particularly generating more support when ancillary measures are added. Lastly, we ultimately observe that command-and-control measures obtain more public support than market-based instruments.","[{""name"": ""Michael Wicki"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert Alexander Huber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Bernauer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1023/A:1024289627887"", ""10.1023/B:PUCH.0000024165.18082.db"", ""10.4337/9781783471416.00021"", ""10.1080/09640568.2017.1308317"", ""10.18637/jss.v032.i01"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2012.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.03.006"", ""10.4324/9781351282000"", ""10.1002/eet.1769"", ""10.17645/pag.v1i2.95"", ""10.32614/CRAN.package.forcats"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2011.02.005"", ""10.1108/9781786359506-015"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.08.095"", ""10.1016/S0967-070X(00)00007-X"", ""10.1007/s11615-003-0068-2"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.06.012"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab30a2"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2011.07.001"", ""10.1016/S1369-8478(02)00046-3"", ""10.1111/puar.12960"", ""10.1016/j.forpol.2011.03.012"", ""10.18637/jss.v067.i01"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.02.014"", ""10.18637/jss.v055.i08"", ""10.1080/09644016.2019.1629171"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000569"", ""10.1177/0263774X15610059"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.07.016"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2016.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2017.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.reseneeco.2014.06.005"", ""10.1038/525449a"", ""10.32614/RJ-2012-011"", ""10.1007/s10584-018-2260-9"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.03.002"", ""10.1787/oecd_papers-v5-art17-en"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.04.021"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00628.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-006-9025-2"", ""10.1016/S0967-070X(00)00026-3"", ""10.1080/09644016.2011.589577"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.13"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.01.022"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.02.001"", ""10.1111/rego.12225"", ""10.3390/su8040373"", ""10.1177/0739456X17715306"", ""10.1016/S1574-0099(05)02017-6"", ""10.1080/14693062.2015.1058240"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-98141-3"", ""10.1016/S1361-9209(99)00005-X"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2015.10.008"", ""10.1111/1468-2451.5502006"", ""10.1177/0013916505278519"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2016.10.003"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.537"", ""10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00109-X"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.024"", ""10.1080/01441647.2012.744779"", ""10.1080/14486563.2008.9725186"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2011.11.007"", ""10.1027/1614-2241/a000051"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.062"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.06.003"", ""10.3390/su8040309"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.03.009"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1332/030557307780712951"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/aa8f80"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2010.05.002"", ""10.2307/2111666"", ""10.1515/9781400831456"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511753831"", ""10.2307/3866082""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/padm.12742,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Assessing public value failure in government adoption of artificial intelligence,"AbstractIn the context of rising delegation of administrative discretion to advanced technologies, this study aims to quantitatively assess key public values that may be at risk when governments employ automated decision systems (ADS). Drawing on the public value failure framework coupled with experimental methodology, we address the need to measure and compare the salience of three such values—fairness, transparency, and human responsiveness. Based on a preregistered design, we administer a survey experiment to 1460 American adults inspired by prominent ADS applications in child welfare and criminal justice. The results provide clear causal evidence that certain public value failures associated with artificial intelligence have significant negative impacts on citizens' evaluations of government.

10.1093/ia/iiaa172,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Artificial intelligence and China's authoritarian governance,"Abstract China has adopted a proactive and strategic approach to embrace the age of artificial intelligence (AI). This article argues that China's bold AI practices are part of its broad and incoherent adaptation strategy to governance by digital means. AI is part of a digital technology package that the Chinese authoritarian regime has actively employed not only to improve public service, but also to strengthen its authoritarian governance. China's digital progress benefits from its huge internet market, strong state power and weak civil awareness, making it more competitive than western democratic societies where privacy concern restricts their AI development. However, China's ambitious AI plan contains considerable risks; its overall impact depends on how AI affects major sources of political legitimacy including economic growth, social stability and ideology. China's approach is gambling on its success in (a) delivering a booming AI economy, (b) ensuring a smooth social transformation towards the age of AI and (c) proving ideological superiority of its authoritarian and communist values.","[{""name"": ""Jinghan Zeng"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Yet successes with this method have largely been confined to massive corpora where the meanings of words are presumed to be fixed. In political science applications, however, many corpora are comparatively small and many interesting questions hinge on the recognition that meaning changes over time. Together, these two facts raise vexing methodological challenges. Can word vectors trace the changing cultural meanings of words in typical small corpora use cases? I test four time-sensitive implementations of word vectors (word2vec) against a gold standard developed from a modest data set of 161 years of newspaper coverage. I find that one implementation method clearly outperforms the others in matching human assessments of how public dialogues around equality in America have changed over time. In addition, I suggest best practices for usingword2vecto study small corpora for time series questions, including bootstrap resampling of documents and pretraining of vectors. I close by showing thatword2vecallows granular analysis of the changing meaning of words, an advance over other common text-as-data methods for semantic research questions.","[{""name"": ""Emma Rodman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7910/DVN/CGNX3M"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00427.x"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2009.191"", ""10.3115/v1/W14-2517"", ""10.3115/v1/D14-1181"", ""10.5406/illinois/9780252037528.001.0001"", ""10.18653/v1/P18-1031"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00428.x"", ""10.1080/00437956.1954.11659520"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1073/pnas.1720347115"", ""10.1093/aristotelian/56.1.167"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0176999"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139025287"", ""10.31235/osf.io/af9jq"", ""10.1162/tacl_a_00008"", ""10.1515/9780823254415"", ""10.18653/v1/D15-1036"", ""10.1086/699246"", ""10.1126/science.aal4230"", ""10.1080/19312458.2018.1455817"", ""10.1002/asi.20342"", ""10.18653/v1/D16-1229"", ""10.1162/tacl_a_00134"", ""10.1613/jair.2934"", ""10.1145/2736277.2741627"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052615-025542"", ""10.4159/9780674037762""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['General Social Sciences', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communication']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

The Role of Ideology and Decline of Geographic Proximity in the Diffusion of Policy Innovations,"States adopt policy innovations within the confines of a dynamic American federal system, but our study of policy diffusion tends to be fairly static. Single‐policy studies incorporate temporal variation, but for only one innovation. Macro‐level analyses examine broad patterns, but often by completely pooling across policy and time. This makes it difficult to identify how diffusion patterns change over time, though Walker's early work explicitly identified such temporal instability. This study specifically examines how neighbor and ideological cues change in importance over time using a dataset of 556 policies adopted from 1960 to 2014. While the findings demonstrate the generality of many key internal, external, and policy‐level determinants of adoption, there is variation in these effects across time. Most important is the relative stability of ideological similarity between adopters and declining influence of contiguous neighbors. Further, political polarization plays a role in conditioning neighbor and ideological cues.","[{""name"": ""Daniel J.

10.1111/ajps.12657,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Which Narrative Strategies Durably Reduce Prejudice? Evidence from Field and Survey Experiments Supporting the Efficacy of Perspective-Getting,"AbstractExclusionary attitudes towards outgroups contribute to social and political challenges worldwide. Previous field experiments found that interpersonal conversations employing multiple narrative strategies can durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. We theoretically distinguish between three of these narrative strategies: narratives which promote analogic perspective taking, vicarious perspective‐giving, and perspective‐getting. Previous research has assigned these strategies together in a compound treatment, leaving open important theoretical and practical questions about each's effectiveness. We present results from three field studies and a survey experiment that individually manipulate their presence. Across the field studies, we find omitting prompts to engage in analogic perspective‐taking and vicarious perspective‐giving does not diminish effects; conversations employing only perspective‐getting narratives durably reduce exclusionary attitudes. Results from within‐subject analyses and a survey experiment similarly show that perspective‐getting consistently reduces exclusionary attitudes and activates multiple mechanisms. These results refine theoretical understandings of prejudice reduction and support facilitating perspective‐getting in conversations intended to reduce exclusionary attitudes.","[{""name"": ""Joshua L.

10.1017/S175577392000020X,EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,When economic and cultural interests align: the anti-immigration voter coalitions driving far right party success in Europe,"AbstractThis article contests the view that the strong positive correlation between anti-immigration attitudes and far right party success necessarily constitutes evidence in support of the cultural grievance thesis. We argue that the success of far right parties depends on their ability to mobilize a coalition of interests between their core supporters, that is voters with cultural grievances over immigration and the often larger group of voters with economic grievances over immigration. Using individual level data from eight rounds of the European Social Survey, our empirical analysis shows that while cultural concerns over immigration are a stronger predictor of far right party support, those who are concerned with the impact of immigration on the economy are important to the far right in numerical terms. Taken together, our findings suggest that economic grievances over immigration remain pivotal within the context of the transnational cleavage.","[{""name"": ""Daphne Halikiopoulou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tim Vlandas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00784.x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2818659"", ""10.1177/0032329213493754"", ""10.1057/9781137535917"", ""10.1177/1354068809346002"", ""10.1162/003465301750160108"", ""10.1177/1465116517718091"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.05.002"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1136491"", ""10.1111/nana.12515"", ""10.1177/0192512107088390"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02050.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042814-012441"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1733636"", ""10.1177/1354068807075943"", ""10.1177/0010414003251176"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.12.1.45"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00716.x"", ""10.1080/01419870120112085"", ""10.2307/2998640"", ""10.1111/spsr.12182"", ""10.1111/jcms.12310"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1615322"", ""10.1177/0010414017720707"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199216352.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2012.00550.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12012"", ""10.1177/0010414011427851"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12319"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000849"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edm031"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1017/S000305540400098X"", ""10.1017/gov.2015.43"", ""10.1162/rest.88.3.510"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12027"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1017/S1755773917000133"", ""10.1093/soceco/1.2.215"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12434"", ""10.1080/13689880601132505"", ""10.1017/S0007123400002544"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1489943"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.4324/9780203852279"", ""10.1016/S0362-3319(01)00106-9"", ""10.1177/1465116516678932"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1175244"", ""10.1177/0192512112455443"", ""10.1177/0010414004273928"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvx003"", ""10.1057/fp.2015.17"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00379"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316257777"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-102512-194818"", ""10.2307/2657900"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00369.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/padm.12829,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,The future of public administration research: An editor's perspective,"AbstractResearch in the field of public administration has changed and advanced significantly in recent years. These advancements concern both how we engage in research—such as the methods we apply, the interdisciplinary nature of the theories we use, and the research questions we ask. Increasingly, we are witnessing a shift in public‐sector values away from efficiency and effectiveness and toward a paradigm that highlights equity. In this article, we reflect on these changes from our position as editors‐in‐chief of some of the leading journals in the field. In addition to describing the progress of this discipline, we explore emerging windows of opportunity for new research. One such window is research on ways to incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives and methods. We also see the need for work in such areas as social equity, comparative administration, artificial intelligence, and climate change. Finally, we argue for a more proactive approach in disseminating research to those involved in the day‐to‐day decision‐making processes of public organizations.","[{""name"": ""Bruce D.

10.1111/1475-6765.12377,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Retrospective pledge voting: A comparative study of the electoral consequences of government parties' pledge fulfilment,"AbstractDoes pledge fulfilment bear any electoral consequences for government parties? While previous research on retrospective voting has largely focused on electoral accountability with respect to the economy, the theoretical framework presented in this study links government parties’ performance to their previous electoral pledges. It is argued that government parties are more likely to be rewarded by voters when they have fulfilled more pledges during the legislative term. Good pledge performance of a party is associated with the ability to maximise policy benefits (accomplishment) and to be a responsible actor that will stick to its promises in the future as well (competence). Analysing data from 69 elections in 14 countries shows that a government party's electoral outcome is affected by its previous pledge performance. A government party that fulfils a higher share of election pledges is more likely to prevent electoral losses. This finding indicates that voters react at the polls to party pledge fulfilment, which highlights the crucial role of promissory representation in democratic regimes. Surprisingly and in contrast with economic voting, there is no evidence that retrospective pledge voting is moderated by clarity of responsibility.","[{""name"": ""THERES MATTHIEß"", ""affiliation"": [""Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR), Research Unit ‘Democracy and Democratization’ WZB Berlin Social Science Research Center  Germany""]}]","[""10.2307/1957392"", ""10.1162/JEEA.2007.5.4.846"", ""10.1093/pa/gsi053"", ""10.1177/0192512118791298"", ""10.1111/pops.12429"", ""10.3917/gap.173.0085"", ""10.2307/2132352"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00635.x"", ""10.1177/1354068816678893"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2015.01.010"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00380.x"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2015.03.008"", ""10.1007/BF00124924"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02072.x"", ""10.1023/A:1005062527921"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2010.00096.x"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674497764"", ""10.1177/1354068817695742"", ""10.2307/1963531"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.05.023"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000856"", ""10.1017/S0007123409990275"", ""10.1080/09644008.2018.1528235"", ""10.1093/0199286728.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1354068810372099"", ""10.1007/BF01047771"", ""10.1177/0032321716688359"", ""10.3998/mpub.9796088"", ""10.1177/1465116515573844"", ""10.1016/S0176-2680(86)80002-7"", ""10.2307/1958151"", ""10.2307/2111378"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2006.03.008"", ""10.1017/S0007123400007419"", ""10.2307/1884852"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12169"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000952"", ""10.1177/0032321718764177"", ""10.1111/ajps.12313"", ""10.1515/9781400831456"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.911483"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(98)00043-2""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1162/glep_a_00593,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,"Policy Characteristics, Electoral Cycles, and the Partisan Politics of Climate Change","Abstract Domestic policies are the cornerstone of the new global climate governance architecture. However, what motivates vote-seeking politicians to pursue climate policies remains remarkably unclear, as the climate politics literature suggests that climate policies are usually not perceived as a vote winner. The present article revisits this issue and argues that a better understanding of the relationship between electoral competition and climate policy making requires taking into account differences both in party ideologies and in policy characteristics. Studying twenty-nine democracies between 1990 and 2016, the analysis finds that climate policy production overall tends to increase as the election approaches due to increases in “soft” policies, such as subsidies, research grants, and information instruments, and relatively stable production rates of “hard” policies like taxes and regulations over the electoral term. Regarding partisan politics, left governments are found to produce more hard, but not more soft, climate policies than center and right governments, especially before elections. This suggests that partisan and electoral incentives are important reference points in the fight against climate change.","[{""name"": ""Kai Schulze"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0007123409000635"", ""10.1111/ajps.12002"", ""10.1111/1467-9531.00117"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1494945"", ""10.1111/ropr.12134"", ""10.1177/1354068812462923"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2008.04.003"", ""10.1086/684791"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-062011-154926"", ""10.1162/glep.2008.8.1.78"", ""10.1017/S0143814X15000045"", ""10.2307/2946699"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1094059"", ""10.1086/684679"", ""10.1017/bap.2018.14"", ""10.1177/0010414013509567"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1220162"", ""10.1177/2158244019900568"", ""10.1080/09644016.2013.755391"", ""10.1177/1354068817697630"", ""10.1007/s11127-014-0221-z"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12006"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00831.x"", ""10.1007/s11127-013-0106-6"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2001.tb02102.x"", ""10.1080/14693062.2013.845409"", ""10.1007/s11127-016-0313-z"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.022"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.02.017"", ""10.1057/cep.2014.34"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.08.008"", ""10.1080/14693062.2014.1000814"", ""10.1177/1354068817693473"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.5.112801.080924"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2003.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.05.011"", ""10.1007/s11127-016-0360-5"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.46"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00216"", ""10.1162/glep.2007.7.4.1"", ""10.1111/1468-0343.00066"", ""10.1017/S0003055400269712"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.05.004"", ""10.1038/nclimate2943"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2015.06.014"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-110813-034103"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316339152"", ""10.1080/09644016.2011.643374"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2010.00852.x"", ""10.1080/09644016.2013.755839"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.923614"", ""10.1017/9781108284646"", ""10.1068/c120225"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511622014"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01150.x"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2020.1832885"", ""10.1080/14693062.2013.811333"", ""10.1080/09644016.2019.1625157"", ""10.1038/s41558-019-0419-7"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.884301"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000903"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00360.x"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.923639"", ""10.1111/ropr.12368"", ""10.1080/09644016.2015.1090371"", ""10.1111/gove.12338"", ""10.1016/S0921-8009(03)00012-0"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.06.006"", ""10.2307/2296528"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0287-6"", ""10.1177/2053168018756668"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2016.12.004"", ""10.1162/GLEP_e_00309"", ""10.1126/science.aah3443"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2008.00743.x"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.12.064"", ""10.1111/psj.12095"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.03.012"", ""10.1007/s11615-019-00209-2"", ""10.1162/glep.2007.7.4.19"", ""10.1080/09644016.2012.740938"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.02.003"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12032"", ""10.1002/eet.575"", ""10.1111/ajps.12220"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00096"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00433"", ""10.1177/0010414011434007"", ""10.1111/lsq.12027"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-2547-7""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/pan.2022.20,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,"Ordered Beta Regression: A Parsimonious, Well-Fitting Model for Continuous Data with Lower and Upper Bounds","AbstractI propose a new model, ordered Beta regression, for continuous distributions with both lower and upper bounds, such as data arising from survey slider scales, visual analog scales, and dose–response relationships. This model employs the cut point technique popularized by ordered logit to fit a single linear model to both continuous (0,1) and degenerate [0,1] responses. The model can be estimated with or without observations at the bounds, and as such is a general solution for these types of data. Employing a Monte Carlo simulation, I show that the model is noticeably more efficient than ordinary least squares regression, zero-and-one-inflated Beta regression, rescaled Beta regression, and fractional logit while fully capturing nuances in the outcome. I apply the model to a replication of the Aidt and Jensen (2014,European Economic Review72, 52–75) study of suffrage extensions in Europe. The model can be fit with the R packageordbetaregto facilitate hierarchical, dynamic, and multivariate modeling.","[{""name"": ""Robert Kubinec"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1745691614551642"", ""10.32614/RJ-2015-019"", ""10.1016/0165-1781(89)90013-9"", ""10.18637/jss.v080.i01"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.057"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790423"", ""10.1017/pan.2022.20"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.11.1.54"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0146021"", ""10.1177/0049124198026003004"", ""10.1080/0266476042000214501"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2014.08.001"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1255(199611)11:6<619::AID-JAE418>3.0.CO;2-1"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3966864"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-2691-6_5"", ""10.2307/2529262"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1980.tb01109.x"", ""10.1016/0165-1781(91)90027-M"", ""10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4"", ""10.1093/bja/aew466"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2005.08.024"", ""10.1016/j.csda.2011.10.005"", ""10.18637/jss.v076.i01""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Food Science', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"

However, there has been little attention given to the potential feedback between these forces. In this article, we investigate the role of union membership in shaping white racial attitudes. We draw upon research in history and American political development to generate a theory of interracial labor politics, in which union membership reduces racial resentment. Cross‐sectional analyses consistently show that white union members have lower racial resentment and greater support for policies that benefit African Americans. More importantly, our panel analysis suggests that gaining union membership between 2010 and 2016 reduced racial resentment among white workers. The findings highlight the important role of labor unions in mass politics and, more broadly, the importance of organizational membership for political attitudes and behavior.","[{""name"": ""Paul Frymer"", ""affiliation"": [""Princeton University""]}, {""name"": ""Jacob M.

10.1111/1475-6765.12374,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,"Empowered and enraged: Political efficacy, anger and support for populism in Europe","AbstractThis article addresses the psychological dynamics between internal political efficacy, emotions and support for populism. Contrary to the extended idea that populism is associated with low levels of political competence, it is argued that individuals’ self‐competence beliefs enhance populist attitudes. Individuals who conceive themselves as able to understand and participate effectively in politics are more critical towards politicians and more prone to consider that citizens could do a better job. The article also hypothesises that internal efficacy enhances the likelihood of experiencing anger, which in turn promotes populist attitudes. Experimental and comparative observational evidence shows robust direct effects of internal efficacy over populism, as well as a smaller indirect impact via feelings of anger. These findings raise important questions regarding the nature of populism and how to fight it in our emancipated and information‐intensive democratic systems.","[{""name"": ""GUILLEM RICO"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""MARC GUINJOAN"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""EVA ANDUIZA"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona Spain""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139963107"", ""10.1111/pops.12490"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.1.87"", ""10.1177/1532673X9702500205"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90359-0"", ""10.1111/spsr.12326"", ""10.1057/9781403920072_11"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12235"", ""10.1057/ap.2012.27"", ""10.1057/ap.2010.7"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199760107.013.0006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452.035"", ""10.1002/ejsp.604"", ""10.2307/2130444"", ""10.1057/9780230627895_7"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-385522-0.00005-6"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.27"", ""10.1177/0956797612464058"", ""10.1037/0096-1523.3.4.552"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.212"", ""10.1111/asap.12145"", ""10.1080/026999300402772"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67250-2"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0157658"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226574431.003.0009"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.2307/421501"", ""10.1080/15205436.2010.496135"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.18"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107300767"", ""10.1177/000312240807300606"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139108881.009"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00033"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.01433"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115043"", ""10.1257/jel.52.1.5"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.602"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12258"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011412"", ""10.1057/palgrave.sth.8700061"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1086/378965"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.06.032"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139152365.002"", ""10.1177/0093650202250881"", ""10.1080/15377857.2018.1491439"", ""10.2307/1963953"", ""10.1177/0002716216662639"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2015.08.003"", ""10.1017/S002238160999079X"", ""10.1017/S1743923X15000628"", ""10.1057/s41269-017-0068-7"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1017/S1755773917000145"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12314"", ""10.1080/026999396380240"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-77619-4_8"", ""10.1075/jlp.17024.ryd"", ""10.1017/S0008423910001095"", ""10.1037/a0026272"", ""10.1177/1948550614568159"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.55.1.37"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.48.4.813"", ""10.1177/1065912916639138"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8309.2012.02109.x"", ""10.18637/jss.v059.i05"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9076-7"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000939"", ""10.1111/pops.12183"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.03.006"", ""10.1177/1465116517698048"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9431-7""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Using data on fiscal rules provided by the IMF for a sample of 77 (advanced and developing) countries over the 1984–2015 period, we find that strong fiscal rules dampen political budget cycles. Our results are remarkably robust against inclusion of media freedom and the level of government debt as explanatory variables. Furthermore, we find a strong effect of fiscal rules in, amongst others, countries with fewer veto players, left-wing governments, established democracies, and more globalized economies. In addition, the effect of fiscal rules on political budget cycles seems to be stronger after the global financial crisis, reflecting post-crisis expansion in the number of countries with strong fiscal rules, notably in the European Union.","[{""name"": ""Bram Gootjes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jakob de Haan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Richard Jong-A-Pin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/jcms.12306"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(94)01641-C"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2005.04.001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00200.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000064"", ""10.1111/manc.12136"", ""10.2307/2297968"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2018.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.03.001"", ""10.1111/kykl.12032"", ""10.1016/j.jimonfin.2014.11.014"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00009-8"", ""10.1007/s11127-019-00647-x"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2019.06.001"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi014"", ""10.1016/j.jmoneco.2005.04.004"", ""10.1257/aer.98.5.2203"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2012.08.011"", ""10.1016/S0165-1765(02)00299-9"", ""10.5089/9781498300865.001"", ""10.18235/0001027"", ""10.1111/j.1367-0271.2004.00137.x"", ""10.1007/s11127-013-0106-6"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2019.101822"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0327.2008.00199.x"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2009.01.001"", ""10.1007/s11127-016-0313-z"", ""10.1007/s11127-011-9795-x"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2018.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2005.02.005"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.5.112801.080924"", ""10.1016/j.jmacro.2017.04.007"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09344-2"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.46"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2017.03.008"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2019.01.003"", ""10.1093/pan/mpj004"", ""10.1007/s11127-012-9943-y"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.26"", ""10.1017/S0266466609990739"", ""10.1111/1468-0343.00083"", ""10.1016/j.ecosys.2012.01.001"", ""10.1111/joes.12263"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(02)00076-2"", ""10.1177/1465116506063706"", ""10.2307/2296528"", ""10.2307/2118475"", ""10.1007/s11127-016-0364-1"", ""10.1007/s11127-009-9414-2"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12570"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2015.04.002"", ""10.1007/s11127-005-9007-7"", ""10.5089/9781475505351.001"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2005.09.009"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00444.x"", ""10.1007/s11127-012-9923-2"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.11.008""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000338,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,"Democracy, Autocracy, and Emergency Threats: Lessons for COVID-19 From the Last Thousand Years","AbstractOur experience with COVID-19 has yet to show that either democracies or autocracies are unambiguously better at dealing with this threat. What the pandemic has instead demonstrated is that these two forms of government each have specific strengths and weaknesses when it comes to dealing with external emergencies. In autocracies centralization of power allows for decisive action, but their ability to maintain secrecy means that they can also suppress information and ignore a problem. In a democracy greater transparency makes it hard to cover up a threat, but the decentralization of power that is inherent to a democracy can lead to a slow and potentially ineffective response. Using both current and historical comparisons between China and western countries, I show that these different patterns have deep roots, dating back a thousand years or more. I then consider three alternative proposals for democracies to be able to act more decisively: allowing for rule by decree, devolving responsibility to localities, and investing in preventative state capacity. History shows that the latter of these three is the safest and most effective strategy, but for it to work voters must reward politicians for investing in prevention. Unfortunately, this reward cannot be assumed.","[{""name"": ""David Stasavage"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/shm/hkz031"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511596704"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990104"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511666841"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000417"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.3151"", ""10.31235/osf.io/ub3zd"", ""10.1016/j.jinf.2004.03.002"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000326"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-59959-9"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00533.x"", ""10.31235/osf.io/fte84"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.2006.00413.x"", ""10.1007/s12284-011-9079-6"", ""10.1080/07075332.1988.9640466"", ""10.1515/9781400830961"", ""10.1126/science.367.6482.1061"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521214469.011"", ""10.1515/9781400822133""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

To build coalitions of support, scholars and policy makers propose compensating individuals who will bear decarbonization’s costs. What are the determinants of public opinion regarding climate compensation and investment? We theorize that climate policy vulnerability and climate change vulnerability induce support for distinct types of climate policy. Fielding original surveys in the United States and India, we show that people who reside in coal-producing regions prefer compensation for lost jobs. The general public privileges diffuse redistribution mechanisms and investments, discounting compensation to targeted groups. Those who are both physically and economically vulnerable have cross-cutting preferences. Nevertheless, there is considerable support across our samples for policies that compensate different coalitions of climate-vulnerable citizens, in line with theories of “just energy” transition and embedded liberalism. We trace the distinctive compensatory preferences of fossil fuel communities to a logic of shared community identities.","[{""name"": ""NIKHAR GAIKWAD"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""FEDERICA GENOVESE"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""DUSTIN TINGLEY"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1126/science.aab1336"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1111/j.1549-0831.2009.00004.x"", ""10.1086/694787"", ""10.1177/0013916506298800"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000314"", ""10.1177/0032321719836066"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000448"", ""10.1093/isq/sqz062"", ""10.1177/0002716203257072"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00577"", ""10.1073/pnas.1306374110"", ""10.1017/bap.2018.14"", ""10.1086/684791"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2017.10.007"", ""10.1037/a0037963"", ""10.7910/DVN/PHRNTQ"", ""10.1017/S000305541000050X"", ""10.1111/geoj.12008"", ""10.1038/nclimate2937"", ""10.1126/science.1254629"", ""10.2307/j.ctv301fkq"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00578"", ""10.1093/qje/qju026"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000205"", ""10.1093/socpro/spx030"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1111/ajps.12012"", ""10.1017/S002085901500036X"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000296"", ""10.1257/jel.53.1.5"", ""10.1017/9781108573481"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2020.101680"", ""10.1080/14693062.2018.1470963"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9078.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000076"", ""10.1017/S0020818300000825"", ""10.1111/ajps.12220"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2016.05.021"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab81c1"", ""10.4324/9780203153284""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Principal–agent theory views indirect governance primarily as a problem of information: the agent has an informational advantage over the principal, which it can exploit to evade principal control. But indirect governance creates a more fundamental problem of power. Competent intermediaries with needed expertise, credibility, legitimacy, and/or operational capacity are inherently difficult to control because the policy benefits they can create (or the trouble they can cause) give them leverage. Conversely, tight governor control constrains intermediaries. The governor thus faces a dilemma: emphasizing control limits intermediary competence and risks policy failure; emphasizing intermediary competence risks control failure. This “governor's dilemma” helps to explain puzzling features of indirect governance: why it is not limited to principal–agent delegation but takes multiple forms; why governors choose forms that appear counterproductive in an informational perspective; and why arrangements are frequently unstable.","[{""name"": ""Kenneth W.

10.1111/gove.12485,GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Blunt force regulation and bureaucratic control: Understanding China's war on pollution,"AbstractIn the past decade, China has increasingly resorted to top‐down, “blunt force” solutions to environmental problems; officials forcibly shutter or destroy factories to reduce pollution, at immense cost to local growth and employment. Why would a high capacity state like China resort to such a costly method of pollution control? I argue that blunt force enforcement is targeted at overcoming principal–agent problems in the bureaucracy. When institutions are too weak to hold bureaucrats accountable, political leaders increase oversight by drastically reducing the number of steps and resources required to produce a regulatory outcome—resulting in blunt force measures. I illustrate this logic through case studies from China's multiyear war on pollution. Using original data on blunt force measures, I then show how localities with lower bureaucratic compliance face greater blunt force pollution enforcement. These findings reveal that when bureaucratic accountability is weak, states pay a very high cost for cleaner air.","[{""name"": ""Denise S. van der Kamp"", ""affiliation"": [""City University of Hong Kong""]}]","[""10.7591/9781501705854"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195070705.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.2012.00367.x"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.12.006"", ""10.1177/0032329293021003002"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00004-8"", ""10.7249/CB156"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt024"", ""10.1017/S0305741017000881"", ""10.1162/DAED_a_00282"", ""10.1017/S0009443903000044"", ""10.1162/DAED_a_00281"", ""10.1007/BF02687150"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2004.tb00338.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198275145.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0097700413497551"", ""10.1163/9781684171163"", ""10.1177/0952076717753279"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801449956.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12394"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000014"", ""10.1177/1461444819826402"", ""10.1017/S0305741012000860"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510243"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.12.019"", ""10.1177/107808747100600401"", ""10.1111/puar.12285"", ""10.1111/ajps.12065"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001114"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000252"", ""10.1007/s12116-008-9027-7"", ""10.2307/2110792"", ""10.1086/677058"", ""10.1002/pad.1799"", ""10.1017/S0305741017000042"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613067"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0048"", ""10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030532"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2015.12.009"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451"", ""10.1086/517935"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1452522"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.12.005"", ""10.1007/s12116-008-9028-6"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139096614"", ""10.1111/gove.12280"", ""10.1177/0010414014534196"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(89)90062-4"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.02.021"", ""10.1017/S0305741017000935"", ""10.1177/0010414013509569"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139680479"", ""10.1007/s41111-017-0059-x"", ""10.1086/671335""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12584,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,The Unequal Distribution of Opportunity: A National Audit Study of Bureaucratic Discrimination in Primary School Access,"AbstractAdministrators can use their discretion to discriminate in the provision of public services via two mechanisms. They make decisions to allocate public services, allowing them to discriminate via allocative exclusion. They can also discriminate by targeting administrative burdens toward outgroups to make bureaucratic processes more onerous. While prior audit studies only examine the use of administrative burdens, we offer evidence of both mechanisms. We sent a request to all Danish primary schools (N = 1,698) from an ingroup (a typical Danish name) and outgroup (a Muslim name) father asking if it was possible to move his child to the school. While both groups received similar response rates, we find large differences in discrimination via allocative exclusion: Danes received a clear acceptance 25% of the time, compared to 15% for Muslims. Muslims also faced greater administrative burdens in the form of additional questions.","[{""name"": ""Asmus Leth Olsen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Copenhagen""]}, {""name"": ""Jonas Høgh Kyhse‐Andersen"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Researcher""]}, {""name"": ""Donald Moynihan"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University""]}]","[""10.1080/03003930.2016.1244052"", ""10.3386/w25333"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy083"", ""10.1126/science.aag2147"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226041049.001.0001"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3306108"", ""10.1257/0002828042002561"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000143"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.1990.tb00226.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00515.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0214244"", ""10.1257/aer.104.9.2633"", ""10.1017/XPS.2018.9"", ""10.1017/XPS.2017.14"", ""10.1177/0197918319890270"", ""10.1093/esr/jcy020"", ""10.1177/0003122415577989"", ""10.1086/690948"", ""10.1111/ajps.12252"", ""10.1016/j.jhe.2018.07.003"", ""10.15195/v4.a19"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71153-9_1"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvx045"", ""10.1111/puar.12439"", ""10.5465/AMBPP.2018.52"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990372"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000813"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.2008.00163.x"", ""10.1002/pam.22046"", ""10.1787/0adf9e55-en"", ""10.1111/ajps.12312"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000424"", ""10.1111/ajps.12360"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy009"", ""10.1086/693984"", ""10.1111/ajps.12493"", ""10.3998/mpub.11924"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000217"", ""10.1086/374403"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226644851.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy018"", ""10.1111/puar.13235"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy025"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq095"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000562"", ""10.1177/1747016118820497"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2015.1133279""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

To what extent did this new set‐up change the power balance among key actors (for example, financial and economic actors versus social affairs actors)? Drawing on historical institutionalism and based on 28 semi‐structured interviews and document analysis, our assessment suggests that while social actors were initially side‐lined and national executives strengthened, over time the pendulum is swinging back. The usual actors are strategically using the institutional structures of the revised Semester as a vehicle to ‘have a say’ in the RRF. Having more carrots and sticks suggests further strengthening the pivotal role of the European Commission. Yet having the option of submitting national plans gives member states options too. The EU institutional response to the Covid‐19 pandemic built on, and further cemented, the EU's socio‐economic governance architecture.","[{""name"": ""Bart Vanhercke"", ""affiliation"": [""European Social Observatory  Brussels Belgium"", ""Associate academic staff member Research Institute for Work and Society (HIVA)  KULeuven""]}, {""name"": ""Amy Verdun"", ""affiliation"": [""Professor of Political Science University of Victoria  Victoria BC"", ""Leiden University  Leiden The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1057/cep.2016.10"", ""10.1080/01402382.2020.1739407"", ""10.1111/jcms.13266"", ""10.1017/S0043887100020852"", ""10.1007/s40812-020-00165-8"", ""10.1111/jcms.13269"", ""10.1111/spol.12709"", ""10.1111/jcms.13274"", ""10.1111/jcms.13276"", ""10.1093/019829638X.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jcms.13271"", ""10.1080/23745118.2021.1928818"", ""10.1080/07036337.2013.774778"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1730356"", ""10.1111/jcms.13270"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2020.1781604"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1852231"", ""10.1111/jcms.13273"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1363268"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3359"", ""10.1111/jcms.13272"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.994023"", ""10.1080/09644008.2021.2003782"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192896216.003.0016"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1363807"", ""10.1177/0958928710385733"", ""10.1057/s41295-020-00227-0"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1363269""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

I furnish here a third justification for bicameralism, with one elected chamber and the second selected by lot, as an institutional compromise between contradictory imperatives facing representative democracy: elections are a mechanism of people’s political agency and of accountability, but run counter to political equality and impartiality, and are insufficient for satisfactory responsiveness; sortition is a mechanism for equality and impartiality, and of enhancing responsiveness, but not of people’s political agency or of holding representatives accountable. Whereas the two traditional justifications initially grew out of anti-egalitarian premises (about the need for elite wisdom and to protect the elite few against the many), the justification advanced here is grounded in egalitarian premises about the need to protect state institutions from capture by the powerful few and to treat all subjects as political equals. Reflecting the “political” turn in political theory, I embed this general argument within the institutional context of Canadian parliamentary federalism, arguing that Canada’s Senate ought to be reconstituted as a randomly selected citizen assembly.","[{""name"": ""Arash Abizadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/jod.1999.0055"", ""10.1080/08913811.2017.1288455"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.2010.00608.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1564.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609350"", ""10.1017/S0034670500049226"", ""10.1007/BF01718470"", ""10.4159/9780674970342"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2008.00746.x"", ""10.1007/BF00286870"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001595"", ""10.1177/1474885116665600"", ""10.3162/036298006X201742"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226842806.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674042582"", ""10.1515/9781400831548"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.1996.tb00045.x"", ""10.1525/9780520340503"", ""10.1515/9780773571341"", ""10.3138/9781442680609"", ""10.1093/aristotelian/91.1.87"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198262138.001.0001"", ""10.1111/papa.12035"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659935"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000602"", ""10.1002/polq.12577"", ""10.1177/053901889028001002"", ""10.1111/j.1939-9162.2010.00004.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199567843.001.0001"", ""10.1086/340313"", ""10.1515/9781400882731"", ""10.1073/pnas.0403723101"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2011.06.028"", ""10.1086/292249"", ""10.1017/S0008423909990059"", ""10.2307/440283"", ""10.2307/2110460"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139017428"", ""10.2307/1911036"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199547944.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0951629815586876"", ""10.1017/9781316338179"", ""10.1057/9781403943835"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198297475.001.0001"", ""10.7202/1038213ar"", ""10.1177/0160323X0503700301"", ""10.1007/s11098-006-9053-0"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226644806.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139680752"", ""10.1111/papa.12029"", ""10.1017/epi.2015.67"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000856"", ""10.1177/0090591707310084"", ""10.1017/S0003055406062071"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139057486"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199756100.001.0001"", ""10.1090/noti1163"", ""10.2307/2297770"", ""10.1287/moor.1.2.144""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

This article distinguishes between constitutive, spatial and institutional dimensions of polarization, adopting a cross-regional comparative perspective on different subtypes of populism in Europe, Latin America and the US. It explains why populism typically arises in contexts of low political polarization (the US being a major, if partial, outlier), but has the effect of sharply increasing polarization by constructing an anti-establishment political frontier, politicizing new policy or issue dimensions, and contesting democracy's institutional and procedural norms. Populism places new issues on the political agenda and realigns partisan and electoral competition along new programmatic divides or political cleavages. Its polarizing effects, however, raise the stakes of political competition and intensify conflict over the control of key institutional sites.","[{""name"": ""Kenneth M.

Despite intense public debate, there is little systematic evidence on how such policies influence the behavior of the religious minorities they target. In this paper, we use rich quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the effects of the 2004 French headscarf ban on the socioeconomic integration of French Muslim women. We find that the law reduces the secondary educational attainment of Muslim girls and affects their trajectory in the labor market and family composition in the long run. We provide evidence that the ban operates through increased perceptions of discrimination and that it strengthens both national and religious identities.","[{""name"": ""AALA ABDELGADIR"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""VASILIKI FOUKA"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1073/pnas.1808793115"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000017"", ""10.3406/homig.2005.4391"", ""10.1080/10615806.2016.1157170"", ""10.1162/rest.90.3.414"", ""10.2307/1130933"", ""10.1007/s10597-006-9052-9"", ""10.1007/s00148-014-0512-1"", ""10.1093/socrel/68.3.253"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.3.416"", ""10.1111/pops.12279"", ""10.18128/D020.V70"", ""10.1017/S1755048310000519"", ""10.1080/10508610903418038"", ""10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.2-3.445"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2011.04.009"", ""10.1080/10888690801997341"", ""10.1177/0146167211424580"", ""10.3982/ECTA9878"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2011.526781"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2009.164954"", ""10.1177/1043463112440683"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12219"", ""10.1353/wp.0.0023"", ""10.1073/pnas.1015550107"", ""10.2307/2620359"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.77.1.135"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.12.014"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.44.3.637"", ""10.2105/AJPH.93.2.232"", ""10.1080/01419870902935963"", ""10.1177/0022022117741988"", ""10.1017/S1755048318000287"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2010.01199.x"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2014.931235"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2008.144329"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071811-145455"", ""10.1515/9781400837564"", ""10.1111/imre.12184"", ""10.1037/a0040322"", ""10.1017/S000305540400098X"", ""10.1126/science.aag2147"", ""10.1007/s11109-005-4803-9"", ""10.1093/restud/rdz024"", ""10.2307/41219165"", ""10.1515/9780748669943"", ""10.1111/imre.12135"", ""10.3406/diver.2012.3547"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3468593"", ""10.1177/0146167297237003"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7sgmx"", ""10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200018"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797"", ""10.1177/0146167207304276"", ""10.1017/S1537592711004919"", ""10.1080/01419870.2018.1444186"", ""10.1177/1088868309349693"", ""10.1017/S1755048316000754"", ""10.2307/4153097"", ""10.1017/S095457949700206X"", ""10.1177/0146167210367491"", ""10.1057/9781137316080"", ""10.1093/qje/qjs045"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2009.00520.x"", ""10.1080/01402380601019613""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000650,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,How to Close the Gender Gap in Political Participation: Lessons from Matrilineal Societies in Africa,"AbstractWhile gender gaps in political participation are pervasive, especially in developing countries, this study provides systematic evidence of one cultural practice that closes this gap. Using data from across Africa, this article shows that matrilineality – tracing kinship through the female line – is robustly associated with closing the gender gap in political participation. It then uses this practice as a lens through which to draw more general inferences. Exploiting quantitative and qualitative data from Malawi, the authors demonstrate that matrilineality's success in improving outcomes for women lies in its ability to sustain more progressive norms about the role of women in society. It sets individual expectations about the gendered beliefs and behaviors of other households in the community, and in a predictable way through the intergenerational transmission of the practice. The study tests and finds evidence against two competing explanations: that matrilineality works through its conferral of material resources alone, or by increasing education for girls.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Lea Robinson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jessica Gottlieb"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/aa.1947.49.4.02a00220"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511549885"", ""10.1017/S1743923X09990365"", ""10.1080/00220388.2013.833321"", ""10.2307/2998592"", ""10.2307/1962158"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000271"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053324"", ""10.3982/ECTA6690"", ""10.1177/0010414012463884"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt005"", ""10.1177/1065912908322411"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608607.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414014548104"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2014.11.004"", ""10.4073/csr.2014.8"", ""10.1515/9781580467575"", ""10.1017/S0021853700021976"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000458"", ""10.1177/0010414006297342"", ""10.2307/2111186"", ""10.1177/0308275X9701700205"", ""10.1016/S1090-5138(02)00122-8"", ""10.2307/2096305"", ""10.1080/00344893.2014.951232"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000976"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000053"", ""10.1257/aer.101.7.3221"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.05.003"", ""10.1080/03057070500035679"", ""10.4159/9780674029088"", ""10.1257/jel.50.4.1051"", ""10.1080/13691050500151255"", ""10.1353/wp.2003.0004"", ""10.1080/03057070.2011.579436"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2011.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.01.006"", ""10.1257/aer.20130604"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511542466.019"", ""10.1198/016214508000000841"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115404"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000650"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000329"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.011"", ""10.1098/rspb.2003.2535"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.05.010"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511550362"", ""10.1023/A:1026256917489"", ""10.1093/ije/dyu049""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Safety Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

This study aims to identify the underlying mechanism between intra-group relationship conflict and knowledge hiding.Design/methodology/approachDrawing on affective events theory (AET), the authors propose a theoretical model and empirically test it by applying hierarchical regression analysis and a bootstrapping approach to data from a multi-wave survey of 224 employees in China.FindingsConsistent with AET, the empirical results show that envy mediates perceived intragroup relationship conflict and knowledge hiding. As predicted, trait competitiveness moderates the indirect effect of perceived intragroup relationship conflict on knowledge hiding via envy.Originality/valueThe results support an AET perspective whereby knowledge hiding is shaped by relationship conflict, envy and trait competitiveness. This study introduces the novel proposition that relationship conflict and competitiveness influence envy, and consequently knowledge hiding.","[{""name"": ""He Peng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Bell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yiran Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/256633"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.03.007"", ""10.1177/014920630202800304"", ""10.1007/BF01390436"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.103.1.5"", ""10.1287/orsc.1110.0734"", ""10.1080/1359432X.2017.1337747"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.5.808"", ""10.1108/eb022747"", ""10.1108/eb022906"", ""10.1177/135910457000100301"", ""10.1177/002224299806200407"", ""10.1037/1076-8998.11.2.145"", ""10.5465/amj.2012.0122"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.3.666"", ""10.1177/0963721416683667"", ""10.1080/1359432X.2014.931325"", ""10.1002/job.737"", ""10.1287/isre.5.4.400"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2008.06.001"", ""10.1037/a0020720"", ""10.1037/a0017104"", ""10.1108/00220411011087832"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.4.741"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.345"", ""10.1037/a0024844"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.0804"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2017.03.002"", ""10.1037/a0020015"", ""10.1177/001872675400700202"", ""10.1002/job.503"", ""10.1108/MD-11-2016-0778"", ""10.4018/jkm.2008100101"", ""10.1108/JKM-11-2014-0469"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1135"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.76.1.129"", ""10.1080/13594320444000236"", ""10.1108/JKM-11-2017-0531"", ""10.1177/001872675400700203"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.99.3.561"", ""10.2307/2393638"", ""10.2307/3069453"", ""10.2307/2667054"", ""10.1108/JKM-02-2017-0048"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2016.07.005"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2006.00054.x"", ""10.1037/h0029849"", ""10.1108/PR-12-2014-0279"", ""10.1037/pspi0000118"", ""10.1007/s11136-020-02460-2"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM0902_1"", ""10.1108/10444061111126675"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2018.05.005"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.4.603"", ""10.1037/a0028324"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.05.008"", ""10.1108/JKM-12-2012-0380"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100037"", ""10.1037/apl0000456"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.899"", ""10.1207/s15328007sem1304_4"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-03-2018-0044"", ""10.1108/JKM-01-2018-0007"", ""10.1108/JKM-05-2016-0203"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.42.2.281"", ""10.1007/s11747-012-0302-9"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-08-2015-0051"", ""10.1108/JKM-05-2017-0179"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.46"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60227-0"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.54.1.49"", ""10.1037/a0015669"", ""10.1007/s11031-011-9235-8"", ""10.1080/02699930441000148"", ""10.1080/09585192.2013.877057"", ""10.1108/13673271211246167"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2019.01.006"", ""10.1111/jonm.12675"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2016.09.009"", ""10.1108/JKM-06-2015-0222"", ""10.1177/0146167296222005""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

By taking a novel cross-country and cross-time approach at both the aggregate- and individual levels using panel data, I robustly demonstrate that the salience of immigration positively affects electoral support for the populist right. I also find, using a structural equation modeling approach, that the salience of immigration, in turn, is partially caused by immigration rates. I do not find evidence of a positive effect of the salience of the issues of crime, unemployment, the economy, or terrorism. I find evidence of a positive effect of the salience of Europe at the individual level, which is of a similar scale to immigration.","[{""name"": ""James Dennison"", ""affiliation"": [""Migration Policy Centre, European University Institute, Italy""]}]","[""10.1080/13608746.2014.985448"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00369.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00304.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.07.005"", ""10.1086/268900"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2006.10.018"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1039374"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.03.001"", ""10.1080/17457289.2012.662983"", ""10.1177/1478929918819264"", ""10.1086/257897"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2011.06.010"", ""10.2307/2110923"", ""10.1023/A:1022952311518"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.02.003"", ""10.1146/annurev.neuro.29.051605.113038"", ""10.1177/0010414003251176"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.01.003"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245.009"", ""10.1521/soco.1986.4.1.39"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12090"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.196"", ""10.1007/BF00992332"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00407"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00015"", ""10.1073/pnas.1305631110"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00632.x"", ""10.1080/01402380802234631"", ""10.1037/e412982005-012"", ""10.2307/1954456"", ""10.2307/1952828"", ""10.1093/ijpor/14.3.264"", ""10.1093/soceco/1.2.215"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2010.01337.x"", ""10.1016/S0022-1031(02)00522-X"", ""10.1080/17457289.2013.810630"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-26300-1"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.01.009""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Despite its real-world import, little is known about how to combat misinformation outside of the United States, particularly in places with low education, accelerating Internet access, and encrypted information sharing. This study uses a field experiment in India to test the efficacy of a pedagogical intervention on respondents’ ability to identify misinformation during the 2019 elections (N = 1,224). Treated respondents received hour-long in-person media literacy training in which enumerators discussed inoculation strategies, corrections, and the importance of verifying misinformation, all in a coherent learning module. Receiving this hour-long media literacy intervention did not significantly increase respondents’ ability to identify misinformation on average. However, treated respondents who support the ruling party became significantly less able to identify pro-attitudinal stories. These findings point to the resilience of misinformation in India and the presence of motivated reasoning in a traditionally nonideological party system.","[{""name"": ""SUMITRA BADRINATHAN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10584609.2014.914613"", ""10.1080/23808985.2019.1602782"", ""10.1111/pops.12394"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1086/694783"", ""10.1111/pops.12494"", ""10.1177/1065912917729037"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.211"", ""10.1093/joc/jqaa022"", ""10.1080/09584935.2020.1765988"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0175799"", ""10.3102/0002831216679817"", ""10.1080/21670811.2017.1360143"", ""10.1080/13183222.2018.1463047"", ""10.1080/15205436.2019.1604970"", ""10.1017/rep.2018.25"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(06)38004-5"", ""10.1002/polq.12398"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990098"", ""10.1093/poq/nft005"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000187"", ""10.1080/10584609.2020.1716499"", ""10.1017/bpp.2016.2"", ""10.37016/mr-2020-030"", ""10.1177/1461444818758715"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316389690"", ""10.1177/016146811912101102"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12228"", ""10.1080/08838151.2016.1273923"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-010419-050807"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1637445"", ""10.1037/xge0000465"", ""10.1177/1354068811436059"", ""10.1177/0963721420915872"", ""10.1561/100.00014127"", ""10.1525/as.2020.60.6.1029"", ""10.1126/science.aau2706"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1073/pnas.1920498117"", ""10.1177/0146167297231009"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052115-021432"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0240005"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2012.01424.x"", ""10.1177/1461444820928059"", ""10.1111/ajps.12562"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190623876.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0093650219898094"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000069"", ""10.7910/DVN/ITKNX5"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y"", ""10.1177/0002764219869406"", ""10.1177/0956797617714579"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511585869"", ""10.1080/21670811.2019.1623701"", ""10.1017/9781108890960.003"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2020.1764603""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We start this review with an outline of what social identity theorizing offers to the study of inequality. We then articulate four hypotheses that can be derived from the social identity approach: the fit hypothesis, the wealth‐categorization hypothesis, the wealth‐stereotype hypothesis, and the sociostructural hypothesis. We review the empirical literature that tests these hypotheses by exploring the effect of economic inequality, measured objectively by metrics such as the Gini coefficient as well as subjectively in terms of perceptions of economic inequality, on wealth categorization (of others and the self), the desire for more wealth and status, intergroup hostility, attitudes towards immigrants, prosocial behavior, stereotyping, the wish for a strong leader, the endorsement of conspiracy theories, and collective action intentions. As we will show, this research suggests that economic inequality may have even more far‐reaching consequences than commonly believed. Indeed, investigating the effects of economic inequality on citizens' sociopolitical behaviors may be increasingly important in today's turbulent political and social landscape.","[{""name"":

We advance an agenda for research that stands on four pillars. First, in the absence of easily accessible data scholars of developing world public administration must assemble it for themselves. Second, building and testing theory plays a paramount role because researchers face limited information. Third, in developing countries, multi‐national and non‐governmental organizations are often crucial and must be considered in studying public administration. Fourth, given the novelties and ambiguities researchers face, qualitative information must be integrated throughout the research process. Our article—and the articles in this volume—constitute a call for developing country research to contribute to the study of public administration writ large, informing our understanding of both developing and developed states.","[{""name"": ""Anthony M.

10.1017/S0260210519000342,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,"'#Refugees can be entrepreneurs too!' Humanitarianism, race, and the marketing of Syrian refugees","AbstractIn the context of a greater focus on the politics of migration, the ‘refugee entrepreneur’ has become an increasingly important figure in humanitarian, media, and academic portrayals of refugees. Through a focus on Jordan's Za‘tari refugee camp, which has been deemed a showcase for refugees’ ‘entrepreneurship’, this article argues that the designation of Syrian refugees as ‘entrepreneurs’ is a positioning of Syrians within colonial hierarchies of race that pervade humanitarian work. For many humanitarian workers in Jordan, Syrians' ‘entrepreneurship’ distinguishes them from ‘African’ refugees, who are imagined as passive, impoverished, and dependent on humanitarian largesse. Without explicit racial comparisons, humanitarian agencies simultaneously market Syrian refugees online as ‘entrepreneurs’, to enable them to be perceived as closer to whiteness, and to thereby render them more acceptable to Western audiences and donors, who are imagined as white. This article extends scholarly understandings of the understudied relationship between race and humanitarianism. Furthermore, it asks critical questions about the political work and effects of vision of the ‘refugee entrepreneur’, which it locates within the context of the increasingly neoliberalised refugee regime. ‘Refugee entrepreneurs’ do not need political support and solidarity, but to be allowed to embrace the forces of free-market capitalism.","[{""name"": ""Lewis Turner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/544026a"", ""10.1111/disa.12271"", ""10.1017/S0020743814000130"", ""10.1017/S0020743817000046"", ""10.1525/9780520928466"", ""10.25071/1920-7336.40451"", ""10.1080/13629395.2015.1078125"", ""10.1215/9780822387879"", ""10.1111/cag.12019"", ""10.1093/jrs/few044"", ""10.1093/jrs/11.4.350-a"", ""10.51644/9781554580989"", ""10.1080/01436597.2017.1331123"", ""10.1080/14616742.2011.534661"", ""10.1080/03056244.2013.816944"", ""10.1215/9780822391715"", ""10.2307/20028386"", ""10.1080/09557571.2013.770298"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.734788"", ""10.1080/13688790.2016.1254016"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00710.x"", ""10.1177/030437540102600404"", ""10.1177/030437549902400302"", ""10.1080/08949468.2016.1131523"", ""10.1080/01436597.2016.1176856"", ""10.1080/01436597.2018.1458301"", ""10.1177/0967010612457975"", ""10.1177/0967010609357042"", ""10.1177/1354066116634442"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1417372"", ""10.1017/S0260210517000110"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1417366"", ""10.1080/09557571.2013.770297"", ""10.1080/13183222.2016.1248323"", ""10.1515/9781685850524"", ""10.1111/ips.12101"", ""10.1093/rsq/hdx003"", ""10.3366/afr.2006.0033"", ""10.1093/0199246912.001.0001"", ""10.1111/gere.12315"", ""10.1353/anq.2016.0073"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.710585"", ""10.1525/can.1996.11.3.02a00050"", ""10.1080/01436597.2011.560471"", ""10.1080/14680777.2015.1137339"", ""10.1111/ips.12071"", ""10.1086/695304"", ""10.1215/9780822374565"", ""10.1080/19436149.2018.1462601"", ""10.4314/rj.v1i1.6A"", ""10.1353/ncr.2004.0015"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4967.2011.00484.x"", ""10.1080/01436597.2011.586235"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1361543"", ""10.1525/jlca.2004.9.2.319"", ""10.5040/9781350222090"", ""10.1080/0966369X.2011.566347"", ""10.1080/21681392.2016.1244956""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S1755048319000208,POLITICS AND RELIGION,0101 Philosophy; 0302 Political Science,Who Wants to Make America Great Again? Understanding Evangelical Support for Donald Trump,"AbstractWhite evangelicals overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election, producing extensive debate as to who evangelicals are, what it means to be an evangelical in the United States today, and whether the electoral results are surprising or not. This paper offers empirical clarity to this protracted discussion by asking and answering a series of questions related to Trump's victory in general and his support from white evangelicals in particular. In doing so, the analyses show that the term “evangelical” has not become a synonym for conservative politics and that white evangelical support for Trump would behigherif public opinion scholars used a belief-centered definition of evangelicalism rather than relying on the more common classification strategies based on self-identification or religious denomination. These findings go against claims thatnominalevangelicals, those who call themselves evangelicals but are not religious, make up the core of Trump's support base. Moreover, strong electoral support among devout evangelicals is not unique to the 2016 election but rather is part of a broader trend of evangelical electoral behavior, even when faced with non-traditional Republican candidates. Finally, the paper explores why white evangelicals might support a candidate like Trump. The paper presents evidence that negative partisanship helps explain why devout evangelicals—despite Trump's background and behaviors being cause for concern—coalesced around his presidential bid. Together, the findings from this paper help make sense of both the 2016 presidential election and evangelical public opinion, both separately and together.","[{""name"": ""Michele F.

10.1017/S1537592720003667,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,When Does Backsliding Lead to Breakdown? Uncertainty and Opposition Strategies in Democracies at Risk,"In recent decades, prominent national leaders like Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez gained power through democratic institutions, only to undermine those institutions once in office as part of a broader effort to consolidate authoritarian power. Yet attempts at “executive aggrandizement” have failed in other countries, with varying consequences for democratic institutions. We develop an agency-based perspective to enhance the understanding of aggrandizement and to explain when it results in democratic breakdown. Relying on comparative case studies of five countries—Bolivia, Ecuador, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela—our analysis suggests that the contingent decisions of opposition actors during the process of aggrandizement have a significant effect on regime outcomes. Irregular opposition attempts to remove incumbents from office, which are especially likely after electoral defeats, contribute to democratic breakdown. More moderate responses to aggrandizement, on the other hand, help the opposition actors to buy time until the next election, hence offering the possibility for democratic survival.","[{""name"": ""Matthew R.

By providing IEA texts, the IEADB helps scholars identify and systematically code IEA design features. We review scholarship derived from the IEADB on international environmental governance, including insights into IEA membership, formation, and design as well as the deeper structure of international environmental law. We note the IEADB’s value as a teaching tool to promote undergraduate and graduate teaching and research.

Despite this, only a significantly small number seek mental healthcare. With the UK beginning to invest further support to the armed forces community, identification of barriers and facilitators of help-seeking behaviour is needed. Methods Corresponding literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, PsycArticles, Medline, Web of Science and EBSCO. Articles which discussed barriers and facilitators of seeking help for mental health concerns in the veteran population were included. Those which discussed serving personnel or physical problems were not included within this review. A total of 26 papers were analysed. Results A number of barriers and facilitators of help-seeking for a mental health issue within the veteran population were identified. Barriers included stigma, military culture of stoicism and self-reliance, as well as deployment characteristics of combat exposure and different warzone deployments. Health service difficulties such as access and lack of understanding by civilian staff were also identified. Facilitators to help combat these barriers included a campaign to dispel the stigma, including involvement of veterans and training of military personnel, as well as more accessibility and understanding from healthcare staff. Conclusions While some barriers and facilitators have been identified, much of this research has been conducted within the USA and on male veterans and lacks longitudinal evidence. Further research is needed within the context of other nations and female veterans and to further indicate the facilitators of help-seeking among veterans.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Randles"", ""affiliation"": [""Westminster Centre for Research in Veterans, University of Chester Faculty of Health and Social Care, Chester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""A Finnegan"", ""affiliation"": [""Westminster Centre for Research in Veterans, University of Chester Faculty of Health and Social Care, Chester, UK""]}]","[""10.1186/1471-244X-9-1"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2008.150284"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa040603"", ""10.3390/healthcare8010001"", ""10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001735"", ""10.1111/j.1440-172X.2011.01936.x"", ""10.1192/bjp.186.4.297"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.04.001"", ""10.1186/1471-244X-10-113"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2013.02.020"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.159.12.2081"", ""10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001734"", ""10.1093/milmed/usy086"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.03.009"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.1186/s13643-016-0345-y"", ""10.1136/bmjebm-2019-111269"", ""10.1097/NMD.0b013e31822fc9bf"", ""10.1080/21635781.2015.1055866"", ""10.1080/20008198.2019.1700613"", ""10.1080/21635781.2015.1055866"", ""10.1080/08039488.2019.1669072"", ""10.1080/15487768.2014.903875"", ""10.1023/A:1024464915138"", ""10.1111/jrh.12203"", ""10.1177/0020764019842327"", ""10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000326"", ""10.1521/psyc.2009.72.3.238"", ""10.7205/MILMED-D-13-00076"", ""10.1186/s12913-018-3346-9"", ""10.1353/hpu.2015.0077"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2018.06.036"", ""10.1176/appi.ps.201800405"", ""10.1037/a0037986"", ""10.1093/milmed/usx219"", ""10.1080/08995605.2019.1598228"", ""10.2147/PRBM.S158876"", ""10.1111/hsc.12585"", ""10.1037/fsh0000231"", ""10.1037/men0000117"", ""10.1111/j.1467-842X.1997.tb01685.x"", ""10.1037/a0024360"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.02.024""]",['Psychology'],"['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1017/S0003055420000647,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,The Non-Democratic Roots of Mass Education: Evidence from 200 Years,"Because primary education is often conceptualized as a pro-poor redistributive policy, a common argument is that democratization increases its provision. But primary education can also serve the goals of autocrats, including redistribution, promoting loyalty, nation-building, and/or industrialization. To examine the relationship between democratization and education provision empirically, I leverage new datasets covering 109 countries and 200 years. Difference-in-differences and interrupted time series estimates find that, on average, democratization had no or little impact on primary school enrollment rates. When unpacking this average null result, I find that, consistent with median voter theories, democratizationcanlead to an expansion of primary schooling, but the key condition under which it does—when a majority lacked access to primary schooling before democratization—rarely holds. Around the world, state-controlled primary schooling emerged a century before democratization, and in three-fourths of countries that democratized, a majority already had access to primary education before democratization.","[{""name"": ""AGUSTINA S.

Such systems, which can regulate party members’ access to offices at multiple levels of their careers, are defined by two main rules or norms: an incumbent re-nomination norm and a seniority progression norm. Using comprehensive electoral and candidate data from Norwegian local and national elections from 1945 to 2019, we find systematic patterns consistent with these two norms. Our work illuminates an institutional aspect of candidate selection that the current literature has ignored while noting some of the important consequences of seniority-based nominations for party cohesion and stability.","[{""name"": ""ALEXANDRA CIRONE"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""GARY W.

10.1017/S0007123420000666,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Politics of Nostalgia and Populism: Evidence from Turkey,"AbstractThis article scrutinizes the relationship between collective nostalgia and populism. Different populist figures utilize nostalgia by referring to their country's ‘good old’ glorious days and exploiting resentment of the elites and establishment. Populists instrumentalize nostalgia in order to create their populist heartland, which is a retrospectively constructed utopia based on an abandoned but undead past. Using two original datasets from Turkey, this study first analyzes whether collective nostalgia characterizes populist attitudes of the electorate. The results illustrate that collective nostalgia has a significantly positive relationship with populist attitudes even after controlling for various independent variables, including religiosity, partisanship, satisfaction with life and Euroscepticism. Secondly, the study tests whether nostalgic messages affect populist attitudes using an online survey experiment. The results indicate that Ottoman nostalgia helps increase populist attitudes. Kemalist nostalgia, however, has a weak direct effect on populist attitudes that disappears after controlling for party preference.","[{""name"": ""Ezgi Elçi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/21599165.2020.1737523"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.27"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1334138"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.30"", ""10.1080/23745118.2016.1269442"", ""10.1080/14683857.2019.1656875"", ""10.4324/9780429295089-16"", ""10.1080/14683841003747054"", ""10.1080/17457289.2017.1407326"", ""10.1080/14683849.2017.1314763"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12121"", ""10.1057/9780230592100"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.3.4.424"", ""10.1080/14616696.2018.1494297"", ""10.1080/14683857.2016.1242893"", ""10.1177/0010414017720705"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.06.010"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12216"", ""10.1177/1465116517718091"", ""10.1111/spsr.12275"", ""10.1177/1065912916639138"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2011.10.005"", ""10.7910/DVN/29SA7P"", ""10.1080/14683849.2018.1483195"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2015.07.001"", ""10.1080/01402382.2011.616665"", ""10.1057/9780230305076"", ""10.1002/ejsp.779"", ""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1177/0010414018784054"", ""10.1177/1369148117701753"", ""10.1080/09502389500490511"", ""10.1177/0002716218818056"", ""10.2307/422412"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00150"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.1386/macp.12.1.59_1"", ""10.1111/ajps.12357"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1017/gov.2017.16"", ""10.1177/0002716218818058"", ""10.1215/1089201x-3139096"", ""10.1080/01402389508425056"", ""10.1080/1356931042000263528"", ""10.1057/9780312299057"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.006"", ""10.5964/jspp.v5i2.733"", ""10.1057/9780230621534"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2016.1208863"", ""10.1037/a0037760"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00066.x"", ""10.1348/014466605X27162"", ""10.1080/14683840500119593"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12166"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-54681-0_4"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2013.786199"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1177/1354068808097890"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00387"", ""10.1080/13569317.2017.1346773"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96758-5_6"", ""10.1080/1356931042000263546"", ""10.1177/0010414094027003004"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1177/1354068817741287"", ""10.1080/10463283.2015.1112653"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4"", ""10.1111/1467-8551.00228"", ""10.1215/00382876-102-2-3-309""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Although the literature offers a large number of instrument taxonomies, many of them act as theoretical guidelines rather than operational concepts that can help to disentangle the different features of governing actions. This article provides a review of the most frequently used policy instrument typologies and, through a meta‐analysis, it analyses how instrument typologies have been differentially adopted to explain real‐world phenomena. The results are a high degree of heterogeneity in citation frequency, the polyhedral nature of the concept of policy instruments, a divide between typologies focused on governmental resources and those focused on drivers of expected behaviour, and ‘labellism’. Thus, what emerges is the urgency of a process of convergence towards a common framework.","[{""name"": ""Claudia Acciai"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social and Political Sciences Scuola Normale Superiore Firenze Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Giliberto Capano"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political and Social Sciences University of Bologna Bologna Italy""]}]","[""10.1016/j.siny.2015.10.002"", ""10.1111/gove.12179"", ""10.1017/S0008423912000376"", ""10.1108/00220410810844150"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2013.787512"", ""10.1002/asi.4630360402"", ""10.1177/0952076719827068"", ""10.1177/2158244019900568"", ""10.1057/9781137477972"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9267-8"", ""10.1111/rego.12244"", ""10.1017/S0143814X19000047"", ""10.1080/01900692.2014.982292"", ""10.1177/0306312714522871"", ""10.1096/fj.07-9492LSF"", ""10.1017/S0143814X18000053"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-17169-9"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00347.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-06154-6"", ""10.1111/j.1754-7121.2000.tb01152.x"", ""10.4324/9780429401046"", ""10.1016/S1449-4035(07)70118-2"", ""10.4337/9781784719326.00013"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2005.00540.x"", ""10.1111/hequ.12093"", ""10.1080/09640568.2014.930706"", ""10.3102/01623737009002133"", ""10.1177/030631277500500106"", ""10.1515/1944-2866.1160"", ""10.1017/9781108555081"", ""10.1016/0883-0355(95)91497-5"", ""10.2307/2131904"", ""10.4135/9781529682571"", ""10.1080/01900692.2012.691243"", ""10.1111/psj.12191"", ""10.25100/cdea.v35i63.6893""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Demography', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12452,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Multiple roots of the populist radical right: Support for the Dutch PVV in cities and the countryside,"AbstractPopulist radical right parties are considerably more popular in some areas (neighbourhoods, municipalities, regions) than others. They thrive in some cities, in some smaller towns, and in some rural areas, but they are unsuccessful in other cities, small towns, and rural areas. We seek to explain this regional variation by modelling at the individual level how citizens respond to local conditions. We argue that patterns of populist radical right support can be explained by anxiety in the face of social change. However, how social change manifests itself is different in rural and urban areas, so that variations in populist radical right support are rooted in different kinds of conditions. To analyse the effects of these conditions we use unique geo‐referenced survey data from the Netherlands collected among a nationwide sample of 8,000 Dutch respondents. Our analyses demonstrate that the presence of immigrants (and particularly increases therein) can explain why populist radical right parties are more popular in some urban areas than in others, but that it cannot explain variation across rural areas. In these areas, local marginalization is an important predictor of support for populist radical right parties. Hence, to understand the support for the populist radical right, the heterogeneity of its electorate should be recognized.","[{""name"": ""EELCO HARTEVELD"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Amsterdam Postbus, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""WOUTER VAN DER BRUG"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Amsterdam Postbus, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""SARAH DE LANGE"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Amsterdam Postbus, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""TOM VAN DER MEER"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Amsterdam Postbus, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1111/cico.12241"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00304.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00369.x"", ""10.1093/esr/jcr031"", ""10.1111/soru.12119"", ""10.1002/9781118619179"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2018.04.003"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.48"", ""10.3386/w21812"", ""10.1093/restud/rdy047"", ""10.1002/psp.514"", ""10.1177/0010414003251176"", ""10.1177/1532673X13482573"", ""10.1093/esr/jcz018"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.05.002"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00715.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00407"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1093/esr/jcv081"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00528"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2942173"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01092.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000898"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1093/esr/jcn028"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsx024"", ""10.1017/S1755773917000145"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.006"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12356"", ""10.1080/01419870.2011.623786"", ""10.1177/0002716217712696"", ""10.1080/17457280902799014"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1334138"", ""10.1111/jcms.12341"", ""10.1080/14782804.2016.1198691"", ""10.1093/soceco/1.2.215"", ""10.1007/s11205-016-1264-y"", ""10.1093/esr/jcm047"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0245644"", ""10.1080/07036330903145930"", ""10.1177/0010414004273928"", ""10.1177/1078087412473067"", ""10.1177/0042098013505889"", ""10.1057/9781137033314"", ""10.1080/14649365.2012.704643"", ""10.23943/9781400889501""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12337,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Is civic nationalism necessarily inclusive? Conceptions of nationhood and anti-Muslim attitudes in Europe,"AbstractDespite the centrality of national identity in the exclusionary discourse of the European radical right, scholars have not investigated how popular definitions of nationhood are connected to dispositions toward Muslims. Moreover, survey‐based studies tend to conflate anti‐Muslim attitudes with general anti‐immigrant sentiments. This article contributes to research on nationalism and out‐group attitudes by demonstrating that varieties of national self‐understanding are predictive of anti‐Muslim attitudes, above and beyond dispositions toward immigrants. Using latent class analysis and regression models of survey data from 41 European countries, it demonstrates that conceptions of nationhood are heterogeneous within countries and that their relationship with anti‐Muslim attitudes is contextually variable. Consistent with expectations, in most countries, anti‐Muslim attitudes are positively associated with ascriptive – and negatively associated with elective (including civic) – conceptions of nationhood. Northwestern Europe, however, is an exception to this pattern: in this region, civic nationalism is linked to greater antipathy toward Muslims. It is suggested that in this region, elective criteria of belonging have become fused with exclusionary notions of national culture that portray Muslims as incompatible with European liberal values, effectively legitimating anti‐Muslim sentiments in mainstream political culture. This may heighten the appeal of anti‐Muslim sentiments not only on the radical right, but also among mainstream segments of the Northwestern European public, with important implications for social exclusion and political behaviour.","[{""name"": ""KRISTINA BAKKÆR SIMONSEN"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Aarhus University  Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""BART BONIKOWSKI"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology Harvard University  USA""]}]","[""10.1080/13569310500244354"", ""10.1177/000312240807300103"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57098-7_8"", ""10.1177/0003122416663683"", ""10.1177/0958928716664292"", ""10.4159/9780674028944"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1177/1468796812470893"", ""10.2307/448703"", ""10.1111/1468-5906.t01-1-00176"", ""10.1111/nana.12128"", ""10.1080/01419870903019544"", ""10.4135/9781412984850"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2012.00550.x"", ""10.1093/esr/jct038"", ""10.1177/0010414015612388"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000054"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090756"", ""10.1177/000312240907400404"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141107"", ""10.1177/2378023116632538"", ""10.1111/1477-7053.00022"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.345"", ""10.1080/01419870.2011.598233"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1177/019027250907200104"", ""10.1080/0140238042000228103"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2016.1138854"", ""10.1057/palgrave.fp.8200018"", ""10.1177/1468796812449707"", ""10.1111/pops.12383"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2016.01.003"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2015.1082288"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2007.02.004"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2013.831542"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53410-1_1"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2014.931219"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edq002"", ""10.1080/14649360120047788"", ""10.1177/0010414010396461"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.800796""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/padm.12883,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Integrating citizen deliberation into climate governance: Lessons on robust design from six climate assemblies,"AbstractRecent years have seen a “wave” of national climate assemblies, which bring together randomly‐selected citizens to deliberate and make recommendations on aspects of the climate crisis. Assessments of the legitimacy of these interventions and their capacity to improve climate governance have focused on their internal design characteristics, but the fundamental question of how they are integrated into complex constellations of political and policy institutions is underexplored. This article constructs a framework for understanding their integrative design characteristics, drawing on recent work on “robust governance.” The framework is used to explore the connection of six national‐level climate assemblies with political institutions, public debate, and civil society. Our findings highlight significant variety in the integrative design of these climate assemblies. This variety challenges the view of assemblies as a standardized object with predictable effects on legitimacy and governance capacity, while also refining deliberative systems theory's highly abstracted conceptions of integration and impact.","[{""name"": ""John Boswell"", ""affiliation"": [""Politics and International Relations University of Southampton, Highfield Campus S017 1BJ  Southampton UK""]}, {""name"": ""Rikki Dean"", ""affiliation"": [""Democratic Innovations Research Unit Goethe University Frankfurt  Frankfurt am Main Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Graham Smith"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for the Study of Democracy University of Westminster  London UK""]}]","[""10.1080/10841806.1999.11643381"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12303"", ""10.1017/S1537592716001146"", ""10.1017/9781108561563"", ""10.1080/19460171.2022.2053179"", ""10.1007/s11077-015-9238-5"", ""10.1332/030557316X14531466517034"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i1.1221"", ""10.3167/dt.2019.060205"", ""10.1177/0032321719866002"", ""10.1126/science.aaw2694"", ""10.1007/s11077-009-9086-2"", ""10.3390/su132011272"", ""10.1080/19460171.2021.1993290"", ""10.1017/S1755773915000119"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00181"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-19945-6_4"", ""10.1177/0032329206288152"", ""10.1017/S1755773909990245"", ""10.1057/9780230347564"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12123"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198843054.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14494035.2018.1504488"", ""10.1080/00344893.2020.1778513"", ""10.3138/9781442693500"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199987269.001.0001"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3049294"", ""10.1787/339306da-en"", ""10.1111/jopp.12054"", ""10.1093/019929111X.001.0001"", ""10.4337/9781786431356"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198867227.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12207"", ""10.1177/0032321721999974"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1743526"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i3.4382"", ""10.1111/padm.12868""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

To date, this debate has largely ignored participants’ views. Using data from 120 in-depth interviews with providers in two for-profit and three not-for-profit sites, we find that most see the sharing economy differently, as an opportunity to build a radically different market, from the bottom up. Like the detractors, they are critical of dominant market arrangements, however, they believe the sharing sector can construct personalized exchanges that are morally attuned, based on ideals of community, and that help them achieve creative and financial autonomy in their working lives. These aspirations represent an attempt to tame, or domesticate the neoliberal market.","[{""name"": ""Connor J Fitzmaurice"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Isak Ladegaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""William Attwood-Charles"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Mehmet Cansoy"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Lindsey B Carfagna"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Juliet B Schor"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Robert Wengronowitz"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA, USA""]}]","[""10.1177/048661347200400203"", ""10.1080/09502380802245902"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.10.001"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674416345"", ""10.1111/1467-8330.00245"", ""10.2307/j.ctt17kk9p8"", ""10.1386/cij.5.1-2.55_1"", ""10.1177/0003122413512316"", ""10.1068/a36263"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2009.00721.x"", ""10.1023/A:1023943503531"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131642"", ""10.1080/03906700802087910"", ""10.1093/ser/mwl034"", ""10.1177/0309132508090821"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2006.09.002"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226322384.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11186-007-9058-5"", ""10.4324/9781315794600"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2009.00685.x"", ""10.1177/000312240907400101"", ""10.1080/03085140120042271"", ""10.1086/225585"", ""10.1086/374404"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.11.027"", ""10.1093/ser/mwn016"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262017480.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822387879"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsw043"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.11.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511488856"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2015.11.001"", ""10.1215/9780822384786"", ""10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01173.x"", ""10.1177/0002716212454831""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

What are the effects of vote-by-mail? In this paper, we provide a comprehensive design-based analysis of the effect of universal vote-by-mail—a policy under which every voter is mailed a ballot in advance of the election—on electoral outcomes. We collect data from 1996 to 2018 on all three US states that implemented universal vote-by-mail in a staggered fashion across counties, allowing us to use a difference-in-differences design at the county level to estimate causal effects. We find that 1) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to affect either party’s share of turnout, 2) universal vote-by-mail does not appear to increase either party’s vote share, and 3) universal vote-by-mail modestly increases overall average turnout rates, in line with previous estimates. All three conclusions support the conventional wisdom of election administration experts and contradict many popular claims in the media.","[{""name"": ""Daniel M.

10.1093/ia/iiz242,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,"Understanding the dynamics of the Indo-Pacific: US-China strategic competition, regional actors, and beyond","Abstract As a geographical concept, ‘Indo-Pacific’ has existed for decades. As a political and strategic concept, it has since 2010 gradually become established in the foreign policy lexicon of some countries, especially Australia, India, Japan and the United States. However, China seems to be reluctant to identify itself as part of the Indo-Pacific; Chinese leaders believe that the US-led Indo-Pacific strategy aims to contain China's rise. While the battle between the two geographical concepts ‘Indo-Pacific’ and ‘Asia–Pacific’ may be fairly easily settled in the future, US–China strategic competition has just begun. Will the Indo-Pacific become a battlefield for US–China rivalry? How will China cope with the US ‘free and open Indo-Pacific’ (FOIP) strategy? How will other regional actors respond to the US–China strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific? What are the strategic implications of the ‘Indo-Pacific’ concept for regional order transformation? How will the Indo-Pacific be institutionalized, economically, politically and strategically? This article introduces the January 2020 special issue of International Affairs, which aims to address those questions, using both country-specific and regional perspectives. Seven articles focus on the policy responses of major players (Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan and ASEAN) to the US FOIP strategy and related US–China rivalry in the region. A further three articles examine the profound implications of Indo-Pacific dynamics for regional institution-building and for geopolitical and geo-economic architecture.","[{""name"": ""Kai He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mingjiang Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)]]"

This article surveys new research that explores how biographical factors influence their behavior. We call this literature the personal biography approach to political leadership. Our survey first lays out four mechanisms through which biographical characteristics might affect leader behavior. We then discuss the main findings, grouping them according to socializing experiences (e.g., education, military service, and prior occupation) and ascriptive traits (e.g., gender, race, and ethnicity). We also consider the methodological problems, especially endogeneity and selection effects, that pose challenges to this style of research. We conclude with an assessment of gaps in the literature and provide suggestions for future work in the biographical vein.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Krcmaric"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA;, ,""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen C.

Contemporary narratives about American politics argue that people embrace elite expressions of negative partisanship, above and beyond representation on policy. Using three conjoint experiments, I examine how individuals weigh the relative value of substantive representation on issues, constituency service, and partisan affect. The findings challenge the notion that Americans are primarily motivated by their affective, partisan identities and demonstrate the value of policy congruence and service responsiveness in terms of perceptions of political representation. The implication is that people evaluate elected officials in ways that we would expect them to in a healthy, functioning representative democracy, rather than one characterized by partisan animus. Even if polarization is driven by “affect, not ideology,” citizens prioritize representational styles centered around the issues that matter to them.","[{""name"": ""Mia Costa"", ""affiliation"": [""Dartmouth College""]}]","[""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.11.001"", ""10.2307/1955282"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09557-6"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00448.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080210"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000795"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000011"", ""10.2307/2657900"", ""10.1561/100.00011019"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000551"", ""10.1177/1532673X14552127"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000553"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9393-9"", ""10.1111/lsq.12074"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00012"", ""10.1080/10584609.2018.1426663"", ""10.1177/1065912910373552"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139207782"", ""10.1111/ajps.12164"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190626594.001.0001"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00517.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316442920"", ""10.1086/682398"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000604"", ""10.1111/pops.12487"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00387.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226452593.001.0001"", ""10.3998/mpub.7354"", ""10.1509/jmkr.37.4.427.18796"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316471050"", ""10.1177/1065912916652240"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199772759.001.0001"", ""10.1515/for-2018-0005"", ""10.1086/688223"", ""10.2307/2647821"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy005"", ""10.1111/pops.12485"", ""10.1515/9781400865871"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051452"", ""10.3162/036298009789869709"", ""10.1073/pnas.1806781116"", ""10.1525/9780520340503"", ""10.2307/2131242"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-100711-135242"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0602_01"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000156"", ""10.2307/2082973"", ""10.1146/annurev.ps.33.020182.000245"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.03.004"", ""10.1016/0030-5073(78)90052-1"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2008.08.001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000089,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Explaining Population Displacement Strategies in Civil Wars: A Cross-National Analysis,"AbstractWhy do combatants uproot civilians in wartime? In this paper I identify cross-national variation in three population-displacement strategies—cleansing, depopulation, and forced relocation—and test different explanations for their use by state actors. I advance a new “assortative” theory to explain forced relocation, the most common type. I argue that combatants displace not only to expel undesirable populations, but also to identify the undesirables in the first place by forcing people to send signals of loyalty and affiliation based on whether, and to where, they flee. This makes communities more “legible” and facilitates the extraction of rents and recruits. I test these arguments using a novel Strategic Displacement in Civil Conflict data set (1945–2008). Consistent with my expectations, different displacement strategies occur in different contexts and appear to follow different logics. Cleansing is more likely in conventional wars, where territorial conquest takes primacy, while forced relocation is more likely in irregular wars, where identification problems are most acute. The evidence indicates that cleansing follows a logic of punishment. The results for relocation, however, are consistent with the implications of my assortative logic: it is more likely to be employed by resource-constrained incumbents fighting insurgencies in “illegible” areas—rural, peripheral territories. A case study from Uganda based on in-depth fieldwork provides evidence for the assortative mechanism. As the most comprehensive analysis of wartime displacement strategies to date, this paper challenges some core assumptions about a devastating form of contemporary political violence.","[{""name"": ""Adam G.

The reason to doubt such a comparison is that the linear specification appears to keep all observations, whereas the logit drops the groups where the dependent variable is either all zeros or all ones. This letter demonstrates that a linear specification averages the estimates for all the homogeneous outcome groups (which, by definition, all have slope coefficients of zero) with the slope coefficients for the groups with a mix of zeros and ones. The correct comparison of the linear to logit form is to only look at groups with some variation in the dependent variable. Researchers using the linear specification are urged to report results for all groups and for the subset of groups where the dependent variable varies. The interpretation of the difference between these two results depends upon assumptions which cannot be empirically assessed.","[{""name"": ""Nathaniel Beck"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a004876"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.20"", ""10.1111/j.1368-423X.2004.00123.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000252"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi019"", ""10.2307/2297110"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000281""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"
10.1017/S0007123421000363,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Cultural Backlash? How (Not) to Explain the Rise of Authoritarian Populism,"AbstractThis book review examines the theory of populism advanced by Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart in Cultural Backlash. The authors offer a distinct explanation of the rise of authoritarian populism in advanced democracies. As societies become more liberal over time, older, more conservative cohorts feel under threat of losing majority status and allegedly turn towards authoritarian-populist parties that promise to stop the tide of liberalism. However, this theory of populism finds little empirical support. In contrast to what the authors argue, there is no polarization of attitudes between younger and older cohorts, and younger cohorts are more likely to vote for authoritarian-populist parties. To substantiate this claim, I replicate many of the analyses in Cultural Backlash and add additional ones with the newest wave of the European Social Survey and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. I conclude by observing that while the cultural backlash theory of populism does not hold, this does not invalidate cultural approaches more generally.","[{""name"": ""Armin Schäfer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1982.tb00559.x"", ""10.1177/0010414011427851"", ""10.9783/9780812293784"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1080/13569317.2015.1075264"", ""10.1177/0032321719842768"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00303.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139152365"", ""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1017/S0007123421000363"", ""10.1177/0192512107088390"", ""10.1111/1477-7053.00022"", ""10.2307/422034"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139152365"", ""10.1177/0010414003251176"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiy017"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.02.001"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-25341-8_8"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1177/0192512112455443""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S000305542000012X,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Corruption Information and Vote Share: A Meta-Analysis and Lessons for Experimental Design,"Debate persists on whether voters hold politicians accountable for corruption. Numerous experiments have examined whether informing voters about corrupt acts of politicians decreases their vote share. Meta-analysis demonstrates that corrupt candidates are punished by zero percentage points across field experiments, but approximately 32 points in survey experiments. I argue this discrepancy arises due to methodological differences. Small effects in field experiments may stem partially from weak treatments and noncompliance, and large effects in survey experiments are likely from social desirability bias and the lower and hypothetical nature of costs. Conjoint experiments introduce hypothetical costly trade-offs, but it may be best to interpret results in terms of realistic sets of characteristics rather than marginal effects of particular characteristics. These results suggest that survey experiments may provide point estimates that are not representative of real-world voting behavior. However, field experimental estimates may also not recover the “true” effects due to design decisions and limitations.","[{""name"": ""TREVOR INCERTI"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139962933"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2008.07.002"", ""10.3102/1076998609346961"", ""10.1177/1065912915591607"", ""10.1037/a0033242"", ""10.1177/0010414019852697"", ""10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-30"", ""10.1037/xge0000104"", ""10.1086/704222"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107324909"", ""10.1007/s11127-006-9101-5"", ""10.1177/2053168019832230"", ""10.1177/1065912916634897"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.05.007"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000091"", ""10.1177/2053168016645136"", ""10.1007/s11127-017-0452-x"", ""10.1177/0010414018797951"", ""10.5129/001041513X13815259182857"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1095"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-092012-134421"", ""10.1017/S0043887110000031"", ""10.1177/1866802X19840457"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.10"", ""10.1002/sim.2889"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.24"", ""10.1136/bmj.323.7304.101"", ""10.1177/0010414013489081"", ""10.3386/w24888"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edz027"", ""10.1080/10584609.2014.914615"", ""10.1073/pnas.1722306115"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1977749"", ""10.1177/2515245919847196"", ""10.1086/678766"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052715-111917"", ""10.1086/694649"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.2.703"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000363"", ""10.1007/s10611-013-9478-2"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.30"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00675.x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2271654"", ""10.1017/S0003055400265179"", ""10.1017/9781108381390"", ""10.1177/1745691614553988"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1211"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000217"", ""10.1002/sim.1461"", ""10.1177/1745691616650874"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0215052"", ""10.1177/0032321719868210"", ""10.1086/687287"", ""10.1177/1866802X1500700102"", ""10.1111/ajps.12413"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.50"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/pops.12803,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Abortion Attitudes: An Overview of Demographic and Ideological Differences,"Despite being a defining issue in the culture war, the political psychology of abortion attitudes remains poorly understood. We address this oversight by reviewing existing literature and integrating new analyses of several large‐scale, cross‐sectional, and longitudinal datasets to identify the demographic and ideological correlates of abortion attitudes. Our review and new analyses indicate that abortion support is increasing modestly over time in both the United States and New Zealand. We also find that a plurality of respondents (43.8%) in the United States are consistently “pro‐choice,” whereas 14.8% are consistently “pro‐life,” across various elective and traumatic abortion scenarios. We then show that age, religiosity, and conservatism correlate negatively, whereas Openness to Experience correlates positively, with abortion support. New analyses of heterosexual couples further reveal that women's and men's religiosity decrease their romantic partner's abortion support. Noting inconsistent gender differences in attitudes toward abortion, we then discuss the impact of traditional gender‐role attitudes and sexism on abortion attitudes and conclude that, rather than misogyny, benevolent sexism—the belief that women should be cherished and protected—best explains opposition to abortion. Our review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the demographic and ideological variables that underly abortion attitudes and, hence, the broader culture war.","[{""name"": ""Danny Osborne"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Auckland""]}, {""name"": ""Yanshu Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Queensland""]}, {""name"": ""Nickola C.

10.17645/pag.v8i3.2925,POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE,0302 Political Science,Who Uses Right-Wing Alternative Online Media? An Exploration of Audience Characteristics,"Accompanying the success of the radical right and right-wing populist movements, right-wing alternative online media have recently gained prominence and, to some extent, influence on public discourse and elections. The existing scholarship so far focuses primarily on the role of content and social media distribution and pays little attention to the audiences of right-wing alternative media, especially at a cross-national level and in the European context. The present paper addresses this gap by exploring the characteristics of the audiences of right-wing alternative online media. Based on a secondary data analysis of the 2019 Reuters Digital News Survey, this article presents a cross-national analysis of right-wing alternative media use in Northern and Central Europe. The results indicate a comparatively high prevalence of right-wing alternative online media in Sweden, whereas in Germany, Austria, and Finland, these news websites seem to be far less popular. With regard to audience characteristics, the strongest predictors of right-wing alternative online media use are political interest and a critical stance towards immigration, accompanied by a skeptical assessment of news quality, in general, and distrust, especially in public service broadcasting media. Additionally, the use of social media as a primary news source increases the likelihood of right-wing alternative news consumption. This corroborates the high relevance of social media platforms as distributors and multipliers of right-wing alternative news content. The findings suggest that right-wing alternative online media should not be underestimated as a peripheral phenomenon, but rather have to be considered influential factors for center-right to radical right-leaning politics and audiences in public discourse, with a high mobilizing and polarizing potential.","[{""name"": ""Heidi Schulze"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10510974.2011.649442"", ""10.1177/1461444806065653"", ""10.5771/2192-4007-2018-2-128"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jcom.12127"", ""10.1177/01634437030255004"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328525"", ""10.2478/nor-2020-0001"", ""10.1177/1940161218811981"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2018.1500868"", ""10.1080/17512786.2019.1647112"", ""10.1080/21670811.2017.1279979"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01452.x"", ""10.20378/irbo-54716"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790867"", ""10.1386/joacm_00009_1"", ""10.1037/a0015701"", ""10.1002/poi3.219"", ""10.17645/mac.v6i4.1467"", ""10.4324/9780429454691"", ""10.7146/politik.v20i4.101534"", ""10.1080/21670811.2019.1625715"", ""10.1177/1077699019831439"", ""10.1177/0267323191006001003"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1646778"", ""10.1386/joacm_00041_1"", ""10.1080/17512786.2019.1577697"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2020.1722731"", ""10.1177/0163443707084345"", ""10.1111/cccr.12068"", ""10.5771/1615-634X-2018-3-283"", ""10.1080/03637751.2018.1508876"", ""10.1609/icwsm.v11i1.14878"", ""10.1177/1940161220907018"", ""10.1177/0093650203253371"", ""10.1207/s15327825mcs0902_3"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3144139"", ""10.1386/joacm_00042_1"", ""10.1080/23254823.2017.1414620""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communication']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

To answer these questions, this paper examines an important case of upward regulatory harmonization, the European Union's non‐financial disclosure Directive 2014/95/EU, which requires large firms to report on their social, environmental, and human rights impacts. In spite of favorable circumstances, the Directive's opponents watered down the Commission's proposal during the course of the negotiations. Upward regulatory harmonization is difficult because of the adjustment costs it imposes on the private sector. The paper provides an in‐depth analysis of countries’ positions in the negotiations: Germany was the most hardline opponent, France the strongest supporter, and the United Kingdom was somewhere in‐between. For most countries, private sector adjustment costs determine government support and opposition for upward harmonization at the supranational level, but the analysis shows that partisan politics and varieties of capitalism also matter.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Kinderman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science and International Relations University of Delaware  Newark DE USA""]}]","[""10.1111/gove.12104"", ""10.1093/jwelb/jwt021"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00351"", ""10.1046/j.0023-9216.2003.03703001.x"", ""10.1111/rego.12017"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1730-2"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2486.001.0001"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.9781783532605_10"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.12.003"", ""10.1093/0199247757.003.0006"", ""10.1177/0010414009331725"", ""10.2202/1469-3569.1351"", ""10.1080/03085147.2011.607364"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.5840/beq200717348"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-04723-2_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54005-9_3"", ""10.1111/jcms.12021"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2016.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.asieco.2006.01.007"", ""10.1177/0924051918786623"", ""10.1080/0969160X.2016.1149302"", ""10.1111/rego.12248"", ""10.54648/EUCL2017003"", ""10.1163/19426720-02001002"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr038"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2281-x"", ""10.1515/ecfr-2015-0307"", ""10.1515/9781400842568"", ""10.1111/jacf.12031"", ""10.1057/s41267-016-0001-8""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']",['Strategy and Management'],"[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

The digital environment and the availability of massive data from customers generate asymmetric information for banks to the detriment of customers, who experience individual vulnerabilities such as privacy rights. This can hinder the positive influence of digitalization in banks’ performance, with relevant managerial and political implications. In this context, the reputation generated by CS strategies can constitute a credence factor that reduces customers’ fears of opportunistic behavior and information asymmetries. We test and find support for our hypothesis over a panel data of large international banks from developed countries. Our findings shed light on the mutual reinforcement of CS and digitalization strategies in enhancing banks’ market performance and efficiency.","[{""name"": ""Francisco Javier Forcadell"", ""affiliation"": [""ESIC Business &amp; Marketing School"", ""Rey Juan Carlos University""]}, {""name"": ""Elisa Aracil"", ""affiliation"": [""ICADE Business School, Comillas Pontifical University""]}, {""name"": ""Fernando Úbeda"", ""affiliation"": [""Autonomous University of Madrid""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2011.10.020"", ""10.1108/EJMBE-10-2017-019"", ""10.1016/j.jfs.2008.10.002"", ""10.1016/S0378-4266(97)00032-0"", ""10.1016/S0378-4266(99)00129-6"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2010.02.015"", ""10.5465/annals.2015.0095"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(03)00030-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107590205.004"", ""10.2307/2672925"", ""10.3386/w15180"", ""10.3386/w24551"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-3632"", ""10.1016/S1574-0048(99)10034-X"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0613-z"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2006.12.004"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878"", ""10.1111/j.1755-053X.2006.tb00149.x"", ""10.3390/su10124428"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00199.x"", ""10.3368/jhr.50.2.317"", ""10.2469/faj.v49.n1.27"", ""10.2307/257246"", ""10.1002/smj.2131"", ""10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2012.10.005"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-3003-8"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2008.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2006.10.003"", ""10.2307/2297430"", ""10.1007/s11846-016-0195-y"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7<535::AID-SMJ885>3.0.CO;2-Z"", ""10.1086/209638"", ""10.1080/01972243.2016.1248611"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.12.017"", ""10.1002/csr.1402"", ""10.1111/beer.12161"", ""10.3390/su11113210"", ""10.1287/orsc.1100.0584"", ""10.1257/.42.1.116"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiaa003"", ""10.1086/209662"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0143-8"", ""10.5465/amj.2014.4002"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12562"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.008"", ""10.1108/14635770410538772"", ""10.1111/jbfa.12183"", ""10.1007/s11123-014-0402-2"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12133"", ""10.3390/su10093113"", ""10.1111/fima.12044"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12656"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2011.01.017"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2575.2007.00269.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-01630-1_1"", ""10.1108/02652321011064917"", ""10.2307/2326770"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-3404"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.04.018"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2006.11.022"", ""10.1108/02635571011030006"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2010.01.006"", ""10.1057/fsm.2010.10"", ""10.1108/IJBM-12-2013-0146"", ""10.1787/9789264276284-en"", ""10.2307/256974"", ""10.1177/0170840603024003910"", ""10.1016/j.bir.2017.12.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9729-9"", ""10.4324/9780203069769"", ""10.1016/j.brq.2014.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2004.12.007"", ""10.1002/jid.1698"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9841-x"", ""10.3390/su9040554"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199808)19:8<729::AID-SMJ967>3.0.CO;2-4"", ""10.1177/001872679705001102"", ""10.1023/A:1013082525900"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2404-4"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2011.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2017.01.015"", ""10.2307/257057"", ""10.2307/41165203"", ""10.1177/0007650317718185"", ""10.1080/14783360500163326""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1111/spsr.12462,SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,The Emotional Foundations of Political Support: How Fear and Anger Affect Trust in the Government in Times of the Covid-19 Pandemic,"AbstractCrises like the current coronavirus pandemic evoke negative emotions in the general public. To date, however, little research has been conducted on the influence of these mental states on trust in the government – the uncontested key player in times of crises. Drawing on the appraisal and affective intelligence theories of emotions, we argue that fear and anger as the two crucial negative emotions in times of crises have divergent effects on trust in the government: Whereas fear leads to a rally‐‘round‐the‐flag effect increasing trust in the government, anger attributes blame for the adverse circumstances to the government. We present empirical evidence for our arguments with an original three‐wave online panel survey of 1’600 Swiss residents during the unprecedented times of the coronavirus pandemic. Our analysis provides empirical support for our arguments and further shows that the relationship is strongest for right‐wing respondents.","[{""name"": ""Julian Erhardt"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science University of Bern""]}, {""name"": ""Markus Freitag"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science University of Bern""]}, {""name"": ""Maximilian Filsinger"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science University of Bern""]}, {""name"": ""Steffen Wamsler"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science University of Bern""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139963107"", ""10.31235/osf.io/dkusw"", ""10.1038/nn1979"", ""10.1080/02699931.2010.550751"", ""10.1111/ajps.12334"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0823-z"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00561.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00533.x"", ""10.1177/1532673X10380848"", ""10.1111/1475‐6765.12401"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199760107.013.0006"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00294"", ""10.1521/soco.2017.35.4.354"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.126.6.890"", ""10.1038/npp.2009.109"", ""10.1111/1475‐6765.12419"", ""10.1162/rest_a_00946"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00503.x"", ""10.1177/0093650216644026"", ""10.2307/2586304"", ""10.1017/S0140525X13001192"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00144.x"", ""10.1080/02699930802110007"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339"", ""10.1177/0146167207301028"", ""10.1521/soco.2017.35.4.324"", ""10.1177/2053168015621328"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2005.00344.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00440.x"", ""10.1207/S15324796ABM2601_05"", ""10.1111/pops.12571"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00806.x"", ""10.2307/1955610"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00418.x"", ""10.1126/science.1157627"", ""10.1093/scan/nsx133"", ""10.1017/S002238160999079X"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1002/0470013494.ch30"", ""10.1111/1475‐6765.12425"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.48.4.813"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000939"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9076-7"", ""10.1111/pops.12439"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063"", ""10.1007/s11077-020-09381-4""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1080/03056244.2020.1722088,REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY,0302 Political Science; 0705 Geography,"Finance, infrastructure and urban capital: the political economy of African 'gap-filling'","ABSTRACT Financial flows into Africa are being reoriented through the pervasive discourse of the ‘infrastructure gap’. The article argues that the generation of new infrastructures identified as ‘alternative assets’ by global finance is also creating landscapes of opportunity for urban capital accumulation by more locally embedded actors. Thus, as international financial flows are becoming ‘infrastructuralised’, domestic capital is increasingly ‘real-estatised’. The conceptualisation of African urban economies in terms of deficits has obscured the extent to which they are also characterised by surfeits, including of certain kinds of property development and speculation, with important implications for the politics of urban accumulation, dispossession and violence.","[{""name"": ""Tom Goodfellow"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315668666"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.047"", ""10.1080/10220461.2013.811337"", ""10.1017/S0022278X00017122"", ""10.1093/afraf/adx019"", ""10.1080/00343404.2012.672726"", ""10.1080/03056244.2017.1372280"", ""10.1080/14036096.2017.1293379"", ""10.1111/tran.12105"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.12550"", ""10.1093/afraf/adx020"", ""10.1111/dech.12361"", ""10.1080/00420980020080651"", ""10.1002/9781118827611"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199264315.001.0001"", ""10.7228/manchester/9781784994266.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000083"", ""10.1177/0308518X18763370"", ""10.1093/afraf/adx044"", ""10.1007/s12116-013-9134-y"", ""10.1177/2043820618780789"", ""10.1215/08992363-16-3-347"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.12468"", ""10.1111/tran.12150"", ""10.1215/00382876-2831246"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198776987.001.0001"", ""10.15641/jarer.v1i1.491"", ""10.1016/j.joat.2015.08.003"", ""10.1177/0042098017751983"", ""10.3828/idpr.30.2.5"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.12062"", ""10.1108/JPIF-06-2015-0042"", ""10.14452/MR-051-03-1999-07_2"", ""10.1080/13604813.2018.1451021"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2015.11.015"", ""10.1080/02723638.2014.933605"", ""10.1215/08992363-16-3-407"", ""10.1177/0042098018810604"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-0149-5"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00756.x"", ""10.1177/0042098019826022"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316225509"", ""10.1080/00343404.2019.1566703"", ""10.1353/at.2003.0070""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

Using new data from voter registration records, we assess the extent to which this pattern can be explained by geographic mobility. We find that the revealed preferences of voters who move from one residence to another correlate with partisan affiliation, though voters appear to be sorting on non-political neighborhood attributes that covary with partisan preferences rather than explicitly seeking politically congruent neighbors. But, critically, we demonstrate through a simulation study that the estimated partisan bias in moving choices is on the order of five times too small to sustain the current geographic polarization of preferences. We conclude that location must have some influence on political preference, rather than the other way around, and provide evidence in support of this theory.","[{""name"": ""Gregory J.

Security Crises, Rivalries, and Polarization in American Foreign Policy","AbstractA common explanation for the increasing polarization in contemporary American foreign policy is the absence of external threat. I identify two mechanisms through which threats could reduce polarization: by revealing information about an adversary that elicits a bipartisan response from policymakers (information mechanism) and by heightening the salience of national relative to partisan identity (identity mechanism). To evaluate the information mechanism, study 1 uses computational text analysis of congressional speeches to explore whether security threats reduce partisanship in attitudes toward foreign adversaries. To evaluate the identity mechanism, study 2 uses public opinion polls to assess whether threats reduce affective polarization among the public. Study 3 tests both mechanisms in a survey experiment that heightens a security threat from China. I find that the external threat hypothesis has limited ability to explain either polarization in US foreign policy or affective polarization among the American public. Instead, responses to external threats reflect the domestic political environment in which they are introduced. The findings cast doubt on predictions that new foreign threats will inherently create partisan unity.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Myrick"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0022002704269354"", ""10.1177/002200277902300304"", ""10.2307/20048198"", ""10.1080/09636412.2019.1604983"", ""10.1017/S000712341700059X"", ""10.1162/002081898753162857"", ""10.1162/isec.2007.32.2.7"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2012.00913.x"", ""10.2307/2600916"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1017/S0022381607080061"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00660.x"", ""10.1515/9781400840830"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00003"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226473673.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1354-5078.1997.00165.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12237"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790652"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226470771.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022002707300842"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491283"", ""10.1017/S0022381608080493"", ""10.1080/0163660X.2017.1406705"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.2"", ""10.1111/ajps.12089"", ""10.1515/9780804779876"", ""10.2307/1956437"", ""10.1057/pol.2014.10"", ""10.1177/0022002710370135"", ""10.2307/3088434"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.39"", ""10.2307/20049883"", ""10.3386/w26946"", ""10.2307/1955610"", ""10.2307/2647642"", ""10.1086/693987"", ""10.1177/0022002719876349"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000285"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226043463.001.0001"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx022"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199389773.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818300028551"", ""10.1111/1468-2478.00232"", ""10.2307/3088387"", ""10.1515/9780691188270-013"", ""10.2307/1958273"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00237.x"", ""10.1017/S000305541000016X"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.111605.105008"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070038"", ""10.1017/S153759270808122X"", ""10.1515/9781400830091"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139963107"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1162/002081898753162839"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139878425"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000064"", ""10.1017/S002081830003201X"", ""10.1177/1532673X17719721"", ""10.1057/ip.2011.34"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00021"", ""10.1007/BF01002142"", ""10.1177/002200277602000106"", ""10.1017/S002238161100154X"", ""10.1007/BF01498516"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.062404.170715"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791123""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

The 2015 Paris Agreement acknowledged climate change as “an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet”. Without urgent global action, its impacts will be catastrophic. The climate crisis, caused by the current generation, will have massive impacts on coming generations. Reasons for particular concern about children and youth include their greater vulnerability to climate change impacts, the disproportionate risks faced by children in developing countries and the challenging adaptations to climate-induced changes that they face. Climate change is already causing increases in extreme weather events, dislocation and economic hardship. It results in direct and structural violence, from the direct violence of interpersonal aggression and regional conflicts to the structural violence manifest in the disproportionate impact of climate change on those who contributed the least to the problem. Moreover, those most impacted are primarily from low-income countries, thereby impeding achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. However, climate change solutions can help to build more peaceful and equitable societies. We outline global, regional and local initiatives and illustrate strategies for both mitigation and adaptation to climate change with projects involving child participation and decision-making. Drawing on the literature on problem- and meaning-focused coping and positive development, we explore how parents, schools, organisations, researchers and policy-makers can support children in developing the coping strategies, knowledge, skills and attitudes they need to adapt to a climate-changed world. We conclude that, although climate change is an urgent threat to global peace, solving it is also one of our best hopes for promoting peace and equity in human relations. As today’s adults, we must accept that the future survival of our children, communities and the natural world depends on the actions we take now.","[{""name"": ""Ann V.

10.1162/isec_a_00447,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,China's Party-State Capitalism and International Backlash: From Interdependence to Insecurity,"Abstract Contrary to expectations, economic interdependence has not tempered security conflict between China and the United States. In response to perceived domestic and external threats, the Chinese Communist Party's actions to ensure regime security have generated insecurity in other states, causing them to adopt measures to constrain Chinese firms. Security dilemma dynamics best explain the subsequent reactions from many advanced industrialized countries to the evolution of China's political economy into party-state capitalism. Party-state capitalism manifests in two signature ways: (1) expansion of party-state authority in firms through changes in corporate governance and state-led financial instruments; and (2) enforcement of political fealty among various economic actors. Together, these trends have blurred the distinction between state and private capital in China and resulted in backlash, including intensified investment reviews, campaigns to exclude Chinese firms from strategic sectors, and the creation of novel domestic and international institutions to address perceived threats from Chinese actors. The uniqueness of China's model has prompted significant reorganization of the rules governing capitalism, both nationally and globally.","[{""name"": ""Margaret M.

Yet, studies of politically motivated reasoning typically only consider what partisans generally might want to believe and do not separately examine the different types of motives that likely underlie these wants. The present research explores the roles of distinct types of motives in politically motivated thinking and identifies the conditions under which motivated reasoners are persuaded by political messages. Results of an experiment with a large, representative sample of Republicans show that manipulations inducing motivations for either (1) forming accurate impressions, (2) affirming moral values, or (3) affirming group identity each increased beliefs in and intentions to combat human‐induced climate change, but only when also paired with political messages that are congruent with the induced motivation. We also find no evidence of a backlash effect even when individuals are provided with clearly uncongenial information and a motivation to reject it. Overall, our findings make clear that understanding when and why motivated political reasoning occurs requires a more complete understanding of both which motivations might be active among a group of partisans and how these motivations resonate with the messaging they receive.","[{""name"": ""Robin Bayes"", ""affiliation"": [""Northwestern University""]}, {""name"": ""James N.

The Content and Effects of Populist Conspiracy Theories,"Abstract Despite the alleged discursive affinity between populist rhetoric and conspiracy theories, we know too little about how populist conspiracies are communicated by politicians, and how these messages activate individual-level support for populist ideas. In this setting, this article reports on a qualitative content analysis of leading (radical) right-wing populist politicians’ self-communication (Trump and Wilders) and an experiment in which the central content features of populist conspiracies are manipulated. The main findings indicate that populist conspiracy theories activate populist attitudes more than mere exposure to populist ideas. Together, this article shows how conspiracies are framed in populist actors’ communication, and how these populist conspiracy frames can fuel support for populist ideology in society.","[{""name"": ""Michael Hameleers"", ""affiliation"": [""Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1057/9780230592100"", ""10.1525/california/9780520238053.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0267323118760317"", ""10.1057/ap.2012.27"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1329333"", ""10.1177/0093650216644026"", ""10.1177/1940161218786786"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.1111/comt.12029"", ""10.1177/0093650215577859"", ""10.1057/9780230592100_4"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1111/jcom.12337"", ""10.1111/ajps.12084"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1316807"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edw037"", ""10.1111/spsr.12270"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1102187"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.49.3.577"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328521""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12502,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,The partisan nature of support for democratic backsliding: A comparative perspective,"AbstractThis article asks whether the willingness of partisans to condone democratic backsliding is a uniquely American phenomenon and explores why partisans would tolerate a party leader subverting democratic norms. We focus on executive aggrandizement as a key mechanism through which democratic backsliding occurs and develop three potential explanations for why partisans would accept the weakening of checks on the power of the executive. First, in a context of affective polarization, partisans may condone executive aggrandizement in order to advantage their party and disadvantage the opponent. Second, partisans may be willing to trade off democratic norms in pursuit of their ideological agenda. Third, partisans may take cues from the behaviour of party elites. These explanations are tested using a candidate‐choice conjoint experiment administered to Americans and Canadians in 2019 that involved respondents choosing between hypothetical candidates in intra‐party contests. Regardless of party, partisans in both countries proved willing to choose candidates who would loosen legislative and judicial restraints on the executive. While the partisan advantage explanation only held for strong Republicans in the United States, partisans in Canada and the United States alike were apparently willing to weaken restraints on the executive for the sake of their ideological agendas, at least in the case of abortion. Finally, Republicans who approved of the Trump presidency were much less likely than other Republicans to punish undemocratic candidates, lending support to the cue‐taking explanation.","[{""name"": ""ELISABETH GIDENGIL"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, McGill University Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship  Canada""]}, {""name"": ""DIETLIND STOLLE"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, McGill University Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship  Canada""]}, {""name"": ""OLIVIER BERGERON‐BOUTIN"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, McGill University Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship  Canada""]}]","[""10.1017/pan.2017.40"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000795"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvz026"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1017/S1537592719000896"", ""10.1111/ajps.12349"", ""10.1080/01402382.2021.1930733"", ""10.1177/0010414012453452"", ""10.1080/17457289.2020.1790577"", ""10.1177/0002764212463353"", ""10.1177/1354068804039118"", ""10.2307/j.ctvnjbgwt"", ""10.1017/S1049096516001682"", ""10.1007/s11109-014-9286-0"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000052"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1086/687533"", ""10.1017/S000305542000012X"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003377"", ""10.1017/S0008423917000713"", ""10.1093/icon/moz018"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1411383"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.30"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226473673.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003286"", ""10.1111/ajps.12089"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i1.1216"", ""10.1111/ajps.12330"", ""10.1177/0002716218818782"", ""10.1177/0969776412460535"", ""10.1111/ajps.12091"", ""10.1177/0002716216662433"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2933655"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9323-7"", ""10.1080/17457289.2020.1844218"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1017/S0043887120000167,WORLD POLITICS,0302 Political Science,The Popularity of Authoritarian Leaders A Cross-National Investigation,"ABSTRACTHow do citizens in authoritarian states feel about their leaders? While some dictators rule through terror, others seem genuinely popular. Using the Gallup World Poll’s panel of more than one hundred-forty countries in 2006–2016, the authors show that the drivers of political approval differ across regime types. Although brutal repression in overt dictatorships could cause respondents to falsify their preferences, in milder informational autocracies, greater repression actually predicts lower approval. In autocracies as in democracies, economic performance matters and citizens’ economic perceptions, while not perfectly accurate, track objective indicators. Dictators also benefit from greater perceived public safety, but the authors find no such effect in democracies. Covert censorship of the media and the Internet is associated with higher approval in autocracies—in particular, in informational ones—but ratings fall when citizens recognize censorship. In informational autocracies, executive elections trigger a ratings surge if there is leader turnover, but, unlike in democracies, reelected autocrats enjoy little honeymoon.","[{""name"": ""Sergei Guriev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Treisman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/0020-8833.00168"", ""10.1002/9780470609927.ch31"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176040"", ""10.1525/9780520354265"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(99)00052-9"", ""10.1086/703208"", ""10.1177/1536867X0900900106"", ""10.1177/0010414011428595"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139172493"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.t01-1-00006"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2015.10.002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510274"", ""10.1093/poq/nfm033"", ""10.2307/2010422"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.00216"", ""10.1073/pnas.1617711114"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr040"", ""10.1002/9780470316696"", ""10.1257/jep.33.4.100"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.06.004"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060106.095434"", ""10.1257/aer.101.7.3253"", ""10.1257/jep.22.2.53"", ""10.1177/0010414005276313"", ""10.1017/S0007123403000127"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139343824"", ""10.1017/S0007123400007134"", ""10.1177/0010414096029005004"", ""10.1515/9780804779876"", ""10.1016/j.geb.2016.12.006"", ""10.1257/aer.101.3.281"", ""10.5129/001041512798838021"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000014"", ""10.1017/S0023879100038607"", ""10.1515/9781685857479"", ""10.1017/S0043887120000167"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(98)00009-8"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00447.x"", ""10.1093/pan/mpp017"", ""10.2307/2111150"", ""10.1111/ajps.12065"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00503.x"", ""10.1177/0022343314531004"", ""10.5129/001041518822704890"", ""10.1017/9781316336182"", ""10.1177/0022002706293671"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0025"", ""10.1353/jod.0.0190"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv030"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976469"", ""10.18637/jss.v045.i07"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2016.1144334"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000738"", ""10.1177/0010414096029005003"", ""10.1016/0022-1031(73)90072-3"", ""10.1017/S1537592714003120"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000274"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.t01-1-00016"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(94)01642-D""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0007123419000255,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,The Political Legacy of Violence During China's Cultural Revolution,"Autocrats use repression to deter opposition. Are they successful in the long run? The author argues that state repression can have long-lastingalienating effectson citizens’ political attitudes andcoercive effectson their political behavior. The article evaluates this proposition by studying the long-term effects of state terror during China's Cultural Revolution. It shows that individuals who grew up in localities that were exposed to more state-sponsored violence in the late 1960s are less trusting of national political leaders and more critical of the country's political system today. These anti-regime attitudes are more likely to be passed down to the younger generation if family members discuss politics frequently than if they do not. Yet while state repression has created anti-regime attitudes, it has decreased citizens’ contentious behavior. These findings highlight the dilemma that authoritarian rulers face when they seek to consolidate their rule through repression.","[{""name"": ""Yuhua Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139176040"", ""10.4159/9780674040410"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aap8469"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000103"", ""10.1080/09546553.2012.700619"", ""10.1111/ajps.12067"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195165241.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521220293"", ""10.1177/0022343317751261"", ""10.1017/S0305741015000430"", ""10.1177/0022002718770520"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2014.01.009"", ""10.1515/9781400863419"", ""10.1093/oep/gpf064"", ""10.1086/231212"", ""10.1086/692964"", ""10.1177/0032329211424721"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000066"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511762574"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000161"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.3.905"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090212"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609336"", ""10.2307/2586304"", ""10.1561/100.00014115"", ""10.1017/S002081831500020X"", ""10.1257/aer.97.4.1507"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190205782.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv24w62r7.4"", ""10.1086/686631"", ""10.2307/422441"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.46"", ""10.1257/jep.30.3.249"", ""10.1017/S0003055400115709"", ""10.1017/S0305741015001629"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780192149978.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022002709336457"", ""10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.2-3.255"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510465"", ""10.1111/ajps.12327"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.101405.143216"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt005"", ""10.1080/0163660X.2016.1261563"", ""10.2307/2111650"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000626"", ""10.1017/XPS.2018.26"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1r4xd8m"", ""10.1086/683125"", ""10.1177/0010414086019001001"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000124"", ""10.1017/S1537592712002861"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000534"", ""10.1525/9780520310148"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738860"", ""10.1177/0097700403261824"", ""10.2307/2991732"", ""10.1177/0738894214544612"", ""10.1177/0010414010394773"", ""10.2307/4150140"", ""10.1257/aer.99.2.287"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316489031"", ""10.1257/aer.101.7.3221"", ""10.2307/2010422"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-064428"", ""10.1017/ssh.2015.23"", ""10.1177/0022002787031002003"", ""10.1006/jeth.2000.2678"", ""10.1080/10670564.2014.918403"", ""10.4159/9780674286689"", ""10.1017/S030574100001290X"", ""10.1177/0010414015626450"", ""10.1017/S0003055404041334"", ""10.1353/wp.2007.0015"", ""10.2307/2111747"", ""10.2307/2759573"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.07.012""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In this article, we investigate the NPF’s “travel” capacities across geographies, political systems, policy fields, levels of analysis, methodological approaches, and other theories of the policy process. We assess these capabilities by reviewing extant research and mapping newly explored territories. While we find that the NPF embodies all necessary conditions to travel to different settings, the empirical applications remain largely confined to the U.S. and European contexts, environmental policy, the meso level of analysis, the use of content analysis of documents as a methodological approach, and only a few combinations with other theories of the policy process. Our findings indicate that the NPF can travel well. However, we call for further research to conceptualize the NPF’s macro level, to replicate NPF scholarship beyond liberal democratic institutional contexts, and to affirm the framework’s capacity to be generalizable in varied settings.","[{""name"": ""Caroline Schlaufer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Johanna Kuenzler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael D.

However, little is known about whether experiences of psychological costs among benefit recipients can be relieved by reducing compliance demands in interactions with the state. Across three studies, we provide evidence that reducing demands causes relief. In a survey experiment, we show that psychological costs experienced by Danish unemployment insurance recipients change in response to information about actual reduced compliance demands. In two field studies, we exploit survey data collected around a sudden, exogenous shock (the COVID-19 lockdown of the Danish society in March 2020), which led to immediate reductions in compliance demands in Denmark’s active labor market policies. We test whether two groups of benefit recipients experienced reduced psychological costs in response to these sudden reductions in compliance demands imposed by the state. Across all studies, we find that the reduction of compliance demands is associated with an increased sense of autonomy, and in two of the three studies, it is associated with reduced stress. Overall, our findings suggest that psychological costs experienced by benefit recipients are indeed affected by state actions in the form of compliance demands.","[{""name"": ""Martin Baekgaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}, {""name"": ""Kim Sass Mikkelsen"", ""affiliation"": [""Roskilde University""]}, {""name"": ""Jonas Krogh Madsen"", ""affiliation"": [""Roskilde University""]}, {""name"": ""Julian Christensen"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}]","[""10.1186/s12889-015-2377-y"", ""10.1353/lar.2011.0014"", ""10.30636/jbpa.32.172"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000092"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy008"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497"", ""10.1257/aer.20121493"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12401"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup046"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8"", ""10.1177/0003122410363563"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02600.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202"", ""10.1111/puar.13134"", ""10.1006/jesp.1998.1369"", ""10.1177/1473325016672916"", ""10.1111/spol.12386"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul002"", ""10.1177/0095399721995460"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139084444"", ""10.1002/1099-0879(200007)7:3<174::AID-CPP236>3.0.CO;2-U"", ""10.1111/puar.13116"", ""10.1146/annurev-resource-121517-033306"", ""10.7758/9781610448789"", ""10.1177/0275074018765822"", ""10.3386/w27311"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.5.837"", ""10.1111/puar.13133"", ""10.1057/9781403980274"", ""10.1111/psj.12280"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070137"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12066"", ""10.1017/S1537592704000623"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2008.00532.x"", ""10.1017/9781108224987"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511762888"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux025"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2009.01.001"", ""10.1177/0146167200266002"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2018.05.010"", ""10.1111/spol.12333"", ""10.1017/neu.2020.15"", ""10.1177/009539999400935493"", ""10.1353/book4898"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226768786.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.01.012"", ""10.1073/pnas.1805016115"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa001"", ""10.1002/pam.20020"", ""10.1348/014466604X17641"", ""10.1007/s11031-019-09818-1"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100500"", ""10.1002/smi.1368"", ""10.1177/0020764016681590""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Social Psychology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1017/S0260210521000048,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,"Military responses to COVID-19, emerging trends in global civil-military engagements","AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic is giving way to increases in military engagements in health-related activities at the domestic level. This article situates these engagements amid issues of continuity, change, and resistance in contemporary redefinitions of military health roles. It positions the COVID-19 pandemic as a pivotal moment in global health military practice. I identify three emerging trends within national military responses to COVID-19: (1) Minimal technical military support; (2) Blended civil-military responses; and (3) Military-led responses. The dynamics that underpin each type of military involvement follow context-specific military political legacies. These levels of involvement also relate to national public health approaches and the degree of capacity within health care systems. Each identified trend points towards specific trajectories for the future co-constitution of global and local civil-military engagements.","[{""name"": ""Fawzia Gibson-Fall"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32838-1"", ""10.1371/journal.pntd.0002448"", ""10.56021/9781421420325"", ""10.1080/14616742.2018.1447310"", ""10.1017/S0260210506006905"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7717.2009.01111.x"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-2594-9_31"", ""10.4000/hms.1012"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32999-4"", ""10.1177/0967010617739534"", ""10.1017/S1049023X13000162"", ""10.1017/S1049023X00040279"", ""10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003048"", ""10.55460/U0WR-0J5E"", ""10.7312/lako14606"", ""10.1177/0967010615616011"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61114-8"", ""10.4324/9780203157817"", ""10.1017/S0260210514000369"", ""10.1525/9780520968417"", ""10.1093/ia/iiz170"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00704.x"", ""10.1080/14650045.2020.1789804"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2006.00395.x"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61114-8"", ""10.1093/ia/iix187"", ""10.1017/S026021051400031X""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['General Health Professions', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/pops.12716,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Investigating the Links Between Cultural Values and Belief in Conspiracy Theories: The Key Roles of Collectivism and Masculinity,"Research suggests that belief in conspiracy theories (CT) stems from basic psychological mechanisms and is linked to other belief systems (e.g., religious beliefs). While previous research has extensively examined individual and contextual variables associated with CT beliefs, it has not yet investigated the role of culture. In the current research, we tested, based on a situated cultural cognition perspective, the extent to which culture predicts CT beliefs. Using Hofstede's model of cultural values, three nation‐level analyses of data from 25, 19, and 18 countries using different measures of CT beliefs (Study 1, N = 5323; Study 2a, N = 12,255; Study 2b, N = 30,994) revealed positive associations between masculinity, collectivism, and CT beliefs. A cross‐sectional study among U.S. citizens (Study 3, N = 350), using individual‐level measures of Hofstede's values, replicated these findings. A meta‐analysis of correlations across studies corroborated the presence of positive links between CT beliefs, collectivism, r = .31, 95% CI = [.15; .47], and masculinity, r = .39, 95% CI = [.18; .59]. Our results suggest that in addition to individual differences and contextual variables, cultural factors also play an important role in shaping CT beliefs.","[{""name"": ""Jais Adam‐Troian"", ""affiliation"": [""American University of Sharjah""]}, {""name"": ""Pascal Wagner‐Egger"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Fribourg""]}, {""name"": ""Matt Motyl"", ""affiliation"": [""New York University""]}, {""name"": ""Thomas Arciszewski"", ""affiliation"": [""Aix‐Marseille University""]}, {""name"": ""Roland Imhoff"", ""affiliation"": [""Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz""]}, {""name"": ""Felix Zimmer"", ""affiliation"": [""Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz""]}, {""name"": ""Olivier Klein"", ""affiliation"": [""Université Libre de Bruxelles""]}, {""name"": ""Maria Babinska"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Warsaw""]}, {""name"": ""Adrian Bangerter"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Neuchâtel""]}, {""name"": ""Michal Bilewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Warsaw""]}, {""name"": ""Nebojša Blanuša"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zagreb""]}, {""name"": ""Kosta Bovan"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zagreb""]}, {""name"": ""Rumena Bužarovska"", ""affiliation"": [""University St. Cyril and Methodius""]}, {""name"": ""Aleksandra Cichocka"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Kent"", ""Nicolaus Copernicus University""]}, {""name"": ""Elif Çelebi"", ""affiliation"": [""Istanbul Şehir University""]}, {""name"": ""Sylvain Delouvée"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Rennes""]}, {""name"": ""Karen M.

More broadly, we see this response as a chance to contribute to the further development of a framework that allows for the rigorous study of populism's pivotal as well as complex and often troubling relation with nationalism.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin De Cleen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Communication Studies Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussel  Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Yannis Stavrakakis"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki  Greece""]}]","[""10.1080/13183222.2019.1606562"", ""10.1111/nana.12480"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.1111/nana.12522"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.1177/0032321719847576"", ""10.4324/9780203934753"", ""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532635"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330086"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12127"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330087"", ""10.1080/17405904.2017.1309325"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04621-7_2""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ips/olaa001,INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Confronting the International Political Sociology of the New Right,"AbstractThe rise of radical right-wing leaders, parties, movements, and ideas have transformed not only domestic political landscapes but also the direction and dynamics of international relations. Yet for all their emphasis on nationalist identity, on “America First” and “Taking Back Control,” there is an unmistakable international dimension to contemporary nationalist, populist movements. Yet these movements are also often transnationally linked. We argue that a constitutive part of this globality is the New Right's (NR) own distinctive international political sociology (IPS). Key thinkers of the contemporary NR have, over several decades, theorized and strategically mobilized globalized economic dislocation and cultural resentment, developing a coherent sociological critique of globalization. Drawing on the oft-neglected tradition of elite managerialism, NR ideologues have borrowed freely from Lenin and Schmitt on the power of enmity, as well as from Gramsci and the Frankfurt School on counterhegemonic strategies. Against the temptation to dismiss right-wing ideas as “merely” populist and by implication as lacking in ideological and theoretical foundations, we are faced with the much more challenging task of engaging a position that has already developed its own international political sociology and incorporated it into its political strategies.","[{""name"": ""Rita Abrahamsen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ottawa""]}, {""name"": ""Jean-François Drolet"", ""affiliation"": [""Queen Mary - University of London""]}, {""name"": ""Alexandra Gheciu"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ottawa""]}, {""name"": ""Karin Narita"", ""affiliation"": [""Queen Mary - University of London""]}, {""name"": ""Srdjan Vucetic"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ottawa""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Williams"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Ottawa""]}]","[""10.1017/S0260210519000305"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2015.1023655"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000267"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1080/00472336.2018.1448108"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190078171.001.0001"", ""10.1177/03058298810100020501"", ""10.3817/0696108117"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000159"", ""10.1017/S175297191800012X"", ""10.1177/0020702019834716"", ""10.2307/j.ctvnjbf2s"", ""10.1080/14616696.2018.1494295"", ""10.1177/0020702019834645"", ""10.1177/0094582X19846900"", ""10.3817/0395103111"", ""10.1515/9781501757495"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16083-9"", ""10.1017/9781107477568.010"", ""10.1080/10357711003736451"", ""10.1080/10304312.2018.1480309"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199744701.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0000"", ""10.7591/9781501747366"", ""10.1177/0305829815581870"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190212599.001.0001"", ""10.1177/186810341603500303"", ""10.3817/0393099055"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy030""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12463,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Class and social policy in the knowledge economy,"AbstractRecent studies of welfare state attitudes in the knowledge economy find very high generalized support for generous welfare state policies, both among the working and the middle classes. Has class become irrelevant as a predictor of social policy preferences? Or do we simply mis‐conceptualise today's class conflict over social policy? To what extent has it changed from a divide over the level of social policy generosity to a divide over the kind of social policy and – more specifically – over the relative importance that should be given to different social policies? Answering these questions is not only relevant to understand welfare politics in the twenty‐first century, but electoral politics as well: only when we understand what working‐ and middle‐class voters care about, can we evaluate the role distributive policies play in electoral processes. We use original survey data from eight West European countries to show that middle‐ and working‐class respondents indeed differ in the relative importance they attribute to social investment and social consumption policies. Middle‐class respondents consistently attribute higher absolute and relative importance to social investment. We also show that this emphasis on investive policies relates to the middle class expecting better future economic and social opportunities than the working class. This divide in anticipated opportunities underlies a new kind of working‐ versus middle‐class divide, which contributes to transforming the class divide from a conflict over the level of social policy to a conflict over the priorities of social policy.","[{""name"": ""SILJA HÄUSERMANN"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Zurich  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""MICHAEL PINGGERA"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Zurich  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""MACARENA ARES"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona  Spain""]}, {""name"": ""MATTHIAS ENGGIST"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Zurich  Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1111/1475-6765.12308"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1701532"", ""10.1177/0032329216638053"", ""10.1111/ajps.12346"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245"", ""10.1332/0305573054325765"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669769.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1401105"", ""10.31235/osf.io/uj6eq"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1298658"", ""10.1177/0958928717700562"", ""10.1080/01402382.2021.1902115"", ""10.1093/0199256438.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198755753.001.0001"", ""10.1093/esr/jcs059"", ""10.1093/sp/jxu027"", ""10.1177/095892879600600102"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1170191"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1401107"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1565736"", ""10.1177/0032329210365042"", ""10.1017/S1537592719001038"", ""10.2307/2585478"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245.009"", ""10.1177/0010414018797943"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198790488.003.0031"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400079"", ""10.1111/ajps.12209"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.599991"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511622014"", ""10.2307/2657333"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1093/esr/jcy008"", ""10.1057/9780230504592"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12259"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1401108"", ""10.1093/0198297564.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1815825"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316257777"", ""10.1177/1354068817752518"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.esr.a018219"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1378984"", ""10.1177/0958928706059829""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S1752971920000202,INTERNATIONAL THEORY,0302 Political Science,Choosing low-cost institutions in global governance,"AbstractContemporary global governance takes place not only throughs formal inter-governmental organizations and treaties, but increasingly through diverse institutional forms including informal inter-governmental organizations, trans-governmental networks, and transnational public–private partnerships. Although these forms differ in many ways, they are all what we call ‘low-cost institutions’ (LCIs): the costs of creating, operating, changing, and exiting them, and the sovereignty costs they impose, are substantially lower on average than those of treaty-based institutions. LCIs also provide substantive and political governance benefits based on their low costs, including reduced risk, malleability, and flexibility, as well as many of the general cooperation benefits provided by all types of institutions. LCIs are poorly-suited for creating and enforcing binding commitments, but can perform many other governance functions, alone and as complements to treaty-based institutions. We argue that the availability of LCIs changes the cost–benefit logic of institutional choice in a densely institutionalized international system, making the creation of new institutions, which existing research sees as the ‘last resort’, more likely. In addition, LCIs empower executive, bureaucratic, and societal actors, incentivizing those actors to favor creating LCIs rather than treaty-based institutions. The availability of LCIs affects global governance in multiple ways. It reduces the status quo bias of governance, changes its institutional and actor composition, enables (modest) cooperation in times of polarization and gridlock, creates beneficial institutional divisions of labor, and expands governance options. At the same time, the proliferation of LCIs reduces the focality of incumbent institutions, increasing the complexity of governance.","[{""name"": ""Kenneth W.

We explore the patterns of political influence over FDI using a comprehensive firm-level data set on Chinese outward FDI from 2000 to 2013. Using six country-level measures of affinity for China, we find that state-owned and globally diversified firms appear to conform most closely to official guidance. Official investment directives and state visits link investments to state policies; Taiwan recognition and Dalai Lama meetings anchor our political interpretations; and UN General Assembly voting and temporary UN Security Council membership suggest that this intervention may be systematic. The results are robust to country, year, and sector fixed effects, and most do not hold for private or small firms. The results suggest that China uses FDI by prominent state-owned enterprises as an instrument to promote its foreign policy.","[{""name"": ""Randall W.

10.1162/glep_a_00561,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,Catalytic Cooperation,"AbstractScholars typically model the politics of global public goods or common pool resources as difficult collective action problems. Theories of international organization aim to explain how institutions can promote cooperation by solving the free rider problem. Based on an analysis of a quintessential global collective action problem—international climate mitigation—this article challenges both this diagnosis of the problem and the concomitant institutional remedies. Important elements of climate mitigation exhibit three key features that depart from the canonical model: joint goods, preference heterogeneity, and increasing returns. The presence of these features creates the possibility for “catalytic cooperation.” Under such conditions, the chief barrier to cooperation is not the threat of free riding but the lack of incentive to act in the first place. States and other actors seek to solve this problem by creating “catalytic institutions” that work to shift actors’ preferences and strategies toward cooperative outcomes over time. While catalytic institutions can be seen in many areas of world politics, the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change has put this logic of cooperation at its core, raising the possibility that similar catalytic institutions may facilitate cooperation in other areas of world politics characterized by analogous problem structures.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Hale"", ""affiliation"": [""Thomas Hale is an associate professor of global public policy at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.

10.1017/S0007123422000394,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Who Dislikes Whom? Affective Polarization between Pairs of Parties in Western Democracies,"AbstractWhile dislike of opposing parties, that is, affective polarization, is a defining feature of contemporary politics, research on this topic largely centers on the United States. We introduce an approach that analyzes affective polarization between pairs of parties, bridging the US two-party system and multiparty systems in other democracies. Analyzing survey data from twenty Western democracies since the mid-1990s, first, we show that partisans' dislike of out-parties is linked to elite policy disagreements on economic issues and, increasingly over time, also to cultural issues. Secondly, we argue and empirically demonstrate that governing coalition partners in parliamentary democracies display much warmer feelings toward each other than we would expect based on elite policy (dis)agreements. Third, we show that radical right parties are disliked much more intensely than we would expect based on policy disputes and coalition arrangements. These findings highlight the policy-based and institutional underpinnings of affective polarization.","[{""name"": ""Noam Gidron"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Adams"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Will Horne"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226299358.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226472157.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414019879947"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1674578"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00623.x"", ""10.1177/0002764218759581"", ""10.1111/pops.12482"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511622014"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.04.009"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102199"", ""10.31235/osf.io/e2wm6"", ""10.1080/13510347.2021.1883002"", ""10.1017/ipo.2020.12"", ""10.1162/rest_a_01160"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102337"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00243.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.04.002"", ""10.1177/0002716218818782"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12146"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00402.x"", ""10.7910/DVN/BSDKUR"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1177/1465116507073284"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000125"", ""10.1111/ajps.12498"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.31"", ""10.1177/00104140211024283"", ""10.1017/S1537592719001038"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1017/9781316662557"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9323-7"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.06.012"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000763"", ""10.1177/1354068812462931"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226293660.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000461"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199607884.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102332"", ""10.1017/psrm.2013.4"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102203"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.18"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mmb"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12228"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000435"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw003"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1017/S0003055422000491"", ""10.1177/0010414021997504"", ""10.1086/704436"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1017/9781108914123"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12324"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12319""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1007/s12116-021-09319-8,STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,The Rise of Data Politics: Digital China and the World,"AbstractData has become one of the most valuable assets for governments and firms. Yet, we still have a limited understanding of how data reshapes international economic relations. This paper explores various aspects of data politics through the lens of China’s digital rise and the country’s global engagement. I start with the theoretical premise that data differs from traditional strategic assets (e.g., land, oil, and labor), in that it is nonrival and partially excludable. These characteristics have generated externality, commitment, and valuation problems, triggering three fundamental changes in China’s external economic relations. First, data’s externality problem makes it necessary for states to regulate data or even to pursue data sovereignty. However, clashes over data sovereignty can ignite conflicts between China and other countries. Second, the commitment problem in data use raises global concerns about foreign government surveillance. As data is easier to transfer across borders than physical commodities, Chinese tech companies’ investments abroad are vulnerable to national security investigations by foreign regulators. Chinese tech companies, therefore, confront a “deep versus broad” dilemma: deep ties with the Chinese government help promote their domestic business but jeopardize their international expansion. Lastly, data’s valuation problem makes traditional measures (e.g., GDP) ill-suited to measure the relative strengths of the world’s economies, which may distort perceptions of China and other states.","[{""name"": ""Lizhi Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.geb.2017.08.001"", ""10.1257/jel.54.2.442"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226613475.001.0001"", ""10.1177/002795011924900110"", ""10.1093/ser/mwt018"", ""10.3386/w25695"", ""10.5089/9781513511436.087"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2019.02.001"", ""10.1257/aeri.20190382"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510045"", ""10.1126/science.aau4832"", ""10.1257/pandp.20191001"", ""10.1515/9780691189956"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3627893"", ""10.3386/w24254"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000417"", ""10.1007/s12116-021-09322-z"", ""10.5210/fm.v14i10.2611"", ""10.3386/w24253"", ""10.3386/w26260"", ""10.1007/s12116-021-09318-9"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000014"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3691262"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3650564"", ""10.1080/17544750.2019.1649289"", ""10.1177/0010414010369068"", ""10.1525/9780520923140"", ""10.32609/0042-8736-2013-9-40-65"", ""10.1007/s12116-021-09321-0"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77b21"", ""10.1086/261725"", ""10.1353/wp.2007.0018"", ""10.3386/w24839"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000106"", ""10.1111/ajps.12514""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/psj.12223,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Policy Change: An Advocacy Coalition Framework Perspective,"One purpose of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) is to explain policy change. Previous holistic reviews of the ACF by Weible, Sabatier, and McQueen (2009) and Pierce, Peterson, Jones, Garrard, and Vu (2017) of the framework have not explicitly analyzed all the concepts and their interactions in a systematic manner. To address this gap and inform scholars and practitioners about past findings, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for future research, this article analyzes how the ACF's theory of policy change is applied to 148 policy processes among 67 journal articles from 2007 to 2014. Similar to Weible et al. (2009), this research finds the frequent use of multiple primary pathways to policy change, infrequent use of many of the ACF's concepts, a plurality of applications in the environment and energy domain, comparison of subsystems, and a need for greater clarity and transparency among applications. Unlike Weible et al. (2009), this article explores associations between primary pathways and policy domains, the frequency of associations between primary pathways and secondary components, policy change and stasis, and identifies threats to internal validity of key ACF concepts.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan J.

10.1017/pan.2020.47,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Measuring the Rural Continuum in Political Science,"AbstractRecent accounts of American politics focus heavily on urban–rural gaps in political behavior. Rural politics research is growing but may be stymied by difficulties defining and measuring which Americans qualify as “rural.” We discuss theoretical and empirical challenges to studying rurality. Much existing research has been inattentive to conceptualization and measurement of rural geography. We focus on improving estimation of different notions of rurality and provide a new dataset on urban–rural measurement of U.S. state legislative districts. We scrutinize construct validity and measurement in two studies of rural politics. First, we replicate Flavin and Franko (2020,Political Behavior, 845–864) to demonstrate empirical results may be sensitive to measurement of rural residents. Second, we use Mummolo and Nall’s (2017,The Journal of Politics, 45–59) survey data to show rural self-identification is not well-captured with objective, place-based classifications, suggesting a rethinking of theoretical and empirical accounts of rural identity. We conclude with strategies for operationalizing rurality using readily available tools.","[{""name"": ""Zoe Nemerever"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Melissa Rogers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/687569"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000552"", ""10.1177/1532673X08316701"", ""10.1080/00045608.2012.687349"", ""10.1111/ajps.12179"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001204"", ""10.1111/ajps.12018"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00435.x"", ""10.1111/j.1549-0831.1992.tb00457.x"", ""10.1177/1065912918781035"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00565.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.14"", ""10.1086/706458"", ""10.1023/A:1026662130163"", ""10.1111/ajps.12073"", ""10.1177/0002716217712696"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-09522-9"", ""10.1016/S0962-6298(03)00029-5"", ""10.1198/jbes.2010.07136"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2007.03.006"", ""10.1086/679597"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00419.x"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2015.02.003"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000042"", ""10.7910/DVN/EACMTV"", ""10.1086/704329"", ""10.4135/9780857020130.n7"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.5"", ""10.1561/100.00015099"", ""10.1017/S0022381608090087"", ""10.1086/686631""]","['Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"
10.1017/pan.2023.20,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,"Less Annotating, More Classifying: Addressing the Data Scarcity Issue of Supervised Machine Learning with Deep Transfer Learning and BERT-NLI","AbstractSupervised machine learning is an increasingly popular tool for analyzing large political text corpora. The main disadvantage of supervised machine learning is the need for thousands of manually annotated training data points. This issue is particularly important in the social sciences where most new research questions require new training data for a new task tailored to the specific research question. This paper analyses how deep transfer learning can help address this challenge by accumulating “prior knowledge” in language models. Models like BERT can learn statistical language patterns through pre-training (“language knowledge”), and reliance on task-specific data can be reduced by training on universal tasks like natural language inference (NLI; “task knowledge”). We demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning on a wide range of eight tasks. Across these eight tasks, our BERT-NLI model fine-tuned on 100 to 2,500 texts performs on average 10.7 to 18.3 percentage points better than classical models without transfer learning. Our study indicates that BERT-NLI fine-tuned on 500 texts achieves similar performance as classical models trained on around 5,000 texts. Moreover, we show that transfer learning works particularly well on imbalanced data. We conclude by discussing limitations of transfer learning and by outlining new opportunities for political science research.","[{""name"": ""Moritz Laurer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wouter van Atteveldt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andreu Casas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kasper Welbers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/pan/mpu019"", ""10.1177/1461444813480466"", ""10.1080/09592310902975455"", ""10.18653/v1/D19-1404"", ""10.1017/pan.2022.29"", ""10.18653/v1/N18-1101"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2009.191"", ""10.4135/9781526486387.n29"", ""10.1086/715162"", ""10.1017/pan.2022.15"", ""10.4135/9781526486387"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000522"", ""10.7910/DVN/8ACDTT"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.44"", ""10.5281/ZENODO.6394862"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0909-7"", ""10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-demos.6"", ""10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.485"", ""10.1080/19312458.2021.2015574"", ""10.18653/v1/2021.eacl-main.20"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.23"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.4"", ""10.3115/v1/D14-1162"", ""10.18653/v1/N19-1423"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052615-025542"", ""10.18653/v1/P18-1031"", ""10.24433/CO.5414009.v2"", ""10.1177/1550147718811827"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.8"", ""10.1111/jcom.12084"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.39""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['General Social Sciences', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muad023,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Administrative Burden in Citizen-State Interactions: A Systematic Literature Review,"AbstractBased on a systematic review of 119 articles and working papers, we provide an overview of how administrative burdens in citizen–state interactions have been studied since the inception of the research agenda in 2012. We develop a new and comprehensive model of how key concepts in the framework are related, assess the evidence of the causal relationships proposed by the model, and discuss where more evidence is needed. Empirical research supports conventional claims that burdens are consequential, distributive, and constructed. However, the literature has moved further by (1) demonstrating that factors such as frontline service delivery and government communication influence experiences of burdens; (2) highlighting how factors beyond ideology influence constructions of burdens; (3) introducing the burden tolerance concept; (4) illustrating that experiences of burden influence policymakers’ and members of the publics’ burden tolerance. Based on the review, we propose an agenda for future administrative burden research. We call for studies linking experiences of burden to outcomes such as democratic behavior and take-up, and for studies connecting policymakers’ burden tolerance to actual state actions. Moreover, we argue that future studies should use qualitative methods to further explore the nature of burdens from the perspective of citizens, rely on experimental methods to establish causal links between state actions and experiences of burden, and compare burdens across contexts. Further, empirical studies should examine the tradeoffs between legitimacy and experiences of burden, and how actors outside the citizen–state interaction may influence experiences of administrative burden.","[{""name"": ""Aske Halling"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University , Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Baekgaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University , Denmark""]}]","[""10.1111/puar.13381"", ""10.30636/jbpa.41.184"", ""10.1017/S000712342200031X"", ""10.1093/jopart/muab011"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa033"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvab027"", ""10.1177/00953997211073948"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa042"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy014"", ""10.1177/073491492004400101"", ""10.1111/puar.13568"", ""10.1177/00953997211027535"", ""10.1111/puar.13311"", ""10.1257/aer.20121493"", ""10.1080/12294659.2023.2180903"", ""10.1111/puar.13105"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup046"", ""10.1177/0003122410363563"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02600.x"", ""10.1111/puar.13527"", ""10.1177/0095399720908666"", ""10.1111/1467-8500.12508"", ""10.1111/puar.13134"", ""10.1177/0020852320984541"", ""10.1111/spol.12639"", ""10.1111/1467-8500.12518"", ""10.1093/jopart/muac036"", ""10.1111/1467-8500.12522"", ""10.1080/01900692.2019.1636397"", ""10.1177/0095399721995460"", ""10.1111/puar.13472"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvaa010"", ""10.1111/puar.13327"", ""10.1017/S1474746421000749"", ""10.1215/03616878-8802198"", ""10.1111/puar.13116"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv034"", ""10.1002/pam.22046"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.03.015"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114880"", ""10.1111/puar.12114"", ""10.30636/jbpa.41.198"", ""10.1257/aer.20130375"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw031"", ""10.1093/jopart/muab020"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy009"", ""10.1177/0275074020954250"", ""10.1111/puar.13133"", ""10.1111/1475-6773.13861"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101547"", ""10.1002/pam.22178"", ""10.1017/bpp.2022.1"", ""10.1111/puar.13115"", ""10.1111/puar.13437"", ""10.30636/jbpa.32.183"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2021.101653"", ""10.1093/jopart/muac043"", ""10.1080/10967494.2021.1951905"", ""10.1111/padm.12717"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa031"", ""10.1093/jopart/muac002"", ""10.1111/puar.12200"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1177/0095399713503540"", ""10.30636/jbpa.41.193"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux025"", ""10.1111/puar.12638"", ""10.1111/ajps.12584"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.1177/0095399719854367"", ""10.1111/gove.12534"", ""10.1002/pad.1824"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2018.02.003"", ""10.1111/puar.13615"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2016.10.006"", ""10.2307/2939044"", ""10.1177/0734371X20932997"", ""10.2307/2585401"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq095"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa001"", ""10.1504/IJEG.2020.106998""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Reviving the Strength of the Expert Interview Method,"In political scientists’ drive to examine causal mechanisms, qualitative expert interviews have an important role to play. This is particularly true for the analysis of complex decision-making processes, where there is a dearth of data, and for linking macro and micro levels of analysis. The paper offers suggestions for making the most effective and reflective use of qualitative expert interviews. It advocates an encompassing, knowledge-based understanding of experts and argues for the incorporation of both “inside” and “outside” experts, meaning those that make and those that analyze political decisions, into an integrated analytical framework. It puts forward concrete advice addressing this technique’s inherent challenges of selecting experts, experts’ personal biases, and the systematic capturing of evidence. Finally, the article suggests that the combination of expert interviews, experimental methods, and online interviewing can meaningfully strengthen the evidentiary value of this important data collection technique.","[{""name"": ""Christian von Soest"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1537592718001056"", ""10.1017/S1049096502001166"", ""10.1017/S1537592720001164"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139084444"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022343309353097"", ""10.1177/0049124116644273"", ""10.1177/0022343320971021"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226806600.001.0001"", ""10.1257/jep.24.2.3"", ""10.1017/S1537592713001084"", ""10.1037/h0043424"", ""10.1017/S1537592711004889"", ""10.1177/00104140211024309"", ""10.1017/S1049096502001142"", ""10.1017/S1049096502001130"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139381635"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226736785.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1468794121999014"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000277"", ""10.1080/19452829.2018.1536696"", ""10.1177/14687941211061061"", ""10.1093/isr/viab023"", ""10.1007/s11133-006-9027-8"", ""10.4135/9781412963947"", ""10.7312/dris19528"", ""10.1177/1465116505054835"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051017-113314"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000357"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.052706.123951"", ""10.1177/1354066119856084"", ""10.1177/1747016117750312"", ""10.1177/0022343320962157"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663901.003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190672171.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226113623.001.0001"", ""10.1177/00104140211025544"", ""10.5153/sro.3952"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107280366"", ""10.1017/S1537592716002991"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053556"", ""10.1146/annurev.economics.050708.143235"", ""10.1177/1609406919864845"", ""10.1017/S0022278X0700290X"", ""10.1177/1609406919874596"", ""10.1017/9781108644006"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1302490"", ""10.1177/1354066120987891"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr048"", ""10.1111/ajps.12154"", ""10.1007/s12108-017-9363-z"", ""10.1177/0022002714547905""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

But the plan will also have profound geopolitical repercussions. The Green Deal will affect geopolitics through its impact on the EU energy balance and global markets; on oil and gas-producing countries in the EU neighbourhood; on European energy security; and on global trade patterns, notably via the carbon border adjustment mechanism. At least some of these changes are likely to impact partner countries adversely. The EU needs to wake up to the consequences abroad of its domestic decisions. It should prepare to help manage the geopolitical aspects of the European Green Deal. Relationships with important neighbourhood countries such as Russia and Algeria, and with global players including the United States, China and Saudi Arabia, are central to this effort, which can be structured around seven actions: 1) Help neighbouring oil and gas-exporting countries manage the repercussions of the European Green Deal. The EU should engage with these countries to foster their economic diversification, including into renewable energy and green hydrogen that could in the future be exported to Europe; 2) Improve the security of critical raw materials supply and limit dependence, first and foremost on China. Essential measures include greater supply diversification, increased recycling volumes and substitution of critical materials; 3) Work with the US and other partners to establish a ‘climate club’ whose members will apply similar carbon border adjustment measures. All countries, including China, would be welcome to join if they commit to abide by the club's objectives and rules; 4) Become a global standard-setter for the energy transition, particularly in hydrogen and green bonds. Requiring compliance with strict environmental regulations as a condition to access the EU market will be strong encouragement to go green for all countries; 5) Internationalise the European Green Deal by mobilising the EU budget, the EU Recovery and Resilience Fund, and EU development policy; 6) Promote global coalitions for climate change mitigation, for example through a global coalition for the permafrost, which would fund measures to contain the permafrost thaw; 7) Promote a global platform on the new economics of climate action to share lessons learned and best practices.","[{""name"": ""Mark Leonard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jean Pisani-Ferry"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeremy Shapiro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simone Tagliapietra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guntram Wolf"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Energy'],['General Energy'],"[[('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.6919), ('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.6893)]]"

At the same time, our understanding of technology decline and of the associated policies and politics is still limited. This paper builds on the sustainability transitions perspective, a novel approach to analyze socio‐technical transformation, including the complex interplay of policy and technology change. We study the decline of coal‐fired power generation in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2017 by analyzing the discourse in The Guardian. We find scientists and environmental NGOs criticizing coal for climate and health reasons. Government and incumbent businesses tried to re‐legitimate coal but eventually, their resistance collapsed and coal was almost completely abandoned in just a few years. Particularly devastating for coal were failed promises around carbon capture and storage, rapid diffusion of wind energy, and pressure from various policies. This study contributes to better understanding the contested nature of decline, and the interplay of discursive struggles, technology change, and public policy in sustainability transitions.","[{""name"": ""Karoliina Isoaho"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Helsinki Helsinki Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Jochen Markard"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Management, Technology and Economics Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1016/j.eist.2014.07.003"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511978586"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.11.004"", ""10.1177/0963662506066775"", ""10.1177/0957650917695448"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.1705"", ""10.1177/0090591701029005003"", ""10.1093/019924264X.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822395362"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.10.010"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2015.11.023"", ""10.1016/S0048-7333(02)00062-8"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2011.02.002"", ""10.1177/0263276414531627"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2016.01.015"", ""10.1126/science.aao3760"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2010.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.06.012"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2012.02.070"", ""10.3167/gps.2015.330301"", ""10.1080/15239080500339646"", ""10.4324/9780203860014"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.10.008"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2015.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2018.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.01.014"", ""10.1080/09644016.2015.1062592"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2019.01.043"", ""10.1016/j.exis.2017.06.002"", ""10.1068/c1142"", ""10.1504/IJSD.2012.044036"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2017.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2015.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2019.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2015.04.009"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2017.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2015.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.065"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2018.02.004"", ""10.1080/09537320802292883"", ""10.1068/c0797j"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.07.045"", ""10.1038/s41560-018-0171-7"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2012.02.013"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2015.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2011.02.003"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00052"", ""10.1038/s41560-017-0025-8"", ""10.1038/nenergy.2015.30"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2011.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2018.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2017.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2016.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2017.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.01.010"", ""10.1038/nenergy.2017.84"", ""10.1002/bse.1808"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-44288-8_3"", ""10.4337/9781784710194.00015"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2014.02.001"", ""10.1177/0963662511409122"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.03.041"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2019.06.020"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2012.04.060"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.04.009"", ""10.1177/0263276414537910"", ""10.1038/s41560-018-0109-0"", ""10.4135/9781446222218""]","['Environmental Science', 'Energy', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article draws on findings from microlevel studies and theorizes two explanations: generational change and a rise in the number of elective institutions. The empirical section tests these hypotheses along with other explanations proposed in the literature—shifts in party/candidate competition, voting-age reform, weakening group mobilization, income inequality, and economic globalization. The authors conduct two analyses. The first analysis employs an original data set covering all post-1945 democratic national elections. The second studies individual-level data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and British, Canadian, and US national election studies. The results strongly support the generational change and elective institutions hypotheses, which account for most of the decline in voter turnout. These findings have important implications for a better understanding of the current transformations of representative democracy and the challenges it faces.","[{""name"": ""Filip Kostelka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""André Blais"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1953211"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00298.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00541.x"", ""10.1007/s11135-017-0488-5"", ""10.1177/0263395716674370"", ""10.1177/0010414004267981"", ""10.1038/nature11421"", ""10.3138/9781442602519"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198825081.013.20"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.04.007"", ""10.5281/zenodo.61234"", ""10.1177/1354068814549335"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.30"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000029"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.06.009"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9302-z"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00718.x"", ""10.1177/1532673X8601400106"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.06.006"", ""10.2307/1913827"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2016.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.soscij.2014.09.004"", ""10.1093/0198296452.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793717.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1354068817753060"", ""10.1111/polp.12067"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000422"", ""10.1080/17457289.2012.718280"", ""10.1093/019924488X.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0043887121000149"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610073"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.27"", ""10.1017/S000305540011562X"", ""10.1007/s11109-007-9039-4"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2016.01.003"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00044"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9106-0"", ""10.1177/2053168018822395"", ""10.1145/358916.361990"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500079"", ""10.2307/2952255"", ""10.1177/1532673X8100900201"", ""10.7804/cses.imd.2020-12-08"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090409"", ""10.1111/ajps.12210"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511616884"", ""10.2307/2131504"", ""10.1080/17457289.2018.1476359"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000259"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.10.007"", ""10.1057/cep.2011.1"", ""10.1177/0032321720906581"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2008.00212.x"", ""10.59962/9780774862691"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2011.11.006"", ""10.1177/0010414012453032"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283576.001.0001"", ""10.25522/manifesto.mpds.2018a"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.929341"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl012"", ""10.2307/2094738"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000409"", ""10.3917/rfsp.685.0821"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.12005"", ""10.1177/0010414000033009001"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2011.10.002"", ""10.1080/13689880308413092"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00369.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856x.2008.00336.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2007.06.002"", ""10.1007/s11205-009-9488-8"", ""10.2307/j.ctt5hjrrf"", ""10.1177/0888325414532496"", ""10.1080/01402382.2011.648005"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2004.00152.x"", ""10.1177/0032321720923257"", ""10.1111/lsq.12003"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.7910/DVN/UMWLMB"", ""10.1017/S0003055402004227"", ""10.4135/9781412993869"", ""10.2307/2669299"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.09.002"", ""10.1111/ajps.12134"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400134"", ""10.1093/019924958X.003.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000149"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00047-6"", ""10.1080/17448680903351834"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198812579.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12795"", ""10.1057/ap.2013.35""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0043887120000106,WORLD POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Social Revolution and Authoritarian Durability,"ABSTRACTThis article explores the causes of authoritarian durability. Why do some authoritarian regimes survive for decades, often despite severe crises, while others collapse quickly, even absent significant challenges? Based on an analysis of all authoritarian regimes between 1900 and 2015, the authors argue that regimes founded in violent social revolution are especially durable. Revolutionary regimes, such as those in Russia, China, Cuba, and Vietnam, endured for more than half a century in the face of strong external pressure, poor economic performance, and large-scale policy failures. The authors develop and test a theory that accounts for such durability using a novel data set of revolutionary regimes since 1900. The authors contend that autocracies that emerge out of violent social revolution tend to confront extraordinary military threats, which lead to the development of cohesive ruling parties and powerful and loyal security apparatuses, as well as to the destruction of alternative power centers. These characteristics account for revolutionary regimes’ unusual longevity.","[{""name"": ""Jean Lachapelle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Steven Levitsky"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lucan A.

Using data from a national survey of state legislators, we examine whether entrepreneurs shape the legislative agenda on disaster preparedness and relief, which types of entrepreneurs are most influential, and what strategies they use in their interactions with legislators. The results indicate that legislators who report contact with policy entrepreneurs are more likely to have introduced related legislation, evidence of the important link between entrepreneurs and policy change. While entrepreneurs utilize a variety of different strategies, the analysis reveals policymakers are particularly receptive to entrepreneurs who provide new and reliable information.

However, a critical reflection on their added value and on how contemporary ‘design-thinking’ approaches relates to the classical idea of public administration as a design science, is still lacking. This introductory paper reflects upon the use of design approaches in public administration. We delve into the more traditional ideas of design as launched by Simon and policy design, but also into the present-day design wave, stemming from traditional design sciences. Based upon this we distinguish between three ideal-type approaches of design currently characterising the discipline: design as optimisation, design as exploration and design as co-creation. More rigorous empirical analyses of applications of these approaches is necessary to further develop public administration as a design science. We reflect upon the question of how a more designerly way of thinking can help to improve public administration and public policy.","[{""name"": ""Arwin van Buuren"", ""affiliation"": [""Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Jenny M Lewis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Melbourne, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""B Guy Peters"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Pittsburgh, USA""]}, {""name"": ""William Voorberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Our analysis shows that party, gender, education, and class shaped attitudes about gendered nationalism: Republicans, men, and members of the working class were more likely to support gendered nationalist views. We identify a strong, significant relationship between gendered nationalist attitudes and the probability of voting for Donald Trump, even after controlling for partisanship, ideology, race, religion, and other factors. Moreover, gender differences in candidate support were largely driven by gender differences in beliefs that the United States has grown too soft and feminine. Our research adds to the growing scholarly evidence indicating that gendered beliefs are likely to have a bigger impact on American political behavior than a voter's gender alone.","[{""name"": ""Melissa Deckman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erin Cassese"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11109-008-9061-1"", ""10.1177/0002716209351526"", ""10.1111/pops.12492"", ""10.4159/9780674029088"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9131-z"", ""10.1017/rep.2017.35"", ""10.1177/0361684317707710"", ""10.1177/1065912915624018"", ""10.1002/polq.12737"", ""10.1007/s11199-016-0635-9"", ""10.1177/1065912916675738"", ""10.1177/0891243210374600"", ""10.1007/s11199-007-9234-0"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001315"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2011.589283"", ""10.1177/1065912917716336"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9391-y"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2017.07.026"", ""10.1177/089124395009002004"", ""10.1525/9780520957282"", ""10.1111/1471-6402.t01-1-00066"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00059"", ""10.2307/2131869"", ""10.1080/21565503.2017.1304224"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173"", ""10.1080/01419870.1993.9993800"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479837137.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2991838"", ""10.1080/014198798330007"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0432.2009.00446.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190462802.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Evidence from European non-financial corporations","Abstract This article provides estimations of the effects of different financial channels on physical investment in Europe using the balance sheets of publicly listed non-financial corporations (NFCs) for the period 1995–2015. The evidence suggests that both financial payments and financial income have an adverse effect on investment in fixed assets. The negative impacts of increasing financial income are non-linear with respect to company size: they crowd out investment in large companies, and have a positive effect on the investment of relatively smaller companies. Similar to the recent literature on finance-growth nexus, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between financial development and companies’ investment. However, in contrast to the existing literature, we also find that a higher degree of financial development in the country is associated with a stronger negative effect of financial income on investment.","[{""name"": ""Daniele Tori"", ""affiliation"": [""The Open University Business School, Milton Keynes, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Özlem Onaran"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Greenwich Greenwich Political Economy Research Centre, London, UK""]}]","[""10.1093/rfs/hhm019"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv007"", ""10.1093/ser/mwt006"", ""10.2307/2297968"", ""10.1007/s10887-015-9115-2"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.1997.tb00043.x"", ""10.1111/joes.12086"", ""10.2307/2673870"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr016"", ""10.1016/j.jfs.2013.03.005"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00727.x"", ""10.1093/wber/lhp016"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(00)00072-6"", ""10.1080/13563460307171"", ""10.1179/1024529413Z.00000000038"", ""10.1111/j.1467-937X.2007.00426.x"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(92)90037-R"", ""10.1162/003465303762687776"", ""10.2307/2297978"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01431.x"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv008"", ""10.2307/2077882"", ""10.2307/3665623"", ""10.1111/0022-1082.00121"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu038"", ""10.1111/joes.12242"", ""10.1111/meca.12179"", ""10.1142/S0219024909005427"", ""10.1093/wber/10.2.291"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2008.04.002"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhp031"", ""10.2307/1928223"", ""10.1086/261629"", ""10.2307/2534426"", ""10.2307/2555961"", ""10.1080/01603477.1986.11489611"", ""10.1162/003355300554773"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2007.12.014"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhq009"", ""10.2307/2938226"", ""10.1093/cje/bet070"", ""10.1162/003355397555163"", ""10.2307/2118406"", ""10.1093/ser/mww027"", ""10.1093/SER/mwi008"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.12.020"", ""10.1080/030851400360541"", ""10.1287/orsc.2016.1073"", ""10.1086/296120"", ""10.1080/095382599107020"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhg013"", ""10.1016/j.qref.2005.11.007"", ""10.1080/01603477.1999.11490208"", ""10.1093/cje/ben009"", ""10.1111/j.1354-7798.2005.00294.x"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx021"", ""10.1177/1536867X0900900106"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv006"", ""10.1093/cje/beh032"", ""10.2753/PKE0160-3477280203"", ""10.1093/cje/bet052"", ""10.1177/0003122411414827"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv009"", ""10.1093/cje/bex085"", ""10.1111/joes.12068"", ""10.1093/ser/mwt020"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04664.x"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.02.005""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1093/isr/viz029,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Empty Institutions in Global Environmental Politics,"AbstractWhy are some institutions without any policy powers or output? This study documents the efforts by governments to create empty international institutions whose mandates deprive them of any capacity for policy formulation or implementation. Examples include the United Nations Forum on Forests, the Copenhagen Accord on Climate Change, and the UN Commission on Sustainable Development. Research is based on participation in twenty-one rounds of negotiations over ten years and interviews with diplomats, policymakers, and observers. The article introduces the concept of empty institutions, provides evidence from three empirical cases, theorizes their political functions, and discusses theoretical implications and policy ramifications. Empty institutions are deliberately designed not to deliver and serve two purposes. First, they are political tools for hiding failure at negotiations, by creating a public impression of policy progress. Second, empty institutions are “decoys” that distract public scrutiny and legitimize collective inaction, by filling the institutional space in a given issue area and by neutralizing pressures for genuine policy. Contrary to conventional academic wisdom, institutions can be raised as obstacles that preempt governance rather than facilitate it.","[{""name"": ""Radoslav S Dimitrov"", ""affiliation"": [""Western University""]}]","[""10.1111/1758-5899.12199"", ""10.1177/0022002798042001001"", ""10.1162/glep.2010.10.2.25"", ""10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.74"", ""10.1162/002081899551048"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00166"", ""10.1080/08039410.1996.9666018"", ""10.1080/09692290903173087"", ""10.5305/amerjintelaw.104.2.0230"", ""10.1111/reel.12154"", ""10.1080/09644010701211759"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706033"", ""10.1080/14693062.2016.1248343"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027910"", ""10.1017/S0020818300012832"", ""10.1177/1070496508314223"", ""10.1177/1070496516631362"", ""10.1162/1526380053243549"", ""10.1080/09644016.2011.538161"", ""10.1162/152638005774785499"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2010.00472.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00672.x"", ""10.1080/09644010601074224"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00643.x"", ""10.1162/152638003322068227"", ""10.1080/08913810508443645"", ""10.1017/S0020818300028587"", ""10.1111/isqu.12095"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1163/19426720-002-03-90000005"", ""10.1163/19426720-00801008"", ""10.1177/0095399704270586"", ""10.1177/0022002700044005004"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195390087.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491382"", ""10.1162/152638003322469286"", ""10.1162/002081899550913"", ""10.1080/09557570903107688"", ""10.1002/pam.20026"", ""10.1162/glep.2007.7.3.107"", ""10.1515/9781400820269"", ""10.2307/2600589"", ""10.17645/pag.v4i3.634"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1086/226550"", ""10.1080/03050629.2017.1256110"", ""10.1162/glep.2006.6.3.72"", ""10.2307/2585925"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807763"", ""10.1111/rego.12113"", ""10.1017/S002058930800064X"", ""10.1017/S0020589310000400"", ""10.1017/S0020589316000130"", ""10.1177/0192512199204003"", ""10.1177/0010836792027003001"", ""10.1163/15718069920848426"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.978-1-909493-56-8_6"", ""10.1163/161372708X324169"", ""10.1017/S0020818300000801"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2011.00486.x"", ""10.2307/2010108"", ""10.2307/2010300"", ""10.7591/9781501711404"", ""10.1162/152638001570651"", ""10.17645/pag.v4i3.635""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"

Sovereign Borrowing, Democratic Institutions and Global Capital Cycles","AbstractHow do domestic and global factors shape governments’ capacity to issue debt in primary capital markets? Consistent with the ‘democratic advantage’, we identify domestic institutional mechanisms, including executive constraints and policy transparency, that facilitate debt issuance rather than electoral events. Most importantly, we argue that the democratic advantage is contingent: investors’ attention to domestic politics varies with conditions in global capital markets. When global financial liquidity is low, investors are risk-averse, and political risk constrains governments’ capacity to borrow. But when global markets are flush, investors are risk-tolerant and less sensitive to political risk. We support our argument with new data on 245,000 government bond issues in primary capital markets – the point at which governments’ costs of market access matter most – for 131 sovereign issuers (1990–2016). In doing so, we highlight the role of systemic factors, which are under-appreciated in much ‘open economy politics’ research, in determining access to capital markets.","[{""name"": ""Cameron Ballard-Rosa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Layna Mosley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rachel L Wellhausen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139344418"", ""10.1177/0010414009331711"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000880"", ""10.5089/9781475505054.001"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000288"", ""10.1162/003355304772839605"", ""10.1080/09692290500396651"", ""10.2307/1958056"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-4287"", ""10.1515/9781400839803"", ""10.1017/S002081831100004X"", ""10.1086/678987"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01399.x"", ""10.3998/mpub.10897"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316493007"", ""10.1086/684749"", ""10.1086/688441"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2005.05.010"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070129"", ""10.1007/s11558-015-9236-6"", ""10.1177/0010414018774363"", ""10.1177/0010414013488539"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2010.11.007"", ""10.1515/9780691210124"", ""10.1111/ecpo.12081"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-04338-5"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000363"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511607226"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1027844"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx054"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.11.002"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000356"", ""10.1177/0010414005279790"", ""10.1093/pan/mpw020"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000455"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060073"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139086196"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx082"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400111"", ""10.1111/isqu.12140"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-061109-080443"", ""10.1016/j.irle.2013.09.001"", ""10.1080/13563467.2016.1183114"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139599993"", ""10.1080/03050629.2014.899227"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090525"", ""10.1017/S0020818303571065"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1188813"", ""10.2307/2296886"", ""10.1111/isqu.12173"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000185"", ""10.1177/0010414004273204"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Finance']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

And how do these relationships influence how third sector professionals involve citizens in co‐production? I consider evidence from non‐profits in France, England and Quebec to illustrate how three varying models of public management (neo‐Weberian state in France, New Public Management in England, and New Public Governance in Quebec) structure the relationships between government and the third sector (based, respectively, on hierarchy and control, contracting and performance management, and partnership) and how these in turn impact non‐profits' co‐production activities with citizens. The article challenges the thesis that co‐production is most compatible with the model of NPG, demonstrating the variety of co‐production activities that occur in all three contexts and providing new insights into the contextual contingency of the barriers and enablers to co‐production between third sector professionals and citizens.","[{""name"": ""Caitlin McMullin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Concordia University  Montreal Quebec Canada""]}]","[""10.1111/1467-923X.12393"", ""10.2307/j.ctv18ph3nw"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00773.x"", ""10.1007/s11266-012-9309-6"", ""10.1177/0020852314566009"", ""10.1111/puar.12465"", ""10.2307/975300"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2005.00292.x"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00117"", ""10.1080/09540969409387823"", ""10.1111/capa.12115"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00779.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t898qf.10"", ""10.7202/040274ar"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0408.2008.00444.x"", ""10.1111/spol.12482"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03008-7_15-1"", ""10.1007/s11266-018-9996-8"", ""10.1111/puar.12765"", ""10.1017/S1474746407004174"", ""10.4337/9781849802284.00016"", ""10.1057/9780230289635_13"", ""10.1080/14719030600853022"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1981.tb01208.x"", ""10.1080/10967494.2013.796260"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8292.2009.00384.x"", ""10.4324/9781315204956-4"", ""10.1108/09513550810855627"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00698.x"", ""10.1177/0020852319895095"", ""10.1177/0735275112457914"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8292.2009.00387.x"", ""10.1080/03003930.2017.1281803"", ""10.1080/09540962.2017.1328798"", ""10.3828/bjcs.2012.11""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Public Administration', 'Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Comparing Affective Polarization Towards Voters and Parties in Norway and the United States,"A growing body of comparative studies on partisan hostility – a phenomenon known as affective polarization – is providing evidence that partisan affective polarization is generally no greater in the United States than it is in many European multiparty systems. This article takes the comparative literature on affective polarization one step further by presenting the first comparative study on affective polarization that simultaneously uses, compares and combines a direct measure of affective polarization towards voters (using the inter‐party marriage measure) and an indirect measure of affective polarization towards parties (using the like/dislike of party measure) while accounting for the fact that multiparty systems have numerous political parties. This is done by comparing the levels of affective polarization in the United States and Norway. The results show greater affective polarization in the United States relating to parties, but the differences between these two countries are indistinguishable from chance when focusing on the affect relating to voters. This provides empirical evidence that comparative evidence of negative affect towards parties cannot necessarily be generalized to suggest that there is comparative evidence of negative affect towards voters. Yet the results also suggest that negative feelings towards out‐parties move to some extent to the personal level in terms of negative feelings towards voters of these out‐parties.","[{""name"": ""Erik Knudsen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Information Science and Media Studies, and the Digital Social Science Core Facility (DIGSSCORE) University of Bergen""]}]","[""10.1017/S002238161400019X"", ""10.1073/pnas.1808083115"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2006.07.003"", ""10.1177/1354068815593453"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.1111/pops.12482"", ""10.1111/ajps.12329"", ""10.1177/2053168015604648"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy014"", ""10.1177/0002764218759581"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102199"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12228""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

We argue that a matching approach is particularly well‐suited to this task, but existing matching methods are ill‐equipped to handle high‐dimensional text data. Our proposed solution is to estimate a low‐dimensional summary of the text and condition on this summary via matching. We propose a method of text matching, topical inverse regression matching, that allows the analyst to match both on the topical content of confounding documents and the probability that each of these documents is treated. We validate our approach and illustrate the importance of conditioning on text to address confounding with two applications: the effect of perceptions of author gender on citation counts in the international relations literature and the effects of censorship on Chinese social media users.","[{""name"": ""Margaret E.

The Mass Politics of a Contested Policy,"The effects of austerity in response to financial crises are widely contested and assumed to cause significant electoral backlash. Nonetheless, governments routinely adopt austerity when confronting economic downturns and swelling deficits. We explore this puzzle by distinguishing public acceptance of austerity as a general approach and support for specific austerity packages. Using original survey data from five European countries, we show that austerity is in fact the preferred response among most voters. We develop potential explanations for this surprising preference and demonstrate the empirical limitations of accounts centered on economic interests or an intuitive framing advantage. Instead, we show that the preference for austerity is highly sensitive to its political backers and precise composition of spending cuts and tax hikes. Using a novel approach to estimate support for historical austerity programs, we contend that governments’ strategic crafting of policy packages is a key factor underlying the support for austerity.","[{""name"": ""KIRK BANSAK"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MICHAEL M.

This paper asks whether, decades from now, the pandemic will be viewed as an inflection point. Critical junctures occur when an event triggers a discontinuous shift in key variables or forces a rapid acceleration of preexisting trends. Pandemics have undeniably had this effect in the far past. A welter of economic and medical developments, however, have strongly muted the geopolitical impact of pandemics in recent centuries. A review of how the novel coronavirus has affected the distribution of power and interest in its first six months suggests that COVID-19 will not have transformative effects on world politics. Absent a profoundex postshift in hegemonic ideas, 2020 is unlikely to be an inflection point.","[{""name"": ""Daniel W.

Prominent explanations for poor implementation emphasize bureaucratic rent-seeking and capture. This article documents a different pathology that we term bureaucratic overload: local bureaucrats are often heavily under-resourced relative to their responsibilities. We advance a two-step theory explaining why bureaucratic overload is detrimental to implementation as well as why politicians under-invest in local bureaucracy, emphasizing a lack of electoral incentives. Drawing on a nationwide survey of local rural development officials across India, including time-usage diaries that measure their daily behavior, we provide quantitative evidence that (i) officials with fewer resources are worse at implementing rural development programs, plausibly because they are unable to allocate enough time to managerial tasks and (ii) fewer resources are provided in administrative units where political responsibility for implementation is less clear. The findings shed light on the political economy and bureaucratic behavior underpinning weak local state capacity.","[{""name"": ""ADITYA DASGUPTA"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""DEVESH KAPUR"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ecoj.12418"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190945398.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511529016"", ""10.1525/as.2015.55.5.882"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316227367"", ""10.2307/2118402"", ""10.1017/9781108185899"", ""10.1093/restud/rdr043"", ""10.2307/3003457"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022705"", ""10.1177/0010414017710255"", ""10.1111/ajps.12495"", ""10.1016/S0014-2921(00)00059-3"", ""10.1257/aer.20140044"", ""10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.2-3.487"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080213-041128"", ""10.3982/ECTA11757"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-6003"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000715"", ""10.1525/9780520918665"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001254"", ""10.1086/431794"", ""10.1257/jep.34.1.31"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.11.013"", ""10.1086/298003"", ""10.1080/14662043.2017.1327928"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283.008"", ""10.1093/jleo/ewp021"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(85)90052-X"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000502"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000351"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01921.x""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Pundits and scholars alike laid much of the blame for this lack of cooperation on domestic political factors, especially populist leaders. Could international relations theories have predicted this behavior? I argue that there are no off-the-shelf theories that engage populism with traditional mechanisms of international cooperation, especially cooperation facilitated by international institutions. I explore how populist sentiment, whether stemming from the public or leaders, can pose barriers to cooperation. I argue that populists are especially likely to resist cues from foreign actors; are especially reticent to delegate national sovereignty; and are especially resistant to policies that result in gains for elites and, when coupled with nationalism, foreigners. The essay concludes with suggestions for further theoretical and empirical research.","[{""name"": ""Jon C.W.

10.1017/S026021052000039X,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,"The Brandt Line after forty years: The more North-South relations change, the more they stay the same?","AbstractThe Brandt Line is a way of visualising the world that highlights the disparities and inequalities between the wealthy North and the poorer Global South. Forty years after its popularisation as part of a call for global reform, is the Brandt Line now a misleading way of representing world politics? This article assesses whether the Global South has lost its distinctiveness and coherence relative to the North since 1980. Existing assessments of global inequality do not settle the question of whether the North–South divide remains relevant for international relations because they overlook the most politically significant measures of inequality. Drawing on power transition theory, this article provides a systematic assessment of the North–South divide in terms of levels of economic development, relative inequality, economic power, and political satisfaction. The evidence suggests that the Brandt Line is largely intact. Although the economic diversity of the South has increased and its collective economic power has risen, relative income rankings remain unaltered and the states of the Global South are as dissatisfied as they were four decades ago. Differential growth rates are reshaping world politics without eroding the North–South divide traced by the Brandt Line.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Lees"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/002234337100800201"", ""10.1093/ia/iix167"", ""10.1177/0022002717707238"", ""10.1057/jird.2014.20"", ""10.1080/13600820600929762"", ""10.1080/01436597.2014.971598"", ""10.1017/S0260210504006126"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.06.016"", ""10.1086/421541"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00730.x"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1080/01436597.2013.802506"", ""10.1093/ia/iiw005"", ""10.1177/0022002715595700"", ""10.2307/2600619"", ""10.1080/03050620802561769"", ""10.1111/1521-9488.00157"", ""10.1177/0020715209339881"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2003.10.007"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00432"", ""10.1093/ia/iix078"", ""10.1093/ia/iix076"", ""10.1086/451959"", ""10.4324/9780203872796"", ""10.1017/S0020818300032859"", ""10.5195/jwsr.2005.392"", ""10.1017/S0260210510001385"", ""10.1257/jel.20181207"", ""10.1080/01436597.2014.971589"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226351841.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.21.080195.002131"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2010.00909.x"", ""10.1080/14747731003593703"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511664267"", ""10.1353/apr.2007.0001"", ""10.2307/2943004"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2007.06.006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511676406"", ""10.1525/sod.2017.3.2.163"", ""10.1080/01436597.2014.971603""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S1752971919000162,INTERNATIONAL THEORY,0302 Political Science,Social bonding in diplomacy,"AbstractIt is widely recognized among state leaders and diplomats that personal relations play an important role in international politics. Recent work at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, and sociology has highlighted the critical importance of face-to-face interactions in generating intention understanding and building trust. Yet, a key question remains as to why some leaders are able to ‘hit it off,’ generating a positive social bond, while other interactions ‘fall flat,’ or worse, are mired in negativity. To answer, we turn to micro-sociology – the study of everyday human interactions at the smallest scales – an approach that has theorized this question in other domains. Drawing directly from US sociologist Randall Collins, and related empirical studies on the determinants of social bonding, we develop a model of diplomatic social bonding that privileges interaction elements rather than the dispositional characteristics of the actors involved or the material environment in which the interaction takes place. We conclude with a discussion of how the study of interpersonal dyadic bonding interaction may move forward.","[{""name"": ""Marcus Holmes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicholas J.

10.1093/polsoc/puab009,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Re-thinking the coronavirus pandemic as a policy punctuation: COVID-19 as a path-clearing policy accelerator,"AbstractThis article joins with others in this special issue to examine the evolution of our understanding of how the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic impacted policy ideas and routines across a wide variety of sectors of government activity. Did policy ideas and routines transform as a result of the pandemic or were they merely a continuation of the status quo ante? If they did transform, are the transformations temporary in nature or likely to lead to significant, deep and permanent reform to existing policy paths and trajectories? As this article sets out, the literature on policy punctuations has evolved and helps us understand the impact of COVID-19 on policy-making but tends to conflate several distinct aspects of path trajectories and deviations under the general concept of “critical junctures” which muddy reflections and findings. Once the different possible types of punctuations have been clarified, however, the result is a set of concepts related to path creation and disruption—especially that of “path clearing”—which are better able to provide an explanation of the kinds of policy change to be expected to result from the impact of events such as the 2019 coronavirus pandemic.","[{""name"": ""John Hogan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Business, Technological University Dublin , Dublin 2, Ireland""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Howlett"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Simon Fraser University , Burnaby, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Mary Murphy"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Social Science, Maynooth University , Maynooth, Ireland""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01594.x"", ""10.1111/gove.12007"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.876180"", ""10.1111/spol.12718"", ""10.1111/spol.12207"", ""10.1017/S0143814X98000038"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2004.00068.x"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1308417"", ""10.1002/rhc3.12193"", ""10.1080/00343404.2016.1258460"", ""10.1177/0170840617693272"", ""10.1111/gwao.12491"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1783790"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1787628"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316273104.007"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsy009"", ""10.2307/jj.12124966"", ""10.1177/0958928709358793"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9515.2011.00779.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123499000083"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00455.x"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1853117"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226241739.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.0021-9886.2005.00554.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818300028460"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00914.x"", ""10.1057/fr.2014.44"", ""10.1017/S0020818300007141"", ""10.1515/9780691221380"", ""10.2307/422246"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb00343.x"", ""10.1086/210041"", ""10.1111/spol.12677"", ""10.1017/S0008423906060203"", ""10.1002/epa2.1057"", ""10.1057/9781137434043_1"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1994.tb01494.x"", ""10.1017/S0008423900009100"", ""10.1017/S0143814X09990158"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.771092"", ""10.1111/j.0033-3298.2005.00462.x"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puab008"", ""10.2307/421608"", ""10.1177/1010539511429592"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.00176"", ""10.1016/j.progress.2018.01.001"", ""10.1023/A:1007113830879"", ""10.1007/BF02687587"", ""10.1086/378454"", ""10.1080/25741292.2020.1824379"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.05.015"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12893"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1787627"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1852232"", ""10.1111/spol.12679"", ""10.2307/2950710"", ""10.2307/2586011"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1574869"", ""10.1080/13669877.2020.1758755"", ""10.1007/s11186-007-9026-0"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135342"", ""10.1017/S175577390999021X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139857086"", ""10.1002/hpja.333"", ""10.1057/9781137314840"", ""10.2307/2392337"", ""10.1007/BF03342736"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2021.02.003"", ""10.4067/S0718-18762016000200003"", ""10.1007/s11077-020-09381-4"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283.006"", ""10.1080/19460171.2014.901175"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00007285"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1853120""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiab198,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Race and racism in the founding of the modern world order,"Abstract While race existed as a cultural marker in earlier history, a mutually-reinforcing link between racism, slavery and empire is a distinct product of western Europe and the US-led world order. Yet, mainstream scholarship on International Relations has obscured the question of race or worse, legitimized its exclusion in discussions of world order-building. At the same time, demand for racial equality from anti-colonial forces presented an alternative and inclusive conception of world order. The first part of this article offers a brief discussion of concepts of race, racism and world order. The next part examines how racist ideas and norms created exclusionary frameworks and approaches of world order, such as the European ‘standard of civilization’ principle. The third part looks at the role of racism in the emergence of the American-led world order, including US President Woodrow Wilson's rejection of the ‘racial equality’ principle in the League of Nations Charter, the privileging of ‘sovereign equality’ over ‘racial equality’ in the UN Charter, and the scant attention given to the link between colonialism and denial of human rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet, anti-colonial leaders and conferences, especially the 1955 Bandung Conference, integrated ‘national sovereignty, racialism and colonialism’, and demanded racial equality as a fundamental human right. The final part cautions against the dangers of complacency and compartmentalizing the study of race and racism, and calls instead for viewing racism as an inter-linked global challenge, hence integral to the emerging research agenda of Global International Relations.","[{""name"": ""Amitav Acharya"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

This study examines the mechanisms leading to this active process and places it in the context of major policy changes in several fields (i.e., rural development, land titling, social protection, environment, and protection of indigenous peoples). It shows that dismantling decisions were made incrementally by conservative coalitions that seized upon the economic crisis to consolidate a neoliberal turn; however, this turn was radicalized with the expansion of the conservative alliance and tied together by populist rhetoric.

This is notwithstanding the fact that a pandemic was bound to happen, sooner or later (and will happen again). The effectiveness of national responses has varied enormously. Globally, New Zealand has been perceived as setting the gold standard in ‘curve crushing’, and for a short period achieved Covid‐free status. For this achievement, much credit is due to the New Zealand government, especially to Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern. However, post‐lockdown the New Zealand government has encountered a number of Covid policy implementation problems (many of which could have been anticipated). Nevertheless, Covid‐19 might still turn out to have been a seismic shock to existing policy processes and policy frames (such as austerity). If so, there are grounds for hope that in the future, governments and voters might be less short‐term in their outlook. Perhaps anticipatory, rather than reactive policy making, might become more fashionable?","[{""name"": ""Sonia Mazey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeremy Richardson"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Health Professions'],['General Health Professions'],"[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

This result suggests such questions may not be that sensitive in many places, which in turn raises doubts that authoritarian citizens are widely feigning positive attitudes towards regimes they secretly despise.

10.1093/irap/lcab003,INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC,0302 Political Science,Hedging and grand strategy in Southeast Asian foreign policy,"AbstractThis article examines recent interest in hedging as a feature of international politics in the Asia Pacific. Focusing on the small states of Southeast Asia, we argue that dominant understandings of hedging are misguided for two reasons. Despite significant advances in the literature, hedging has remained a vague concept rendering it a residual category of foreign policy behavior. Moreover, current accounts of hedging tend to overstate the strategic intentions of ostensible hedgers. This article proposes that a better understanding of Southeast Asia’s foreign policy behavior needs to dissociate hedging from neorealist concepts of international politics. Instead, we locate the concept in the context of classical realism and the diplomatic practice of second-tier states. Exploring Southeast Asia’s engagement with more powerful actors from this perspective reveals the strategic limitations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the dilemma that Southeast Asian states face from a rising China challenging the status quo in the western Pacific.","[{""name"": ""David Martin Jones"", ""affiliation"": [""Visiting Professor, War Studies, Kings College, University of London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Nicole Jenne"", ""affiliation"": [""Associate Professor, Pontificia Universidad Católica de  Chile""]}]","[""10.1080/13523269808404179"", ""10.1093/ia/iiz223"", ""10.1080/14799855.2017.1357999"", ""10.5509/2009824657"", ""10.1093/irap/lcz007"", ""10.1093/irap/lcz017"", ""10.1162/isec.2008.32.3.113"", ""10.1093/irap/lcz010"", ""10.1093/irap/lcu005"", ""10.1525/9780520352797"", ""10.1093/cjip/pow013"", ""10.1093/irap/lcz011"", ""10.1355/CS30-2A"", ""10.1093/bjps/XIV.53.1"", ""10.1093/irap/lcz015"", ""10.1080/09636412.2015.1103130"", ""10.1162/016366005774859724"", ""10.4324/9780203002865"", ""10.1080/14799855.2017.1354566"", ""10.1353/asp.2019.0048"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511974182"", ""10.4324/9780203865019"", ""10.1355/9789814786751"", ""10.4159/9780674042414"", ""10.1111/aspp.12391"", ""10.4324/9780203816554"", ""10.1080/09636412.2012.679203"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2011.01022.x"", ""10.1016/j.orbis.2013.02.011""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiab120,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,"Globalization, deglobalization and the liberal international order","Abstract For decades, globalization and the liberal international order evolved side by side. Recently, however, deglobalizing forces have been on the rise and the liberal international order has come to be increasingly beleaguered. The special issue ‘Deglobalization? The future of the liberal international order’ examines the interconnectedness of globalization and deglobalization processes on the one hand and the trajectory of the liberal international order on the other. This introduction provides a conceptual frame for the articles to follow. It discusses globalization and deglobalization processes, compares how they have been intertwined with the liberal international order in the past and presently, and explores how these differences are likely to affect the future of world politics. The special issue makes three important contributions. First, we examine globalization and deglobalization processes systematically. Second, we break new ground in studying the future of international order. Third, we generate novel insights into epochal change.","[{""name"": ""Markus Kornprobst"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T V Paul"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055420000751,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Explanations of Institutional Change: Reflecting on a ""Missing Diagonal""","Previous research on institutional change has concentrated on two types of explanations. On one hand, the dualism of path dependency and critical junctures has advanced our understanding of how institutional change occurs due to sudden exogenous shocks. On the other hand, more recent critiques have established a better understanding of endogenous, gradual change. This article is motivated by observations that current research tends to overlook what I call the “missing diagonal.” I argue that we need to disentangle the sources of a cause (exogenous vs. endogenous) from its time horizon (sudden vs. gradual). By cross-tabulating these two dimensions, the proposed typology of institutional change explanations is able to capture complex multilayered as well as sequential arguments of institutional change. The typology urges scholars to be more precise with their social science language of erosion and decay, while serving as a generator for an innovative research agenda on endogenous ruptures.","[{""name"": ""JOHANNES GERSCHEWSKI"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0020818305050101"", ""10.1017/S1537592715002261"", ""10.1177/0049124192020004001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb00343.x"", ""10.1515/9781400841080"", ""10.3998/mpub.10029"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.441"", ""10.1007/BF00234205"", ""10.1017/psrm.2016.37"", ""10.5129/001041517821273044"", ""10.1057/9781137271327"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511809477"", ""10.2307/2669334"", ""10.1017/S0898588X00003011"", ""10.1353/jod.1990.0059"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.21"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790997"", ""10.1057/9780230524644_17"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628"", ""10.1177/0010414010390653"", ""10.1177/003232927300400101"", ""10.1017/9781108692823"", ""10.5129/001041518822704971"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316273104.007"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.323"", ""10.1515/9781400823963"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511806049"", ""10.1017/S0094837300005224"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000278"", ""10.1353/wp.0.0013"", ""10.2307/421608"", ""10.1177/0951629814531667"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.21.080195.000521"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.2307/2586011"", ""10.1017/S0043887100020852"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511528170"", ""10.1111/j.1467-923X.1933.tb02302.x"", ""10.2307/2082975"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198744023.001.0001"", ""10.3998/mpub.6576809"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1312349"", ""10.1177/0002764218759577"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816178"", ""10.1086/392759"", ""10.1177/0049124113503142"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198819974.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055404041395"", ""10.1007/BF02687587"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803963.005"", ""10.1038/366223a0"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511842856"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.21"", ""10.1177/000169939603900302"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803963.006"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.091106.121756"", ""10.1177/0010414015626449"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120709-145346"", ""10.1080/00963402.1964.11454697""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1017/S0003055420000866,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Emigrant Inclusion in Home Country Elections: Theory and Evidence from sub-Saharan Africa,"Since 1990, nearly 100 countries extended voting rights to citizens living abroad, including 32 in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the actual ability for emigrants to vote in subsequent elections varies widely. Whereas others view diaspora enfranchisement as a signal to emigrant and international audiences, I argue that incumbent parties expand or restrict emigrant voter access depending on party perceptions of political support abroad. I first leverage the multiple reversals over emigrant inclusion in South African elections since 1994 to illuminate how changing dynamics between an incumbent party and citizens abroad shape emigrant voter access. I further test my argument with an original dataset covering multiple dimensions of external voting in every African election where emigrants had voting rights from 1990 to 2015. I find a robust relationship between emigrant voter access and diaspora support for the incumbent party.","[{""name"": ""ELIZABETH IAMS WELLMAN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13510347.2014.979163"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2013.11.009"", ""10.1080/1351034042000238176"", ""10.1353/lar.2007.0046"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2020.102145"", ""10.1007/s12116-017-9252-z"", ""10.1080/09739572.2019.1705695"", ""10.23696/vdemds20"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-043010-095807"", ""10.1057/s41304-019-00202-8"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7379.2011.00867.x"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00538"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-102512-194818"", ""10.1017/S0022381600053585"", ""10.3917/afco.256.0114"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000596"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-071510-103222"", ""10.1080/09739572.2017.1331607"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625626"", ""10.3917/afco.256.0073"", ""10.1177/0192512110374044"", ""10.5129/001041510X12911363510439"", ""10.1177/0888325412450537"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.090203.103000"", ""10.3917/afco.256.0051"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2011.00887.x"", ""10.1017/S0022381608090154"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801449666.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.08.003"", ""10.1080/13510347.2014.979161"", ""10.1162/0033553041382175"", ""10.1177/0010414012453445"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2005.00221.x"", ""10.1177/0010414009332126"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-082012-115925"", ""10.1177/0192512118758154"", ""10.1080/01402382.2018.1528105"", ""10.1057/9781137271327"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.7"", ""10.3917/afco.256.0035"", ""10.1093/migration/mns008"", ""10.3917/afco.256.0011"", ""10.5129/001041517821273053"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2013.04.001"", ""10.1086/375195"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808661"", ""10.1111/lamp.12125"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcm4j72"", ""10.1017/S0007123409990056"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107045484"", ""10.1023/A:1026662130163"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674736283"", ""10.1080/13510347.2014.988146"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1534827"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.081205.095418"", ""10.1080/13621020903309607"", ""10.1080/13510347.2014.979800"", ""10.1080/01442872.2019.1694650"", ""10.1177/0010414014546331"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12357"", ""10.1177/0010414015606736"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2016.1234932"", ""10.1017/9781108858960"", ""10.4102/ac.v2i1.32"", ""10.2307/2585577"", ""10.4324/9780203077283"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511800344"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510274"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2017.1409164"", ""10.1007/s12116-016-9230-x"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000671"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139519755"", ""10.1017/S1755773919000171"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000300"", ""10.1080/13621025.2011.549707"", ""10.1525/ae.1998.25.2.291"", ""10.3368/jhr.50.2.317"", ""10.1080/13510347.2014.981668"", ""10.1017/S0022278X06002060"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.10.004"", ""10.1257/aer.99.2.310"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139343824"", ""10.1086/690946"", ""10.1111/j.1813-6982.2004.tb00107.x"", ""10.1017/S0022278X03004269""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1146/annurev-polisci-051120-104535,ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,"Automation, Digitalization, and Artificial Intelligence in the Workplace: Implications for Political Behavior","New technologies have been a key driver of labor market change in recent decades. There are renewed concerns that technological developments in areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence will destroy jobs and create political upheaval. This article reviews the vibrant debate about the economic consequences of recent technological change and then discusses research about how digitalization may affect political participation, vote choice, and policy preferences. It is increasingly well established that routine workers have been the main losers of recent technological change and disproportionately support populist parties. However, at the same time, digitalization also creates a large group of economic winners who support the political status quo. The mechanisms connecting technology-related workplace risks to political behavior and policy demands are less well understood. Voters may fail to fully comprehend the relative importance of different causes of structural economic change and misattribute blame to other factors. We conclude with a list of pressing research questions.","[{""name"": ""Aina Gallego"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain;"", ""Institut Barcelona Estudis Internacionals, Barcelona, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Thomas Kurer"", ""affiliation"": [""Cluster of Excellence “The Politics of Inequality”, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany;"", ""Department of Political Science, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1016/S0169-7218(11)02410-5"", ""10.3386/w28257"", ""10.1257/pandp.20201003"", ""10.1257/aer.20160696"", ""10.1086/705716"", ""10.1257/jep.33.2.31"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2021.103693"", ""10.1073/pnas.2111611118"", ""10.1257/jep.29.3.3"", ""10.1257/aer.103.5.1553"", ""10.1162/003355398555874"", ""10.1177/001979390205500303"", ""10.1162/003355303322552801"", ""10.1093/isq/sqab027"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-041719-102503"", ""10.3138/cpp.2020-065"", ""10.1093/restud/rdv039"", ""10.1257/aer.102.1.167"", ""10.1111/ajps.12408"", ""10.1257/pandp.20181019"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsz023"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192848369.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0047279421000519"", ""10.1257/aeri.20190385"", ""10.1257/aeri.20170036"", ""10.1111/jors.12503"", ""10.1257/jep.33.4.128"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102182"", ""10.1016/j.jmoneco.2017.09.006"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvab012"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.09.024"", ""10.1080/2474736X.2020.1757387"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2020.3812"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199797899.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ej/ueaa044"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.01.014"", ""10.1093/oxrep/gry007"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019"", ""10.1177/00104140211024290"", ""10.1086/714920"", ""10.1177/0010414019879947"", ""10.1177/2053168019832745"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192848369.003.0009"", ""10.1257/aer.99.2.58"", ""10.1257/aer.104.8.2509"", ""10.1162/rest_a_00754"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-092120-044327"", ""10.1257/jep.34.4.52"", ""10.1017/ics.2020.22"", ""10.1177/2053168018822395"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400079"", ""10.3386/w27122"", ""10.2307/1914185"", ""10.1017/S1755773920000144"", ""10.1177/0010414013516066"", ""10.1093/ej/ueab009"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1544268"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1177/0010414020912283"", ""10.1177/2053168018822142"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192848369.003.0008"", ""10.1177/2053168019831164"", ""10.24148/wp2020-19"", ""10.1162/rest_a_01083"", ""10.1017/S175577392100014X"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-110713"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00366"", ""10.1177/0010414021997175"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400067"", ""10.4337/9781035335299.00013"", ""10.1515/9781400882915"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-063806"", ""10.1111/joes.12328"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-033542"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12259"", ""10.1177/0010414018784065"", ""10.1177/0010414008330595"", ""10.1017/S0007123410000384"", ""10.1057/s42214-018-0001-4"", ""10.3386/w27526"", ""10.1093/ej/ueaa006"", ""10.1017/S000305540505149X"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-27043-8_16"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1017/S1537592718001081"", ""10.1177/0010414017740600"", ""10.1177/0032329203261095"", ""10.3386/w24839"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-041719-102405"", ""10.1017/psrm.2021.43"", ""10.3386/w28290""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muaa025,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Who Is in Charge?The Provision of Informal Personal Resources at the Street Level,"AbstractStreet-level bureaucrats (SLBs) nowadays provide services under conditions of increased demand for public services coupled with scarcer financial resources. The literature that focuses on how workers adapt to this situation mainly examines their provision of formal resources as part of their job. What researchers have not systematically examined is the delivery of informal personal resources (IFRs) by street-level workers to clients. Understanding the provision of IFRs is particularly important when “no one is fully in charge” of public services. Drawing on 214 in-depth qualitative interviews with SLBs who provide education, health, and welfare services in the public sector in Israel, we found a remarkable range of IFRs they provided to clients. We also found that four main factors influencing the provision of IFRs: lack of formal resources; professional commitment; managerial encouragement; and a work environment whose values combine old and new approaches to public service. The findings contribute to the public administration literature by exposing how public service function in a somewhat vague reality, and they contribute to the SLB literature by highlighting the unrecognized component of informal service provision.","[{""name"": ""Einat Lavee"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Haifa""]}]","[""10.1177/017084069601700403"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1093/bjc/azn067"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00481.x"", ""10.1177/0275074014532826"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq093"", ""10.1111/puar.12238"", ""10.1177/0049124113500475"", ""10.1086/689621"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul002"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup039"", ""10.4324/9781315614205"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2014.09.001"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux028"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bcs008"", ""10.1111/padm.12144"", ""10.1177/0038038506062033"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut037"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.854401"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00650.x"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60102-6"", ""10.2307/2991852"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02342.x"", ""10.1111/padm.12402"", ""10.1111/cfs.12443"", ""10.4337/9781784715632.00033"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(85)90062-8"", ""10.1521/scpq.18.3.231.22576"", ""10.4324/9780203830444"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024272"", ""10.1177/1049732315588501"", ""10.1177/0095399713509242"", ""10.4324/9780203861684"", ""10.2307/976618"", ""10.1111/puar.12430"", ""10.1556/SocEc.32.2010.1.3"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1500629"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00390.x"", ""10.1525/sp.2006.53.2.274"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq095"", ""10.1177/0734371X10394401"", ""10.1111/padm.12130"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy024"", ""10.1111/gove.12297"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu056"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.02016.x"", ""10.1080/14719037.2012.662443"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.2006.00297.x"", ""10.1007/s10869-006-9034-5"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226874937.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq096""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Administration', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/padm.12642,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,The role(s) of accounting and performance measurement systems in contemporary public administration,"AbstractThe spate of public sector reforms which have taken place in recent decades has triggered the development of a new body of research around public sector accounting and performance measurement both in public administration as well as in the (public sector) accounting literature. However, studies in accounting and public administration have at times ignored each other, proceeding in parallel. This symposium encourages the adoption of interdisciplinary perspectives in exploring the myriad roles played by accounting and performance measurement systems in contemporary public administration. Emphasizing that accounting and performance measurement systems are socially, politically, culturally constructed and, in turn, are implicated in the creation of organizations, society and political values, this symposium aims to extend the dialogue between accounting and public administration scholars in exploring how accounting, accountability and performance measurement considerations are connected to policy‐making, public services and, more generally, the building and maintenance of modern states and democracies.","[{""name"": ""Ileana Steccolini"", ""affiliation"": [""Essex Business School University of Essex  Colchester UK""]}, {""name"": ""Iris Saliterer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Public and Non‐Profit Management Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg  Baden‐Württemberg Germany""]}, {""name"": ""James Guthrie"", ""affiliation"": [""Macquarie Graduate School of Management Macquarie University  Sydney New South Wales Australia""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00864.x"", ""10.1108/09513571211234286"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-11-2013-1532"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(87)90008-0"", ""10.1111/faam.12049"", ""10.1111/puar.12406"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw028"", ""10.1111/puar.12994"", ""10.1111/puar.12969"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1494066"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2006.00600.x"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(83)90030-2"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-06-2015-2090"", ""10.1006/mare.2000.0136"", ""10.1108/09513579210011835"", ""10.1108/09513570810854383"", ""10.1108/EUM0000000006263"", ""10.1108/09513579810231439"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(80)90017-3"", ""10.1111/padm.12550"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01559.x"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00140"", ""10.1080/12294659.2015.1088688"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2010.01896.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99432-1"", ""10.1080/09540962.2016.1237128"", ""10.1016/j.bar.2010.02.006"", ""10.1111/puar.12609"", ""10.1111/1468-0408.00082"", ""10.1111/puar.12981"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00779.x"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(93)E0001-W"", ""10.1111/1477-7053.00085"", ""10.1093/jopart/muh019"", ""10.4135/9781412982719.n3"", ""10.1108/09513571211198773"", ""10.1108/09513579310042542"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut019"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2013.05.008"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0408.2011.00534.x"", ""10.1111/faam.12005"", ""10.1111/padm.12363"", ""10.1111/padm.12066"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0408.2009.00474.x"", ""10.1080/14719037.2019.1599059"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.905409"", ""10.1080/15309576.2015.1006469"", ""10.1016/S1044-5005(03)00019-2"", ""10.1108/EUM0000000004618"", ""10.1111/1468-0408.00081"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0408.2008.00444.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6281.2009.00275.x"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2013.05.001"", ""10.1177/0020852315619023"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(83)90028-4"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00443.x"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2007.02.005"", ""10.5465/19416520.2013.783668"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0408.2009.00477.x"", ""10.1111/faam.12004"", ""10.2753/PMR1530-9576320409"", ""10.30636/jbpa.11.15"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01583.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur024"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut051"", ""10.1111/gove.12256"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1508609"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy052"", ""10.1111/puar.12337"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux023"", ""10.1080/09638180126799"", ""10.1111/puar.12837"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0408.2012.00544.x"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-04-2015-2026"", ""10.1111/1099-1123.00306"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.2003.00147.x"", ""10.1111/padm.12604"", ""10.1016/j.mar.2013.07.004"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-03-2018-3423"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01788.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.02008.x"", ""10.1006/mare.2000.0132"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-10541-7"", ""10.1080/14719030802264366"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq043"", ""10.1111/faam.12033""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Accounting', 'Public Administration', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

Adopting a difference‐in‐differences (DID) methodology, we document the effects of tariff reductions on improving firm‐level SO2 emission intensity, and the key corporate strategic decisions responsible for delivering the observed results, with robustness tests covering other major pollutants. In response to trade liberalisation, firms are found to increase labour resources for environmental protection and to improve their production processes to reduce emission intensity. This study contributes to the literature by investigating at the level of the operating firm how output and input tariff reductions may impact on environmental performance and uncovering for the first time the specific actions responsible for the results.","[{""name"": ""Jingbo Cui"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Social Sciences and Environmental Research Center Duke Kunshan University Kunshan China""]}, {""name"": ""On Kit Tam"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Economics, Finance and Marketing Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University Melbourne Vic.

A popular answer argues that human psychology is tailored for face-to-face interaction and people’s behavior therefore changes for the worse in impersonal online discussions. We provide a theoretical formalization and empirical test of this explanation: the mismatch hypothesis. We argue that mismatches between human psychology and novel features of online environments could (a) change people’s behavior, (b) create adverse selection effects, and (c) bias people’s perceptions. Across eight studies, leveraging cross-national surveys and behavioral experiments (total N = 8,434), we test the mismatch hypothesis but only find evidence for limited selection effects. Instead, hostile political discussions are the result of status-driven individuals who are drawn to politics and are equally hostile both online and offline. Finally, we offer initial evidence that online discussions feel more hostile, in part, because the behavior of such individuals is more visible online than offline.","[{""name"": ""ALEXANDER BOR"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MICHAEL BANG PETERSEN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/a0030398"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000234"", ""10.1177/2158244019832705"", ""10.1017/S0022381608090117"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372879"", ""10.1177/0022022102033005001"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edr037"", ""10.1111/jcom.12104"", ""10.1017/9781108560573"", ""10.7910/DVN/8I6NOT"", ""10.7312/sydn18924"", ""10.1177/1461444811413191"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000431"", ""10.2190/576R-1NVK-M943-CJMP"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.861"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2005.01.002"", ""10.1080/00220671.2011.629692"", ""10.1080/10584609.2013.852642"", ""10.31234/osf.io/8m5dc"", ""10.1016/S0167-4870(01)00059-9"", ""10.1073/pnas.1813486116"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.54.4.541"", ""10.1080/13691180110097030"", ""10.1177/0956797620922476"", ""10.1016/0162-3095(85)90041-X"", ""10.1023/B:JOBA.0000007455.08539.94"", ""10.1007/s12110-003-1016-y"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000120"", ""10.1073/pnas.1906420116"", ""10.1093/pan/mpu010"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2010.09.003"", ""10.1177/1094428114547952"", ""10.1177/0963721417731378"", ""10.1177/1073191106287666"", ""10.1145/2998181.2998213"", ""10.1093/qje/qjr044"", ""10.1080/10584609.2018.1561563"", ""10.1177/1350506818765318"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000283"", ""10.1016/0747-5632(88)90023-4"", ""10.1006/obhd.2001.2961"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2014.01.016"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01412.x"", ""10.1023/A:1012563421824"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2014.940365"", ""10.1177/1745691620917336"", ""10.1016/S0167-2681(98)00121-8"", ""10.1080/10584609.2018.1504840""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

A review of the empirical literature on the migration–terrorism nexus indicates that (1) there is little evidence that more migration unconditionally leads to more terrorist activity, especially in Western countries, (2) terrorism has electoral and political (but sometimes short-lived) ramifications, for example, as terrorism promotes anti-immigrant resentment and (3) the effectiveness of stricter migration policies in deterring terrorism is rather limited, while terrorist attacks lead to more restrictive migration policies.","[{""name"": ""Marc Helbling"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Meierrieks"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/341395"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060103"", ""10.1007/s11127-016-0367-y"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801450686.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022343319864425"", ""10.1007/BF00124924"", ""10.1086/669605"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-032211-212920"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990360"", ""10.1177/1468796818757264"", ""10.31235/osf.io/d4ewg"", ""10.1007/s11127-010-9601-1"", ""10.1086/684679"", ""10.1080/09546553.2016.1211525"", ""10.1177/0022343318804592"", ""10.9783/9780812206791"", ""10.1093/ijpor/14.1.93"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000288"", ""10.1093/esr/jcp056"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00144.x"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2019.07.019"", ""10.1177/0738894212456951"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000388"", ""10.1177/0022343319897105"", ""10.1093/poq/nfl029"", ""10.1111/jasp.12563"", ""10.1080/10781910701270970"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.77.5.905"", ""10.1080/10242694.2013.824676"", ""10.1177/0022343311399130"", ""10.1002/ejsp.294"", ""10.1016/j.jmoneco.2004.04.001"", ""10.1007/s11127-006-9046-8"", ""10.1007/BF01718440"", ""10.1177/0886260505282885"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00343.x"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1177/0022343311398926"", ""10.1162/isec.2006.31.1.165"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000029"", ""10.1111/ajps.12494"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080246"", ""10.1017/S1049096503001665"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12033"", ""10.1111/joes.12060"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2007.12.011"", ""10.1177/0022343312445650"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2007.04.004"", ""10.1086/466909"", ""10.2307/1956010"", ""10.1111/kykl.12122"", ""10.1007/s00148-005-0036-9"", ""10.1007/s11127-011-9895-7"", ""10.1080/09636412.2018.1483615"", ""10.1177/0192512107088390"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00512.x"", ""10.1093/esr/jcy038"", ""10.1177/0146167217752118"", ""10.2307/j.ctt3fhbht"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2019.03.023"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edm012"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2010.06.003"", ""10.1017/S0043887114000148"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791451"", ""10.1177/0738894212456940"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2011.05.044"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2016.1202749"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12339"", ""10.1007/s11127-008-9361-3"", ""10.1086/386271"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2013.12.013"", ""10.1057/9780230616660"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1996.tb00674.x"", ""10.1080/09546550701246817"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12362"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1215614"", ""10.1515/zfsoz-2014-0402"", ""10.1177/0022002713478795"", ""10.1080/13504851.2016.1240329"", ""10.4324/9780203008690"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2019.102047"", ""10.1257/jel.20181444"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.03.015"", ""10.1080/03050629.2013.834256"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00784.x"", ""10.1111/caje.12469"", ""10.1177/0032321717725485"", ""10.1177/2053168018806391"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00054.x"", ""10.1177/1465116514534908"", ""10.1177/0022002710383664"", ""10.2307/146245""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S153759272000242X,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Strategic Discrimination,"Why are women and people of color under-represented in U.S. politics? I offer a new explanation: strategic discrimination. Strategic discrimination occurs when an individual hesitates to support a candidate out of concern thatotherswill object to the candidate’s identity. In a series of three experiments, I find that strategic discrimination exists, it matters for real-world politics, and it can be hard to overcome. The first experiment shows that Americans consider white male candidates more electable than equally qualified Black and white women, and to a lesser extent, Black men. These results are strongly intersectional, with Black women rated less electable than either Black men or white women. The second experiment demonstrates that anti-Trump voters weigh Democratic candidates’ racial and gender identities when deciding who is most capable of beating Donald Trump in 2020. The third experiment finds that while some messages intended to combat strategic discrimination have no effect, diverse candidates can increase their perceived electability by showing that they have a path to victory. I conclude by arguing that strategic discrimination is especially salient in contemporary U.S. politics due to three parallel trends: increasing diversity among candidates, growing awareness of sexism and racism, and high levels of political polarization.","[{""name"": ""Regina Bateson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0192512110388788"", ""10.1177/2053168018816228"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000217"", ""10.1017/rep.2015.2"", ""10.2307/2111542"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00484.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9414-8"", ""10.1080/21565503.2019.1633931"", ""10.1257/0002828042002561"", ""10.1017/S1537592719001397"", ""10.1080/00224490309552174"", ""10.1093/poq/nfh036"", ""10.1017/S1743923X13000391"", ""10.1002/1520-6696(198610)22:4<333::AID-JHBS2300220405>3.0.CO;2-X"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990752"", ""10.1086/691799"", ""10.1300/J014v19n02_03"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2013.776379"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199968275.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1065912918789289"", ""10.1080/21565503.2016.1208105"", ""10.1086/268331"", ""10.1017/S1743923X13000433"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000186"", ""10.1177/1065912916668412"", ""10.1515/bejeap-2014-0082"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316336007"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00236.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00637.x"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01508"", ""10.1037/h0094754"", ""10.1177/106591290105400111"", ""10.1086/268330"", ""10.1162/003355398555766"", ""10.1017/S002238160708005X"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199322428.001.0001"", ""10.7910/DVN/6FFKRI"", ""10.1086/268231"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.12.005"", ""10.1093/poq/nfm035"", ""10.1086/268843"", ""10.1080/17457289.2016.1270287"", ""10.1057/9780230303911"", ""10.7560/745643"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000837"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511778797"", ""10.1177/2053168018822174"", ""10.1177/1065912913498827"", ""10.1080/21565503.2017.1321995"", ""10.1017/S1537592707070065"", ""10.1080/21565503.2018.1557057"", ""10.1257/aer.99.2.323"", ""10.1086/704698"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.64.2.243"", ""10.1177/1097184X20901578"", ""10.1177/106591290505800202"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226041049.001.0001"", ""10.1080/21565503.2019.1632065"", ""10.1177/0146167294205011"", ""10.1023/B:POBE.0000022341.98720.9e"", ""10.1177/106591299304600304"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000321"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000868"", ""10.1017/S1743923X14000555"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.008"", ""10.1017/S153759271600298X""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It starts by defining solidarity in such a way that it can be distinguished from other types of support and pro-social practice, and by arguing that solidarity can manifest itself at three different levels: at the inter-personal level, the group level, or at the level of legal and contractual norms. Drawing upon findings from two ongoing studies on personal and societal effects of the COVID-19 crisis, I then go on to argue that, while forms of inter-personal solidarity have been shifting even during the first weeks and months of the crisis, the importance of institutionalized solidarity is becoming increasingly apparent. The most resilient societies in times of COVID-19 have not been those with the best medical technology or the strictest pandemic containment measures, but those with good public infrastructures and other solidaristic institutions.","[{""name"": ""Barbara Prainsack"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vienna, Austria, and King's College London, UK barbara.prainsack@univie.ac.at""]}]","[""10.15252/emmm.201606337"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717935.001.0001"", ""10.1023/A:1009463023119"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0199923"", ""10.15252/emmm.201606337"", ""10.1086/517900"", ""10.1086/517900"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0199923"", ""10.1017/9781139696593"", ""10.1017/9781139696593"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30893-X"", ""10.1080/15562948.2017.1288284"", ""10.1023/A:1009463023119"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490378"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717935.001.0001"", ""10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30085-2"", ""10.1080/15562948.2017.1288284"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490378"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30893-X"", ""10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30085-2"", ""10.1007/BF03391656"", ""10.1007/BF03391656""]",['Health Professions'],['General Health Professions'],"[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Second, Donald Trump and Barak Obama show the opposite result for the in‐degree centrality and follower analysis. The result shows that the topic‐based networks and the person‐based networks play a different role in social networks. This study demonstrates that the presidents, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices, the Centers for Disease Control, and news channels play a crucial role in the news of COVID‐19 for people. Key players, such as Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and BBC, are located in the central networks. In contrast, U.S. news channels and WHO and its regional offices have independent channels.ConclusionsGovernments should understand the characteristics of public key players to provide information for COVID‐19 in a timely manner.","[{""name"": ""Seungil Yum"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Florida""]}]","[""10.1109/CSE.2009.120"", ""10.1126/science.345.6193.148-a"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811395"", ""10.1017/9781108565691"", ""10.1177/016555150202800601"", ""10.1155/2014/502809""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muz041,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Prosocial Behaviors: A Matter of Altruism or Public Service Motivation?,"AbstractIn recent years, public service motivation (PSM) research has grown substantially, but is still largely limited to the field of public administration. To be able to export the theory and measures of PSM to other disciplines, we need more conceptual clarity. Some suggest PSM is analogous to altruism, whereas others warn not to confound the two concepts. Is PSM separate from altruism? How does each motivational construct relate to prosocial behaviors? We use a nationally representative panel of respondents to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) to measure both altruism and PSM among respondents before the 2016 election and measure respondents’ participation in prosocial behaviors after the 2016 election. Using linear probability models with state fixed effects, we find that although PSM and altruism predict prosocial behaviors separately, altruism has no effect after controlling for PSM. PSM is a more consistent predictor of some prosocial behaviors than altruism, particularly in more formal contexts such as volunteering with an organization.","[{""name"": ""Jaclyn S Piatak"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Carolina at Charlotte""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen B Holt"", ""affiliation"": [""University at Albany, SUNY""]}]","[""10.2307/2234133"", ""10.1002/per.417"", ""10.1177/1088868306294907"", ""10.1177/1088868314523838"", ""10.1177/0146167294205016"", ""10.4324/9781315808048"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.05.052"", ""10.1111/puar.12248"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024390"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.972481"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq085"", ""10.20899/jpna.3.1.23-39"", ""10.1177/0275074008327512"", ""10.1177/0021886391273003"", ""10.1177/0899764096253006"", ""10.1177/0734371X07309523"", ""10.1177/0734371X10394405"", ""10.7249/CB156"", ""10.1177/0899764012459254"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu020"", ""10.2224/sbp.2007.35.1.101"", ""10.2307/3235246"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.48.1.26"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.93.1.48"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.2009.00405.x"", ""10.1086/210468"", ""10.1111/puar.12906"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1470120"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui028"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199234035.003.0010"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1111/padm.12163"", ""10.56021/9780801852756"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus039"", ""10.1016/S1053-5357(99)00045-1"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199234035.003.0003"", ""10.1006/drev.1994.1006"", ""10.1207/s15327906mbr3902_8"", ""10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.182"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02305.x"", ""10.1002/nml.21060"", ""10.1093/0199266999.001.0001"", ""10.1016/0191-8869(85)90008-X"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus057"", ""10.1515/9781400821921"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM0904_8"", ""10.1177/0734371X9901900402"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv048"", ""10.1080/10967490801887947"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024303"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024345"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199234035.003.0001"", ""10.1111/puar.12430"", ""10.2307/976618"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00881.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu013"", ""10.1108/IJM-12-2014-0248"", ""10.1177/0899764016628295"", ""10.1177/0899764018794907"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024401"", ""10.1111/puar.12505"", ""10.2307/976330"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2006.00036.x"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2017.02.006"", ""10.1177/089976408101000105"", ""10.1111/padm.12136"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55269-3_13"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw027"", ""10.1108/PR-01-2015-0012"", ""10.1111/puar.12155"", ""10.1177/0091026013495773"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02310.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02197.x"", ""10.1080/10967494.2013.817242"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2009.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2010.11.010""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The competition is an annual comparative evaluation of fully automatic software verifiers for C and Java programs. The objective is to provide an overview of the state of the art in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of software verification, establish standards, provide a platform for exchange to developers of such tools, educate PhD students on reproducibility approaches and benchmarking, and provide computing resources to developers that do not have access to compute clusters. The competition consisted of 15 648 verification tasks for C programs and 586 verification tasks for Java programs. Each verification task consisted of a program and a property (reachability, memory safety, overflows, termination). The new category on data-race detection was introduced as demonstration category. SV-COMP 2022 had 47 participating verification systems from 33 teams from 11 countries.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_27"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00121"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_25"", ""10.1134/S0361768820080022"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_33"", ""10.1609/aaai.v31i1.10641"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_38"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_43"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-71500-7_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_18"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5831008"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5831003"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5838498"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5959149"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_22"", ""10.1145/2049697.2049700"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_22"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985839"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33826-7_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48869-1_5"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00619-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27940-9_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15"", ""10.1007/s10009-015-0407-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_7"", ""10.1007/s10817-019-09535-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49052-6"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00617-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_29"", ""10.1145/3478536"", ""10.1145/3332466.3374529"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02508-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02508-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_22"", ""10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774672"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_44"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_24"", ""10.1145/1889997.1890000"", ""10.1007/s10515-013-0122-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_7"", ""10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_28"", ""10.5281/zenodo.6147218"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_27"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409734"", ""10.1007/s10817-016-9389-x"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102257"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_23"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970337"", ""10.15514/ISPRAS-2017-29(4)-13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_3"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5720267"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-09284-3_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_36"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_34""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1017/S1537592721001985,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,New Directions in Rebel Governance Research,"Day to day governance of civilians is not solely the purview of states. Rulemaking, rule-enforcing, and goods and services provision are central components of governance, yet in many instances it is non-state actors who assume these functions. We advance the study of governance by rebel groups engaged in armed confrontation against state governments. We identify five key areas of research where the field of rebel governance is best poised to go: the study of multi-level governance, rebel use of self-constraining or hand-tying behaviors, synergy between institutional form and domestic legitimacy, the nuanced role of territorial control in governance, and short- and longer-term impacts of rebel governance on post-conflict outcomes. In each area, we draw attention to the lessons already learned, interrogate key assumptions in existing work, raise arguments that remain under- or uninvestigated, and focus on the next frontier in the exploration of rebel governance.

10.1093/cjip/poz019,CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Narrating the China Threat: Securitising Chinese Economic Presence in Europe,"Abstract This article unpacks the discursive construction of a European ‘China Threat’ narrative by European think tanks. We theorise think tanks as crucial actors in the securitising process, especially at the initial stages where ideas and reference frames are formed. Despite having no decision-making authority, think tanks participate as securitising actors in the process of idea formation and bidding, articulating a securitised frame of reference for policy makers. In the case of EU–China relations, we observe an emerging congruence between think tanks and policy makers that engage in a non-linear construction of a ‘China Threat’ policy frame. In this article, we review key think tank reports that are circulated through official EU policy channels and deconstruct the assumptions behind the ‘China Threat’ discourse. We first argue that, analytically, their securitising attempt is characterised by a distorted representation of Chinese economic activities abroad, including those falling under the Belt and Road Initiative. Second, politically, this narrative produces a distorted notion of European politics where pluralism is weakness and disagreement dissent, promoting a view of the EU where ‘responsible’ core countries must contain the periphery’s ‘opportunism’. Third, we contend that despite defending ‘Europeanness’ as the epitome of human rights and democracy, the securitisation of Chinese FDI rests on othering practices that risk undermining those very ideals. By identifying the problematic undertones of this securitising effort, we call for a fact-based and pluralistic debate on the challenges of Chinese investment and financing for European economies and societies.","[{""name"": ""Igor Rogelja"", ""affiliation"": [""Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute and a Teaching Fellow at the Lau China Institute, King’s College London""]}, {""name"": ""Konstantinos Tsimonis"", ""affiliation"": [""Lecturer in Chinese Society at the Lau China Institute, King’s College London""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

As a lens for exploring this changing electoral landscape, this article focuses on the growing share of the electorate that is cross-pressured between conservative and progressive attitudes on economic and cultural issues. It argues that a stable asymmetry characterizes Western European mass attitudes: while support for the left is common among voters with progressive attitudes on both issues, it is enough to be conservative on one issue to turn right. Analyzing survey data collected from 1990 to 2017, the study shows that cross-pressures are resolved in favor of the right and examines the trade-offs this poses to center-right parties. These findings contribute to debates on electoral dealignment and realignment and shed light on the electoral choices of the center-right.","[{""name"": ""Noam Gidron"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/ap.2014.28"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245.009"", ""10.1177/0263395718754718"", ""10.1177/1354068814549345"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.07.001"", ""10.1177/0010414013516066"", ""10.4324/9780203079546"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12319"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00235.x"", ""10.2307/3088437"", ""10.1017/psrm.2013.4"", ""10.1086/676042"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00778.x"", ""10.1080/00344893.2012.653229"", ""10.2307/2089536"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080210"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1181871"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12130"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp067"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.021406.172506"", ""10.1080/13501760701847655"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190626594.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.02.001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12165"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grj022"", ""10.1257/jep.20.2.97"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00841.x"", ""10.1080/09644008.2013.794452"", ""10.1177/0010414007313114"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199599233.003.0005"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.08.015"", ""10.1086/680040"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000404"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199599233.003.0004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614712"", ""10.1080/01402380312331280598"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1981.tb01327.x"", ""10.1177/1465116511434788"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000072"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01922.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12348"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000435"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-090717-092750"", ""10.1561/100.00000010"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.818354"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1086/692126"", ""10.1007/s11109-014-9272-6"", ""10.2307/j.ctvnjbgwt"", ""10.1177/2041905818815189"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000228"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139094009"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00243.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

This relationship is not explained by contemporary attitudes, the location of the camps, geographic sorting, the economic impact of the camps, or their current use. We argue that cognitive dissonance led those more directly exposed to Nazi institutions to conform with the belief system of the regime. These attitudes were then transmitted across generations. The evidence provided here contributes both to our understanding of the legacies of historical institutions and the sources of political intolerance.","[{""name"": ""JONATHAN HOMOLA"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MIGUEL M.

10.1111/ajps.12624,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Ideological Asymmetries and the Determinants of Politically Motivated Reasoning,"AbstractA large literature demonstrates that conservatives have greater needs for certainty than liberals. This suggests an asymmetry hypothesis: Conservatives are less open to new information that conflicts with their political identity and, in turn, political accountability will be lower on the right than the left. However, recent work suggests that liberals and conservatives are equally prone to politically motivated reasoning (PMR). The present article confronts this puzzle. First, we identify significant limitations of extant studies evaluating the asymmetry hypothesis and deploy two national survey experiments to address them. Second, we provide the first direct test of the key theoretical claim underpinning the asymmetry hypothesis: epistemic needs for certainty promote PMR. We find little evidence for the asymmetry hypothesis. Importantly, however, we also find no evidence that epistemic needs promote PMR. That is, although conservatives report greater needs for certainty than liberals, these needs are not a major source of political bias.","[{""name"": ""Brian Guay"", ""affiliation"": [""Massachusetts Institute of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher D.

10.1017/S0003055422000880,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Elements of External Validity: Framework, Design, and Analysis","The external validity of causal findings is a focus of long-standing debates in the social sciences. Although the issue has been extensively studied at the conceptual level, in practice few empirical studies include an explicit analysis that is directed toward externally valid inferences. In this article, we make three contributions to improve empirical approaches for external validity. First, we propose a formal framework that encompasses four dimensions of external validity: $ X $-, $ T $-, $ Y $-, and C-validity (populations, treatments, outcomes, and contexts). The proposed framework synthesizes diverse external validity concerns. We then distinguish two goals of generalization. To conduct effect-generalization—generalizing the magnitude of causal effects—we introduce three estimators of the target population causal effects. For sign-generalization—generalizing the direction of causal effects—we propose a novel multiple-testing procedure under weaker assumptions. We illustrate our methods through field, survey, and lab experiments as well as observational studies.","[{""name"": ""NAOKI EGAMI"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ERIN HARTMAN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S000305541800076X"", ""10.7910/DVN/3EKRSI"", ""10.3102/1076998612441947"", ""10.1126/science.aad9713"", ""10.1111/ajps.12432"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00984.x"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aaw2612"", ""10.1214/ss/1032280304"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.1086/691280"", ""10.1214/19-AOS1929"", ""10.1093/aje/kwy228"", ""10.1073/pnas.1808083115"", ""10.1111/rssa.12094"", ""10.1111/rssa.12734"", ""10.1017/bpp.2018.25"", ""10.1037/h0037350"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-041719-102556"", ""10.1080/19345747.2015.1060282"", ""10.1080/07350015.2019.1639407"", ""10.1080/01621459.1994.10476818"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511762888"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.1"", ""10.1093/aje/kwq084"", ""10.1080/01621459.1996.10476902"", ""10.1111/j.1467-985X.2007.00527.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1510507113"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.12.005"", ""10.1111/biom.13009""]",['Mathematics'],['Statistics and Probability'],"[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"
10.1017/S0003055421000940,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Effective for Whom? Ethnic Identity and Nonviolent Resistance,"A growing literature finds that nonviolence is more successful than violence in effecting political change. We suggest that a focus on this association is incomplete, because it obscures the crucial influence of ethnic identity on campaign outcomes. We argue that because of prevalent negative stereotypes associating minority ethnic groups with violence, such groups are perceived as more violent even when resisting nonviolently, increasing support for their repression and ultimately hampering campaign success. We show that, cross-nationally, the effect of nonviolence on outcomes is significantly moderated by ethnicity, with nonviolence increasing success only for dominant groups. We then test our argument using two experiments in the United States and Israel. Study 1 finds that nonviolent resistance by ethnic minorities is perceived as more violent and requiring more policing than identical resistance by majorities. Study 2 replicates and extends the results, leveraging the wave of racial justice protests across the US in June 2020 to find that white participants are perceived as less violent than Black participants when protesting for the same goals. These findings highlight the importance of ethnic identity in shaping campaign perceptions and outcomes, underscoring the obstacles that widespread biases pose to nonviolent mobilization.","[{""name"": ""DEVORAH MANEKIN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""TAMAR MITTS"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0022002715591215"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053315"", ""10.1080/09636412.2020.1722854"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000039"", ""10.4324/9780429467783-8"", ""10.1093/socpro/spu002"", ""10.1525/sp.2004.51.3.305"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.876"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00117.x"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.49"", ""10.1037/pspi0000230"", ""10.1177/0003122410395370"", ""10.1111/pops.12383"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp080"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.77"", ""10.1080/07418820802427825"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.09.012"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9152-7"", ""10.1177/019027250406700401"", ""10.1177/0022343313480381"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2012.00860.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.062906.070752"", ""10.1177/0022343312469979"", ""10.1080/01419870.2013.790984"", ""10.1080/21565503.2018.1518782"", ""10.1017/S1742058X04040081"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-72883-4_7"", ""10.15195/v4.a19"", ""10.1111/j.1745-9125.2012.00275.x"", ""10.1086/519823"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-76333-0_14"", ""10.1111/soin.12136"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139381277"", ""10.1257/jel.48.1.3"", ""10.1080/07418825.2017.1362461"", ""10.1080/09546553.2016.1233872"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy018"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000413"", ""10.1177/0022343313512853"", ""10.1177/2053168019877032"", ""10.1177/1354066109350049"", ""10.1111/j.1475-682X.2004.00097.x"", ""10.1177/0010414015621072"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199778201.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pan/mpu019"", ""10.1111/pops.12261"", ""10.1177/0022343312471551"", ""10.1080/03050629.2018.1500911"", ""10.7910/DVN/SHHVCA"", ""10.1177/0011128719839354"", ""10.1177/0022343318820575"", ""10.1017/pan.2016.15"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-20-4-415"", ""10.1111/1745-9125.12143"", ""10.2307/2082611"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.81.2.181"", ""10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00193.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-073018-022541"", ""10.4159/9780674088962"", ""10.31235/osf.io/ap46d"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-22-4-395"", ""10.1177/0022343313476530"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.34.4.590"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314"", ""10.1017/S000305542000009X"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000544"", ""10.2307/2669264"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2007.02.004"", ""10.1111/ajps.12103"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2016.1202749"", ""10.1177/0022002715576574"", ""10.1177/0022343318759411"", ""10.1177/0022022104270118"", ""10.1177/0022002717721390"", ""10.1080/21565503.2018.1438953"", ""10.1177/2378023118803189"", ""10.1017/S1537592717004273"", ""10.1177/0022343318820088"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-032015-010015"", ""10.1177/01461672952111002"", ""10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00020-9"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy016"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000388"", ""10.1017/S1537592713001059"", ""10.1111/j.1745-9125.2010.00203.x"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00270""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1111/psj.12388,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Does Entrepreneurship Work? Understanding What Policy Entrepreneurs Do and Whether It Matters(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras claves,"When a major policy change occurs, policy entrepreneurs—advocates who devote substantial time, energy, and resources to campaigning for a specific policy outcome—are often credited as critical influences. However, there has been a little quantitative, large‐n cross‐sectional study of whether policy entrepreneurship effectuates policy change, how policy entrepreneurs pursue their goals, and whether particular entrepreneur attributes are more or less facilitative to that end. This paper aims to fill that gap by investigating policy entrepreneurship in municipalities across the State of New York, where between 2008 and 2012 hundreds of local jurisdictions passed policies to ban or restrict high‐volume hydraulic fracturing (fracking), often encouraged by anti‐fracking advocates. It demonstrates that policy entrepreneurs have a consequential, positive impact on policy adoption; that their characteristics, strategies, and goals classify into distinct archetypes; and that archetypes vary in their policy impact.","[{""name"": ""Gwen Arnold"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/puar.12905"", ""10.1111/psj.12175"", ""10.1111/psj.12339"", ""10.1080/13876980902888103"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.83.3.377"", ""10.1111/ajph.12006"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2008.06.002"", ""10.1007/s10113-017-1139-z"", ""10.1080/03610917408548446"", ""10.1111/j.1528-3577.2004.00174.x"", ""10.1080/13501760600808964"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2010.00443.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2011.00547.x"", ""10.1002/9781394260645"", ""10.1177/0003122416663929"", ""10.3102/01623737028003259"", ""10.4155/cmt.11.37"", ""10.1177/106591299304600211"", ""10.5751/ES-03344-150225"", ""10.1093/heapro/dam009"", ""10.5751/ES-03488-150226"", ""10.1007/s10113-017-1154-0"", ""10.1177/153244000700700104"", ""10.1080/12264431.1996.10804874"", ""10.2307/3380990"", ""10.1177/009539979602800203"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00510.x"", ""10.1111/juaf.12094"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1sq5vhr"", ""10.1023/A:1015770705872"", ""10.1111/fpa.12018"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00325.x"", ""10.2307/2111674"", ""10.2307/2648004"", ""10.1080/13501763.2012.761514"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00329.x"", ""10.1080/10361146.2014.934657"", ""10.2307/2648004"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.054"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2008.00581.x"", ""10.5751/ES-10747-240226"", ""10.4159/9780674041660"", ""10.2307/41165207"", ""10.4135/9781483345208"", ""10.1007/BF00136406"", ""10.2307/1964135"", ""10.2307/2131997"", ""10.1177/004208169302900207"", ""10.2458/v21i1.21136"", ""10.2307/977380"", ""10.1017/S1068280500010261"", ""10.1177/1532673X9101900207"", ""10.1016/S0019-8501(02)00229-8"", ""10.2478/itms-2013-0013"", ""10.1017/S1068280500010273""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Public Administration']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

While the large majority of individuals do not hold consistent opinions on climate issues, we argue that the experience of natural disasters can prime voters on climate change and affect political behavior. Using micro-level geospatial data on natural disasters, we exploit referendum votes in Switzerland, which allows us to obtain a behavioral rather than attitudinal measure of support for policies tackling climate change. Our findings indicate a sizeable effect for pro-climate voting after experiencing a flood: vote-share supporting pro-climate policies can increase by 20 percent.

10.1093/isr/viab029,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Consequences of Economic Sanctions: The State of the Art and Paths Forward,"Abstract What determines the consequences of economic sanctions? Is there a common explanation for these consequences? This article provides a comprehensive review of the fragmented literature focusing on the consequences of sanctions. We critically discuss the complex relationships between types of sanctions and sanction senders and their targets, as well as the structural factors that account for the specific consequences of different sanction cases. A discussion on the thematic, methodological, and theoretical shortcomings of the existing literature on sanction consequences follows. We argue that a “common approach” to sanction consequences research should be framed within the framework of international interdependence. We also present several nascent trends and propose new directions for sanction researchers and other disciplines.","[{""name"": ""Özgür Özdamar"", ""affiliation"": [""Bilkent University, Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Evgeniia Shahin"", ""affiliation"": [""Bilkent University, Turkey""]}]","[""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.03.015"", ""10.1177/0022002708325044"", ""10.1177/0022343312456224"", ""10.2307/20048030"", ""10.1016/j.ribaf.2017.01.005"", ""10.1080/00396338.2016.1186981"", ""10.1017/S002081831500017X"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9361.2006.00335.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.1983.tb00037.x"", ""10.1093/epolic/eix001"", ""10.1177/002070201006500107"", ""10.1177/0022343317752539"", ""10.1017/S0020818311000117"", ""10.1111/j.1813-6982.1987.tb00150.x"", ""10.1080/10361140802429221"", ""10.1080/714005349"", ""10.1017/S0260210598000692"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7287.2000.tb00012.x"", ""10.1016/j.eap.2016.08.006"", ""10.1080/03050629.2013.768478"", ""10.1017/9781108227346.004"", ""10.1111/j.1813-6982.1989.tb00174.x"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2013.01.001"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1221679"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-25016-5"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-25016-5"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2015.12.010"", ""10.1162/002081800551127"", ""10.1080/03050629.2015.1041297"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2006.00033.x"", ""10.1177/1354066112448200"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.01523.x"", ""10.1177/0022002711420961"", ""10.1177/002070201006500106"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316460290.009"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316460290.010"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12451"", ""10.1177/0022343309356489"", ""10.1177/0010414011427883"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00590.x"", ""10.1108/JES-05-2016-0101"", ""10.1111/1467-9485.00248"", ""10.1111/1467-9701.00264"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00351"", ""10.1177/0020702014521561"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2020.103561"", ""10.1016/0022-5428(93)90038-Q"", ""10.2307/2009785"", ""10.1023/A:1013061708807"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2017.06.008"", ""10.1017/S0892679411000323"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12065"", ""10.1016/j.ruje.2016.02.002"", ""10.1080/00220388.2020.1746277"", ""10.1093/epolic/eix002"", ""10.1080/10242694.2016.1245811"", ""10.1080/09557571.2016.1230591"", ""10.1017/S0260210502000396"", ""10.1177/0022002715603453"", ""10.1080/09557571.2016.1237472"", ""10.1016/S0304-3878(02)00009-3"", ""10.1080/00396338.2014.962797"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198749325.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2014.12.011"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027661"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7287.1988.tb00552.x"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2014.04.006"", ""10.1080/09636419708429314"", ""10.1046/j.1468-2508.2004.00140.x"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1301977"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00761.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00259.x"", ""10.1080/09557571.2016.1166479"", ""10.1016/j.soscij.2016.11.005"", ""10.1177/0967010600031003003"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00142.x"", ""10.1177/0095327X16631095"", ""10.1177/0738894216635023"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000613"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000216"", ""10.1002/soej.12031"", ""10.1080/09662839.2014.893427"", ""10.1177/0738894213520379"", ""10.1080/03050629508434868"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2014.12.018"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2015.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.03.005"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.68.036122"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2014.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.ribaf.2016.07.009"", ""10.1162/isec.22.2.90"", ""10.1080/0163660X.2014.978444"", ""10.1086/691793"", ""10.1177/002070209605100303"", ""10.1177/0022343308098404"", ""10.1177/0192512110372610"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2011.00136.x"", ""10.1080/10242694.2014.920219"", ""10.1080/03050629.2010.502436"", ""10.1177/0022343314563636"", ""10.1111/isqu.12017"", ""10.1177/0738894213503432"", ""10.1177/0022002710393915"", ""10.1177/0738894218797024"", ""10.1177/0022002715596777"", ""10.1057/9781137526021_6"", ""10.1186/s12992-016-0168-6"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2015.08.012"", ""10.1177/0192512115590203"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1660857"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2007.01026.x"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12453"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.1995.tb00223.x"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1242584"", ""10.14254/2071-8330.2018/11-1/1"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027703"", ""10.1002/polq.12251"", ""10.1080/03050629.2018.1388234"", ""10.1177/0022343399036005001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00668.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.00512.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2004.00640.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2009.01190.x""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)]]"

Early work, motivated by ongoing conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, tended to portray these forms of violence as inevitable, ubiquitous, and either opportunistic or strategic. However, recent literature and new data sources have documented substantial variation in sexual violence across countries, conflicts, perpetrators, and victims and survivors. Building on this observed variation, scholars have developed and tested a wealth of theories about when, where, why, and under what conditions sexual violence occurs as well as its consequences. We highlight the core findings from the literature, explain the key debates among experts, and explore several avenues for future research. We conclude by detailing what the study of wartime sexual violence—both the findings and the research process—offers to a broader set of political science scholars.","[{""name"": ""Ragnhild Nordås"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA; and Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO);""]}, {""name"": ""Dara Kay Cohen"", ""affiliation"": [""John F.

Major powers such as the People's Republic of China, Russia and the USA, who are fierce rivals in other domains, form lasting alliances. Three of the most relevant case examples are the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN) community, the International Thermonuclear Experiential Reactor (ITER) nuclear fusion project community and the International Space Station (ISS) community. Beyond Gridlock theory identifies eight pathways through and beyond gridlock and their mechanisms. It is through the combination of these pathways that international collaborations can be initiated, maintained and delivered. Extensive field work in each of the three case study communities reveal winning combinations of pathways for Big Science collaborations. Shifts in major powers’ core interests and multiple, diverse organisations and institutions coalescing around common goals emerge as the two core pathways. They are supported in their implementation by two enabling pathways: innovative leadership and innovative funding. The relationship between all four provides clues on mechanisms that can be used to good effect in other international relations domains that are caught up in the debilitating global gridlock phenomenon.","[{""name"": ""Mark Robinson"", ""affiliation"": [""SOAS – Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy""]}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.2431956"", ""10.2307/2620595"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-32738-9"", ""10.1515/9781400820269"", ""10.1109/SOFE.2015.7482278"", ""10.1126/science.134.3473.161""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Astronomy and Astrophysics']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)]]"
10.1093/isq/sqaa047,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Backlash and Judicial Restraint: Evidence from the European Court of Human Rights,"AbstractHow does backlash from consolidated democracies affect the behavior of liberal international institutions? We argue that liberal international institutions have incentives to appease their democratic critics. Liberal institutions rely on democratic support for their continued effectiveness and can accommodate democratic critics at a lower legitimacy cost than non-democratic challengers. We examine this theory in the context of the European Court of Human Rights using a new dataset of rulings until 2019 and a coding of government positions during multiple reform conferences. Combining matching and a difference-in-differences design, we find strong evidence that the Court exercises restraint towards consolidated democracies that have criticized the Court in multilateral reform conferences by rendering fewer violation judgments against these states. We find some evidence that governments have also recently appointed more deferential judges. The findings suggest that backlash can affect liberal international institutions even without membership exit.","[{""name"": ""Øyvind Stiansen"", ""affiliation"": [""PluriCourts, University of Oslo""]}, {""name"": ""Erik Voeten"", ""affiliation"": [""PluriCourts, University of Oslo and Georgetown University""]}]","[""10.1093/isq/sqz032"", ""10.1162/002081898550572"", ""10.1177/1354066107087769"", ""10.1093/ejil/chw019"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi010"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00260.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199207992.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1488880"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000020"", ""10.2307/2111585"", ""10.1353/hrq.2013.0057"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080350"", ""10.1017/S002238160809004X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491924"", ""10.1080/00344893.2013.830484"", ""10.1111/lasr.12236"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00411.x"", ""10.7591/9781501722646"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09353-1"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1488881"", ""10.1093/hrlr/ngv020"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00318"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000202"", ""10.1017/ajil.2017.23"", ""10.1111/lest.12025"", ""10.1177/1354066112448201"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9833.2009.01472.x"", ""10.2307/2111621"", ""10.1017/S0020589319000460"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00580.x"", ""10.1093/hrlr/ngs034"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000435"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080247"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000270"", ""10.2307/797642"", ""10.2307/1123662"", ""10.1017/9781108751551.011"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000398"", ""10.1093/ejil/chaa071"", ""10.1093/jhuman/hup018"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139628747"", ""10.1177/1354066113508591"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl013"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1225785"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr013"", ""10.1177/0010414001034006002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199535262.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pan/mpj004"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000047"", ""10.1515/til-2013-022"", ""10.1017/S0007123411000433"", ""10.1111/hojo.12075"", ""10.1093/jnlids/idx016"", ""10.1017/S1744552318000022"", ""10.1017/S1574019610100029"", ""10.1093/pan/10.2.134"", ""10.18637/jss.v042.i09"", ""10.1162/002081800551163"", ""10.1093/hrlr/ngv002"", ""10.1093/pa/gsr071"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-063806"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000276"", ""10.1162/002081802760199872"", ""10.1162/002081897550311"", ""10.1017/9781780685175"", ""10.4337/9781788112338.00021"", ""10.2307/1962405"", ""10.1093/hrlr/ngv046"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1017/S1744552318000058"", ""10.1093/hrlr/ngy015"", ""10.1080/13642987.2019.1593153"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000292"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000019"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9330-7"", ""10.1017/S2071832200017569"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070233"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080398"", ""10.1515/til-2013-021"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-29587-4_1"", ""10.9783/9780812295153"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000489""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management', 'Law']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Gender Politics, Europeanization, and the Democratic Deficit","AbstractThis article explores the dynamics of antigender mobilization in Poland and shows how gender equality projects are interconnected with the rise of opponents of “gender ideology.” It highlights material and discursive links between the local implementation of gender mainstreaming and the antigenderist backlash. The article points out that particular gender equality policies in non-Western settings result from Europeanization and thus are marked by a significant democratic deficit—that is, they are promoted without engaging a wider audience and elude parliamentary control. The study shows that if gender equality projects, such as gender mainstreaming, are fostered by external international commitments and obscure bureaucratic measures, they may unintentionally provide the impetus for antigender mobilization. Indeed, gender wars are fueled not only by controversies over gender and LGBT equality but also by growing concerns about citizens’ control over the state and its policies. The article is data based, and by employing framing analysis, it provides an explanation of the recent political success of antigenderist campaigns, which take place in a world of reconfigured states and diminishing democracies.","[{""name"": ""Marta Rawłuszko"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198793373.001.0001"", ""10.1086/229213"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803185.027"", ""10.1177/1065912908327231"", ""10.1086/696691"", ""10.4324/9781315625744"", ""10.1093/sp/jxr020"", ""10.1080/15705850902899230"", ""10.1177/0048393107307663"", ""10.1353/jod.0.0149"", ""10.1086/701171"", ""10.4324/9781315625744-2"", ""10.1093/0199252092.003.0003"", ""10.1093/sp/jxi023"", ""10.1177/0267323105058253"", ""10.1093/0199252092.003.0002"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.611"", ""10.1080/13501760050086116"", ""10.1086/661728"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i3.1414"", ""10.1080/13501760010018331"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59277-0_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43533-6"", ""10.1093/0199252092.003.0013"", ""10.1057/9780230355378_7"", ""10.7494/human.2016.15.3.105"", ""10.1023/A:1021288101039"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x"", ""10.1177/1350506817752012""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

A large literature on retrospective voting in the United States finds that the president’s party is rewarded in presidential elections for strong economic performance and punished for weak performance. By contrast, there is no clear consensus about whether politicians are held accountable for the local economy at other levels of government, nor how voters react to the economy in a complex system of multilevel responsibility. In this study, we use administrative data on county-level economic conditions from 1969 to 2018 and election results across multiple levels of government to examine the effect of the local economy on elections for local, state, and federal offices in the United States. We find that the president’s party is held accountable for economic performance across nearly all levels of government. We also find that incumbents are held accountable for the economy in U.S. House and gubernatorial elections. Our findings have broad implications for literatures on representation, accountability, and elections.","[{""name"": ""JUSTIN DE BENEDICTIS-KESSNER"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""CHRISTOPHER WARSHAW"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226012773.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2586302"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2010.01.003"", ""10.1177/106591299504800108"", ""10.1177/1532673X9502300104"", ""10.1177/004478082010004001"", ""10.1086/692588"", ""10.1177/0002716216662454"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000029"", ""10.1111/1468-0343.00045"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.11.014"", ""10.1007/BF00124924"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00603.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000965"", ""10.1177/106591299504800203"", ""10.1093/poq/nfh003"", ""10.2307/1924969"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000598"", ""10.2307/2131102"", ""10.7910/DVN/3WZFK9"", ""10.3886/ICPSR08907.v5"", ""10.1089/elj.2009.0049"", ""10.2307/2991738"", ""10.1086/322847"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000377"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-032211-212920"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226530406.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.1086/681591"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674497764"", ""10.1086/699244"", ""10.1086/685088"", ""10.1086/692669"", ""10.1111/j.0022-3816.2004.00299.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000649"", ""10.1111/ajps.12349"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi014"", ""10.3886/ICPSR00013.v2"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000046"", ""10.1017/psrm.2016.54"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.11.001"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.183"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070323"", ""10.1177/1078087415589191"", ""10.1086/652903"", ""10.1111/ajps.12053"", ""10.1111/ecpo.12040"", ""10.2307/2111027"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9453-9"", ""10.1086/686308"", ""10.2307/2083077"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.09.002"", ""10.1017/S0007123406000275"", ""10.1086/692785"", ""10.2307/2131418"", ""10.1177/1532673X8701500403"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000159"", ""10.1017/psrm.2017.44"", ""10.2307/1962406"", ""10.1515/9780691219417"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-071108"", ""10.2307/2110623"", ""10.1086/679749"", ""10.1086/706458"", ""10.2307/2111664"", ""10.3998/mpub.11800"", ""10.1086/265426"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000264"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000330"", ""10.2307/2111314"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139175104.003"", ""10.2202/1540-8884.1286"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.02.002"", ""10.2307/1911408"", ""10.1177/1532673X8001800203"", ""10.2202/1538-0653.1285"", ""10.2307/1958062"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00613.x"", ""10.1017/S000305541400063X"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.032808.150414"", ""10.2307/1955049"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy051"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-031710-103823""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Despite this centenary, it has only been relatively recently that scholars have examined questions of: (1) how diverse, equitable, and inclusive the field is; (2) how oppressive administrative structures marginalize groups; and (3) what principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) mean globally. We seek to contribute to this conversation by reflecting on what is currently known about answers to these questions, especially from global perspectives.

10.1057/s41295-022-00277-6,COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Voices from the past: economic and political vulnerabilities in the making of next generation EU,"AbstractIn this article, we show that Next Generation EU (NGEU) is mainly a response to the economic and political imbalances left over from the Eurozone crisis. It is a pre-emptive intervention, especially targeted at structurally weak economies with rising Euroscepticism, to avoid costly ex-post bailouts as in the Great Recession. We demonstrate, using quantitative analysis, that pre-existing vulnerabilities, rather than the impact of the pandemic, drove the allocation of NGEU resources: per capita grants largely correspond to past economic vulnerabilities, as well as to political ones. Countries most vulnerable to another adjustment by austerity after the COVID-19 economic crisis receive most resources. Also, countries with strong anti-EU sentiments are entitled to larger NGEU grants per capita. In contrast, grants are not correlated with the severity of the health crisis. Then, we show the domestic relevance of economic and political vulnerabilities through qualitative case studies of national political debates and domestic positions on NGEU in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Despite its innovative traits, NGEU is a politically constrained solution to address the mess from the previous decade, and as such, it is a Janus solution: promising a fresh start, but haunted by the past.","[{""name"": ""Klaus Armingeon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caroline de la Porte"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elke Heins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stefano Sacchi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/indlaw/dws029"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv028"", ""10.31235/osf.io/atg8p"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12375"", ""10.1057/s41295-022-00278-5"", ""10.1007/s40812-020-00165-8"", ""10.1111/jcms.13083"", ""10.1057/cep.2014.39"", ""10.1111/spol.12709"", ""10.1057/cep.2014.43"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198714071.001.0001"", ""10.4232/1.13393"", ""10.4232/1.13708"", ""10.4232/1.13710"", ""10.1080/01402382.2021.1905328"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000409"", ""10.1080/13501763.2021.1954060"", ""10.1080/07036337.2021.1877690"", ""10.1111/jcms.12133"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1164744"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1852231"", ""10.1177/1465116518814338"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12190"", ""10.1007/s10272-021-0956-y"", ""10.1080/13501763.2021.1954067"", ""10.1057/cep.2014.42"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1853121"", ""10.1057/cep.2014.40"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198857013.001.0001"", ""10.1111/wusa.12290""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

However, the empirical literature still struggles to produce robust generalizations and cumulative knowledge that link contextual, situational and institutional design factors to processes and outcomes. We still have not mustered the broad and deep evidence base that will really help us sort fact from fiction and identify more and less productive approaches to collaboration. The current empirical evidence in the study of collaborative governance consists chiefly of small-N case studies or large-N surveys. The challenge is to move from case- based, mid- range theory building to more largeN- driven systematic theory- testing, while also retaining the rich contextual and process insights that only small-N studies tend to yield. This article, and the articles in the accompanying special issue, introduces an attempt to provide this middle ground – the Collaborative Governance Case Database. The database has been developed to serve as a free common pool resource for researchers to systematically collect and compare high- quality collaborative governance case studies. This article is an introduction to the database, exploring its design, opportunities and limitations. This article is also an invitation; inviting all researchers to freely use the cases in the database for their own research interest and to help strengthening the database by adding new cases there are eager to share with colleagues.","[{""name"": ""Scott Douglas"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht School of Governance, Bijlhouwerstraat 6, 3511 ZC, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Chris Ansell"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, UC Berkeley, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Charles F Parker"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government, Uppsala University, Uppsala  Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Eva Sørensen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department for Social Science and Business, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Paul ‘T Hart"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht School of Governance, Utrecht University, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Jacob Torfing"", ""affiliation"": [""Department for Social Science and Business, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark""]}]","[""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1332/policypress/9781447340553.001.0001"", ""10.1201/b18116"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00665.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12432"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1785726"", ""10.1515/9781400838103"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1769275"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1743526"", ""10.1057/9781137542182"", ""10.1111/puar.12765"", ""10.1111/padm.12161"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1767337"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01753.x"", ""10.1080/08941920.2017.1274208"", ""10.1353/book48834"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199596751.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1794749"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1769288""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

To evaluate data quality on MTurk, we fielded three surveys between 2018 and 2020. While we find no evidence of a “bot epidemic,” significant portions of the data—between 25 and 35 percent—are of dubious quality. While the number of IP addresses that completed the survey multiple times or circumvented location requirements fell almost 50 percent over time, suspicious IP addresses are more prevalent on MTurk than on other platforms. Furthermore, many respondents appear to respond humorously or insincerely, and this behavior increased over 200 percent from 2018 to 2020. Importantly, these low-quality responses attenuate observed treatment effects by magnitudes ranging from approximately 10 to 30 percent.","[{""name"": ""Douglas J.

The liberal teleology of transitional justice risks working to realize the self-supersessionist goal of replacing the colony with a ‘post-colonial’, settler/settled polity. Drawing on Indigenous scholars, decolonization is explored through refusal, resurgence and prefiguration. The article advances a counterfactual proposition: If transitional justice is radicalized it has the potential to contribute to decolonization through decentring the state, inter-nationalizing the justice relation, challenging the legitimacy of the settler regime and abandoning liberal teleology. The article argues for a decolonizing acceptance of indeterminacy and uncertainty.","[{""name"": ""Augustine S J Park"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'Building and Construction', 'Anthropology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

How does this influence global patterns of migration and democratization? Although control over citizen movement has long been central to autocratic power, modern autocracies vary considerably in how much they restrict emigration. This article shows that autocrats strategically choose emigration policy by balancing several motives. Increasing emigration can stabilize regimes by selecting a more loyal population and attracting greater investment, trade and remittances, but exposing their citizens to democracy abroad is potentially dangerous. Using a half-century of bilateral migration data, the study calculates the level and destinations of expected emigration given exogenous geographic and socioeconomic characteristics. It finds that when citizens disproportionately emigrate to democracies, countries are more likely to democratize – and that autocrats restrict emigration freedom in response. In contrast, a larger expected flow of economic emigration predicts autocratic survival and freer emigration policy.

Despite the centrality of this claim in the literature, empirical evidence is mixed. In this article, I argue that these mixed findings are—in part—because many Americans hold beliefs about women’s inclusion that are out of step with reality. Leveraging variation in survey respondents’ beliefs about women’s representation, I examine how these perceptions influence attitudes toward Congress and state legislatures. In both cases, I find that believing women are included is associated with higher levels of external efficacy among both men and women. Using panel data, I then show that when citizens’ underestimations (overestimations) are corrected, their levels of efficacy increase (decrease), shedding further light on this relationship. The findings presented in this research add new theoretical insights into when, and how, Americans consider descriptive representation when evaluating the institutions that represent them.","[{""name"": ""KATELYN E.

10.1017/pan.2019.48,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Profiling Compliers and Noncompliers for Instrumental-Variable Analysis,"Instrumental-variable (IV) estimation is an essential method for applied researchers across the social and behavioral sciences who analyze randomized control trials marred by noncompliance or leverage partially exogenous treatment variation in observational studies. The potential outcome framework is a popular model to motivate the assumptions underlying the identification of the local average treatment effect (LATE) and to stratify the sample into compliers, always-takers, and never-takers. However, applied research has thus far paid little attention to the characteristics of compliers and noncompliers. Yet, profiling compliers and noncompliers is necessary to understand what subpopulation the researcher is making inferences about and an important first step in evaluating the external validity (or lack thereof) of the LATE estimated for compliers. In this letter, we discuss the assumptions necessary for profiling, which are weaker than the assumptions necessary for identifying the LATE if the instrument is randomly assigned. We introduce a simple and general method to characterize compliers, always-takers, and never-takers in terms of their covariates and provide easy-to-use software in R and STATA that implements our estimator. We hope that our method and software facilitate the profiling of compliers and noncompliers as a standard practice accompanying any IV analysis.","[{""name"": ""Moritz Marbach"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominik Hangartner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00477.x"", ""10.1257/aer.20150355"", ""10.1093/qje/qju030"", ""10.2307/1905714"", ""10.1257/aer.20161503"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.1177/1532673X08328600"", ""10.1257/aer.20150479"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(02)00201-4"", ""10.3386/w14690"", ""10.1111/j.0006-341X.2002.00021.x"", ""10.3982/ECTA10266"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139084444"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv034"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2009.09.006"", ""10.7910/DVN/TRLTPY"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt013"", ""10.1080/01621459.1996.10476902"", ""10.1257/aer.20150592"", ""10.1257/jel.48.2.399"", ""10.1002/sim.6128"", ""10.1093/qje/qju019"", ""10.1257/aer.20151129"", ""10.1086/702946"", ""10.1086/690829""]",['Mathematics'],['Statistics and Probability'],"[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"

We specifically sought to assess the often assumed link between conspiracy beliefs and populist attitudes; moreover, we examined if populist attitudes predict conspiracy beliefs in particular, or rather, credulity of unsubstantiated epistemic claims in general. Study 1 revealed that populist attitudes are robustly associated with conspiracy mentality in a large multination study, drawing samples from 13 European Union (EU) countries. Studies 2 and 3 revealed that besides conspiracy beliefs, populist attitudes also predict increased credulity of obscure and politically neutral news items (regardless of whether they were broadcasted by mainstream or alternative news sources), receptivity to bullshit statements, and supernatural beliefs. Furthermore, Study 3 revealed that these findings were mediated by increased faith in intuition. These studies support the notion of populist gullibility: An increased tendency of people who score high on populist attitudes to accept obscure or unsubstantiated epistemic claims as true, including nonpolitical ones.","[{""name"": ""Jan‐Willem van Prooijen"", ""affiliation"": [""VU Amsterdam"", ""The Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR)"", ""Maastricht University""]}, {""name"": ""Talia Cohen Rodrigues"", ""affiliation"": [""Leiden University""]}, {""name"": ""Carlotta Bunzel"", ""affiliation"": [""VU Amsterdam""]}, {""name"": ""Oana Georgescu"", ""affiliation"": [""VU Amsterdam""]}, {""name"": ""Dániel Komáromy"", ""affiliation"": [""VU Amsterdam""]}, {""name"": ""André P.

In this article, we examine empirical data on the timing of policy responses from the Coronavirus Government Response Tracker to determine whether and how countries led by women reacted differently to the pandemic. Exploring the relationship between the gender of leaders and legislators and the timing of stay-at-home orders, school closures, and coordinated public information campaigns, we find no statistical evidence supporting popular claims in the media. However, we find some evidence that the level of gender equality in legislatures is related to school closures, a policy with clear gendered consequences. These conclusions are an important first step in understanding the potentially gendered nature of the crisis response and identifying new avenues for research.","[{""name"": ""Andrea S.

However, in this paper we argue that meritocracy is also a deeply elitist project. Firstly, we place Michael Young in context to show how his critique of meritocracy should be understood as a socialist vision to ameliorate class divides. Secondly, we show how economic inequality in the UK has not generated systematic resistance: in fact, inequality and belief in meritocracy have gone hand in hand. Thirdly, we argue that people see their own lives as meritocratic rather than ascribed, and that such values are deeply embedded in popular life.

10.1017/S104909652300063X,PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE & POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Measuring Democratic Backsliding,"ABSTRACTDespite the general narrative that the world is in a period of democratic decline, there have been surprisingly few empirical studies that assess whether this is systematically true. Most existing studies of global backsliding are based largely if not entirely on subjective indicators that rely on expert coder judgment. Our study surveys objective indicators of democracy (e.g., incumbent performance in elections) and finds little evidence of global democratic decline during the past decade. To explain the discrepancy in trends between expert-coded and objective indicators, we consider the role of coder bias and leaders strategically using more subtle undemocratic action. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the world is becoming less democratic exclusively in ways that require subjective judgment to detect, this claim is not justified by existing evidence.","[{""name"": ""Andrew T.

10.1093/ia/iiaa009,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Immature leadership: Donald Trump and the American presidency,"Abstract There has been a renaissance in the study of how the backgrounds of individual leaders affect foreign policy outcomes. Donald Trump's presidency highlights the limits of this approach. Trump's psychology is so unique, and so akin to that of a small child, that studying his background alone is insufficient to explain his decision-making. The evidence for this characterization of Trump's leadership comes not from his political opponents, but his allies, staffers and subordinates. Trump's lack of impulse control, short attention span and frequent temper tantrums have all undercut his effectiveness as president as compared to his predecessors. Nonetheless, the 45th president helps to clarify ongoing debates in American politics about the relative strength of the presidency as an institution. In particular, the powers of the presidency have become so enhanced that even comparatively weak and inexperienced leaders can execute dramatic policy shifts. The formal checks on presidential power, from the legislative, judicial and executive branches have all eroded. Similarly, the informal checks on the presidency had also degraded before Trump's inauguration. This article uses Trump's presidency—and his severe limitations as a decision-maker—to highlight the ways in which even a weak leader can affect change by holding a powerful office.","[{""name"": ""Daniel W Drezner"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1093/isq/sqaa019,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Illiberal Norm Diffusion: How Do Governments Learn to Restrict Nongovernmental Organizations?,"AbstractRecent decades have witnessed a global cascade of restrictive and repressive measures against nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We theorize that state learning from observing the regional environment, rather than NGO growth per se or domestic unrest, explains this rapid diffusion of restrictions. We develop and test two hypotheses: (1) states adopt NGO restrictions in response to nonarmed bottom-up threats in their regional environment (“learning from threats”); (2) states adopt NGO restrictions through imitation of the legislative behavior of other states in their regional environment (“learning from examples”). Using an original dataset on NGO restrictions in ninety-six countries over a period of twenty-five years (1992–2016), we test these hypotheses by means of negative binomial regression and survival analyses, using spatially weighted techniques. We find very limited evidence for learning from threats, but consistent evidence for learning from examples. We corroborate this finding through close textual comparison of laws adopted in the Middle East and Africa, showing legal provisions being taken over almost verbatim from one law into another. In our conclusion, we spell out the implications for the quality of democracy and for theories of transition to a postliberal order, as well as for policy-makers, lawyers, and civil-society practitioners.","[{""name"": ""Marlies Glasius"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam""]}, {""name"": ""Jelmer Schalk"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leiden""]}, {""name"": ""Meta De Lange"", ""affiliation"": [""Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences""]}]","[""10.1353/jod.2018.0032"", ""10.4135/9781412984195"", ""10.1080/09668130802292143"", ""10.1080/13569771003593904"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2615708"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000100"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.55"", ""10.1080/13510347.2012.641297"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.00499.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511814365"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0026"", ""10.1177/0003122415571582"", ""10.1177/0022002712468720"", ""10.1057/ap.2015.29"", ""10.1177/0899764017737384"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.02.001"", ""10.1177/0002716204272516"", ""10.1080/13510347.2012.641298"", ""10.1007/s11266-014-9531-5"", ""10.1177/0022343301038006006"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199599363.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00580.x"", ""10.1177/0022343307078942"", ""10.2307/797642"", ""10.1080/14747731.2011.621274"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7rjt2"", ""10.1177/1354066116681429"", ""10.1111/soc4.12007"", ""10.1017/S1537592713002107"", ""10.1353/sof.0.0167"", ""10.1080/09636412.2014.874205"", ""10.1080/17448689.2013.818767"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1479693"", ""10.1080/13510347.2012.641299"", ""10.1177/0022002710374715"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511617683"", ""10.1080/13510347.2012.641300"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0071"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755941.001"", ""10.1177/1354066114523655"", ""10.1177/0049124191019003003"", ""10.1080/13510347.2015.1095736"", ""10.1017/S002081830808003X"", ""10.1080/03050620903554614"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090146"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755941.008"", ""10.2307/20048274""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In general, quotas are followed by greater legislative attention to the interests and priorities of women as a group. Across cases, effects have been most pronounced on issues related to women's rights, public health, and poverty alleviation. Quotas can influence policy in two general ways: First, quotas may send cues to all officeholders, prompting broad changes in legislator behavior among both men and women. Second, quotas typically bring more women into legislatures, causing a shift in aggregate legislator preferences and increasing women's ability to collectively influence legislative decisions. Yet, the positive effects of quotas are not universal, and some research reveals instances in which quotas have led to limited policy changes or even to more gender-inegalitarian outcomes. I suggest several variables that may moderate the relationship between quota adoption and policy change, including underexplored dimensions of quota design.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Clayton"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, USA;""]}]","[""10.1080/14616742.2018.1543550"", ""10.1080/21565503.2020.1752441"", ""10.1177/1065912914525861"", ""10.1017/S1743923X06221019"", ""10.1017/S1743923X12000505"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316534281"", ""10.1086/708336"", ""10.1111/j.1478-9302.2012.00272.x"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2013.05.012"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1497"", ""10.1126/science.1212382"", ""10.1017/S0008423907070059"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199340101.003.0002"", ""10.1257/aer.20160080"", ""10.1257/pol.6.2.164"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.4"", ""10.2307/2647822"", ""10.2307/3088386"", ""10.1086/708645"", ""10.1017/S1743923X09000038"", ""10.1177/1065912918809493"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2011.00904.x"", ""10.1080/00344890802079573"", ""10.1177/0192512113507733"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00539.x"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2009.01279.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2004.00495.x"", ""10.1177/0010414014548104"", ""10.1017/9781108777919.033"", ""10.1177/0010414018758767"", ""10.1080/00344893.2014.951232"", ""10.1017/S1743923X16000453"", ""10.1111/ajps.12391"", ""10.1086/697251"", ""10.1017/S0007123403000164"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00372.x"", ""10.1080/00344890701363227"", ""10.1093/pa/gsn007"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000467"", ""10.1177/0010414018797954"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00158.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190491420.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230303911_4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199830091.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1743923X08000342"", ""10.1017/S1743923X07000025"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000053"", ""10.1093/parlij/55.1.19"", ""10.1353/sor.2002.0043"", ""10.2307/3647686"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2018.1506204"", ""10.1017/S1537592704040241"", ""10.1177/1866802X1300500105"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000226"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000293"", ""10.1111/isqu.12190"", ""10.5129/001041519X15647434969795"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053324"", ""10.1257/app.4.4.165"", ""10.1093/pa/gsw011"", ""10.1111/j.0022-3816.2004.00296.x"", ""10.1017/S1537592717002225"", ""10.1111/ajps.12511"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000960"", ""10.1017/S002238160808033X"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000824"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000382"", ""10.1515/9781626371255-008"", ""10.1080/00344890802079607"", ""10.2307/2647821"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.3.1287"", ""10.1017/S0022278X12000067"", ""10.1093/pa/gsv015"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000611"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000079"", ""10.1080/15544770903501384"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000182"", ""10.1111/lsq.12079"", ""10.1017/S1743923X1100033X"", ""10.1093/pa/gsq061"", ""10.2307/1960962"", ""10.1093/pa/gsw003"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00202.x"", ""10.3162/036298009787500330"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226772738.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226022963.001.0001"", ""10.1093/sf/sos169"", ""10.1300/J014v24n04_04"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2003.9971008"", ""10.1017/S0008423900009082"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316336014"", ""10.1177/0010414006297342"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190936198.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03057070500493795"", ""10.1177/0010414012437165"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2013.05.008"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.00031"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.123839"", ""10.1017/S1743923X16000167"", ""10.1017/S1743923X13000524"", ""10.1080/02589001.2011.539011"", ""10.1093/0198297556.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1065912908322411""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1093/ejil/chaa017,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science,Guiding Principles on Shared Responsibility in International Law,"Abstract It is common in international practice that several states and/or international organizations contribute together to the indivisible injury of a third party. Examples thereof are aplenty in relation to climate change and other environmental disasters, joint military activities and cooperative actions aimed at stemming migration. Such situations are hardly captured by the existing rules of the law of international responsibility. In particular, the work of the International Law Commission, which is widely considered to provide authoritative guidance for legal questions of international responsibility, has little to offer. As a result, it is often very difficult, according to the existing rules of the law of international responsibility, to share responsibility and apportion reparation between the states and/or international organizations that contribute together to the indivisible injury of a third party. The Guiding Principles on Shared Responsibility in International Law seek to provide guidance to judges, practitioners and researchers when confronted with legal questions of shared responsibility of states and international organizations for their contribution to an indivisible injury of third parties. The Guiding Principles identify the conditions of shared responsibility (including questions of multiple attribution of conduct), the consequences of shared responsibility (notably, the possibility of joint and several liability) and the modes of implementation of shared responsibility. The Guiding Principles are of an interpretive nature. They build on the existing rules of the law of international responsibility and sometimes offer novel interpretations thereof. They also expand on those existing rules, backed by authoritative practice and scholarship, to address complex questions of shared responsibility.","[{""name"": ""André Nollkaemper"", ""affiliation"": [""Amsterdam Center for International Law, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Jean d’Aspremont"", ""affiliation"": [""Sciences Po Law School, Paris, France; University of Manchester, United Kingdom""]}, {""name"": ""Christiane Ahlborn"", ""affiliation"": [""United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, New York, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Berenice Boutin"", ""affiliation"": [""Asser Institute, The Hague, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Nataša Nedeski"", ""affiliation"": [""Amsterdam Center for International Law, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Ilias Plakokefalos"", ""affiliation"": [""Athens Public International Law Center, University of Athens, Greece""]}]",[],"['Physics and Astronomy', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Astronomy and Astrophysics', 'Law']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000624,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Digital Authoritarianism and the Future of Human Rights,"AbstractHow will advances in digital technology affect the future of human rights and authoritarian rule? Media figures, public intellectuals, and scholars have debated this relationship for decades, with some arguing that new technologies facilitate mobilization against the state and others countering that the same technologies allow authoritarians to strengthen their grip on power. We address this issue by analyzing the first game-theoretic model that accounts for the dual effects of technology within the strategic context of preventive repression. Our game-theoretical analysis suggests that technological developments may not be detrimental to authoritarian control and may, in fact, strengthen authoritarian control by facilitating a wide range of human rights abuses. We show that technological innovation leads to greater levels of abuses to prevent opposition groups from mobilizing and increases the likelihood that authoritarians will succeed in preventing such mobilization. These results have broad implications for the human rights regime, democratization efforts, and the interpretation of recent declines in violent human rights abuses.","[{""name"": ""Tiberiu Dragu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yonatan Lupu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0007123413000203"", ""10.2307/2657651"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000075"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0018545"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1017/S000305541900025X"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000423"", ""10.1177/0951629807085819"", ""10.1177/0010414017730077"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199736416.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000727"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080143"", ""10.2307/2991732"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000635"", ""10.1177/0022343314563653"", ""10.1257/jep.31.1.117"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176040"", ""10.1017/S002238161300100X"", ""10.1111/ajps.12065"", ""10.1017/S1537592714003120"", ""10.1177/0022002713515406"", ""10.1353/jod.0.0190"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174916"", ""10.1086/428442"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000205"", ""10.1177/0022002709352462"", ""10.1017/S002081831300012X"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-25646-4"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.101405.143216"", ""10.1111/ajps.12509"", ""10.1086/683187"", ""10.1177/0022343314559624"", ""10.1111/ajps.12178"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000070"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-030810-110815"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000599"", ""10.1177/0022343314555782"", ""10.3982/ECTA14281"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000091"", ""10.5210/fm.v6i8.876"", ""10.1177/0022002712468720"", ""10.1111/ajps.12033"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000614"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139164887"", ""10.1177/0022002700044001006"", ""10.2307/20031707"", ""10.1561/100.00019002"", ""10.2307/20042281"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000014"", ""10.1177/0010414005282983"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000306"", ""10.1017/S0003055406062046"", ""10.1086/687589"", ""10.1561/100.00016129"", ""10.1177/0022002712468724"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0051"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000552"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190910976.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000623"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00441.x"", ""10.1177/0022002712449327"", ""10.3982/ECTA14392"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042114-014927""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This forum explores how existential assumptions rooted in relational logics provide a significantly distinct set of tools that drive us to re-orient how we perceive, interpret, and engage both similarity and difference. Taking their cues from cosmological commitments originating in the Andes, South Asia, East Asia, and the Middle East, the six contributions explore how our existential assumptions affect the ways in which we deal with difference as theorists, researchers, and teachers.

Specifically, this paper reports an empirical study which examines how the good work of servant leadership may lower employees’ exposure to workplace bullying, with compassion as a mediator and social cynicism beliefs (SCBs) as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were gathered from 337 essential health professionals working in various public and private health-care organisations in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Findings This study found that perceived servant leadership helps in lessening employee exposure to workplace bullying by strengthening their compassion. However, SCBs moderate the mediating role of compassion in employees’ perceptions of the servant leadership–bullying relationship. Research limitations/implications This study has implications in developing models of leadership to build employees’ empathetic resources to combat workplace bullying. The authors found that servant leadership and workplace compassion, embodying positive, ethical and sustainable attributes, play a crucial role in managing bullying at work by promoting relational dignity. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that examines the relationships between employee perceptions of servant leadership, workplace bullying and employee compassion while considering SCBs as a boundary condition.","[{""name"": ""Saima Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Talat Islam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Premilla D'Cruz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ernesto Noronha"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.emj.2018.01.003"", ""10.1080/15555240.2017.1325327"", ""10.1007/978-981-16-2362-2_4"", ""10.1108/PR-06-2020-0470"", ""10.1108/JGR-04-2019-0038"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0621-z"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2019.100705"", ""10.1007/BF02723327"", ""10.1002/job.1847"", ""10.1177/0022022104268388"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2005.03.002"", ""10.1108/k-10-2021-0987"", ""10.1108/GKMC-06-2021-0109"", ""10.1177/1094428107300343"", ""10.1007/BF02310555"", ""10.1007/s42380-020-00062-7"", ""10.1108/01425451011010078"", ""10.1007/978-981-16-2362-2_2"", ""10.1007/978-981-16-2362-2_1"", ""10.1108/ER-06-2015-0116"", ""10.1515/9781503625969-006"", ""10.1080/02678370902815673"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2018.07.004"", ""10.3758/BRM.41.4.1149"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.4135/9781848608030.n31"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04509-1"", ""10.2753/ATP1084-1806320102"", ""10.1108/JMD-03-2018-0098"", ""10.1108/IJOEM-08-2021-1194"", ""10.1108/JWL-11-2021-0144"", ""10.1108/JMD-01-2017-0039"", ""10.1007/s11846-022-00547-3"", ""10.1108/LHS-02-2017-0006"", ""10.1108/GKMC-12-2020-0198"", ""10.1108/IJHRH-05-2021-0113"", ""10.1108/GKMC-04-2021-0071"", ""10.1002/cjas.1637"", ""10.1108/IJM-01-2020-0036"", ""10.1108/GKMC-02-2022-0041"", ""10.1177/0002764203260211"", ""10.1108/JOEPP-05-2014-0023"", ""10.1080/09585192.2013.816863"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6198.2001.tb00236.x"", ""10.1111/joop.12265"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(04)36003-X"", ""10.1177/0022022102033003005"", ""10.1177/0022022111422259"", ""10.1007/s10869-010-9192-3"", ""10.1177/0018726710396250"", ""10.1002/job.508"", ""10.1002/job.2617"", ""10.1108/PR-09-2019-0480"", ""10.1111/joop.12059"", ""10.1080/15298860309032"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2006.03.004"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2827-6"", ""10.1177/0018726719884617"", ""10.1016/j.avb.2018.06.007"", ""10.1111/1744-7941.12216"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100452"", ""10.1080/14766080609518609"", ""10.1111/jonm.12244"", ""10.1080/09585192.2018.1460857"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3594-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2262-0"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2019.100708"", ""10.1287/orsc.1100.0559"", ""10.1177/0149206310380462"", ""10.1080/03637751.2012.697630"", ""10.5465/19416520903065683"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2415-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3454-1"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-031413-091221"", ""10.1007/s10551-022-05098-x""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This Article questions the validity of this interpretation. A state's treaty obligation to protect human rights implies an obligation to cooperate on the mitigation of climate change, the Article argues, only if and inasmuch as climate change mitigation effectively protects the enjoyment of treaty rights by individuals within the state's territory or under its jurisdiction. As such, human rights treaties open only a narrow window on the applicability of general mitigation obligations arising under climate treaties and customary international law.","[{""name"": ""Benoit Mayer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/ngeo2595"", ""10.1515/9781400834402"", ""10.1017/S0020589316000130"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195379440.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020589318000222"", ""10.1017/ajil.2019.48""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"
10.1111/rego.12437,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Algorithmic regulation: A maturing concept for investigating regulation of and through algorithms,"AbstractThis paper offers a critical synthesis of the articles in this Special Issue with a view to assessing the concept of “algorithmic regulation” as a mode of social coordination and control articulated by Yeung in 2017. We highlight significant changes in public debate about the role of algorithms in society occurring in the last five years. We also highlight prominent themes that emerge from the contributions, illuminating what is distinctive about the concept of algorithmic regulation, reflecting upon some of its strengths, limitations, and its relationship with the broader research field. In closing, we argue that the core concept is valuable and maturing. It has evolved into an analytical bridge that fosters cross‐disciplinary development and analysis in ways that enrich its early “skeletal” form, thereby enabling careful and context‐sensitive analysis of algorithmic regulation in concrete settings while facilitating critical reflection concerning the legitimacy of existing and proposed regulatory regimes.","[{""name"": ""Lena Ulbricht"", ""affiliation"": [""Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society Research Group Quantification and Social Regulation Berlin Germany"", ""WZB Berlin Social Science Center Research Group Politics of Digitalization Berlin Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Karen Yeung"", ""affiliation"": [""Ethics and Informatics, Birmingham Law School and School of Computer Science University of Birmingham Birmingham UK""]}]","[""10.1215/9780822377269"", ""10.1177/1350508419855714"", ""10.1017/9781108680844"", ""10.1111/rego.12391"", ""10.1111/rego.12338"", ""10.1177/2053951719885967"", ""10.1111/rego.12358"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199560219.003.0014"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1713632"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30184-9"", ""10.2139/ssrn.875789"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2019.04.009"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198838494.003.0004"", ""10.1007/s00146-019-00917-8"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12400.001.0001"", ""10.1177/2053951716665128"", ""10.1177/2053951719858751"", ""10.1111/rego.12371"", ""10.1007/s40804-019-00137-z"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190224851.013.129"", ""10.1111/rego.12333"", ""10.14452/MR-062-10-2011-03_1"", ""10.2307/j.ctvr339d1"", ""10.1016/j.infoandorg.2020.100301"", ""10.1111/rego.12349"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262525374.003.0009"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98911-2_4"", ""10.1177/2053951719897945"", ""10.1177/2053951720919963"", ""10.1111/rego.12367"", ""10.1177/2053951719842543"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(93)E0001-W"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-15742-5_55"", ""10.1111/rego.12296"", ""10.14763/2019.4.1424"", ""10.1177/1461444820929316"", ""10.4135/9781446215012"", ""10.1111/rego.12094"", ""10.1111/rego.12331"", ""10.1111/rego.12369"", ""10.1016/j.bar.2018.12.001"", ""10.4337/9780857936110.00010"", ""10.1177/1461444816675438"", ""10.1093/ips/olw010"", ""10.1080/01402389408425031"", ""10.1177/135485659900500206"", ""10.1111/rego.12417"", ""10.1145/3428502.3428513"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.1177/0170840620937900"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00570.x"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1606266"", ""10.1177/2053951720913064"", ""10.1017/err.2019.6"", ""10.1177/1461444818821316"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2019.01.001"", ""10.1111/issj.12189"", ""10.58704/941r-s927"", ""10.1080/13510347.2020.1714595"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198838494.003.0006"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1657162"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1648536"", ""10.1111/rego.12158"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198838494.003.0002"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3626915"", ""10.1111/rego.12401"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198838494.001.0001"", ""10.1177/2053951719868492"", ""10.1177/0162243915608948"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198819974.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/poq/nfaa012,PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology; 0503 Journalism and Communication,"""TAKING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM"" HOW POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO UNDERSTAND AND REPRESENT PUBLIC OPINION","Abstract For most of the twentieth century, public opinion was nearly analogous with polling. Enter social media, which has upended the social, technical, and communication contingencies upon which public opinion is constructed. This study documents how political professionals turn to social media to understand the public, charting important implications for the practice of campaigning as well as the study of public opinion itself. An analysis of in-depth interviews with 13 professionals from 2016 US presidential campaigns details how they use social media to understand and represent public opinion. I map these uses of social media onto a theoretical model, accounting for quantitative and qualitative measurement, for instrumental and symbolic purposes. Campaigns’ use of social media data to infer and symbolize public opinion is a new development in the relationship between campaigns and supporters. These new tools and symbols of public opinion are shaped by campaigns and drive press coverage (McGregor 2019), highlighting the hybrid logic of the political media system (Chadwick 2017). The model I present brings much-needed attention to qualitative data, a novel aspect of social media in understanding public opinion. The use of social media data to understand the public, for all its problems of representativeness, may provide a retort to long-standing criticisms of surveys—specifically that surveys do not reveal hierarchical, social, or public aspects of opinion formation (Blumer 1948; Herbst 1998; Cramer 2016). This model highlights a need to explicate what can—and cannot—be understood about public opinion via social media.","[{""name"": ""Shannon C McGregor"", ""affiliation"": [""Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"", ""UNC Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190231910.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137488015_2"", ""10.1093/poq/nfi063"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190696726.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1940161216646731"", ""10.2307/2585837"", ""10.1086/320038"", ""10.1080/08913810608443655"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1329334"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316212783"", ""10.4159/9780674038943"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-20319-5"", ""10.1080/10584609.2018.1476425"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199782536.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1461444814562445"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1334727"", ""10.1007/978-3-322-80821-9_10"", ""10.1177/1940161219895215"", ""10.1177/1464884919845458"", ""10.1515/9781400840441"", ""10.1111/jcom.12300"", ""10.1093/poq/nfv048"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190694043.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1355857"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy042""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

However, is giving the Global South a seat at the table truly inclusive development? This article looks at a cross-cultural comparison of the African philosophy of Ubuntu (specifically in South Africa), the Buddhist Gross National Happiness (Bhutan) and the native American idea of Buen Vivir (e.g. Ecuador) and how they view the SDGs, how they view ‘development’, ‘sustainability’, goals and indicators, the implicit value underpinnings of the SDGs, prioritization of goals, and missing links, and leadership. Viewed through the lens of the three cosmovisions of the Global, the SDGs do not effectively address the human–nature–well-being interrelationship. Other cosmovisions have an inherent biocentric value orientation that is often ignored in academic and diplomatic circles. These claim to be more promising than continuing green development approaches, based in modernism. On the positive side, the SDGs contain language of all three worldviews. However, the SDGs are not biocentric aiming to respect nature for nature’s sake, enabling reciprocity with nature. They embody linear growth/results thinking which requires unlimited resource exploitation, and not cyclical thinking replacing growth with well-being (of all beings). They represent individualism and exclude private sector responsibility. They do not represent collective agency and sharing, implying that there is a need for ‘development as service’, to one another and to the Earth. Including these perspectives may lead to abolishing the word ‘development’ within the SDGs, replacing it by inter-relationship; replacing end-result-oriented ‘goals’ with process thinking; and thinking in cyclical nature, and earth governance, instead of static ‘sustainability’. The glass can be viewed as half full or half empty, but the analysis shows that Western ‘modernism’ is still a strong underpinning of the SDGs. Bridges can be built between Happiness, Ubuntu and Buen Vivir in re-interpreting goal frameworks, global governance and the globalization process. This article is largely based on Van Norren 2017 (Development as service, a Happiness, Ubuntu, and Buen Vivir interdisciplinary view of the Sustainable Development Goals. Doctoral dissertation, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands, 2017). Interview findings are numbered with A (Africa); B (Bhutan); E (Ecuador); S (SDGs).","[{""name"": ""Dorine E. van Norren"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.14512/9783865819062"", ""10.1111/lsi.12141"", ""10.1080/13552070512331332280"", ""10.1057/dev"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2401884"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2008.02.009"", ""10.1080/14623730.2004.9721940"", ""10.1002/j.1834-4461.2012.tb00133.x"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12187"", ""10.1080/19452829.2014.910180"", ""10.1080/02580136.2012.10751789"", ""10.4337/jhre.2013.01.03"", ""10.1007/s10784-016-9323-z"", ""10.1017/S0021855313000089"", ""10.1080/17449640903326813"", ""10.1080/02589340220149434"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2007.00280.x"", ""10.1080/03057240.2010.497609"", ""10.1177/1523422306288434"", ""10.1080/02580136.2012.10751800"", ""10.1007/1-4020-2858-X_2"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7660.2006.00518.x"", ""10.5235/20504721.1.1.122"", ""10.1080/09581596.2014.941281"", ""10.1057/dev.2011.85"", ""10.1108/SAJGBR-12-2014-0096"", ""10.1111/j.1759-5436.2010.00105.x"", ""10.1080/01436597.2013.831594"", ""10.5195/BSJ.2011.43""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000533,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,The Epistemological Challenge of Truth Subversion to the Liberal International Order,"AbstractTruth-subversion practices, which populist leaders utilize for political domination, are a significant source of current pressure on the Liberal International Order (LIO). Truth-subversion practices includefalse speak(flagrant lying to subvert the concept of facts),double speak(intentional internal contradictions in speech to erode reason), andflooding(the emission of many messages into the public domain to create confusion). Aiming to destroy liberal truth ideals and practices, truth subversion weakens epistemological security; that is, the experience of orderliness and safety that results from people's and institutions’ shared understandings of their common-sense reality. It privileges baseless claims over fact-based opinions, thus creating communities of the like-minded between which communication becomes impossible. Truth subversion challenges the LIO's three key institutions: democracy, markets, and multilateralism. If truth-subversion practices prevail, societal polarization, inaccurate information, and emotional inflaming strain democracy and human rights protections. Markets that depend for their functioning on accurate information can falter, and multilateralism that relies on communication and reasoned consensus can decay. International relations (IR) scholarship has recognized knowledge production practices as a key feature underlying the LIO, but has not yet identified challenges to those practices as a threat for the LIO. We discuss what the discipline can do to alleviate its blind spots.","[{""name"": ""Emanuel Adler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alena Drieschova"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0020818320000478"", ""10.1017/S0020818300026709"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139565073"", ""10.1017/9781108325615"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491306"", ""10.1017/S175297191000031X"", ""10.1515/9781400826537"", ""10.1162/002081800551109"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000636"", ""10.1177/0002716209339345"", ""10.1080/09636410490523567"", ""10.1177/1354066101007003003"", ""10.1353/book.47469"", ""10.1017/9781108241540"", ""10.31235/osf.io/5gxd2"", ""10.1177/1354066115599043"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000570"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051749"", ""10.2307/2944796"", ""10.2307/2600353"", ""10.1145/3328529.3328562"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000569"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000386"", ""10.1177/03058298810100020501"", ""10.1080/0034676042000183817"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1017/S002081832000065X"", ""10.1515/9781400823253"", ""10.1080/22041451.2018.1428928"", ""10.1017/S0020818321000163"", ""10.2307/2009958"", ""10.1177/0266382116680741"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000521"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.211"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000302"", ""10.1126/science.aao2998"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027831"", ""10.2307/2600569"", ""10.1162/002081899551048"", ""10.1162/002081898550770"", ""10.1177/2336825X1802600305"", ""10.7765/9781526126832"", ""10.1162/00208180152507551"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1162/isec.2009.33.3.110"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000314"", ""10.1177/2053168018773964"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000600"", ""10.1017/S1537592714003120"", ""10.1017/S0260210599001795"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087230"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199735952.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11483.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jcom.12216"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139198769"", ""10.1126/science.aaa1160"", ""10.1515/9781400882915""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article contends, however, that the EU's response has been less a turning point and more of an epiphany, providing a reality check for the EU and its member states about how far European foreign policy cooperation has evolved in recent decades. It suggests that an understanding of the EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine requires consideration of the member states' foreign policy co-operation, which has intensified over the past half-century, and its underpinning norm which we term a ‘collective European responsibility to act’. In emphasizing this norm, we identify core ideas about the functioning of collective European foreign policy. We re-examine three key preoccupations of the EU foreign policy-making practice and assessment through the lens of the collective European responsibility to act and show how it enables a different and novel re-reading of the added value of EU foreign policy cooperation. The EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine thus serves as a timely focusing event that demands a rethink of the premises that have underpinned our analysis and understanding of collective European foreign policy-making over decades.","[{""name"": ""Heidi Maurer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Richard G Whitman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicholas Wright"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This research has largely ignored whether individuals also care about rewarding or punishing foreign countries for their policies on these issues. We tested this possibility by administering a series of conjoint and traditional survey experiments in the United States and China that examined how reciprocity influences opposition to foreign acquisitions of domestic companies. We find that reciprocity is an important determinant of public opinion on the regulation of foreign investments.

10.1146/annurev-polisci-051820-120746,ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,"Race in International Relations: Beyond the ""Norm Against Noticing""","The global movement for racial justice and the rise of anti-Asian hate at the height of the pandemic have called new attention to race and racism in international politics. Although critical theorists have decried the “norm against noticing,” other scholars of international relations have long sidestepped the possible role of race in shaping contemporary international affairs. New studies of hierarchy in international relations open the door for new understandings of race in world politics. We propose an analytic framework for the relationship between racial hierarchy, international law, and foreign policy, demonstrating that race can help explain patterns of interstate interactions that sustain an unequal global order. Positing two faces of racism in international relations, we examine how race biases international law in practice and affects the assessment of foreign threats and national interest. We discuss key methodological challenges in empirical research on race in international relations, focusing on issues of measurement, aggregation, and causation.","[{""name"": ""Bianca Freeman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA;, ,""]}, {""name"": ""D.G.

Some explanations focus narrowly on changes in the balance of power in the international system, or trace historic parallels and cultural continuities in Russian international behavior. For a complete understanding of Russian foreign policy today, individuals, ideas, and institutions—President Vladimir Putin, Putinism, and autocracy—must be added to the analysis. An examination of three cases of recent Russian intervention (in Ukraine in 2014, Syria in 2015, and the United States in 2016) illuminates the causal influence of these domestic determinants in the making of Russian foreign policy.","[{""name"": ""Michael McFaul"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/01622880151091916"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2005.00001.x"", ""10.1177/0022343308100719"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0066"", ""10.1353/jod.2020.0049"", ""10.1017/S0020818319000365"", ""10.1093/isr/viw009"", ""10.1162/isec.2009.34.2.119"", ""10.1080/09636412.2015.1036610"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00256"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2018.1531650"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2019.1591142"", ""10.1162/15203970152521908"", ""10.1080/09636412.2013.786909"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000111"", ""10.2307/2010470"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2002.10641515"", ""10.5129/001041518822704935"", ""10.5129/001041518822704872"", ""10.2307/2539197"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000488"", ""10.2307/20047125"", ""10.1162/016228800560516"", ""10.5129/001041518822704971"", ""10.1163/2451-8921-00404004"", ""10.1162/isec.2007.32.2.45"", ""10.1080/09636412.2015.1070602"", ""10.17645/mac.v5i1.808"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy050"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000363""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1146/annurev-polisci-051120-013321,ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Political Control,"Political leaders use different tactics to ensure widespread compliance with state policies and to minimize resistance. Scholarship tends to treat different tactics individually, suggesting fundamental dissimilarities in underpinning logic and goals. We introduce political control as a concept that unifies these different tactics within a single framework and demonstrate the analytical utility of considering seemingly disparate strategies in conversation rather than in isolation. We synthesize a growing recent literature on political control, including innovative approaches to repression as well as studies of indoctrination, distribution, and infiltration. We argue that tactics of political control can be understood to vary along two primary dimensions: the level of violence and the materiality of state actions.

No previous research has employed a wavelet coherence technique to gather information on the dynamic connection and/or causality between these economic indicators at dissimilar frequencies and various time frames. The main objectives are to address the questions: (a) Is there long‐run relationship between the indicators under consideration? (b) What are the main determinants of economic growth in the long run? (c) How are the indicators related at dissimilar frequencies and various time frames? The empirical findings confirm that (a) there is a long‐run relationship between the indicators under consideration; (b) in the long run, economic growth is influenced significantly by foreign aid, trade openness, gross fixed capital formation, and inflation rate; (c) the outcomes of the wavelet coherence technique give evidence to support the long‐run estimations of this study; and (d) the outcomes of wavelet coherence are supported by the Toda‐Yamamoto causality test results.","[{""name"": ""Tomiwa Sunday Adebayo"", ""affiliation"": [""Cyprus International University""]}, {""name"": ""Demet Beton Kalmaz"", ""affiliation"": [""European University of Lefke""]}]","[""10.2307/2937943"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.07.010"", ""10.1111/dpr.12154"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00219.x"", ""10.2307/1912517"", ""10.2307/1913236"", ""10.14254/2071-8330.2018/11-2/8"", ""10.5709/ce.1897-9254.171"", ""10.2139/ssrn.482461"", ""10.1016/0016-7142(84)90025-5"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(74)90034-7"", ""10.5539/ijef.v9n5p87"", ""10.1186/s40008-019-0173-z"", ""10.1016/j.bir.2019.06.003"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12709"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(92)90104-Y"", ""10.1080/23322039.2019.1626321"", ""10.1016/0140-9883(96)00009-6"", ""10.1016/j.econmod.2004.06.004"", ""10.2307/2297890"", ""10.1002/jae.616"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.09.007"", ""10.3390/su11061538"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.121"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(94)01616-8"", ""10.1175/1520-0477(1998)079<0061:APGTWA>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.14254/2071-8330.2018/11-3/2"", ""10.1198/073500102753410372""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Computer Science']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Information Systems']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

The Spanish party Podemos is a key case study for such an analysis, as it is a left‐populist actor that has made extensive use of nationalist rhetoric in its discourse. Through a discourse analysis on a corpus that includes speeches by Podemos leadership and primary data such as interviews and original unpublished material, this article studies the nationalist dimension of Podemos and its relation with the party's much‐discussed populism. The analysis shows that the Podemos leadership deliberately embeds nationalism in its populist strategy: Nationalism is a central element of the party's populist project and serves to advance an alternative form of national identification that challenges that of the right wing. Through a resignification of national pride and belonging, Podemos constructs an image of Spain that refers to an inclusive welfare state, to people's mobilization, and to a moral community that is not delimited by lingual or ethnic particularisms.","[{""name"": ""Jacopo Custodi"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Political and Social Sciences Scuola Normale Superiore  Florence Italy""]}]","[""10.1080/13183222.2019.1606562"", ""10.4324/9781315226446-4"", ""10.1080/23745118.2019.1632576"", ""10.1080/17449057.2018.1532633"", ""10.1111/nana.12480"", ""10.1080/1362102042000214705"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.17141/iconos.52.2015.1670"", ""10.1075/jlp.6.2.08car"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63826-3_10"", ""10.1177/03058298830120020701"", ""10.1111/newe.12001"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12321"", ""10.4324/9781351022668"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.1111/nana.12575"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu087"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63432-6_6"", ""10.1177/0032329208316570"", ""10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog114"", ""10.1080/13569319808420771"", ""10.1002/9781444355093.ch24"", ""10.21308/recp.44.09"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00165"", ""10.1108/9781839092039"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63432-6_1"", ""10.4324/9780203934753"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02050.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63826-3_11"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521439612"", ""10.1057/9780230523364"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1fx4gx6"", ""10.4324/9781315180823"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330087"", ""10.1080/13569317.2016.1150136"", ""10.1080/17449057.2010.507114"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47479-3"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1093/icon/mom039"", ""10.1080/01419870.2015.1009480"", ""10.1080/0969229042000249831"", ""10.1177/0032321716647400"", ""10.5565/rev/papers.2222"", ""10.1075/jlp.17025.sta"", ""10.1080/17405904.2017.1309325""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This study specifically (1) examines news repertoires of young people, based on their combined usage of media platforms and news content preferences; and (2) examines their variation due to social background characteristics. Results from a survey of Dutch adolescents (N = 1,084; age 16 to 21) reveal four distinct news repertoires: labeled minimalists, omnivores, traditionalists, and online news users. Findings further suggest that platform-based news repertoires are related to preferences for specific news content. Finally, this study contributes to the digital divide literature by demonstrating that inequalities in news media usage related to education do not seem to apply to younger citizens.","[{""name"": ""Sabine Geers"", ""affiliation"": [""Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1371/journal.pone.0155112"", ""10.1080/10584600902854363"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199759477.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108116015"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2015.1084023"", ""10.1080/08838151.2014.998220"", ""10.1177/1077699017706928"", ""10.1080/10705511.2011.532732"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511499531"", ""10.1177/0093650208321782"", ""10.1515/COMMUN.2006.023"", ""10.1177/1461444814543162"", ""10.1080/08838151.2010.519808"", ""10.1002/9780470767603.ch14"", ""10.1177/0894439319828012"", ""10.1002/pits.22183"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139878425"", ""10.1177/1464884911427803"", ""10.1386/nl.8.115_1"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1385549"", ""10.1177/1461444811436146"", ""10.1177/0267323112453671"", ""10.1080/17482798.2015.997103"", ""10.5117/2011.039.001.064"", ""10.1515/commun-2013-0022"", ""10.1080/19331681.2014.958794"", ""10.1177/1461444813487959"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2003.09.005"", ""10.1177/1461444815580413"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2010.549235"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1162/isec_a_00405,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,Illusions of Autonomy Why Europe Cannot Provide for Its Security If the United States Pulls Back,"Abstract Europe's security landscape has changed dramatically in the past decade amid Russia's resurgence, mounting doubts about the long-term reliability of the U.S. security commitment, and Europe's growing aspiration for strategic autonomy. This changed security landscape raises an important counterfactual question: Could Europeans develop an autonomous defense capacity if the United States withdrew completely from Europe? The answer to this question has major implications for a range of policy issues and for the ongoing U.S. grand strategy debate in light of the prominent argument by U.S. “restraint” scholars that Europe can easily defend itself. Addressing this question requires an examination of the historical evolution as well as the current and likely future state of European interests and defense capacity. It shows that any European effort to achieve strategic autonomy would be fundamentally hampered by two mutually reinforcing constraints: “strategic cacophony,” namely profound, continent-wide divergences across all domains of national defense policies—most notably, threat perceptions; and severe military capacity shortfalls that would be very costly and time-consuming to close. As a result, Europeans are highly unlikely to develop an autonomous defense capacity anytime soon, even if the United States were to fully withdraw from the continent.","[{""name"": ""Hugo Meijer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephen G.

10.1017/psrm.2018.26,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Identifying voter preferences for politicians' personal attributes: a conjoint experiment in Japan,"AbstractAlthough politicians’ personal attributes are an important component of elections and representation, few studies have rigorously investigated which attributes are most relevant in shaping voters’ preferences for politicians, or whether these preferences vary across different electoral system contexts. We investigate these questions with a conjoint survey experiment using the case of Japan’s mixed-member bicameral system. We find that the attributes preferred by voters are not entirely consistent with the observed attributes of actual politicians. Moreover, voters’ preferences do not vary when asked to consider representation under different electoral system contexts, whereas the observed attributes of politicians do vary across these contexts. These findings point to the role of factors beyond voters’ sincere preferences, such as parties’ recruitment strategies, the effect of electoral rules on the salience of the personal vote, and the availability of different types of politicians, in determining the nature of representation.","[{""name"": ""Yusaku Horiuchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel M.

10.1080/14494035.2020.1782627,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Governing the adoption of robotics and autonomous systems in long-term care in Singapore,"ABSTRACT Robotics and autonomous systems have been dubbed as viable technological solutions to address the incessant demand for long-term care (LTC) across the world, which is exacerbated by ageing populations. However, similar to other emerging technologies, the adoption of robotics and autonomous systems in LTC pose risks and unintended consequences. In the health and LTC sectors, there are additional bioethics concerns that are associated with novel technology applications. Using an in-depth case study, we examined the adoption of novel technologies such as robotics and autonomous systems in LTC to meet the rising social care demand in Singapore consequent to its ageing population. We first described the LTC sector in Singapore and traced the development of robotics and autonomous systems deployed in the LTC setting. We then examined technological risks and ethical issues that are associated with their applications. In addressing these technological risks and ethical concerns, Singapore has adopted a regulatory sandbox approach that fosters experimentation through the creation of a robotics test-bed and the initiation of various robotics pilots in different health clusters. The stakeholders largely envision positive scenarios of human-robot coexistence in the LTC setting. When robots can take over routine and manual care duties in the future, human care workers can be freed up to provide more personalised care to the care recipients. We also highlighted existing gaps in the governance of technological risks and ethical issues surrounding the deployment of robotics and autonomous systems in LTC that can be advanced as future research agendas.","[{""name"": ""Si Ying Tan"", ""affiliation"": [""Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Araz Taeihagh"", ""affiliation"": [""Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, Singapore""]}]","[""10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018815"", ""10.1007/s12369-016-0336-0"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2018.12.046"", ""10.1080/17516234.2018.1492315"", ""10.1111/jnu.12435"", ""10.1525/jer.2009.4.1.25"", ""10.1007/s10676-016-9413-1"", ""10.1007/s00391-016-1065-6"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001182"", ""10.1007/s12369-016-0366-7"", ""10.1007/s11948-017-9976-1"", ""10.1007/s12369-015-0322-y"", ""10.1007/s00391-017-1345-9"", ""10.1002/gps.4906"", ""10.3390/en11051277"", ""10.1111/risa.13505"", ""10.3390/en11051062"", ""10.3390/su11205791"", ""10.1111/jnu.12424"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2017.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.jamda.2017.10.008"", ""10.1080/13607863.2017.1421617"", ""10.1007/s12369-015-0326-7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9566.2009.01218.x"", ""10.1177/0969733017742960"", ""10.1080/01691864.2018.1528176"", ""10.1177/0162243916633755"", ""10.1080/13669877.2012.729522"", ""10.1007/s12369-014-0242-2"", ""10.1177/0306312713509704"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9234-6"", ""10.1080/01441647.2018.1494640"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101546"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2017.07.010""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Demography', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/isr/viaa033,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Friends, Fellows, and Foes: A New Framework for Studying Relational Peace","AbstractIn this article, we suggest that taking a relational view of peace seriously is a fruitful avenue for expanding current theoretical frameworks surrounding peace as a concept. Paving the way for such an approach, this article conducts a review of the literature that takes on peace as a relational concept. We then return to how a relationship is conceptualized, before turning to how such components would be further defined in order to specify relational peace. Based on this framework, we argue that a peaceful relationship entails deliberation, non-domination, and cooperation between the actors in the dyad; the actors involved recognize and trust each other and believe that the relationship is either one between legitimate fellows or one between friends. The article clarifies the methodological implications of studying peace in this manner. It also demonstrates some of the advantages of this approach, as it shows how peace and war can coexist in webs of multiple interactions, and the importance of studying relations, and how actors understand these relationships, as a way of studying varieties of peace.","[{""name"": ""Johanna Söderström"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Malin Åkebo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Anna K Jarstad"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden""]}]","[""10.1007/s10551-010-0402-8"", ""10.2307/jj.919503"", ""10.1111/pech.12372"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107280366"", ""10.1093/isr/viw054"", ""10.1162/isec.2006.30.4.87"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0130.2011.00746.x"", ""10.1080/17502977.2018.1482078"", ""10.1093/isp/ekx009"", ""10.1080/21647259.2017.1368158"", ""10.1093/isr/vix005"", ""10.1093/isr/vix004"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190680121.001.0001"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw005"", ""10.1177/0090591704268372"", ""10.1017/S0022278X16000227"", ""10.1086/231209"", ""10.1177/0735275113501998"", ""10.1017/9781108236140"", ""10.1093/isr/vix001"", ""10.1177/002234336900600301"", ""10.1017/S1537592719004511"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199301027.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022002792036002007"", ""10.4324/9780203088999"", ""10.1093/isr/vix007"", ""10.1080/13698230701660170"", ""10.1080/17450144.2010.534491"", ""10.1017/S0260210510000069"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12139"", ""10.1080/19460171.2018.1506349"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1029907"", ""10.2307/351454"", ""10.1080/23802014.2019.1687012"", ""10.1080/17502977.2018.1515608"", ""10.4324/9781315142470"", ""10.1093/isr/vix002"", ""10.1080/14678802.2018.1468532"", ""10.1162/002081802320005487"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1029905"", ""10.1525/9780520317680"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2011.00121.x"", ""10.1177/0967010614550899"", ""10.1080/01436597.2013.800750"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12149"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139178914.002"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw036"", ""10.1057/9780230288492"", ""10.4135/9781412959636.n472"", ""10.1093/isp/eky014"", ""10.1080/13698230701208061"", ""10.1080/14616742.2018.1487266"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1029908"", ""10.1086/233648"", ""10.1080/13698230.2015.1092661"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195395914.003.0013"", ""10.1111/j.1399-6576.2011.01113.x"", ""10.1111/dech.12305"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1120154"", ""10.5465/amr.1998.926617"", ""10.1057/9781403983411"", ""10.1093/isr/vix006"", ""10.1017/S0266267102001086"", ""10.1080/14678802.2014.881088"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i4.1728"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190215545.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027764"", ""10.1177/1468796805052112""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12484,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,"Far-right protest mobilisation in Europe: Grievances, opportunities and resources","AbstractWhat explains far‐right mobilisation in the protest arena? After decades of growing electoral support and policy influence, the far right is experiencing an increase in grassroots mobilisation. Scholars of social movements and political parties have devoted little attention to the determinants of far‐right protest mobilisation in Europe. In this article, we bridge previous research on the far right and social movements to advance hypotheses on the drivers of far‐right protest mobilisation based on grievances, opportunities and resource mobilisation models. We use an original dataset combining novel data on 4,845 far‐right protest events in 11 East and West European countries (2008–2018), with existing measures accounting for the (political, economic and cultural) context of mobilisation. We find that classical approaches to collective action can be fruitfully applied to the study of the far right. Cultural grievances, notably concerns about immigration, as well as the availability of institutional access points in contexts characterised by divided government increase far‐right protest mobilisation. But far‐right protest mobilisation also rests on the organisational resources available to nativist collective actors, that is, the network in which they are embedded, their visibility in the media and elected officials. These findings have important implications to understand far‐right success in advanced democracies. They show that far‐right mobilisation in the protest arena not only rests on favourable circumstances, but also on whether far‐right actors can profit from them.

We argue that the revolving-door incentivizes congressional staffers to showcase their legislative skills to the lobbying market in ways that affect policymaking in Congress. Using comprehensive data on congressional staffers, we find that employing staffers who later become lobbyists is associated with higher legislative productivity for members of Congress, especially in staffers’ final terms in Congress. It also is associated with increases in a member’s bill sponsorship in the areas of health and commerce, the topics most frequently addressed by clients in the lobbying industry, as well as granting more access to lobbying firms. These results provide the systematic empirical evidence of pre-exit effects of the revolving-door among congressional staff.","[{""name"": ""MICHAEL E.

10.1111/pops.12740,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Examining the Left-Right Divide Through the Lens of a Global Crisis: Ideological Differences and Their Implications for Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID‐19 disease pandemic is one of the most pressing global health issues of our time. Nevertheless, responses to the pandemic exhibit a stark ideological divide, with political conservatives (versus liberals/progressives) expressing less concern about the virus and less behavioral compliance with efforts to combat it. Drawing from decades of research on the psychological underpinnings of ideology, in four studies (total N = 4441) we examine the factors that contribute to the ideological gap in pandemic response—across domains including personality (e.g., empathic concern), attitudes (e.g., trust in science), information (e.g., COVID‐19 knowledge), vulnerability (e.g., preexisting medical conditions), demographics (e.g., education, income) and environment (e.g., local COVID‐19 infection rates). This work provides insight into the most proximal drivers of this ideological divide and also helps fill a long‐standing theoretical and empirical gap regarding how these various ideological differences shape responses to complex real‐world sociopolitical events. Among our key findings are the central role of attitude‐ and belief‐related factors (e.g., trust in science and trust in Trump)—and the relatively weaker influence of several domain‐general personality factors (empathic concern, disgust sensitivity, conspiratorial ideation). We conclude by considering possible explanations for these findings and their broader implications for our understanding of political ideology. Highlights Stark ideological differences exist across a wide range of attitudinal and behavioral indices of pandemic response, with more conservative individuals reliably exhibiting less concern about the virus. These findings illustrate the extent to which the pandemic has become politicized. A range of factors contribute to this ideological gap in pandemic response, but some are substantially more important than others. Several factors that have received attention in public and academic discourse about the pandemic appear to contribute little, if at all, to the ideological divide. These include news following, scientific literacy, perceived social norms, and knowledge about the virus. The most critical factors appear to be trust in scientists and trust in Trump, which further highlights the politicization of COVID‐19 and, importantly, the antagonistic nature of these two beliefs. Efforts to change and, especially, disentangle these two attitudes have the potential to be effective interventions.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Coe Ruisch"", ""affiliation"": [""The Ohio State University""]}, {""name"": ""Courtney Moore"", ""affiliation"": [""The Ohio State University""]}, {""name"": ""Javier Granados Samayoa"", ""affiliation"": [""The Ohio State University""]}, {""name"": ""Shelby Boggs"", ""affiliation"": [""The Ohio State University""]}, {""name"": ""Jesse Ladanyi"", ""affiliation"": [""The Ohio State University""]}, {""name"": ""Russell Fazio"", ""affiliation"": [""The Ohio State University""]}]","[""10.1080/10584609.2012.737424"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0823-z"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1177/1745691614529796"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279"", ""10.1177/1745691610393980"", ""10.1177/1948550620940539"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.01.046"", ""10.2307/1955648"", ""10.1521/soco.2017.35.4.415"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.142015"", ""10.1177/2053168015622072"", ""10.1521/soco.2017.35.4.354"", ""10.1086/681254"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2013.05.008"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0247520"", ""10.1073/pnas.2023131118"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000031"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.11.4.323"", ""10.1126/sciadv.abc2717"", ""10.1177/1948550620934692"", ""10.1080/02699930802110007"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.61.7.651"", ""10.1111/pops.12407"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2017.11.033"", ""10.1007/s11109-009-9094-0"", ""10.1017/S0008423920000311"", ""10.1088/0963-6625/7/3/001"", ""10.1111/ssm.12051"", ""10.1037/1040-3590.19.3.281"", ""10.1126/science.1157627"", ""10.1177/0963721414531598"", ""10.1177/0956797620964422"", ""10.1561/100.00014127"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0226394"", ""10.1037/pspp0000365"", ""10.1037/xge0000898"", ""10.1098/rstb.2011.0029"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2013.05.009"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0238015"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0025552"", ""10.1177/0265407505056439"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199760107.013.0017"", ""10.1037/a0015474"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-12227-0"", ""10.1177/1948550613476096"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

10.1093/isq/sqz089,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,"""Mirror, Mirror On the Wall:"" Self-Legitimation by International Organizations","AbstractMost analyses of legitimacy and legitimation in international organizations (IOs) focus on the perceptions of external audiences. In so doing, they fail to consider self-legitimation, where an IO undertakes legitimation internally, as a way of developing and reinforcing its identity. Moreover, most studies of IO legitimacy neglect the fact that IO identities are rarely uniform and instead are multiple and conflicting. I address these omissions by examining self-legitimation in three IOs—the United Nations (UN), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the World Bank. These organizations are both operational and normative actors, and both institutions dependent on member states and autonomous bodies with independent expertise and capacities. These identities sometimes dictate contradictory goals and practices, forcing the organizations to violate the principles and activities considered appropriate to one of their identities, thus complicating legitimation. Based on extensive fieldwork and drawing on a range of disciplines, this article proposes a novel theory of IO self-legitimation: I argue that the need for self-legitimation depends on the degree of identity cohesion and identity hierarchy of the organization. I identify two temporal dimensions of self-legitimation, three categories of self-legitimation practices, and three broader repercussions of self-legitimation, ultimately showing that self-legitimation is a necessary and constitutive activity for IOs.","[{""name"": ""Sarah von Billerbeck"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Reading""]}]","[""10.1017/S175297191000031X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107280366"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490163"", ""10.1017/S2045381712000135"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2005.00380.x"", ""10.2307/2393432"", ""10.1093/bjc/azu053"", ""10.1177/0170840614559259"", ""10.2307/2095849"", ""10.1177/0893318900141006"", ""10.1017/S0020818300012832"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490200"", ""10.2307/1388226"", ""10.2307/256405"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0083-3"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195075809.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195061789.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0021886309336402"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199594566.003.0013"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000492"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316710982"", ""10.1177/1354066107074283"", ""10.5465/19416520.2014.873177"", ""10.1162/002081898550699"", ""10.1086/226550"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1017/S0020818300032811"", ""10.1111/isqu.12033"", ""10.1093/isr/vix025"", ""10.4324/9780203450857_chapter_1"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-36408-0"", ""10.1002/job.1937"", ""10.1017/S0002930000159810"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00159"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.1177/1354066103009002004"", ""10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107325135"", ""10.5465/19416520.2016.1120963"", ""10.1080/17502977.2017.1353751"", ""10.1515/9781400837816"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490408"", ""10.1080/13533310903036392"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672097.001.0001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1017/psrm.2019.53,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Using screeners to measure respondent attention on self-administered surveys: Which items and how many?,"AbstractInattentive respondents introduce noise into data sets, weakening correlations between items and increasing the likelihood of null findings. “Screeners” have been proposed as a way to identify inattentive respondents, but questions remain regarding their implementation. First, what is the optimal number of Screeners for identifying inattentive respondents? Second, what types of Screener questions best capture inattention? In this paper, we address both of these questions. Using item-response theory to aggregate individual Screeners we find that four Screeners are sufficient to identify inattentive respondents. Moreover, two grid and two multiple choice questions work well. Our findings have relevance for applied survey research in political science and other disciplines. Most importantly, our recommendations enable the standardization of Screeners on future surveys.","[{""name"": ""Adam J. Berinsky"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michele F.

10.1111/pops.12753,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,The Language of Pandemic Leaderships: Mapping Political Rhetoric During the COVID-19 Outbreak,"This article maps political rhetoric by national leaders during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We identify and characterize global variations in major rhetorical storylines invoked in publicly available speeches (N = 1201) across a sample of 26 countries. Employing a text analytics or corpus linguistics approach, we show that state heads rhetorically lead their nations by: enforcing systemic interventions, upholding global unity, encouraging communal cooperation, stoking national fervor, and assuring responsive governance. Principal component analysis further shows that country‐level rhetoric is organized along emergent dimensions of cultural cognition: an agency‐structure axis to define the loci of pandemic interventions and a hierarchy‐egalitarianism axis which distinguishes top‐down enforcement from bottom‐up calls for cooperation. Furthermore, we detect a striking contrast between countries featuring populist versus cosmopolitan rhetoric, which diverged in terms of their collective meaning making around leading over versus leading with, as well as their experienced pandemic severity. We conclude with implications for understanding global pandemic leadership in an unequal world and the contributions of mixed‐methods approaches to a generative political psychology in times of crisis. Highlights During a global pandemic, political leaders must adapt their rhetoric to local societal conditions. Our work affirms the importance of political governance that elevates strong institutions while empowering public cooperation, but cautions that these may be most readily enacted in more democratic and economically developed contexts. In poorer, less democratic settings, rhetoric emphasizing accountable governance should be responsive to bottom‐up grassroots efforts in local communities, in contrast to the tightening grip of top‐down militarized policing in states witnessing the opportunistic creep of authoritarianism during a period of societal disorder. Finally, rhetoric where leaders uphold global ideals underscore wider identities of international collaborations in a global crisis, in contrast to more insularizing nationalistic rhetoric.","[{""name"": ""Cristina Jayme Montiel"", ""affiliation"": [""Ateneo de Manila University""]}, {""name"": ""Joshua Uyheng"", ""affiliation"": [""Ateneo de Manila University"", ""Carnegie Mellon University""]}, {""name"": ""Erwine Dela Paz"", ""affiliation"": [""Ateneo de Manila University""]}]","[""10.1177/0957926508088962"", ""10.1037/pac0000494"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31145-4"", ""10.1037/amp0000715"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.26"", ""10.1525/9780520907393"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00834.x"", ""10.4324/9780203809068.ch1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2012.00948.x"", ""10.1111/sipr.12075"", ""10.1038/466029a"", ""10.1080/13645579.2019.1576317"", ""10.1016/j.pubrev.2017.09.003"", ""10.1215/03616878-8641530"", ""10.1080/17441692.2020.1807581"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.05.011"", ""10.1111/pops.12644"", ""10.1007/s11538-013-9918-2"", ""10.3389/fcomm.2020.557561"", ""10.1111/pops.12648"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00862.x"", ""10.1080/14767430.2020.1758986"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2020.06.009"", ""10.1080/13645570500402447"", ""10.1177/1745691617734863"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.06.007"", ""10.1111/bjso.12398"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01151.x"", ""10.1177/1745691620966795"", ""10.1037/apl0000577"", ""10.1177/1742715020927111"", ""10.1002/casp.2369"", ""10.1111/bjso.12400"", ""10.1177/0957926516634546"", ""10.1080/17405904.2016.1268186"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0884-z"", ""10.1080/13549839.2020.1754375"", ""10.1177/1742715020929151"", ""10.4135/9780857028020""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

TRACKING WHITE AMERICANS' RACIAL ATTITUDES VIA A PANEL SURVEY, 2008-2018","AbstractIn his campaign and first few years in office, Donald Trump consistently defied contemporary norms by using explicit, negative rhetoric targeting ethnic/racial minorities. Did this rhetoric lead White Americans to express more or less prejudiced views of African Americans or Hispanics, whether through changing norms around racial prejudice or other mechanisms? We assess that question using a thirteen-wave panel conducted with a population-based sample of Americans between 2008 and 2018. We find that via most measures, White Americans’ expressed anti-Black and anti-Hispanic prejudice declined after Trump’s political emergence, and we can rule out even small increases in the expression of prejudice. These results suggest the limits of racially charged rhetoric’s capacity to heighten prejudice among White Americans overall. They also indicate that rather than being a fixed predisposition, prejudice can shift by reacting against changing presidential rhetoric.","[{""name"": ""Daniel J Hopkins"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Samantha Washington"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA""]}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226043463.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12030"", ""10.2307/2096070"", ""10.1126/science.aad9713"", ""10.1177/1948550617750735"", ""10.1073/pnas.1317670111"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00117.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123498000143"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs056"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edy033"", ""10.1086/706461"", ""10.1017/S1537592719000963"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09567-4"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00192.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.062906.070752"", ""10.1017/9781108645157"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090719"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226435725.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226472157.001.0001"", ""10.3758/BF03210951"", ""10.1515/9781400889181"", ""10.1080/08913811.2018.1448515"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990128"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691163611.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2111708"", ""10.1002/polq.12737"", ""10.1215/9780822396697-007"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mmb"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791024"", ""10.1111/ajps.12157"", ""10.1086/694845"", ""10.2307/2111666"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000417,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,"Surveillance, Security, and Liberal Democracy in the Post-COVID World","AbstractTo what extent has the COVID-19 outbreak, and the augmented use of health surveillance technology that has resulted from it, altered international conceptions of civil liberties, privacy, and democracy? This article examines how global patterns of liberal democracy have been and could be affected by the pandemic. In China, the outbreak has strengthened a pre-existing techno-authoritarian project aimed at prevention and control of threats to both public health and public order. Certain features of the international system such as China's major power status, its global economic role, and its leadership in international organizations suggest that China's model of illiberal pandemic response could diffuse worldwide. Other factors, however—such as the incomparability of China's political system to many other countries in the contemporary international system—suggest more limited diffusion potential. To date, the pandemic has largely augmented existing trends, meaning that autocracies have been likely to respond in ways that infringe upon citizen rights, and weak democracies have exhibited some risk of democratic erosion and pandemic-associated autocratization. In these cases, however, factors other than surveillance have been central to processes of democratic decay. Conversely, a large number of consolidated democracies have employed surveillance, but have managed to navigate the initial stages of crisis without significantly compromising democratic standards. In these cases, surveillance technology has been fenced in by democratic institutions and rule of law, and norms, institutions, and public opinion have worked together to facilitate pandemic responses that are (on balance) proportional, limited in time and scope, and subject to democratic oversight. This suggests that international relations may need to separate the pandemic's effects on democracy from its effects on liberalism, and that care must be taken to identify the precise mechanisms that link pandemic response to various components of liberal democracy.","[{""name"": ""Sheena Chestnut Greitens"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.6602"", ""10.1017/S0020818319000365"", ""10.1080/0140238042000297107"", ""10.1017/S1537592707070776"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.3151"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00360"", ""10.1177/0010414019852701"", ""10.1017/S002081831600028X"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.115"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000402"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000338"", ""10.1111/isqu.12008"", ""10.1353/jod.2020.0048"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628"", ""10.1353/jod.1991.0033"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001533"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000550"", ""10.1177/0002716204272516"", ""10.1080/13510347.2019.1582029"", ""10.1126/science.abb2434"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551192""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S1537592718003584,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,"Rule by Violence, Rule by Law: Lynching, Jim Crow, and the Continuing Evolution of Voter Suppression in the US","Although restricting formal voting rights—voter suppression—is not uncommon in democracies, its incidence and form vary widely. Intuitively, when competing elites believe that the benefits of reducing voting by opponents outweigh the costs of voter suppression, it is more likely to occur. Internal political and state capacity and external actors, however, influence the form that voter suppression takes. When elites competing for office lack the ability to enact laws restricting voting due to limited internal capacity, or external actors are able to limit the ability of governments to use laws to suppress voting, suppression is likely to be ad hoc, decentralized, and potentially violent. As political and state capacity increase and external constraints decrease, voter suppression will shift from decentralized and potentially violent to centralized and mostly non-violent. We illustrate our arguments by analyzing the transition from decentralized, violent voter suppression through the use of lynchings (and associated violence) to the centralized, less violent suppression of black voting in the post-Reconstruction South. We also place the most recent wave of U.S. state voter suppression laws into broader context using our theoretical framework.","[{""name"": ""Brad Epperly"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Witko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ryan Strickler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul White"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139583749"", ""10.1177/2053168015589804"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00395.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781650"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000671"", ""10.2307/2580018"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226012773.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01615440109598978"", ""10.2307/2149478"", ""10.1086/683256"", ""10.1177/1065912913514854"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195387421.001.0001"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300181388.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020859000110910"", ""10.2307/1073827"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000434"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139017992"", ""10.1086/688343"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjf9x3z"", ""10.1080/01615440.2011.639289"", ""10.1017/S0007123498000167"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190232573.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2208825"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469620879.001.0001"", ""10.1093/sf/sot093"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2009.08.001"", ""10.1017/S1537592713002843"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609336"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226724058.001.0001"", ""10.1525/curh.1924.19.4.596"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511843686"", ""10.1177/1532673X16687266"", ""10.2307/2152013"", ""10.2307/2579665"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(97)00032-2"", ""10.1177/0022002712468724"", ""10.1177/0032329293021001003"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2005.00176.x"", ""10.1162/002219501750442369"", ""10.1086/684438"", ""10.2307/2096147"", ""10.2307/2095805"", ""10.1017/S0898588X09990022"", ""10.2307/2209719""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000521,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Racism and Antiracism in the Liberal International Order,"AbstractFormal racial equality is a key aspect of the current Liberal International Order (LIO). It is subject to two main challenges: resurgent racial nationalism and substantive racial inequality. Combining work in International Relations with interdisciplinary studies on race, I submit that these challenges are the latest iteration of struggles between two transnational coalitions over the LIO's central racial provisions, which I call racial diversity regimes (RDRs). The traditional coalition has historically favored RDRs based on racial inequality and racial nationalism. The transformative coalition has favored RDRs based on racial equality and nonracial nationalism. I illustrate the argument by tracing the development of the liberal order's RDR as a function of intercoalitional struggles from one based on racial nationalism and inequality in 1919 to the current regime based on nonracial nationalism and limited equality. Today, racial nationalists belong to the traditional coalition and critics of racial inequality are part of the transformative coalition. The stakes of their struggles are high because they will determine whether we will live in a more racist or a more antiracist world. This article articulates a comprehensive framework that places race at the heart of the liberal order, offers the novel concept of “embedded racism” to capture how sovereignty shields domestic racism from foreign interference, and proposes an agenda for mainstream International Relations that takes race seriously.","[{""name"": ""Zoltán I.

10.1017/S0003055419000637,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Race and Representation in Campaign Finance,"Racial inequality in voter turnout is well-documented, but we know less about racial inequality in campaign contributions. Using new data on the racial identities of over 27 million donors, we find an unrepresentative contributor class. Black and Latino shares of contributions are smaller than their shares of the population, electorate, and elected offices. However, we argue that the presence of ethnoracial minority candidates mobilizes coethnic donors. Results from regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference designs suggest that the presence of ethnoracial minority candidates increases the share of minority contributions in US House elections. We find a reduction in white contributions to black Democrats, and to black and Latino Republicans, but little difference in overall fundraising competitiveness. Although we cannot definitively rule out alternative mechanisms that covary with candidate ethnorace, the results suggest that the nomination of minority candidates can increase the ethnoracial representativeness of campaign finance without costs to fundraising.","[{""name"": ""JACOB M.

10.17645/pag.v8i1.2478,POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE,0302 Political Science,Populist Disinformation: Exploring Intersections between Online Populism and Disinformation in the US and the Netherlands,"The discursive construction of a populist divide between the ‘good’ people and ‘corrupt’ elites can conceptually be linked to disinformation. More specifically, (right-wing) populists are not only attributing blame to the political elites, but increasingly vent anti-media sentiments in which the mainstream press is scapegoated for not representing the people. In an era of post-truth relativism, ‘fake news’ is increasingly politicized and used as a label to delegitimize political opponents or the press. To better understand the affinity between disinformation and populism, this article conceptualizes two relationships between these concepts: (1) blame attributions to the dishonest media as part of the corrupt elites that mislead the people; and (2) the expression of populist boundaries in a people-centric, anti-expert, and evidence-free way. The results of a comparative qualitative content analysis in the US and Netherlands indicate that the political leaders Donald Trump and Geert Wilders blame legacy media in populist ways by regarding them as part of the corrupt and lying establishment. Compared to left-wing populist and mainstream politicians, these politicians are the most central players in the discursive construction of populist disinformation. Both politicians bypassed empirical evidence and expert knowledge whilst prioritizing the people’s truth and common sense at the center stage of honesty and reality. These expressions resonated with public opinion on Facebook, although citizens were more likely to frame mis- and disinformation in terms of ideological cleavages. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of populist discourse in a post-factual era.","[{""name"": ""Michael Hameleers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9780230592100"", ""10.1177/0267323118760317"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697"", ""10.1177/1940161218819430"", ""10.1177/1940161218811981"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790867"", ""10.1093/ccc/tcz009"", ""10.1177/0093650216644026"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01402.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.1111/comt.12029"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328520"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1111/jcom.12337"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1588909"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1102187"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1334726"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.49.3.577"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551"", ""10.1080/22041451.2018.1428928"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328521""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/pops.12709,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,"Personal and Political: Post-Traumatic Stress Through the Lens of Social Identity, Power, and Politics","Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has always been controversial and highly politicized. Here, using a social identity approach, we review evidence that trauma and its aftermath are fundamentally linked to social position, sociopolitical capital, and power. We begin this contribution by demonstrating how a person's group memberships (and the social identities they derive from these memberships) are inherently linked to the experience of adversity. We then go on to consider how it is through group memberships that individuals are defined by their trauma risk and trauma histories—that is, a person's group memberships and their trauma are often inherently linked. Considering the importance of group memberships for understanding trauma, we argue that it is important to see these, and group processes more generally, as more than just “demographic” risk factors. Instead, we argue that when groups are defined by their trauma history or risk, their members will often derive some sense of self from this trauma. For this reason, attributes of group memberships are important in developing an understanding of adjustment and adaptation to trauma. In particular, groups' status, their recourse to justice, and the level of trust and solidarity within the group are all central to the impact of traumatic events on individual‐level psychological resilience. We review evidence that supports this analysis by focusing on the exacerbating effects of stigma and social mistrust on post‐traumatic stress, and the value of solidarity and strong identities for resilience. We conclude that because of these group‐related processes, trauma interweaves the personal with the political and that post‐traumatic stress is fundamentally about power, positionality, and politics.","[{""name"": ""Orla T.

We argue that two main factors explain why torture can persist as a generalized practice even in democratic societies: weak procedural protections and the militarization of policing, which introduces strategies, equipment, and mentality that treats criminal suspects as though they were enemies in wartime. Using a large survey of the Mexican prison population and leveraging the date and place of arrest, this paper provides causal evidence about how these two explanatory variables shape police brutality. Our paper offers a grim picture of the survival of authoritarian policing practices in democracies. It also provides novel evidence of the extent to which the abolition of inquisitorial criminal justice institutions—a remnant of colonial legacies and a common trend in the region—has worked to restrain police brutality.","[{""name"": ""BEATRIZ MAGALONI"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""LUIS RODRIGUEZ"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0022002799043001006"", ""10.2307/2960436"", ""10.1086/381480"", ""10.18504/pl2550-015-2017"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976520"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000178"", ""10.1086/432166"", ""10.1177/0010414017720703"", ""10.1162/rest_a_00801"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2011.00132.x"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(93)90048-E"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00126"", ""10.1093/pan/mps040"", ""10.1073/pnas.1805161115"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.1177/0022002715587048"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976520.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804960"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1022367"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00086.x"", ""10.1017/S004388711800014X"", ""10.1086/694393"", ""10.1177/0010414016688001"", ""10.5040/9781350219748"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510274"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.1177/0010414010376915"", ""10.1086/344122"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x"", ""10.23943/9781400890323"", ""10.1145/2133806.2133826"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551130"", ""10.1177/0022002715587053"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00441.x"", ""10.1080/09546553.2012.700619"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2006.tb00338.x"", ""10.1257/aer.20121637"", ""10.1017/S0022216X00005885"", ""10.1515/9781503625754"", ""10.1017/S1537592708081899"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511511110"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000175"", ""10.1093/ajcl/55.4.617"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190628512.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022002715587100"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000856"", ""10.1177/0010414004271082"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.01527.x"", ""10.1007/s12117-012-9175-z"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176040"", ""10.1177/0022002799043005003"", ""10.2307/2952354"", ""10.1515/9781685854133-011"", ""10.1111/lasr.12040"", ""10.1017/S1537592719003906""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/psrm.2021.64,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,How the refugee crisis and radical right parties shape party competition on immigration,"AbstractWhile the structure of party competition evolves slowly, crisis-like events can induce short-term change to the political agenda. This may be facilitated by challenger parties who might benefit from increased attention to issues they own. We study the dynamic of such shifts through mainstream parties’ response to the 2015 refugee crisis, which strongly affected public debate and election outcomes across Europe. Specifically, we analyse how parties changed their issue emphasis and positions regarding immigration before, during, and after the refugee crisis. Our study is based on a corpus of 120,000 press releases between 2013 and 2017 from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. We identify immigration-related press releases using a novel dictionary and estimate party positions. The resulting monthly salience and positions measures allow for studying changes in close time-intervals, providing crucial detail for disentangling the impact of the crisis itself and the contribution of right-wing parties. While we provide evidence that attention to immigration increased drastically for all parties during the crisis, radical right parties drove the attention of mainstream parties. However, the attention of mainstream parties to immigration decreased toward the end of the refugee crisis and there is limited evidence of parties accommodating the positions of the radical right.","[{""name"": ""Theresa Gessler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sophia Hunger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/1369183X.2017.1282813"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.818354"", ""10.1080/10584609.2016.1233920"", ""10.1080/01402382.2011.616665"", ""10.1080/01402382.2012.682349"", ""10.1177/0032321716650224"", ""10.21105/joss.00774"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2017.10.011"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00686.x"", ""10.1177/1354068810393265"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051701"", ""10.1017/S0007123406000226"", ""10.1017/9781108652780"", ""10.1093/pan/mpn004"", ""10.1177/1354068817694503"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00783.x"", ""10.1177/1354068809346002"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000155"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00074"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000698"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1531909"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1039381"", ""10.1111/lsq.12308"", ""10.1177/1354068805049734"", ""10.1177/1354068814549345"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.00841.x"", ""10.1080/17457289.2011.539483"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.04.004"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.2307/2297968"", ""10.1111/ajps.12000"", ""10.1177/2378023118760414"", ""10.1177/0010414014558257"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1101295"", ""10.1017/9781108652780.003"", ""10.1080/10584609.2018.1517843"", ""10.1017/9781108652780.013"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1609296"", ""10.1080/10584609.2010.516798"", ""10.1177/1354068810380097"", ""10.1177/1354068817713122"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs023"", ""10.1086/269431"", ""10.1080/01402380312331280598"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198842897.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1080/01402382.2018.1490484"", ""10.1080/10584609.2016.1201179"", ""10.17645/pag.v3i2.64"", ""10.1080/10584600902850718"", ""10.1111/spsr.12018"", ""10.1177/1354068817728211"", ""10.1080/01402382.2010.508901"", ""10.1177/0010414019858936"", ""10.1057/9781403920072_11"", ""10.1080/09644008.2018.1538362"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510298""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055420000519,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Hot Politics? Affective Responses to Political Rhetoric,"Canonical theories of opinion formation attribute an important role to affect. But how and for whom affect matters is theoretically underdeveloped. We establish the circumplex model in political science as a theory of core affect. In this theory unconscious emotional processes vary in level (arousal, measured with skin conductance) and direction (valence, measured with facial electromyography). We theorize that knowledge, attitude extremity, and (in)congruence with political rhetoric explain variation in affective responses. In a large lab study (N = 397), participants watched video clips with left-wing or right-wing rhetoric on prominent issues. We find that people with extreme attitudes experience more arousal in response to political rhetoric and that political rhetoric incongruent with prior attitudes evokes negative affect. Moreover, we show that affective responses lead to opinion change, independent of self-reported emotions. We conclude by setting a research agenda for the alignment between affective and cognitive components of emotions and their consequences.","[{""name"": ""BERT N.

In particular, we propose centering the study of the welfare state around those who occupy the margins of American society. We argue that concentrating on populations at the proverbial “bottom” of standard economic and political hierarchies productively reorients research on social policy and politics by bringing crucial but often overlooked facets of the welfare state into sharper view. Specifically, the bottom-up approach we offer here entreats political scientists to re-considerwherethey look in their efforts to delineate the welfare state,howto examine what they find, andwhatkinds of questions to ask in the process. Ultimately, studying the welfare state from the bottom up suggests a host of new directions for scholars seeking to understand its politics.","[{""name"": ""Jamila Michener"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mallory SoRelle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chloe Thurston"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226277813.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00613.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134534"", ""10.1515/9781400841318"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2006.10.004"", ""10.2307/2657333"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000456"", ""10.1515/9781438457611"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469653662.001.0001"", ""10.1086/703538"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-060415-093825"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817298"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2006.10.001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316181607"", ""10.2307/974990"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226356495.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001637"", ""10.1017/9781108380058"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226711829.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0898588X15000097"", ""10.1017/S153759270404040X"", ""10.1017/S0898588X0200007X"", ""10.1515/for-2017-0006"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199591527.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.3998/mpub.10131793"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511665080"", ""10.2307/796948"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195079197.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000333"", ""10.1093/0198297564.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1078087419855677"", ""10.3998/mpub.16475"", ""10.1017/S0043887109000185"", ""10.1215/03616878-4193618"", ""10.1176/ps.25.6.355"", ""10.7758/9781610448840"", ""10.58948/2331-3528.1839"", ""10.4159/9780674495425"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000305"", ""10.1017/9781108224987"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226768786.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592704000623"", ""10.1515/9781400830428"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199730346.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226140582.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592717000949"", ""10.4324/9780203883167"", ""10.1111/psj.12328"", ""10.1177/0032329202030002004"", ""10.1177/1078087419844831"", ""10.1177/0038040716666607"", ""10.7591/9781501725005"", ""10.1515/9780691222004-005"", ""10.1525/nclr.1999.2.2.681"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2006.10.003"", ""10.1007/s12552-016-9162-0"", ""10.1353/jph.2007.0012"", ""10.1080/07393140701523643"", ""10.1017/S1537592720002200"", ""10.9783/9780812209075"", ""10.2307/2095527"", ""10.4159/9780674043725"", ""10.1515/9781503625983"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805288"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy008"", ""10.4159/9780674981423"", ""10.1017/S1537592712001624"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226521664.001.0001"", ""10.7758/rsf.2019.5.1.07""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12428,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,From chasing populists to deconstructing populism: A new multidimensional approach to understanding and comparing populism,"AbstractThis paper challenges some widespread theoretical assumptions and practices in the study of populism and proposes a new multidimensional approach to generate and analyse data on this latent construct. Rather than focusing on categorising subjects as populists or not, it recommends reaching a better understanding of what populism is, the salience and relative weight of its attributes and how they interact creating an inner populist logic.Despite the increasing media and academic attention, historical discrepancies in how to conceptualise and operationalise populism have hindered cumulative progress in the literature. Initially most efforts were devoted to the study of specific movements, without a clear comparative angle, and the concept of populism was often conflated with that of nationalism. When the literature started to pay more attention to the analysis of the attributes associated with populism serious disagreements emerged concerning its true essence. Populism has been conceptualised as an ideology, a cynical strategy, a performative style and a discursive logic of articulation. The disputes between these competing interpretations have arguably slowed down the generation of comparative data.Although this article is meant to be a critique of the current state of the field and a call to make it pivot into a slightly different direction, it does not adopt an iconoclast stance and largely tries to reconcile the different existing research traditions – ideational, discursive, performative and strategic. It shows that their efforts are to a great extent complementary but mostly operating on different rungs of the ladder of abstraction. This paper argues that shifting from minimal definitions into a multidimensional approach may stimulate the generation of comparative data on a wider range of attributes and facilitate the identification of degrees and varieties within populism.This paper develops a new analytical framework which deconstructs populism into five dimensions: (1) depiction of the polity, (2) morality, (3) construction of society, (4) sovereignty and (5) leadership. These dimensions, that synthesise the most influential conceptualisations of populism, are empirically and theoretically interconnected and encompass ideational, discursive and performative attributes suggested in the literature. These dimensions are in turn composed of lower order attributes forming a multilayered network structure. This multidimensional framework provides a heuristic template that can be adapted and operationalised in diverse ways depending on the hypotheses, type of data and subjects of the analysis. Some examples of how to turn these dimensions into variables to capture supply‐ and demand‐side populism are introduced. Future empirical research could help map and better understand the network of interactions and intersections among these dimensions and attributes. This could be the key to settle some of the current conceptual debates about populism and its varieties.","[{""name"": ""JOSÉ JAVIER OLIVAS OSUNA"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science and Administration National Distance Education University (UNED) Madrid Spain"", ""LSE Ideas The London School of Economics and Political Science, UK""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1353/sor.2013.0020"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12224"", ""10.4135/9781849209731.n8"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.1968.tb01332.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1596694"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2875372"", ""10.1007/BF00154696"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.1111/nana.12522"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1057/9781403920072_2"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1596690"", ""10.1111/spsr.12270"", ""10.1177/1065912919833176"", ""10.2307/2938818"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.1163/25888072-02011021"", ""10.1111/j.1747-1346.2009.00200.x"", ""10.1525/9780520968042"", ""10.1080/13569317.2016.1260813"", ""10.2307/3235246"", ""10.1515/9781400842995"", ""10.1177/0010414009331721"", ""10.25222/larr.85"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.43"", ""10.1017/S1537592717000111"", ""10.1057/s41269-018-0105-1"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.2307/jj.17912858"", ""10.4324/9781315680903-2"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.887879"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226471013.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62855-4"", ""10.1080/14782800903108635"", ""10.1057/9781403920072_1"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12032"", ""10.1177/1354068819868908"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139152365"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12126"", ""10.9783/9780812293784"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198837886.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0032321716647400"", ""10.1353/wp.1995.0004"", ""10.2307/20433986"", ""10.1353/sais.2007.0018"", ""10.1007/s41111-019-00117-1"", ""10.1057/s42214-018-0001-4"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.30"", ""10.2307/1958356"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edw037"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199832637.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13569310701822289"", ""10.1080/1356931042000263519"", ""10.1080/13569317.2014.909266"", ""10.1353/sais.2007.0019"", ""10.3406/mots.1984.1167"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12216"", ""10.1111/jcms.12093"", ""10.2307/422412"", ""10.5040/9781472544940"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000807"", ""10.1515/9780773586109""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/ipo.2021.17,ITALIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI SCIENZA POLITICA,0302 Political Science,Belief in conspiracy theories and attitudes toward political violence,"AbstractIn the last decade, political protest events have been rising in Western democracies. At the same time, there has been a steady increase in the diffusion of conspiracy theories in political communication, a phenomenon that has captured the interest of scholars for its growing political relevance. However, while most research focuses on the reasons why citizens believe in conspiracies, studies looking at the political-behavioral implications of such beliefs, in particular their connection to political radicalism, have been more limited. In this paper, we investigate the association between people's belief in conspiracies and their propensity to endorse political violence or to legitimate radical political action. Building on pathway theories of radicalization, we argue that conspiracy theories provide narratives that might help people channel their feelings of resentment toward political targets, fueling radical attitudes. We provide some correlational evidence using survey data of US respondents collected on MTurk. We observe attitudes toward political violence using two multi-item batteries, one developed by us. Our results show that people who score higher on a scale of generic conspiracy belief are also more likely to endorse violent political actions.","[{""name"": ""Federico Vegetti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Levente Littvay"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/a0033852"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.60.2.161"", ""10.2307/3791566"", ""10.1002/ejsp.1922"", ""10.1177/2053168015622072"", ""10.2307/2564659"", ""10.1037/gpr0000144"", ""10.1080/09546553.2011.587064"", ""10.1177/0956797612457686"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.1057/9780230349216"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00424"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279"", ""10.1111/pops.12015"", ""10.5038/1944-0472.4.4.1"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.63.3.452"", ""10.1080/13608746.2017.1359894"", ""10.1037/a0032615"", ""10.1177/1948550619896491"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00432.x"", ""10.1177/1948550611434786"", ""10.1177/0032321720972616"", ""10.1080/09546550802073367"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8295.2010.02004.x"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1177/109442810141004"", ""10.1037/pas0000217"", ""10.1111/bjop.12018"", ""10.1111/pops.12163"", ""10.1007/978-1-4612-4618-3_9"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00225"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2009.03.009"", ""10.1002/acp.1583"", ""10.2307/3791630"", ""10.2466/PR0.105.2.389-393"", ""10.1177/0002716208317051"", ""10.1002/per.1930"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199351800.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1948550614567356"", ""10.1177/0010414012453032"", ""10.1080/00313220601118751"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00160"", ""10.1177/004931032002001"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2494"", ""10.1080/14792772043000040"", ""10.1111/ajps.12084"", ""10.1111/spsr.12270""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S1752971919000216,INTERNATIONAL THEORY,0302 Political Science,Backlash against human rights shaming: emotions in groups,"AbstractHuman rights advocates continue to use shaming as a central tool despite recognizing its declining effectiveness. Shame is indeed a potent motivator, but its effects are often counterproductive for this purpose. Especially when wielded by cultural outsiders in ways that appear to condemn local social practices, shaming is likely to produce anger, resistance, backlash, and deviance from outgroup norms, or denial and evasion. Shaming can easily be interpreted as a show of contempt, which risks triggering fears for the autonomy and security of the group. In these circumstances, established religious and elite networks can employ traditional normative counter-narratives to recruit a popular base for resistance. If this counter-mobilization becomes entrenched in mass social movements, popular ideology, and enduring institutions, the unintended consequences of shaming may leave human rights advocates farther from their goal.","[{""name"": ""Jack Snyder"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00548.x"", ""10.1017/9781316856444"", ""10.1080/01436590120043309"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420010202"", ""10.1017/9781108241588.012"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226304007.003.0008"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77hg2"", ""10.1111/0735-2751.00089"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139106931.012"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00694.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2012.02316.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139871532"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00276"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000244"", ""10.1017/S0020818309990221"", ""10.2307/2096305"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139106931.005"", ""10.1111/j.1471-0374.2009.00263.x"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy005"", ""10.1111/ajps.12119"", ""10.1017/9781108186100"", ""10.1515/9781400852987"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00212"", ""10.1525/9780520342057"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1243897"", ""10.1080/09636412.2011.549017"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080247"", ""10.1177/0010414018784066"", ""10.1017/9781108147767.005"", ""10.1353/sor.2003.0013"", ""10.1162/016228800560327"", ""10.1017/9781108147767.007"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316161555"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000254"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027910"", ""10.1375/acri.35.3.269"", ""10.1525/ae.1982.9.4.02a00040"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00087"", ""10.1017/S1537592705050401"", ""10.1177/0022343313510014"", ""10.1017/9781108241588.011"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000337"", ""10.1017/S0020818304582024"", ""10.1080/09636412.2016.1220203"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000097"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2011.10.017"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000163"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1515/9781503601024"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139106931"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777"", ""10.1073/pnas.1514699113"", ""10.31899/rh8.1002"", ""10.1093/sf/sot078"", ""10.1177/0957926513486223"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00044"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139237161"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190274917.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804618"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1111/lasr.12044"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00496.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00732.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794349.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511813245"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000070"", ""10.1017/S000305541900025X"", ""10.1017/9781108763493"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511761584"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139237161.011""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muaa027,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Are Citizens More Negative About Failing Service Delivery by Public Than Private Organizations? Evidence From a Large-Scale Survey Experiment,"AbstractCitizens’ perceptions of the performance of public service providers are a central concern for academics and policy-makers alike. A growing body of behavioral public administration research emphasizes the psychological biases that shape the perceptions of citizens. This article makes a novel contribution to this debate by examining the interaction between politically motivated bias and cognitive bias in citizens’ performance appraisals. It asks: Are citizens more negative about failing service delivery by public organizations than by private organizations, and if so, why? This is investigated through a survey experiment conducted among a representative sample of 2,623 Dutch citizens. The main finding of the study is that public organizations are punished more severely by citizens for negative performance information than private organizations, but this tendency is concentrated among citizens who have a preference for private service provision and varies across service areas. Our study shows not only that citizens’ processing of information about public services is subject to various forms of bias, but also that these biases interact in shaping how citizens view public organizations. Further investigating these complex dynamics is an important task for behavioral public administration scholars seeking to understand the specific implications of behavioral dynamics for the broad range of organizations providing public services.","[{""name"": ""Petra van den Bekerom"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Public Administration at Leiden University""]}, {""name"": ""Joris van der Voet"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Public Administration at Leiden University""]}, {""name"": ""Johan Christensen"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Public Administration at Leiden University""]}]","[""10.1080/14719037.2012.725757"", ""10.1111/puar.12406"", ""10.1086/681591"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00284"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760587.009"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990089"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur030"", ""10.1111/padm.12390"", ""10.1111/puar.12609"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00779.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy064"", ""10.1111/puar.12441"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01962.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq057"", ""10.1111/padm.12066"", ""10.1177/0275074015580390"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul020"", ""10.1111/gove.12317"", ""10.2307/1914185"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.996627"", ""10.1017/S1049096513000577"", ""10.1111/puar.13067"", ""10.1017/S1930297500006021"", ""10.1111/puar.12337"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-10541-7"", ""10.1111/padm.12213"", ""10.1080/10967490801887970"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut038""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/rego.12367,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Algorithmic governance: A modes of governance approach,"AbstractThis article examines how modes of governance are reconfigured as a result of using algorithms in the governance process. We argue that deploying algorithmic systems creates a shift toward a special form of design‐based governance, with power exercisedex antevia choice architectures defined through protocols, requiring lower levels of commitment from governing actors. We use governance of three policy problems – speeding, disinformation, and social sharing – to illustrate what happens when algorithms are deployed to enable coordination in modes of hierarchical governance, self‐governance, and co‐governance. Our analysis shows that algorithms increase efficiency while decreasing the space for governing actors' discretion. Furthermore, we compare the effects of algorithms in each of these cases and explore sources of convergence and divergence between the governance modes. We suggest design‐based governance modes that rely on algorithmic systems might be re‐conceptualized as algorithmic governance to account for the prevalence of algorithms and the significance of their effects.","[{""name"": ""Daria Gritsenko"", ""affiliation"": [""Aleksanteri Institute and Helsinki Center for Digital Humanities (HELDIG) University of Helsinki Helsinki Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Matthew Wood"", ""affiliation"": [""The Department of Politics University of Sheffield Sheffield UK""]}]","[""10.1145/3290605.3300760"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.211"", ""10.1177/1478077118778586"", ""10.1215/9780822387534"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01352.x"", ""10.1126/science.aal4321"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1216147"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1461444812440159"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.1080/13563467.2016.1216533"", ""10.4337/9781845421663"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1gk0941"", ""10.1177/2053951717726554"", ""10.1177/0170840606067250"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12888"", ""10.4324/9781315211909-8"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1473476"", ""10.1177/1077800405284363"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5658.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262525374.003.0009"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.11.011"", ""10.1093/ej/uez054"", ""10.1332/030557317X15053060139376"", ""10.1002/poi3.152"", ""10.1177/0163443716643157"", ""10.1145/2702123.2702520"", ""10.4324/9781315253633"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1154087"", ""10.1080/00332925.2017.1314699"", ""10.4135/9781446215012"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01780.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199256044.001.0001"", ""10.14763/2019.2.1415"", ""10.4337/9780857939852.00028"", ""10.1177/2053951719867349"", ""10.2307/1229391"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080213-041033"", ""10.1098/rsta.2012.0382"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.001"", ""10.4324/9781315142036"", ""10.1177/0002764217701217"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.1111/1468-2230.00392"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1156141"", ""10.1162/INOV_a_00056"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.10.008"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674736061"", ""10.1080/23736992.2016.1152897"", ""10.1177/0170840607076586"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199689583.003.0005"", ""10.1177/2056305117706784"", ""10.14763/2016.2.409"", ""10.1177/2053951717738104"", ""10.1006/ijhc.1999.0349"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01753.x"", ""10.1177/0306312717741687"", ""10.1080/135017606061071406"", ""10.1109/MC.2018.2888774"", ""10.1177/1354856512457548"", ""10.1111/jcc4.12006"", ""10.1177/0952076714529139"", ""10.1080/19460171.2015.1052003"", ""10.5235/175799611796399812"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1186713"", ""10.1111/rego.12158"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198838494.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0162243915605575"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.001""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Safety Research', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1093/isr/viz040,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"What Isn't a Norm? Redefining the Conceptual Boundaries of ""Norms"" in the Human Rights Literature","AbstractWhat makes the “norm” a distinct concept? How do norms differ from other aspects of the moral and social fabric of society? In this article I argue that imposing stricter boundaries on the norm concept could have significant analytical payoffs, especially in the human rights literature. Greater conceptual clarity on the boundaries of the norm concept highlights three important distinctions: the difference between norms and moral principles, norms and supererogatory standards, and norms and formal law. Clarifying what a norm is (and, importantly, what it is not) improves our analytic equipment and theories, but the inquiry is not purely a theoretical exercise. Clarifying the norm concept enables us to ask new questions about, and rethink old findings on issues like the role of shaming in human rights advocacy, the origins of norms and challenges to their construction, what constitutes evidence of the existence of a norm, and whether, in fact, all human rights have been translated into norms.","[{""name"": ""Michelle Jurkovich"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Massachusetts Boston""]}]","[""10.1162/002081800551271"", ""10.1177/0022002798042001001"", ""10.1017/S175297191000031X"", ""10.1177/1354066108089244"", ""10.1017/S1537592703000471"", ""10.1002/ejsp.640"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781261"", ""10.1177/1354066197003004003"", ""10.1353/wp.1997.0009"", ""10.1257/jep.3.4.99"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-17807-8_14"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000070"", ""10.1093/jrs/fer028"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1162/00208180152507614"", ""10.2307/2600716"", ""10.1177/0047117806063844"", ""10.15171/ijhpm.2015.171"", ""10.1086/223933"", ""10.1177/0022002792036004002"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00580.x"", ""10.1163/19426720-02202005"", ""10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131606"", ""10.1093/he/9780199644704.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022002707303046"", ""10.4324/9781315588483"", ""10.1177/1354066110363502"", ""10.1177/0010836702037001689"", ""10.1515/9781501751189"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00798.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559044"", ""10.1080/10736700.2016.1157246"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.57"", ""10.1111/ajps.12178"", ""10.1162/002081898550699"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw036"", ""10.1162/002081800551163"", ""10.1017/S000305540707027X"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00694.x"", ""10.1177/1354066101007001002"", ""10.1162/002081898550671"", ""10.4159/9780674042605"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491641"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777.002"", ""10.1353/hrq.2004.0010"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195337235.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1958356"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00044"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1017/S0043887109000045"", ""10.2307/2944711"", ""10.15171/ijhpm.2016.29"", ""10.2307/2026228""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12373,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Voter mobilisation in the echo chamber: Broadband internet and the rise of populism in Europe,"AbstractCan the diffusion of broadband internet help explain the recent success of populist parties in Europe? Populists cultivate an anti‐elitist communication style, which, they claim, directly connects them with ordinary people. The internet therefore appears to be the perfect tool for populist leaders. This study shows that this notion holds up to rigorous empirical testing. Drawing on survey data from Italy and Germany, a positive correlation is found between use of the internet as a source of political information and voting for populist parties. By instrumenting internet use with broadband coverage at the municipality level, the study then demonstrates that this relationship is causal. The findings suggest that part of the rise of populism can be attributed to the effect of online tools and communication strategies made possible by the proliferation of broadband access.","[{""name"": ""MAX SCHAUB"", ""affiliation"": [""Berlin Social Science Center (WZB)  Germany""]}, {""name"": ""DAVIDE MORISI"", ""affiliation"": [""Collegio Carlo Alberto  Turin Italy""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315623016"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00304.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12224"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0143611"", ""10.1080/09644008.2014.982546"", ""10.2307/3235370"", ""10.1080/13608746.2013.775720"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvx044"", ""10.1177/1940161216645340"", ""10.1111/spsr.12270"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.1177/1940161218790035"", ""10.1080/17457289.2012.718280"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697"", ""10.1257/aer.104.7.2238"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2014.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.04.003"", ""10.1177/0267323112465369"", ""10.1177/2053168018773964"", ""10.1017/S1537592717000111"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00690.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1995.tb00487.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.887879"", ""10.5964/jspp.v5i2.745"", ""10.1111/ajps.12237"", ""10.31222/osf.io/s42ba"", ""10.1080/13608746.2017.1359894"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003274"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12314"", ""10.1017/ipo.2016.22"", ""10.1080/09644008.2016.1184650"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000513"", ""10.2307/j.ctvk12sz4"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1080/10584609.2016.1224416""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1146/annurev-polisci-060418-042842,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VOL 23",0302 Political Science,Understanding the Role of Racism in Contemporary US Public Opinion,"In the contemporary context, it is inescapable that racism is a factor in US public opinion. When scholars take stock of the way we typically measure and conceptualize racism, we find reason to reconceptualize the racial resentment scale as a measure of perceptions of the reasons for political inequality. We also see reason to move beyond thinking of racism as an attitude, toward conceptualizing it as a perspective. In addition, we see reason to pay closer attention to the role of elites in creating and perpetuating a role for racism in the way people think about public affairs. The study of racism is evolving in parallel with the broader public discussion: toward a recognition of the complex and fundamental ways it is woven into US culture and political life.","[{""name"": ""Katherine Cramer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA;""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400882731"", ""10.1016/j.soscij.2011.09.006"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00561.x"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1457287"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9135-8"", ""10.2307/1388607"", ""10.2307/2096302"", ""10.5040/9798216188131.ch-002"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1nzfgvw"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2017.303945"", ""10.1007/s10940-016-9319-4"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226065090.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.04.001"", ""10.1111/soin.12136"", ""10.1016/j.soscij.2013.10.014"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226869087.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000305"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.56.1.5"", ""10.1111/pops.12013"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.82.1.62"", ""10.1111/1745-9125.12178"", ""10.1017/9781108354943"", ""10.4324/9780203076828"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9326-4"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12418"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12028"", ""10.1111/psq.12394"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00755.x"", ""10.1215/03616878-3802977"", ""10.1177/1532673X18772280"", ""10.1177/1088868309352179"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12158"", ""10.1007/s11109-014-9297-x"", ""10.1086/692785"", ""10.1215/03616878-1460533"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00281"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00192.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.062906.070752"", ""10.1017/S1742058X14000198"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976612.006"", ""10.1017/9781108645157"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs051"", ""10.1086/693907"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226435725.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12322"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12184"", ""10.1177/1532673X17701222"", ""10.1177/0731121415587605"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226137971.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12315"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12488"", ""10.1515/9781400889181"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1177/1065912908320450"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9060-2"", ""10.1177/1532673X12452909"", ""10.1111/pops.12028"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0077552"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9462-8"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074246"", ""10.1093/poq/nfu012"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp079"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.277"", ""10.1177/1532673X17692326"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00784.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9422-8"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.11.003"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9108-y"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2009.00726.x"", ""10.1177/1065912914531091"", ""10.4324/9781315164236-7"", ""10.1017/S1049096518000355"", ""10.1111/asap.12130"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mmb"", ""10.2307/420124"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1986.tb00229.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226768786.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000904"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00577.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226353159.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226793849.001.0001"", ""10.1080/07393148.2017.1378296"", ""10.1080/17457289.2018.1441846"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.09.006"", ""10.1177/1065912916685186"", ""10.1086/703538"", ""10.1093/poq/nft026"", ""10.1177/0002716210388477"", ""10.1093/poq/nfx050"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.07.003"", ""10.1017/S1742058X14000332"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00191.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226902388.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802874"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00440.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This Article argues, contrary to dominant scholarly views, that this effort transformed international tax—changing its participants, agenda, institutions, norms, and even its legal forms. Perhaps most important, efforts to close corporate tax loopholes widened a rift over revenues that threatens a hundred-year-old tax treaty framework.

10.1017/S1537592720001164,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,The Qualitative Transparency Deliberations: Insights and Implications,"In recent years, a variety of efforts have been made in political science to enable, encourage, or require scholars to be more open and explicit about the bases of their empirical claims and, in turn, make those claims more readily evaluable by others. While qualitative scholars have long taken an interest in making their research open, reflexive, and systematic, the recent push for overarching transparency norms and requirements has provoked serious concern within qualitative research communities and raised fundamental questions about the meaning, value, costs, and intellectual relevance of transparency for qualitative inquiry. In this Perspectives Reflection, we crystallize the central findings of a three-year deliberative process—the Qualitative Transparency Deliberations (QTD)—involving hundreds of political scientists in a broad discussion of these issues. Following an overview of the process and the key insights that emerged, we present summaries of the QTD Working Groups’ final reports. Drawing on a series of public, online conversations that unfolded at www.qualtd.net, the reports unpack transparency’s promise, practicalities, risks, and limitations in relation to different qualitative methodologies, forms of evidence, and research contexts. Taken as a whole, these reports—the full versions of which can be found in the Supplementary Materials—offer practical guidance to scholars designing and implementing qualitative research, and to editors, reviewers, and funders seeking to develop criteria of evaluation that are appropriate—as understood by relevant research communities—to the forms of inquiry being assessed. We dedicate this Reflection to the memory of our coauthor and QTD working group leader Kendra Koivu.1","[{""name"": ""Alan M.

However, research has yet to explore and explain the nature of attacks that seek to destabilize a leader's influence. Building on the identity leadership model which sees leadership as flowing from a leader's capacity to promote a sense of shared identity with followers, we argue that a leader can be destabilized if followers come to see the leader as defiling, devaluing, dividing, and destroying this shared sense of “us.” To explore these ideas, we analyzed the attack rhetoric used by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 U.S. presidential debates to examine how they sought to subvert each other's leadership. Our analysis supports the proposed model and sheds light on the hitherto underexplored topic of leadership destabilization. Moreover, by helping us understand the ways in which principles of identity leadership can be weaponized to destabilize leadership, the analysis defines an important agenda for future research.","[{""name"": ""Mazlan Maskor"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Queensland""]}, {""name"": ""Niklas K.

10.1111/ajps.12503,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,The Political Consequences of External Economic Shocks: Evidence from Poland,"AbstractHow do external economic shocks influence domestic politics? We argue that those materially exposed to the shock will display systematic differences in policy preferences and voting behavior compared to the unexposed, and political parties can exploit these circumstances. Empirically, we take advantage of the 2015 surprise revaluation of the Swiss franc to identify the Polish citizens with direct economic exposure to this exogenous event. Using an original survey fielded prior to the 2015 elections and an embedded survey experiment, we show that exposed individuals were more likely to demand government support and more likely to desert the government and vote for the largest opposition party, which was able to use the shock to expand its electoral coalition without alienating its core voters. Our article clarifies the connection between international shocks, voters’ policy preferences, partisan policy responses, and, ultimately, voting decisions.","[{""name"": ""John Ahlquist"", ""affiliation"": [""UC San Diego""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Copelovitch"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Wisconsin–Madison""]}, {""name"": ""Stefanie Walter"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zurich""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00199.x"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691158563.001.0001"", ""10.1162/0033553042476206"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12621"", ""10.1111/ecpo.12111"", ""10.3386/w22637"", ""10.1111/ajps.12203"", ""10.1111/ajps.12079"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-22596-8_9"", ""10.1016/S2212-5671(15)01261-7"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.1177/0010414013488559"", ""10.1177/1354068818816967"", ""10.3386/w21812"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-020614-095051"", ""10.1177/0010414016633224"", ""10.1515/9781400865345"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2016.03.006"", ""10.1080/03050629.2014.899219"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiy018"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3289741"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02050.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139871464"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12122"", ""10.18637/jss.v045.i07"", ""10.1111/spsr.12278"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000194"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000275"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.41"", ""10.1111/ajps.12362"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2681050"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12055"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00589.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12012"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090158"", ""10.1017/S000305541000050X"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000603"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1177305"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.5129/001041516818254428"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy020"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1307245"", ""10.1017/S0003055402004227"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000394"", ""10.1177/0010414017710264"", ""10.1177/1354068815596514"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0022"", ""10.1177/0010414010384371"", ""10.1111/ajps.12165"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000485"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080144"", ""10.1177/0010414015617967"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139236812"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.64""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Until now, sparse data has limited our ability to establish such gaps and to formulate theories for explaining them. This article offers the first systematic comparative analysis of elite and citizen perceptions of the legitimacy of IOs. It examines legitimacy beliefs toward six key IOs, drawing on uniquely coordinated survey evidence from Brazil, Germany, the Philippines, Russia, and the United States. We find a notable elite–citizen gap for all six IOs, four of the five countries, and all of six different elite types. Developing an individual-level approach to legitimacy beliefs, we argue that this gap is driven by systematic differences between elites and citizens in characteristics that matter for attitudes toward IOs. Our findings suggest that deep-seated differences between elites and general publics may present major challenges for democratic and effective international cooperation.","[{""name"": ""LISA DELLMUTH"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JAN AART SCHOLTE"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JONAS TALLBERG"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SOETKIN VERHAEGEN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0020818320000491"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107284142"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12842"", ""10.1177/1465116513491018"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9330-7"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000034"", ""10.1515/til-2013-021"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9334-3"", ""10.1177/1465116505057816"", ""10.1017/S0260210514000230"", ""10.1177/1465116500001002001"", ""10.1177/14651165030043002"", ""10.1515/9781400823703"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050307"", ""10.1111/isqu.12134"", ""10.1177/1465116518757702"", ""10.1111/ajps.12583"", ""10.1177/1465116502003004001"", ""10.1177/1465116519857162"", ""10.3998/mpub.15828"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060140"", ""10.1198/jbes.2010.07136"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00343.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198819974.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790751"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00010035"", ""10.4324/9780203966242"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9339-y"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx022"", ""10.1017/S1537592717000111"", ""10.2307/2110458"", ""10.1017/S0003055400185077"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199602315.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793380.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108652698"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09354-0"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511845369"", ""10.1017/S1537592719000744"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042214-044157"", ""10.1080/15705850701322418"", ""10.1177/1354066121994320"", ""10.1177/0010414008324992"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7093.2006.00043.x"", ""10.1057/s42214-018-0001-4"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198826873.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.7910/DVN/NDHWX0"", ""10.1093/0198295685.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11558-010-9088-z"", ""10.1017/S0007123402000157"", ""10.1016/S0022-1996(00)00094-5"", ""10.1525/9780520340503"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000373"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027697""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1093/fpa/orab009,FOREIGN POLICY ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,"Soldiers, Pollsters, and International Crises: Public Opinion and the Military's Advice on the Use of Force","Abstract When advising civilian leaders on the use of force, are nonelected officials swayed by public opinion? Scholars have long debated whether public preferences affect foreign policy, but most studies focus on elected politicians, overlooking the nonelected officials who formulate policies and advise leaders. Bureaucrats and nonelected officials are expected to provide advice based on technical expertise, yet they may have institutional incentives and civic-minded reasons to recommend actions that align with popular preferences. This potentially creates additional channels through which public opinion influences policy decisions. An original survey experiment fielded on US military officers reveals that public opposition makes military leaders less likely to recommend the use of force. This article contributes to debates on the role of public opinion in foreign policymaking, integrates research on public opinion and civil–military relations, and yields broader insights for scholars studying the behavior of officials who are not subject to electoral incentives. Al asesorar a los dirigentes civiles sobre el uso de la fuerza, los funcionarios no electos ¿se dejan influir por la opinión pública? Los estudiosos llevan mucho tiempo debatiendo si las preferencias del público afectan a la política exterior, pero la mayoría de los trabajos se centran en los políticos electos, pasando por alto a los funcionarios no electos que formulan las políticas y asesoran a los líderes. Se espera que los burócratas y los funcionarios no electos ofrezcan un asesoramiento basado en la experiencia técnica, pero que puedan tener incentivos institucionales y razones de carácter cívico para recomendar acciones que se alineen con las preferencias populares. Potencialmente, esto crea canales adicionales a través de los cuales la opinión pública influye en las decisiones políticas. Una original encuesta realizada a oficiales militares estadounidenses revela que la oposición pública hace que los líderes militares sean menos propensos a recomendar el uso de la fuerza. Este trabajo contribuye a los debates sobre el papel de la opinión pública en la construcción de la política exterior, integra la investigación sobre la opinión pública y las relaciones cívico–militares, y aporta una visión más amplia para los estudiosos que evalúan el comportamiento de los funcionarios que no son objeto de incentivos electorales. Les officiels non élus sont-ils influencés par l'opinion publique lorsqu'ils conseillent des dirigeants civils sur le recours à la force? Des chercheurs ont longuement débattu pour déterminer si les préférences publiques affectaient la politique étrangère, mais la plupart des études se concentrent sur les politiciens élus en négligeant les officiels non élus qui formulent les politiques et conseillent les dirigeants. Les bureaucrates et officiels non élus sont supposés prodiguer des conseils reposant sur une expertise technique, mais ils peuvent toutefois avoir des motivations institutionnelles et des raisons d'ordre civique de recommander des mesures alignées sur les préférences populaires. Cela crée potentiellement des canaux supplémentaires par lesquels l'opinion publique influence les décisions politiques. Une expérience d'enquête originale menée sur des officiers de l'Armée américaine révèle que l'opposition publique rend les dirigeants militaires moins susceptibles de recommander le recours à la force. Cet article contribue aux débats sur le rôle de l'opinion publique dans l’élaboration de la politique étrangère en y intégrant des recherches sur l'opinion publique et sur les relations entre civils et militaires et en apportant des renseignements plus larges aux chercheurs qui étudient le comportement des officiels qui ne sont pas sujets à des motivations électorales.","[{""name"": ""Erik Lin-Greenberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA""]}]","[""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.111605.105008"", ""10.1177/0002716295537000013"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00374"", ""10.1177/0095327X9802400302"", ""10.2307/2991728"", ""10.1002/9780470754948"", ""10.2307/2944796"", ""10.1177/0095327X16687067"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx022"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjf9wx3"", ""10.1111/j.0268-2141.2003.00051.x"", ""10.1086/218693"", ""10.1111/ajps.12493"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.84.3.231"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226644592.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1956018"", ""10.1177/0022002791035004003"", ""10.1515/9781400824458"", ""10.2307/977164"", ""10.1017/9781108667357.011"", ""10.2307/977384"", ""10.1017/S0020818319000341""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

We define placebo tests as tools for assessing the plausibility of the assumptions underlying a research design relative to some departure from those assumptions. We offer a typology of tests defined by the aspect of the research design that is altered to produce it (outcome, treatment, or population) and the type of assumption that is tested (bias assumptions or distributional assumptions). Our formal framework clarifies the extra assumptions necessary for informative placebo tests; these assumptions can be strong, and in some cases similar assumptions would justify a different procedure allowing the researcher to relax the research design's assumptions rather than test them. Properly designed and interpreted, placebo tests can be an important device for assessing the credibility of empirical research designs.","[{""name"": ""Andrew C.

10.1017/S0260210520000248,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,Participatory authoritarianism: From bureaucratic transformation to civic participation in Russia and China,"AbstractThis article explores the way in which Russian and Chinese governments have rearticulated global trends towards active citizenship and participatory governance, and integrated them into pre-existing illiberal political traditions. The concept of ‘participatory authoritarianism’ is proposed in order to capture the resulting practices of local governance that, on the one hand enable citizens to engage directly with local officials in the policy process, but limit, direct, and control civic participation on the other. The article explores the emergence of discourses of active citizenship at the national level and the accompanying legislative development of government-organised participatory mechanisms, demonstrating how the twin logics of openness and control, pluralism and monism, are built into their rationale and implementation. It argues that as state bureaucracies have integrated into international financial markets, so new participatory mechanisms have become more important for local governance as government agencies have lost the monopoly of information for effective policymaking. Practices of participatory authoritarianism enable governments to implement public sector reform while directing increased civic agency into non-threatening channels.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Owen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/08935696.2013.843250"", ""10.1080/09692299408434268"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2006.03.004"", ""10.1111/j.1943-0787.2010.01201.x"", ""10.1177/0010414015617960"", ""10.1017/S1468109918000300"", ""10.4324/9780203828458"", ""10.1080/09668136.2017.1301882"", ""10.1007/s12116-007-9014-4"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9781474403337.001.0001"", ""10.2753/RSP1061-1967470401"", ""10.1080/03085140600960773"", ""10.17265/2159-5526/2015.01.004"", ""10.4159/9780674973459"", ""10.1177/000312240507000601"", ""10.1017/S1537592718004024"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139600002"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12166"", ""10.1017/9781108348997"", ""10.1080/00420980500279869"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199677160.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580576.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00003524"", ""10.1515/9781400886920"", ""10.1080/14747731.2017.1403781"", ""10.1093/ia/iiy060"", ""10.4324/9780203697078"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226736785.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108561563"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198806486.001.0001"", ""10.4337/9781788972192"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1267714"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2006.03.005"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.24.1.39"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511779831"", ""10.4324/9780203387818"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840012"", ""10.1353/jod.2002.0003"", ""10.1017/S1537592711000892"", ""10.1111/ajps.12207"", ""10.1561/100.00012051"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316771785"", ""10.1525/as.2003.43.5.845"", ""10.1177/0888325413506933"", ""10.1007/s12116-011-9088-x"", ""10.1080/13510340902777800"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510274"", ""10.1017/S0007123409990330"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139839396"", ""10.1017/gov.2017.13"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316417720"", ""10.1177/0010414007305817"", ""10.1080/14631379708427888"", ""10.4135/9781446213551"", ""10.1080/03003930600896277"", ""10.1080/14747731.2018.1502497"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1267713"", ""10.22140/cpar.v5i1/2.81"", ""10.1163/18763316-04103003"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510090"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1250250"", ""10.1353/wp.2002.0009"", ""10.1017/S175297191000031X"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190205782.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13510340701635647"", ""10.2307/j.ctt155jmv1"", ""10.5612/slavicreview.75.2.331"", ""10.1177/0263276406064831"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199680320.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03085140600960799"", ""10.1017/S0010417500009282"", ""10.1177/030437540102600201"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139683524"", ""10.22439/fs.v0i0.2471"", ""10.1080/09668136.2018.1447089"", ""10.1080/21599165.2015.1023894"", ""10.1002/pam.21651"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199683628.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12225"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491160"", ""10.1017/S0305741009990567"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199336203.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2012.06.010"", ""10.1177/0010414011407466"", ""10.1080/17516234.2013.850221"", ""10.1080/10670564.2018.1389003"", ""10.1057/palgrave.polity.2300083""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055422000818,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Moderates,"Moderates are often overlooked in contemporary research on American voters. Many scholars who have examined moderates argue that these individuals are only classified as such due to a lack of political sophistication or conflicted views across issues. We develop a method to distinguish three ways an individual might be classified as moderate: having genuinely moderate views across issues, being inattentive to politics or political surveys, or holding views poorly summarized by a single liberal–conservative dimension. We find that a single ideological dimension accurately describes most, but not all, Americans’ policy views. Using the classifications from our model, we demonstrate that moderates and those whose views are not well explained by a single dimension are especially consequential for electoral selection and accountability. These results suggest a need for renewed attention to the middle of the American political spectrum.","[{""name"": ""ANTHONY FOWLER"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SETH J.

This paper provides an initial understanding of some driving factors and their consequences. Since transmission requires people, the human factor behind globalisation is essential. Globalisation, a major force behind global well‐being and equality, is highly associated with this factor. The analysis investigates the impact globalisation has on the speed of initial transmission to a country and on the scale of initial infections in the context of other driving factors. Our cross‐country analysis finds that measures of globalisation are positively related to the spread of the virus, both in speed and in scale. However, the study also finds that globalised countries are better equipped to keep fatality rates low. The conclusion is not to reduce globalisation to avoid pandemics, but to better monitor the human factor at the outbreak and mobilise collaboration forces to curtail diseases.","[{""name"": ""Klaus F.

The first is the revival of Tsarist imperial nationalist and White Russian émigré nationalist denials of the existence of Ukraine and Ukrainians. Russian imperial nationalists believe the eastern Slavs constitute a pan Russian nation of Great Russians, Little Russians and White Russian branches of one Russian nation. The second is the cult of the Great Patriotic War and Joseph Stalin and the revival of Soviet era discourse on Ukrainian Nazis (i.e., nationalists). A Ukrainian nationalist in the Soviet Union and Vladimir Putin's Russia is any Ukrainian who seeks a future for his/her country outside the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Russian World and who upholds an ethnic Ukrainian (rather than a Little Russian) identity. The Russian World is the new core of the Eurasian Economic Union, Russian President Vladimir Putin's alternative to the EU's Eastern Partnership. In the contemporary domain, Ukrainian nationalists are Nazi's irrespective of their language preference or political beliefs and if they do not accept they are Little Russians. Putin's invasion goal of denazification is a genocidal goal to eradicate the ‘anti‐Russia’ that has allegedly been nurtured by Ukrainian nationalists and the West.","[{""name"": ""Taras Kuzio"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy  Kyiv Ukraine""]}]","[""10.1515/9781474410434-006"", ""10.2747/1060-586X.19.4.289"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2017.10.001"", ""10.1080/13518046.2019.1684002"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2019.10.007"", ""10.1080/15387216.2019.1703777"", ""10.1080/1060586X.2015.1023004"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2016.01.002"", ""10.1080/09668136.2020.1862060""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We use the UNCTAD global database on bilateral FDI stocks and flows. To control for the heterogeneous nature of PTAs, we employ two different indicators of PTA depth. We find that on average signing a PTA increases bilateral FDI stocks by around 30%. Nevertheless, we also find that ‘deeper’ or comprehensive PTAs (e.g., including provisions on investment, public procurement and intellectual property rights provisions) do not have a significantly different impact than signing regular PTAs. Belonging to the EU single market, on the other hand, has a strong impact and increases bilateral FDI by around 135%, and signing a BIT has an effect that is comparable to signing a PTA.","[{""name"": ""Henk L.

Could additional vaccine doses have been manufactured more quickly some other way? Would alternative policy choices have made a difference? This paper provides a simple analytical framework through which to view the contours of the vaccine value chain. It then creates a new database that maps the COVID‐19 vaccines of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax and CureVac to the product‐ and location‐specific manufacturing supply chains that emerged in 2020 and 2021. It describes the choppy process through which dozens of other companies at nearly 100 geographically distributed facilities came together to scale up global manufacturing. The paper catalogues major pandemic policy initiatives – such as the United States' Operation Warp Speed – that are likely to have affected the timing and formation of those vaccine supply chains.

10.1017/psrm.2022.8,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Does accommodation work? Mainstream party strategies and the success of radical right parties,"AbstractThis research note investigates how mainstream party strategies affect the success of radical right parties (RRPs). It is a widespread view that mainstream party accommodation of radical right core issue positions would reduce the radical right's success. Empirical evidence for this claim, however, remains inconclusive. Using party level data as well as micro-level voter transitions between mainstream and RRPs, we re-evaluate the effectiveness of accommodative strategies and also test whether they work contingent on specific conditions, e.g., the newness of radical right challengers or the existence of a cordon sanitaire. We do not find any evidence that accommodative strategies reduce radical right support. If anything, our results suggest that they lead to more voters defecting to the radical right. Our findings have important implications for the study of multi-party competition as they challenge what has become a core assumption of this literature: that accommodative strategies reduce niche party success.","[{""name"": ""Werner Krause"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Denis Cohen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tarik Abou-Chadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.01897.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-58202-3"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051701"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00243.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976254"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510298"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.03.001"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000155"", ""10.1177/0010414021997166"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1672019"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.981448"", ""10.25522/manifesto.mpds.2019a"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00304.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000029"", ""10.1111/j.1939-9162.2010.00006.x"", ""10.1177/1354068809346002"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000155"", ""10.1177/0010414019858936""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiaa093,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Disentangling the security traffic jam in the Sahel: constitutive effects of contemporary interventionism,"Abstract Despite years of ongoing interventions by multiple external and regional actors, the security situation in west Africa's Sahel region is dramatically deteriorating. In this introduction to the special section of the July 2020 issue of International Affairs, we zoom in on four major external international intervention actors (France, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations) in the Sahel region's escalating ‘security traffic jam’. We argue that the diversity of intervention actors makes the Sahel a paradigmatic case for exploring a set of often-overlooked constitutive intervention effects. By adding new temporal, relational and spatial dimensions to the notion of ‘constitutive effects’ as introduced by post-structuralists in the 1990s, we (re)launch constitutive effects as a conceptual framework for approaching the study of ongoing intervention engagements. From this perspective, and as further illustrated in this special section, intervention continuity and escalation cannot be explained simply with reference to frameworks of ‘success’ or ‘failure’, but require a broader conceptualization of effects, including how specific threat perceptions, rationales and problematizations get constituted and consolidated through and during ongoing intervention practice. Contributions to this special section each unpack a diverse set of constitutive effects including the contested performance of security actorness, the (un)making of security alliances and partnerships, logics of choices produced by ongoing intervention practices, as well as the constitution of conditions for continual international involvement.","[{""name"": ""Signe Marie Cold-Ravnkilde"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katja Lindskov Jacobsen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],['Infectious Diseases'],"[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)]]"
10.1093/pa/gsaa013,PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,"Democracy and the Politics of Coronavirus: Trust, Blame and Understanding","Abstract This article explores the relationship between crises and democracy through a focus on the unfolding coronavirus pandemic. Its central argument is that to interpret the current pandemic purely in terms of its epidemiology and public health implications risks overlooking its potentially more significant socio-political consequences. This is because the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis have themselves become overlaid or layered-upon a pre-existing set of concerns regarding the performance, efficiency and capacity of democratic political structures. The aim of this article is to try and understand and warn against what might be termed a rather odd form of cross-contamination whereby the cynicism, negativity and frustration concerning politicians, political processes and political institutions that existed before the coronavirus outbreak is allowed to direct, define and automatically devalue how democratic structures are subsequently judged in terms of how they responded to the challenge. As such, this article focuses on the link between the Coronavirus crisis and the democratic crisis; or, more precisely, the risk that the Coronavirus crisis may mutate into and fuel a broader crisis of democracy.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Flinders"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK""]}]","[""10.1080/13698575.2011.575457"", ""10.1177/0022002701045005006"", ""10.1111/j.1865-1682.2009.01091.x"", ""10.1177/0095399711403899"", ""10.1080/0306837050013612"", ""10.2307/2669362"", ""10.1017/S1049096503001665"", ""10.1080/19187033.2009.11675048"", ""10.4159/9780674246713"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1712455"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00434.x"", ""10.1016/j.ajic.2015.06.031"", ""10.2307/1955610"", ""10.1016/j.healthplace.2011.02.008"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9952-1"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00004219""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

A rapid transition towards low-carbon development across the world has been contested by discourses aiming to acknowledge the inseparability of social and ecological issues. These discussions are fairly new in the European context and in 2019, the European Commission presented its Communication on the European Green Deal—the European Union’s legislative roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2050. Empirical evidence for this article is derived from process tracing and policy analysis of the European Commission’s documents on the European Green Deal in relation to existing Green New Deals. Drawing from a neo-Gramscian perspective we argue that the European Green Deal is an attempt to extend the neoliberal hegemonic formation within European climate politics. This results in the foreclosure of democratic channels for articulating climate politics according to dissenting discourses, thereby avoiding the political contestation inherent to climate politics.","[{""name"": ""Juan Antonio Samper"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amanda Schockling"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mine Islar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10455752.2017.1373300"", ""10.3998/mpub.2556282"", ""10.4337/9781785365119"", ""10.1177/2514848618796829"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2018.09.011"", ""10.1080/1045575052000335339"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2020.101695"", ""10.1007/s11625-020-00877-9"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106832"", ""10.1177/0308518X15602491"", ""10.1111/geoj.12008"", ""10.1111/1467-8330.00247"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2018.05.015""]","['Environmental Science', 'Energy', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'General Energy']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.6919), ('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.6893)]]"

We propose a novel organizational model to address these problems. We also report on the first partnership under this model, to study the incendiary issues surrounding the impact of social media on elections and democracy: Facebook provides (privacy-preserving) data access; eight ideologically and substantively diverse charitable foundations provide initial funding; an organization of academics we created, Social Science One, leads the project; and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard and the Social Science Research Council provide logistical help.","[{""name"": ""Gary King"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nathaniel Persily"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.respol.2012.09.007"", ""10.1007/11681878_14"", ""10.3386/w23296"", ""10.1086/269461"", ""10.1016/j.scaman.2015.02.003"", ""10.1353/jod.2004.0029"", ""10.1126/science.aan4906"", ""10.1006/obhd.1993.1044"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.116.1.117""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Additionally, diffuse fears and anxieties also matter for protective ownership and accessibility, with some effects explained by political party affiliation. Broader, general distrust of others is associated with owners’ frequency of carrying their handgun outside of the home.ConclusionThe results highlight the complexity of the fear‐guns link, with multiple dimensions of fear and experience at work.","[{""name"": ""Tara D.

10.1111/gove.12433,GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,When top-down meets bottom-up: Local adoption of social policy reform in China,"AbstractAuthoritarian local leaders face two driving forces in social policymaking: top‐down pressure from the regime and bottom‐up motivations derived from local conditions. Existing studies recognize the importance of both forces, but remain unclear as to how they interact and which of them is more influential in driving local policy adoption. Focusing on two health insurance integration policies in China, we find that when the policy entails substantial class or distributive conflicts and bureaucratic friction, top‐down pressure for compliance is a dominant driver for local policy adoption; when the policy does not entail such conflicts or bureaucratic infighting, bottom‐up motivations based on local economic geography together with top‐down pressure drive local adoption. We find support for this argument from an analysis of an original city‐level data set in China from 2004 to 2016. This study has implications for social policy reform, decentralization, and government responsiveness in authoritarian countries with multilevel governance.","[{""name"": ""Xian Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""Rutgers University""]}, {""name"": ""Sung Eun Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Korea University""]}]","[""10.1080/23812346.2016.1138700"", ""10.1177/0097700413519563"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139042796"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790874"", ""10.1353/wp.2007.0005"", ""10.1080/1352327042000306039"", ""10.7591/9780801470332"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198297772.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316492710"", ""10.1353/chn.2005.0013"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00390.x"", ""10.1017/S0305741018001261"", ""10.1086/tcj.64.20749244"", ""10.1017/S1744133107004197"", ""10.1080/1067056042000213409"", ""10.1080/10670564.2014.882617"", ""10.1017/S0305741015000399"", ""10.1093/0198297564.003.0003"", ""10.1111/ajps.12394"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510243"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2004.06.009"", ""10.1515/9780691221724"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000252"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510274"", ""10.1355/ae33-2a"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000580"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.071207.093504"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1177/0010414014556212"", ""10.1017/S0305741005000500"", ""10.1017/S0305741009990592"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400067"", ""10.1177/186810261604500203"", ""10.1525/as.2017.57.6.1110"", ""10.1353/jod.2003.0019"", ""10.1177/0010414015612392"", ""10.2307/422143"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1sq5tc6.8"", ""10.1080/17516234.2014.1003454"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316257777"", ""10.2307/4150172"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491870"", ""10.2307/2586013"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790591"", ""10.1017/S0305741012000835"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.04.017"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316771785"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510441"", ""10.1177/0097700409347970"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv025"", ""10.1111/gove.12332""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

These difficulties are grounded in a limited understanding of the popular constraints during periods of fiscal pressure. For instance, an influential view claims that fiscal austerity does not entail significant political risk. But this research potentially underestimates the impact of austerity on votes because of strategic selection bias. This study addresses this challenge by conducting survey experiments in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the UK and Germany. In contrast to previous findings, the results show that a government's re-election chances greatly decrease if it proposes austerity measures. Voters object particularly strongly to spending cuts and, to a lesser extent, to tax increases. While voters also disapprove of fiscal deficits, they weight the costs of austerity policies more than their potential benefits for the fiscal balance. These findings are inconsistent with the policy recommendations of international financial institutions.","[{""name"": ""Evelyne Hübscher"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Sattler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markus Wagner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ajps.12346"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1271600"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12171"", ""10.1111/ajps.12079"", ""10.2307/2118475"", ""10.1561/100.00009031"", ""10.1007/s11127-008-9301-2"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01922.x"", ""10.1257/aer.98.5.2203"", ""10.2307/2534672"", ""10.1080/01402382.2011.572385"", ""10.7910/DVN/VHS0J3"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12037"", ""10.1257/aer.20181164"", ""10.1086/704781"", ""10.1093/0198297564.001.0001""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Instead, it adds a building block to the European economic model, alongside the single market and economic and monetary union. The pandemic crisis would therefore need to be addressed also through the EGD framework. We find that the Covid‐19 crisis provided a missing link between the EGD's long‐term objectives and conducive short‐term policies. We discuss to what extent economic governance changes reinforce the role of the EGD as a pillar of the European Union economic model, contributing also to creating strong (political, institutional and society) dynamics in favour of sustainability and promoting integration.","[{""name"": ""Annette Bongardt"", ""affiliation"": [""CICP, U.

We investigated this question by conducting survey experiments about the Paris Agreement, which relies on social pressure for enforcement. Our experiments, administered to national samples in the United States, produced three sets of findings. First, shaming by foreign countries shifted domestic public opinion in favor of compliance, increasing the political incentive to honor the Paris Agreement. Second, the effects of shaming varied with the behavior of the target. Shaming was more effective against partial compliers than against targets that took no action or honored their obligations completely. Moreover, even partial compliers managed to reduce the effects of shaming through the strategic use of counter-rhetoric. Third, identity moderated responses to shaming. Shaming by allies was not significantly more effective than shaming by non-allies, but Democrats were more receptive to shaming than Republicans. Overall, our experiments expose both the power and the limits of shaming as a strategy for enforcing the Paris Agreement. At the same time, they advance our understanding of the most significant environmental problem facing the planet.","[{""name"": ""Dustin Tingley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Tomz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.31234/osf.io/8439q"", ""10.1177/1354066108089244"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000188"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00523.x"", ""10.1515/9780691225203"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00694.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.391"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000024"", ""10.1177/0010414013509571"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139237161"", ""10.1177/1369148120948361"", ""10.1080/09644016.2019.1705056"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050125"", ""10.1017/S153759271600414X"", ""10.1162/002081801317193592"", ""10.1080/01436590120043309"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000679"", ""10.1162/002081801317193619"", ""10.1177/0146167203261295"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00521.x"", ""10.1162/glep.2006.6.3.72"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000488"", ""10.1177/0951629813505723"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000343"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00732.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000045"", ""10.1038/s41558-020-00914-6"", ""10.1177/0022002710374715"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1017/S0043887121000083"", ""10.1111/ajps.12201"", ""10.1007/s11558-016-9264-x"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001242"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-020614-095051"", ""10.1111/ajps.12710"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-110615-090105"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12708"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070282"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7rxq8"", ""10.1073/pnas.1306374110"", ""10.1080/14754835.2014.919213"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022857"", ""10.1353/hrq.2012.0016"", ""10.1017/S0020818319000146"", ""10.1038/s41558-019-0414-z"", ""10.7591/9781501707384"", ""10.1177/1086026615575332"", ""10.1007/s11558-013-9165-1"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12101"", ""10.1111/ajps.12119"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000176"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2015.07.010"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080247"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000337"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00544"", ""10.1038/nclimate3006"", ""10.1177/0022343313510014"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1007/s10584-016-1711-4""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1111/psj.12257,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Text as Policy: Measuring Policy Similarity through Bill Text Reuse,"AbstractThe identification of substantively similar policy proposals in legislation is important to scholars of public policy and legislative politics. Manual approaches are prohibitively costly in constructing datasets that accurately represent policymaking across policy domains, jurisdictions, or time. We propose the use of an algorithm that identifies similar sequences of text (i.e., text reuse), applied to legislative text, to measure the similarity of the policy proposals advanced by two bills. We study bills from U.S. state legislatures. We present three ground truth tests, applied to a corpus of 500,000 bills. First, we show that bills introduced by ideologically similar sponsors exhibit a high degree of text reuse, that bills classified by the National Conference of State Legislatures as covering the same policies exhibit a high degree of text reuse, and that rates of text reuse between states correlate with policy diffusion network ties between states. In an empirical application of our similarity measure, we find that Republican state legislators introduce legislation that is more similar to legislation introduced by Republicans in other states, than is legislation introduced by Democratic state legislators to legislation introduced by Democrats in other states.","[{""name"": ""Fridolin Linder"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bruce Desmarais"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Burgess"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eugenia Giraudy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2012.00964.x"", ""10.2307/1963526"", ""10.1002/rhc3.12097"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090926"", ""10.1177/1532440012438890"", ""10.1177/0887403411434547"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939697"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00611.x"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12283"", ""10.1177/0002764217717564"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw007"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.3"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000040"", ""10.1177/1532440015592776"", ""10.1177/153244000500500102"", ""10.1177/0010414008327428"", ""10.2307/448763"", ""10.1145/2086737.2086741"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1177/1532673X04263801"", ""10.1017/S1537592714003168"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190626594.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1532440011406233"", ""10.1177/1532440011408929"", ""10.1080/10584609.1990.9962899"", ""10.2307/2669344"", ""10.1177/153244000700700104"", ""10.1080/13501760500161332"", ""10.1016/0378-8733(88)90004-4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00510.x"", ""10.1111/psj.12119"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000698"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt002"", ""10.1093/publius/pjt008"", ""10.1093/pan/mpm010"", ""10.1177/106591290305600407"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr047"", ""10.1017/S0143814X13000317"", ""10.1093/pan/mpn018"", ""10.1177/106591290105400106"", ""10.2307/2111646"", ""10.1017/S1049096509090301"", ""10.1111/psj.12110"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1999.tb01997.x"", ""10.1108/00220410410560582"", ""10.1177/1532673X17715619"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024341"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.00518.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000153"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001078"", ""10.1016/0022-2836(81)90087-5"", ""10.1186/s12916-015-0370-z"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00181"", ""10.1093/pan/mpn006"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00185.x"", ""10.2307/1954434"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040907.115949"", ""10.1086/261181"", ""10.1145/1007730.1007734"", ""10.1353/wp.2005.0019"", ""10.1111/ajps.12175"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12086"", ""10.1515/cejpp-2016-0012"", ""10.1177/1532440015605815"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.671234""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Looking at street-level bureaucrats’ attitude towards clients, we analyze how the frontline supervisor affects this core perception that protrudes the human judgments street-level bureaucrats are required to pass in their use of their discretion. Using a survey dataset of 971 street-level bureaucrats and their 203 frontline supervisors, this study shows that frontline supervisors function as an attitudinal role model to street-level bureaucrats. Moreover, their supportive leadership behaviors are crucial to them upholding a positive attitude towards clients. Supportive leadership does not unequivocally strengthen the supervisor’s position as an attitudinal referent, though. These findings challenge pessimistic assessments of the potential for supervisory leadership at the frontlines. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Shelena Keulemans"", ""affiliation"": [""Radboud University Nijmegen""]}, {""name"": ""Sandra Groeneveld"", ""affiliation"": [""Leiden University""]}]","[""10.1177/0093854800027003006"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2007.06.007"", ""10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S"", ""10.1080/10967494.2016.1235641"", ""10.2307/2390661"", ""10.1108/JOE-07-2014-0018"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.47.6.1191"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui031"", ""10.1080/01900692.2016.1187166"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq093"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.2005.00466.x"", ""10.1108/02683940610673997"", ""10.1177/0146167294206001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.65"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bcq074"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bcs008"", ""10.1177/0146167299025003008"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui014"", ""10.1093/jopart/mun034"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy051"", ""10.1177/0734371X17698189"", ""10.1111/puar.12609"", ""10.1016/S1048-9843(96)90024-7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00650.x"", ""10.1521/soco.2006.24.4.453"", ""10.1177/0095399716667157"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy002"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.246"", ""10.1086/266945"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02131.x"", ""10.1080/15309576.2019.1697303"", ""10.1111/1467-8551.00162"", ""10.1108/01437730510617654"", ""10.2307/799655"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.12.008"", ""10.1177/1088868312472732"", ""10.3998/mpub.11924"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus060"", ""10.1016/1048-9843(90)90009-7"", ""10.1177/014920638601200408"", ""10.1177/107808747801300302"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2004.02.009"", ""10.1348/096317905X36731"", ""10.1002/job.280"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.01.001"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024289"", ""10.1177/0275074018809202"", ""10.1287/orsc.4.4.577"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00451.x"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2005.04.009"", ""10.5465/19416520.2016.1160515"", ""10.5465/19416520.2013.759433"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup003"", ""10.1016/S1048-9843(99)00013-2"", ""10.4159/9780674981423""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Public Administration', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1017/S0020818321000163,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Rising Inequality As a Threat to the Liberal International Order,"AbstractThe rise of top-heavy inequality—earnings concentration in a very thin layer of elites—calls into question our understanding of the distributional effects of the Liberal International Order. Far more people lose from globalization, and fewer gain, than traditional economic models suggest. We review three modern trade theories (neo-Heckscher-Ohlin-Stolper-Samuelson or H-O-S-S, new new trade theory, and economic geography) that each arrive at the conclusion of top-heavy inequality by introducing some form of unit heterogeneity—an assumption that the actors we once treated as identical actually differ from one another in important ways. Heterogeneity allows the gains from globalization to concentrate in a narrow segment of workers with superlative talents, extraordinarily productive firms, or heavily agglomerated cities. An analysis of European voting data shows that shocks from trade and migration elicit populist opposition only where the top 1 percent have gained the most. With few politically feasible alternatives to protectionism, most notably the failure of democracies to redistribute income, our analysis predicts a persistence of public support for antiglobalization parties, especially those on the Right.","[{""name"": ""Thomas M.

10.1017/S0260210521000127,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,Relational revolution and relationality in IR: New conversations,"AbstractThere is a multifaceted relational revolution afoot in International Relations (IR) and in the social sciences more widely. This article suggests, via engagement with varied forms of relational thought and practice in IR, but in particular via engagement with ‘relational cosmology’ associated with the ‘natural’ as well as the ‘social’ sciences, that there are important reasons for relational thought and practice in IR and around it to be more attentive to dialogues on relationality across natural and social sciences. If relational thought in IR has challenged the colonial and bifurcated ontologies of the field, relational cosmology too assists in shifting ‘modern’ understandings of science and the cosmos by facilitating engagement with situated knowledges and deep-going relationalities across ‘nature’ and ‘society’, ‘human’ and ‘non-human’ communities. Relational cosmology may be productive in joining, and perhaps even in facilitating, conversations across multiple relationalities emerging from different parts of the world and in different fields of inquiry, and yet – reflecting its relational and pluriversal orientations – it is not proposed here as a new ‘meta-‘ or ‘grand-’ narrative for relational theorising or IR.","[{""name"": ""Milja Kurki"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0047117820946809"", ""10.1177/0305829811401459"", ""10.1080/01916599.2014.948288"", ""10.1177/0047117820948199"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198859901.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108241540"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612183"", ""10.1177/0305829815583322"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198850885.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0047117819851261"", ""10.1177/0305829818779510"", ""10.1111/isqu.12171"", ""10.1093/isr/viv031"", ""10.1177/0047117819842275"", ""10.3167/dt.2020.070221"", ""10.1177/1354066199005003002"", ""10.1177/03058298000290020701"", ""10.4324/9781315890050""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

How to Evaluate the Effects of Participatory Processes on Legitimacy Perceptions,"AbstractThe potential for participatory processes to address deficits in perceptions of legitimacy is strongly debated. This letter discusses how to evaluate the effects of participatory procedures. It argues that participatory processes should not be compared to normative ideals about how citizens should behave, but rather to the status quo of representative decision making. The authors use the example of winner–loser gaps in perceptions of fairness to illustrate the importance of evaluation frameworks, drawing on twelve experiments from the Netherlands and Sweden (total N = 5,352). The study shows that the choice of benchmarks matters substantially for the interpretation of process effects. When comparing participatory processes to the status quo of representative decision making, it finds higher fairness perceptions for a participatory process than for a representative process across all twelve experiments, even when the outcomes are unfavourable.","[{""name"": ""Hannah Werner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sofie Marien"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.009"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000513"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.92.3.476"", ""10.1515/9781400882731"", ""10.1007/s10602-008-9065-1"", ""10.1017/S1537592715000079"", ""10.1093/0199276382.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13669871003660767"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000605"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00299.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12271"", ""10.1007/s11109-011-9166-9"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12303"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12304"", ""10.3200/SOCP.148.1.61-76"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur064"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000079"", ""10.7910/DVN/ZNG7PM"", ""10.1177/0032321717723507"", ""10.1177/0146167203029006007"", ""10.1017/S1755773912000173"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9427-3"", ""10.1177/0032321716667956"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609848"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02052.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2008.00777.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12293"", ""10.1017/S000712340300019X"", ""10.1093/poq/nfn030"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000508"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1564.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511720444""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1111/pops.12779,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Power to the People: The Hidden Link Between Support for Direct Democracy and Belief in Conspiracy Theories,"Although an increasing volume of research has identified several negative sociopolitical attitudes as correlates of conspiracy theories, to date it remains unclear whether belief in conspiracy theories is necessarily in conflict with support for democratic governance. In this contribution, we integrate previous findings suggesting inconsistent relationships between belief in conspiracy theories and support for democratic governance. Study 1 (N = 300) shows that belief in conspiracy theories is associated with decreased support for representative democracy but increased support for direct democracy. Study 2 (N = 270) replicated these findings and revealed that these relationships were mediated by political cynicism and feelings of powerlessness. In Study 3 (N = 298), we experimentally show that a system with direct democracy (as compared with representative democracy) empowered participants and therefore decreased belief in conspiracy theories. Contrary to the common notion that conspiracy theories are associated with decreased support for democracy, these findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs are associated with a preference for direct over representative democracy.","[{""name"": ""Myrto Pantazi"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford University""]}, {""name"": ""Kostas Papaioannou"", ""affiliation"": [""National Centre for Social Research"", ""Aristotle University of Thessaloniki""]}, {""name"": ""Jan‐Willem van Prooijen"", ""affiliation"": [""VU University Amsterdam""]}]","[""10.1111/0162-895X.00160"", ""10.1177/2053168020959859"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00225"", ""10.4324/9780429452734"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.03.006"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.9"", ""10.2307/j.ctv18zhcs4"", ""10.56021/9780801891816"", ""10.1111/pops.12568"", ""10.3758/BF03193146"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12191"", ""10.1177/1478929918807713"", ""10.2307/3791630"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613722"", ""10.1080/13569775.2016.1210875"", ""10.1002/per.1930"", ""10.1177/1948550619896491"", ""10.1177/0146167218768779"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659959.004"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0089177"", ""10.1111/bjop.12018"", ""10.1111/jasp.12453"", ""10.1111/bjso.12311"", ""10.1111/ajps.12420"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000307"", ""10.1016/j.jarmac.2017.07.008"", ""10.1177/1529100612451018"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2013.03.013"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01930.x"", ""10.1111/1478-9302.12102"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0198295685.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1542/peds.2013-2365"", ""10.1002/per.858"", ""10.1177/1750698017701615"", ""10.1177/1948550614567356"", ""10.1007/s11205-015-1085-4"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2018.10.053"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0237934"", ""10.1037/a0017457"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00280"", ""10.1002/acp.1583"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8295.2010.02004.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12021"", ""10.1126/science.1159845"", ""10.2307/3791566""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Communication', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Twenty leading labs from five continents are critically analysed through a literature review as well as policy and programme evaluation practices, assessing the extent to which the purpose, structures and processes used in policy labs address three challenges: (1) establishing the causality and value of public interventions, (2) explaining mechanisms of change, and (3) utilising research findings in public policy. The article concludes that creating synergies between evaluation inquiry and policy labs can improve the design and implementation of public policy and programmes.","[{""name"": ""Karol Olejniczak"", ""affiliation"": [""SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Sylwia Borkowska-Waszak"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Strathclyde, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Anna Domaradzka-Widła"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Warsaw, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Yaerin Park"", ""affiliation"": [""George Washington University, USA""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

To explain this, we draw on a study of municipal officials to develop a racialization of municipal opportunity perspective, which highlights how racial segregation in the suburbs intersects with policies that encourage competition over tax revenue to produce fiscal inequalities that fall along racial lines. Officials across the region shared views about ‘good’ revenues like sales taxes paid mostly by nonresidents, but those in black suburbs were unable to access them and instead turned to ‘bad’ revenues like legal fines to manage fiscal crises—even where residents were fairly affluent and despite the absence of discriminatory intent at the local level. These findings invite inquiry into the racially uneven consequences of seemingly colorblind municipal fiscal practices in the USA and the distributional consequences of municipal governance in other national contexts.","[{""name"": ""Josh Pacewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA""]}, {""name"": ""John N Robinson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MI, USA""]}]","[""10.1177/0011128717739568"", ""10.2307/2096302"", ""10.1002/9781444397499"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195305791.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226298238.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226114040.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414009331724"", ""10.1177/1078087418791775"", ""10.1525/9780520950177"", ""10.1086/651940"", ""10.1080/04353684.1989.11879583"", ""10.1111/socf.12360"", ""10.4159/9780674969223"", ""10.1177/000312240507000406"", ""10.1111/j.0011-1348.2005.00022.x"", ""10.1007/s11133-014-9274-z"", ""10.1177/0739456X07306393"", ""10.1086/226312"", ""10.2307/2094977"", ""10.1525/9780520934573"", ""10.1086/659260"", ""10.1515/9780804763172"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511627071"", ""10.1177/0896920515607073"", ""10.1177/109861102129198174"", ""10.1080/07418820200095291"", ""10.1086/226311"", ""10.1111/j.1573-7861.2010.01195.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6040.2007.00196.x"", ""10.1086/690118"", ""10.1111/cico.12190"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226402727.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8330.00247"", ""10.1177/0003122418822335"", ""10.18574/nyu/9780814777114.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0011128704269108"", ""10.1177/0093854805284414"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226733883.001.0001"", ""10.1086/691354"", ""10.1080/13604813.2013.765125"", ""10.1080/0888431032000115664"", ""10.1086/674561"", ""10.1111/j.1745-9133.2011.00748.x"", ""10.1177/1466138108099586"", ""10.1177/10780870122184975"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226768786.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-060415-093825"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226370958.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1466138109339042"", ""10.1177/2332649216650692"", ""10.1177/14624740122228276"", ""10.1215/9780822392255""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s11109-018-09520-x,POLITICAL BEHAVIOR,0302 Political Science,"Mind This Gap, Too: Political Orientations of People with Disabilities in Europe","AbstractPeople with disabilities constitute one of the largest minority groups in Europe, and yet our knowledge about how they relate to the political system remains limited. In addition to facing practical barriers such as inaccessible campaign material and polling stations, they often have fewer resources that facilitate and promote confidence and engagement in politics. Moreover, experiences of discrimination and low numbers of politicians with disabilities can generate feelings of disempowerment. Using European Social Survey data from 30 countries from 2002 to 2015, this study shows that people with disabilities have lower levels of internal and external efficacy, political trust and interest, and electoral participation. The disparities in internal efficacy and political interest disappear when accounting for education, income, employment, and social contact. Meanwhile, significant gaps in external efficacy, political trust, and turnout remain to be explained. Perceptions of discrimination strengthen the internal efficacy and political interest of citizens with disabilities but further decrease their external efficacy, political trust, and turnout. The study sheds light on a frequently overlooked dimension of political inequality, provides insights on several contributing factors, and highlights where further research is needed.","[{""name"": ""Stefanie Reher"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0304-4076(02)00145-8"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(02)00146-X"", ""10.1017/S1743923X12000487"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.t01-1-00124"", ""10.1017/S1743923X0707002X"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2004.00163.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070293"", ""10.1080/17457280701617078"", ""10.2307/1963525"", ""10.2307/2082425"", ""10.2307/3088386"", ""10.2307/2111684"", ""10.1080/00344893.2012.653246"", ""10.4159/9780674029088"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edh081"", ""10.1080/13689880500504978"", ""10.1057/bp.2012.28"", ""10.1080/13572334.2014.937121"", ""10.1007/BF00992337"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199268436.001.0001"", ""10.1093/eurpub/ckm002"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2011.05.007"", ""10.1017/S0003055401003021"", ""10.2307/3088429"", ""10.1080/13621025.2013.764219"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9243-3"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12102"", ""10.1016/j.intell.2012.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2007.11.009"", ""10.1017/S002238160808033X"", ""10.1007/BF00992332"", ""10.1057/9781403980274"", ""10.1177/106591290405700107"", ""10.2307/2647555"", ""10.2307/2647821"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01930.x"", ""10.1177/0192512116655813"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12218"", ""10.4324/9781315561691"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.07.010"", ""10.1080/09687590903537406"", ""10.2307/1959140"", ""10.2307/2110816"", ""10.1177/1532673X15586618"", ""10.1177/0010414001034001002"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12173"", ""10.1017/s0007123417000151"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-24269-6"", ""10.1177/1065912914563548"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.973260"", ""10.1525/9780520340503"", ""10.1093/poq/nfi056"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.09.002"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12077"", ""10.1017/s1755773918000140"", ""10.1177/1065912908330346"", ""10.1177/1368430216638536"", ""10.1007/s11109-005-4803-9"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2004.048744"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2012.00885.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511843693"", ""10.1177/106591290205500107"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00319"", ""10.2307/3595617"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00323.x"", ""10.1080/09687599727380"", ""10.1177/104420739800900203"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1pnc1k7"", ""10.1080/17457289.2017.1280500"", ""10.1080/09687590220148496"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00289.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1007/s11558-020-09404-y,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,0302 Political Science; 0201 Theoretical Economics,"Legitimacy challenges to the liberal world order: Evidence from United Nations speeches, 1970-2018","AbstractThe liberal international economic order has been facing high-profile legitimacy challenges in recent years. This article puts these challenges in historical context through a systematic analysis of rhetorical challenges towards both the order per se and specific global economic institutions. Drawing on Albert Hirschman’s classic typology of exit, voice and loyalty, we coded leaders’ speeches in the General Debate at the UN General Assembly between 1970 and 2018 as articulating intentions to abandon elements of the order, challenges or calls for reform, unequivocal support, or factual mentions of cooperation. Surprisingly, we find that explicit criticisms towards the liberal order are at an all-time low and that exit threats remain rare. An analysis of the historical evolution of criticisms to global economic institutions reveals a move away from the Cold War insider-outsider conflict towards insider contestation. For example, we find that as countries’ economies become more open, their leaders expressed more support for global economic institutions during the Cold War but less support since. Finally, we demonstrate consistency between the public policy positions leaders announce in UNGA General Debate speeches and their government positions on consequential reform debates on debt relief.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Kentikelenis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erik Voeten"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0020818320000454"", ""10.1093/isq/sqz029"", ""10.1177/0022002715595700"", ""10.4159/9780674054264-011"", ""10.1017/S0043887100008042"", ""10.1177/2053168017712821"", ""10.1080/09692290903173087"", ""10.1080/01436590701192231"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262028226.001.0001"", ""10.1111/isqu.12134"", ""10.1080/13642987.2017.1383242"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199689859.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7093.2006.00043.x"", ""10.1093/isq/sqz025"", ""10.4324/9781315580692"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2005.05.010"", ""10.1002/ijfe.209"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000296"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678666"", ""10.2307/j.ctvt9k3d3"", ""10.2307/2010160"", ""10.1080/00036840500392078"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000094"", ""10.1177/0022002713499723"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9340-5"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678665"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1635513"", ""10.1515/9781400823710"", ""10.3929/ethz-b-000238666"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09344-2"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-032644"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1607767"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9334-3"", ""10.1162/002081899550913"", ""10.1177/0305829810366477"", ""10.1515/9781400838196"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139855990"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12392"", ""10.1080/09692290.2018.1511447"", ""10.1086/702900"", ""10.1177/0003122417728241"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1174953"", ""10.1017/S0020818300033531"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190069629.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1007/978-0-333-98562-5"", ""10.1111/dech.12471"", ""10.5089/9781484376379.001"", ""10.1007/s11558-007-9015-0"", ""10.1353/jod.2014.0040"", ""10.1111/ajps.12130"", ""10.1017/9781316570463"", ""10.2307/3877870"", ""10.1162/002081802760199863"", ""10.1515/9781400830732"", ""10.4159/9780674969797"", ""10.4159/9780674242852"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00293.x"", ""10.1017/S002081830505006X"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9331-6"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1650796"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800182"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.18235/0001027"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135342"", ""10.1080/19460171.2011.576520"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2012.00962.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9320-9"", ""10.1017/S002081830003352X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755941"", ""10.1177/0951629808100763"", ""10.4159/9780674919808"", ""10.1111/1468-0130.00275"", ""10.1177/1354066103009002004"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grh004"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105171"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9330-7"", ""10.1162/002081800551154"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09352-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615726"", ""10.1080/13569317.2016.1207741""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Citizen perceptions of AI in government decision making,"AbstractUsing a survey experiment on the topic of tax auditing, we investigate artificial intelligence (AI) use in government decision making through the lenses of citizen red tape and trust. We find that individuals consider an AI‐led decision to be lower in red tape and trustworthiness than a decision by a human. We also find that highly complex tasks produce decisions with higher levels of perceived red tape, but that this effect does not vary according to whether the task is AI‐ or human‐led. We argue that researchers and practitioners give more attention to the balance of instrumental and value‐based qualities in the design and implementation of AI applications.","[{""name"": ""Alex Ingrams"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Public Administration Leiden University Leiden The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Wesley Kaufmann"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Public Law &amp; Governance Tilburg University Tilburg The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Daan Jacobs"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Public Law &amp; Governance Tilburg University Tilburg The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1111/puar.12979"", ""10.1177/0149206320969787"", ""10.1111/padm.12534"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101490"", ""10.1007/s00146-019-00931-w"", ""10.1177/02750749922064463"", ""10.1016/S0740-624X(96)90004-0"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1996.tb00864.x"", ""10.1177/0020852302682004"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2010.03.001"", ""10.1080/10967494.2016.1143421"", ""10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2015.05.006"", ""10.1177/009539979202400302"", ""10.1093/jopart/mun040"", ""10.1177/0275074019856123"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02600.x"", ""10.3233/IP-170050"", ""10.1111/puar.13293"", ""10.1080/13563467.2016.1216533"", ""10.1177/0020852307083462"", ""10.1002/nml.21369"", ""10.1177/0095399712473984"", ""10.1007/s00146-020-00960-w"", ""10.1080/09540969409387823"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12487"", ""10.5539/jpl.v6n4p35"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.848920"", ""10.1080/10967494.2020.1752338"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus048"", ""10.1177/0095399712465596"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3158"", ""10.1017/9781316676912"", ""10.1080/19331681.2014.908155"", ""10.1080/14719037.2019.1645873"", ""10.1177/0275074020954250"", ""10.1080/15309576.2018.1474770"", ""10.4135/9781473909472"", ""10.1111/puar.12436"", ""10.1111/padm.12294"", ""10.1177/0020852316640058"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101550"", ""10.1177/0095399718770392"", ""10.1080/14719030903319002"", ""10.1080/01900692.2019.1575664"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.00131"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa019"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a003505"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02478.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101536"", ""10.1177/0192512101222004"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-09438-9"", ""10.1177/0020852313477763"", ""10.1177/0952076718780537"", ""10.2307/976375"", ""10.1177/0275074017734642"", ""10.2307/3110348"", ""10.1007/s11127-005-3993-3"", ""10.1111/ropr.12079"", ""10.2307/2991822"", ""10.1111/spol.12470"", ""10.1017/dap.2020.19"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2012.06.001"", ""10.1080/10967494.2016.1276493"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2018.09.008"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2009.01049.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2006.00315.x"", ""10.1080/10967494.2015.1027800"", ""10.1108/09513550310500382"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2019.05.010"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00959.x"", ""10.1081/PAD-120019352"", ""10.1177/0275074014553462"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul013"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum044"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00343.x"", ""10.1515/9781400835768"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1549268"", ""10.1111/rego.12158"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0330-6""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Safety Research']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Such arguments often make implicit appeal to the notion that each case needs to be assessed on its own merits, without comparison to or generalization from previous cases. This article argues that this notion of individual justice can only be meaningfully served through human judgment. It distinguishes individual justice and considers how it relates to other dimensions of justice, namely consistency and fairness / nondiscrimination. Finally, it identifies and discussess two challenges: first, how individual justice can be accommodated alongside other dimensions of justice in the socio‐technical contexts of humans‐in‐the‐loop; and second, how inequities in individual justice may result from an uneven application of human judgment in algorithmic contexts.","[{""name"": ""Reuben Binns"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science University of Oxford  Oxford UK""]}]","[""10.7717/peerj-cs.93"", ""10.1145/3290605.3300760"", ""10.2307/794073"", ""10.1109/ISTAS.2015.7439436"", ""10.1007/978-94-015-8531-6"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372864"", ""10.1145/3173574.3173951"", ""10.1007/BF00144295"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00168"", ""10.1007/s10506-017-9214-9"", ""10.2307/1227753"", ""10.1007/s10699-016-9489-4"", ""10.1017/lst.2019.9"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1080/088395198117550"", ""10.1145/2090236.2090255"", ""10.1080/13600834.1995.9965709"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199664313.003.0011"", ""10.17351/ests2019.260"", ""10.4324/9781315572758"", ""10.1145/1165485.1165498"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6314-2_2"", ""10.1098/rsta.2017.0355"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1573912"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287600"", ""10.1007/3-540-44836-5_6"", ""10.1093/comjnl/29.6.545"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2230.1987.tb02568.x"", ""10.1080/13600869.2016.1232465"", ""10.1007/s10892-010-9095-6"", ""10.1145/2850417"", ""10.1136/bmj.296.6623.657"", ""10.1016/S1096-7494(99)80087-7"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(80)90011-9"", ""10.2307/1340132"", ""10.1177/009539978701900301"", ""10.1098/rsta.2017.0359"", ""10.3138/utlj.2017-0056"", ""10.1145/1401890.1401959"", ""10.1017/S082932010001005X"", ""10.1177/107808747801300302"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9430-8"", ""10.1145/41735.41743"", ""10.1017/9781316875056"", ""10.1145/1754428.1754432"", ""10.3389/frobt.2018.00015"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjz82xm"", ""10.2307/1372753"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-10889-2"", ""10.2139/ssrn.968657"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2745206"", ""10.1145/3173574.3174014"", ""10.1002/poi3.198"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-00102-6_2"", ""10.1007/s10111-011-0188-1"", ""10.1111/rego.12158"", ""10.1111/1468-2230.12412""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1111/rego.12402,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Hardening foreign corporate accountability through mandatory due diligence in the European Union? New trends and persisting challenges,"AbstractThe negative externalities of global commodity chains and existing governance gaps have received wide scholarly attention. Indeed, many sectors including forest‐risk commodities (FRCs) like soy and beef from Brazil remain largely unregulated. This article analyzes ongoing policy‐making processes at European Union level to adopt new regulations for reducing accountability gaps: one regulation of FRCs and one general, cross‐sectoral directive on human rights and environmental due diligence. This article draws on and aims to contribute to previous research into foreign corporate accountability, therein analytically distinguishing between input, output, and surrogate accountability. This study shows that new policies will likely be more comprehensive than previous supply chain regulations, while their specific institutional design and stringency are highly contested. More in general, we argue that for hardening corporate accountability, due diligence politics will need to confront important governance challenges that have limited the potential of previous regulations, such as a lack of consequentiality of reporting obligations, weak state monitoring, limited stakeholder involvement, and difficulties to establish legal liability.","[{""name"": ""Almut Schilling‐Vacaflor"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Social Sciences University of Osnabrück  Osnabrück Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Lenschow"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Social Sciences University of Osnabrück  Osnabrück Germany""]}]","[""10.1111/rego.12051"", ""10.1080/01402382.2010.486119"", ""10.1093/ejil/chs054"", ""10.1162/1526380054794916"", ""10.1017/bhj.2017.14"", ""10.1177/1070496517701249"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.10.007"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1679220"", ""10.1007/s10460-009-9236-3"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.025"", ""10.1080/03066150.2015.1010077"", ""10.1111/rego.12212"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051476"", ""10.1111/rego.12005"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262027410.001.0001"", ""10.1111/rego.12240"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11709.003.0005"", ""10.1080/14747731.2017.1304008"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12398"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx047"", ""10.1080/09644016.2015.1074384"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105316"", ""10.1080/08941920.2020.1725201"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2019.1661231"", ""10.3390/su70912258"", ""10.1111/rego.12268"", ""10.1111/dech.12009"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11709.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12610.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09644016.2020.1793618"", ""10.1016/j.exis.2016.07.003"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab0d41"", ""10.1126/science.aba6646"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00563.x"", ""10.1111/rego.12154"", ""10.1007/s12142-020-00607-9"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105281"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106362"", ""10.4337/jhre.2012.01.01"", ""10.1038/s41559-017-0099"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.07.002""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Building and Construction']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Evidence from Property Records and Meeting Minutes,"Homeowners and renters have participated in politics at different rates throughout American history, but does becoming a property owner motivate an individual to participate in local politics? I combine deed-level property records in California and Texas with an original dataset on individual comments in local city council meetings to study the role of property ownership in shaping costly forms of political behavior, and I document large inequalities in who participates at city council meetings. I also link property records to individual-level contribution records and administrative voter files and find that becoming a property owner increases an individual’s political activity. Over and above voting in local elections, property ownership motivates individuals to participate in local city council meetings and donate to candidates. These findings illustrate how the experience of homeownership leads property owners to become much more active in local politics.","[{""name"": ""JESSE YODER"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv1pnc1k7"", ""10.1177/1078087411426399"", ""10.1017/S153759271800213X"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00044"", ""10.1257/089533003321164976"", ""10.1086/344122"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00667.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000783"", ""10.2307/1960778"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000035"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2668780"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3173813"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.t01-1-00126"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070323"", ""10.3982/ECTA16385"", ""10.2307/2669367"", ""10.1017/S0022050705000343"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcm4j72"", ""10.1080/2330443X.2017.1389620"", ""10.1111/ajps.12062"", ""10.2307/2082425"", ""10.1086/257897"", ""10.1017/S000305540808009X"", ""10.1257/jep.32.1.3"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2008.06.003"", ""10.1017/S1537592704040307"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.33"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190270452.001.0001"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1017/S000305540011562X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510809""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0007123419000760,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Dimensions of Elite Partisan Polarization: Disentangling the Effects of Incivility and Issue Polarization,"AbstractElite partisan polarization has been found to have several potentially problematic effects on citizens, such as creating political distrust and different types of polarization among partisans. However, it remains unclear whether these effects are caused by the parties moving apart in terms of issue positions (issue polarization) or by the rise of disrespectful rhetoric (incivility). In the literature, these two dimensions of elite polarization often appear to affect citizens in similar ways, but typical research designs have not been well suited to disentangling their effects. To determine their unique effects, four studies have been conducted using original designs and a mix of experimental and observational data. The results show that issue polarization and incivility have clearly distinct effects. A more uncivil tone lowers political trust, but increasing issue polarization does not. Conversely, only issue polarization creates attitude polarization among partisans. Both aspects of elite polarization create affective polarization.","[{""name"": ""Rasmus Skytte"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.070204.105138"", ""10.1017/S000305540707044X"", ""10.1177/106591290605900312"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.005"", ""10.1177/0093650212449353"", ""10.1177/0044118X16655246"", ""10.1111/ajps.12081"", ""10.1111/pops.12532"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050316-092550"", ""10.1080/10584609.2010.542360"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691165110.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592716004497"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226473673.001.0001"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw005"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1055526"", ""10.1111/jcc4.12009"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1111/jcom.12104"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051452"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000501"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl008"", ""10.1017/S002238160808050X"", ""10.1515/for-2015-0027"", ""10.2307/1959140"", ""10.1080/19331681.2014.997416"", ""10.1086/699912"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00233.x"", ""10.1080/08838151.2014.966365"", ""10.1086/698755"", ""10.1177/1745691615569849"", ""10.1515/for-2015-0034"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw089"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1052892"", ""10.1037/pspi0000140"", ""10.1111/lsq.12110"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.9"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.1017/S0003055401003045"", ""10.1080/13572330500158623"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316091906.001"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy040"", ""10.1007/s11109-009-9094-0"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9318-4"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1038455"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000514"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9323-7"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000500"", ""10.1057/9781137312761_4"", ""10.1111/pops.12303"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226299358.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022381608080493"", ""10.2307/j.ctv322v3xg.10"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp067""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

These claims to legitimacy are both an expression of and shape of how a rule is being exercised. In this paper, we introduce new expert-coded measures of regime legitimation strategies (RLS) for 183 countries in the world from 1900 to 2019. Country experts rated the extent to which governments justify their rule based onperformance, the person of the leader, rational-legal procedures, and ideology. They were also asked to qualify the ideology of the regime. The main purposes of this paper are to present the conceptual basis for the measure, describe the data, and provide convergent, content, and construct validity tests for new measures. Our measure of regime legitimation performs well in all these three validation tests, most notably, the construct validity exercise which explores commonly held beliefs about leadership under populist rule.","[{""name"": ""Marcus Tannenberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Bernhard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Johannes Gerschewski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anna Lührmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian von Soest"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/pan.2018.28"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738861"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316422335"", ""10.2307/1964021"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i1.1214"", ""10.1177/0002764209338800"", ""10.1080/19436149.2010.514473"", ""10.1017/S1537592717002183"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738864"", ""10.1017/S0007123400003793"", ""10.1177/0032321717723511"", ""10.1017/S0022278X00054215"", ""10.1080/13510347.2013.738860"", ""10.1080/13569775.2017.1304319"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.1177/0002764209338793"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-05981-2_6"", ""10.2307/1951731"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3167764"", ""10.1177/0002764209338797"", ""10.1177/1354068808097890"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1984.tb00080.x"", ""10.1080/13569775.2013.773200"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818431"", ""10.1017/S1537592714000851"", ""10.1353/jod.2006.0048"", ""10.2307/2127069"", ""10.1057/9780230275331"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12065"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3471132"", ""10.1093/afraf/ady020"", ""10.2307/20433986"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-21599-7"", ""10.2307/2950715"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511557682"", ""10.1017/S0007123400003537"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3172796"", ""10.1017/S0003055401003100"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511814822"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3557877"", ""10.1080/01436590600720710"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-05981-2"", ""10.2307/2010202"", ""10.2307/422412"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490163"", ""10.1080/13510347.2017.1289178"", ""10.1017/S0034670500001510"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000280"", ""10.7312/bern93902"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198295457.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780804764704"", ""10.1080/14662040601135813""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Applying design is seen as a promising way to deal with wicked problems and create more responsive policies and services. We aim to contribute to the debate on the value of design for public administration and the development of the latter into a design science by conducting a systematic literature review into the empirical applications of design. We analyse the goals, processes and outcomes of 92 empirical studies. Based upon this we distil six design approaches, varying from traditional scientific and informational approaches to innovative, user-driven and thus more ‘inspirational’ approaches. The more traditional (science-driven) approaches still dominate the field. The impact of these types of studies is correspondingly low. We argue that further developing and refining the whole range of design approaches can foster both the scientific rigour and the societal relevance of a design-oriented public administration.","[{""name"": ""Margot Hermus"", ""affiliation"": [""Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Arwin van Buuren"", ""affiliation"": [""Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Victor Bekkers"", ""affiliation"": [""Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Given this centrality, the study of persuasion has a long history with an enormous number of theories and empirical inquiries. However, the literature is fragmented, with few generalizable findings. I unify previously disparate dimensions of this topic by presenting a framework focusing on actors (speakers and receivers), treatments (topics, content, media), outcomes (attitudes, behaviors, emotions, identities), and settings (competition, space, time, process, culture).

10.1017/eis.2019.23,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science; 0837 Safety Science and Engineering,'Enemies of the people': Populism and the politics of (in)security,"AbstractPopulists are on the rise across the globe and claim to speak on behalf of ‘the people’ that are set against the establishment in the name of popular sovereignty. This article examines how populist discourses represent ‘the people’ as a referent object that is threatened and the form and implications of this populist securitisation process. Drawing on securitisation theory and poststructuralism, the article understands populist securitisation as a discursive practice that propagates a politics of fear, urgency, and exceptionality in order to mobilise ‘the people’ against a ‘dangerous’ elite and normalise this antagonistic divide of the social space. While the proposed theoretical framework aims to clarify the relationship between poststructuralist and securitisation theory and capture the nexus between populism and security, the case of populism broadens the scope of potential subjects of security and poses important challenges to existing theoretical assumptions about security as something designated by states’ representatives and ‘security experts’. The article develops and illustrates its arguments with a case study on the (de)securitisation moves in the populist discourse of Donald Trump.","[{""name"": ""Thorsten Wojczewski"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0192512117693908"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00123.x"", ""10.1093/isr/viz007"", ""10.1017/S0260210504005819"", ""10.4324/9780203008690"", ""10.4324/9780203926765"", ""10.1177/0002716216662639"", ""10.1515/9781626370098"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2009.00089.x"", ""10.4324/9780203836385"", ""10.1177/00108360121962245"", ""10.1046/j.0020-8833.2003.00277.x"", ""10.1177/1354066105052960"", ""10.1057/9781137480583"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2007.00008.x"", ""10.1017/S0260210510001373"", ""10.1177/0967010611418999"", ""10.1177/03058298050330031701"", ""10.1057/9781137307576"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.4135/9781446270073"", ""10.1017/S0260210597002416"", ""10.4324/9781315099460"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-21207-7"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.4324/9780203764237"", ""10.1177/0043820017746263"", ""10.1017/S0260210500118467"", ""10.4324/9780203934753"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1515/9781685857110"", ""10.1057/9780230592100"", ""10.1177/1354066108097553"", ""10.1177/1354066107080128""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We examine the gendered pipeline to power across three potential candidate pools: lower-level officeholders, those named in newspapers as likely candidates, and lawyers who made political contributions. We find some evidence that women are less likely to seek elected office; however, the dearth of women in the pipeline plays a much greater role in the lack of women candidates. For the gender disparity in candidates to close, women have to be far more likely to run for office than men, particularly on the Republican side. Our results highlight the need to consider the gendered pipeline to power alongside rates of entry in studies of women’s underrepresentation.","[{""name"": ""DANIELLE M.

10.1017/S0007123419000413,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Violence on Many Sides: Framing Effects on Protest and Support for Repression,"AbstractThe success of protests depends on whether they favorably affect public opinion: nonviolent resistance can win public support for a movement, but regimes counter by framing protest as violent and instigated by outsiders. The authors argue that public perceptions of whether a protest is violent shift based on the framing of the types of action and the identities of participants in those actions. The article distinguishes between three dimensions: (1) threat of harm, (2) bearing of arms and (3) identity of protesters. Using survey experiments in Israel and the United States, the study finds support for framing effects. Threat of harm has the largest positive effect on perceptions of violence and support for repression.

Support for repressing a nonthreatening out-group is at least as large as support for repressing a threatening in-group.

10.1162/isec_a_00418,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,The Subversive Trilemma Why Cyber Operations Fall Short of Expectations,"Abstract Although cyber conflict has existed for thirty years, the strategic utility of cyber operations remains unclear. Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict.","[{""name"": ""Lennart Maschmeyer"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000119,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,The Evolution of Territorial Conquest After 1945 and the Limits of the Territorial Integrity Norm,"AbstractPast studies conclude that a territorial integrity norm caused territorial conquest to decline sharply after 1945, virtually subsiding after 1975. However, using new and more comprehensive data on territorial conquest attempts, this study presents a revised history of conquest after 1945. Unlike attempts to conquer entire states, attempts to conquer parts of states remained far more common than previously recognized. More than conquest declined in frequency, its relationship with war evolved. Challengers attempting conquest before 1945 often initiated a war, then sought to occupy large territories. Today, challengers more often seize small regions, then attempt to avoid war. Adopting this strategy, the fait accompli, challengers increasingly came to target territories with characteristics that reduce the risk of provoking war—such as a low population and the absence of a defending military garrison—but challengers nonetheless take a calculated gamble. In part because seizures of smaller territories with such characteristics have not declined, the operative constraint appears to be against war-prone aggression, not territorial revision. The evolution of conquest is a symptom of war's decline, not its cause. Most of the evidence that the territorial integrity norm suppressed conquest or war withers under investigation with new data. Attempts to get away with seizing small pieces of territory are likely to be a defining element of the twenty-first-century international security landscape.","[{""name"": ""Dan Altman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0022002707310425"", ""10.1177/0022002703252980"", ""10.1111/ajps.12082"", ""10.1177/2053168020956789"", ""10.1162/016228899560031"", ""10.1515/9781400828876"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00166"", ""10.1007/s10708-005-5803-3"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw018"", ""10.3998/mpub.14335"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy041"", ""10.2307/2539197"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy037"", ""10.1177/0022002792036002005"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy039"", ""10.1177/1354066107087766"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx049"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1360074"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00471.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818311000051"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139019477"", ""10.1080/07388940590915318"", ""10.4324/9780203207420"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000085"", ""10.1177/0022002797041001004"", ""10.1177/0022343316676311"", ""10.1057/9780230379435"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199301027.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03050629.2013.834259"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628290"", ""10.1177/073889429601500203"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027363"", ""10.1515/9781400821747"", ""10.2307/2620362"", ""10.1515/9781474434447"", ""10.1111/1468-2478.00042"", ""10.1177/0010836715597948"", ""10.1177/0738894208101126"", ""10.4135/9781608718276"", ""10.1177/0022002715620470"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000193"", ""10.1162/isec.22.4.5"", ""10.1177/0022343301038002001"", ""10.1353/book2179"", ""10.1162/00208180151140568"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469621241.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817991"", ""10.1086/678529"", ""10.2307/2539338"", ""10.1177/073889429801600105"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491511"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy042""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000107,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,The Enemy of My Enemy: When Firms Support Climate Change Regulation,"AbstractPolicies to mitigate global climate change entail significant economic costs. Yet a growing number of firms lobby in favor of regulation to mitigate carbon emissions. Why do firms support environmental regulations that directly increase production costs? This question is all the more puzzling in a globalized economy where regulation may undermine the competitiveness of domestic firms at home and abroad. By imposing differential costs on participants in the domestic market, policies designed to mitigate carbon emissions shift market share toward firms with low anticipated adjustment costs. I develop and test a model of climate change policymaking in the presence of market competition and open borders. Heterogeneity in adjustment costs induces a preference for regulation among low-cost firms. Firms facing import pressure—or export competition—may prefer stringent regulation if costs are sufficiently asymmetric. Firms embedded in global value chains also benefit if regulation raises the costs of domestically produced intermediate goods.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Kennard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3003160"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.1982.tb00369.x"", ""10.5465/amr.1998.192962"", ""10.1111/1468-0262.00467"", ""10.1007/s11558-009-9060-y"", ""10.18637/jss.v008.i02"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000654"", ""10.1093/restud/rdv029"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316105542"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9318-3"", ""10.1093/isq/sqz062"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-100711-135308"", ""10.7910/DVN/6R1HAS"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000205"", ""10.1007/s10640-015-9893-1"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-53265-7.50015-9"", ""10.2307/2098594"", ""10.1023/A:1008323700888"", ""10.1073/pnas.1006388108"", ""10.1086/261404"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2941.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1884639"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000582"", ""10.2307/1885536"", ""10.1257/jep.9.4.97"", ""10.1257/aer.98.4.1707"", ""10.1086/383099"", ""10.1093/biomet/80.1.27"", ""10.1086/687207"", ""10.1002/jid.1789""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)]]"
10.1162/glep_a_00549,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,Political Economy Determinants of Carbon Pricing,"Carbon pricing is widely considered a key policy instrument for achieving substantial climate change mitigation. However, implementation remains patchy and price levels vary significantly across countries and regions. In this article, we analyze the structural social, political, and economic conditions under which carbon prices have been implemented so far. We estimate a Tobit regression model to investigate variations in explicit carbon prices over 262 national and subnational jurisdictions. Our results highlight well-governed institutions and public attitudes as the most important conditions for carbon pricing and characterize fossil fuel consumption as a barrier to the implementation of carbon prices. The results suggest that governance and public attitude need to be integrated into political economy analysis. Policy makers should take regulatory capacities and public attitudes seriously when designing carbon pricing policies.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Levi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Flachsland"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Jakob"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.reseneeco.2017.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.reseneeco.2009.03.001"", ""10.1002/wcc.280"", ""10.1002/eet.1685"", ""10.1007/s10640-017-0133-8"", ""10.1002/wcc.531"", ""10.1038/d41586-019-00124-x"", ""10.3368/le.88.2.326"", ""10.1093/oep/gpz042"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00400"", ""10.1080/14693062.2015.1058240"", ""10.1080/10618600.1996.10474708"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/aaa3a2"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.08.008"", ""10.1038/nclimate2943"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00416.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur035"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107415416"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.12.027"", ""10.3763/cpol.2009.0673"", ""10.1080/14693062.2018.1470963"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/11/10/104010"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.02.003"", ""10.1080/14693062.2014.968762"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.019"", ""10.4097/kjae.2013.64.5.402"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139696678"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0152-7"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0201-2"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/aa822a"", ""10.1080/23251042.2018.1488516"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2012.00563.x"", ""10.1080/09644016.2019.1608659"", ""10.1080/14693062.2013.811333"", ""10.1080/14693062.2014.991907"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1458411"", ""10.1080/00207659.2018.1560979"", ""10.1007/s10584-013-0710-y"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00052"", ""10.1038/s41560-017-0025-8"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2015.08.011"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0287-6"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11316.001.0001"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00471"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.02.027"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.02.014"", ""10.1353/apr.2014.0004"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.08.010"", ""10.2307/1907382"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.004""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Energy']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

This article argues that emotive rhetoric is one of the tools politicians can use strategically to appeal to voters. Consequently, we expect that legislators are more likely to use emotive rhetoric in debates that have a large general audience. Our analysis covers two million parliamentary speeches held in the UK House of Commons and the Irish Parliament. We use a dictionary-based method to measure emotive rhetoric, combining the Affective Norms for English Words dictionary with word-embedding techniques to create a domain-specific dictionary. We show that emotive rhetoric is more pronounced in high-profile legislative debates, such as Prime Minister’s Questions. These findings contribute to the study of legislative speech and political representation by suggesting that emotive rhetoric is used by legislators to appeal directly to voters.","[{""name"": ""MORITZ OSNABRÜGGE"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SARA B.

10.1111/lsq.12286,LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Pink-Collar Representation and Budgetary Outcomes in US States,"Legislatures worldwide are dominated by wealthy elites, who are often out of touch with the needs and problems of citizens. Research shows that the underrepresentation of the working class matters in terms of policy processes and outcomes. Yet the research on class has largely focused on blue‐collar representatives, who are primarily men. Working‐class women are more likely to hold pink‐collar jobs, or low‐status occupations dominated by women. We argue that pink‐collar legislators are uniquely positioned to legislate over education and social service policy. To test our argument, we combine a new coding of working‐class backgrounds that accounts for pink‐collar representation with state spending data on education and social services from US states over time. Modeling compositional budget data, we find that class and gender intersect to shape policy outcomes via state budget allocations, with women's pink‐collar representation associated with increased spending on both education and social services.","[{""name"": ""Tiffany D.

It also considers how the attenuating role of emotional intelligence might depend on employees’ gender.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data were collected from 193 employees working in different organizations in Pakistan.FindingsInterpersonal conflict relates positively to CWB, but this relationship is weaker at higher levels of emotional intelligence. The negative buffering role of emotional intelligence is particularly strong among women as compared to men.Practical implicationsGiven that individuals high in emotional intelligence are better at regulating their negative emotions, emotional intelligence training may be a powerful tool for reducing the hostility elicited among organizational members in response to interpersonal conflict and, consequently, their engagement in CWB.Originality/valueThis study uncovered the emotional mechanism that underlies the interpersonal conflict–CWB relationship by gender and makes suggestions to managers on minimizing the harmful effects of interpersonal conflict.","[{""name"": ""Yasir Mansoor Kundi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kamal Badar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.paid.2016.07.015"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199912)20:7<1073::AID-JOB943>3.0.CO;2-7"", ""10.1007/s11192-012-0764-z"", ""10.1080/14330237.2018.1426808"", ""10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01904-6"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.85.3.349"", ""10.1016/j.orgdyn.2019.03.006"", ""10.1007/s10869-013-9342-5"", ""10.1037/1076-8998.11.2.145"", ""10.1108/IJCHM-02-2018-0164"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2005.00497.x"", ""10.1108/IJOA-11-2017-1272"", ""10.1007/s10490-010-9227-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32827-8_29"", ""10.1108/PR-11-2012-0191"", ""10.1023/A:1022021804846"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6772-0_3"", ""10.1177/0149206305279602"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.04.004"", ""10.1108/PR-07-2018-0241"", ""10.1002/job.243"", ""10.1108/PR-10-2019-0577"", ""10.1080/09585192.2016.1164216"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.02.080176.002003"", ""10.1037/apl0000289"", ""10.2307/2092623"", ""10.1037/apl0000265"", ""10.1111/1468-2389.00224"", ""10.1037/str0000130"", ""10.1016/j.intman.2013.10.002"", ""10.1093/cercor/12.9.998"", ""10.2753/MTP1069-6679190202"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.10.549"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.44.3.513"", ""10.1177/1754073917708613"", ""10.1177/1073191118798916"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1002/job.677"", ""10.1177/0258042X19890243"", ""10.5465/amr.2002.7389905"", ""10.1177/1548051818806289"", ""10.1086/226425"", ""10.1002/job.4030060206"", ""10.1111/ncmr.12009"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-12-2018-0142"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-11-2017-0140"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2018.03.002"", ""10.1016/S0160-2896(99)00016-1"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2009.12.019"", ""10.1037/a0028085"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2018.05.009"", ""10.1111/1471-6402.00005"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01743"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.11.062"", ""10.5465/amr.2016.0472"", ""10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00019.x"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1177/001872678503800105"", ""10.2307/256693"", ""10.2190/DUGG-P24E-52WK-6CDG"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1635-0"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-05-2019-0081"", ""10.1016/j.apnr.2015.01.010"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-08-2015-0051"", ""10.1002/smi.979"", ""10.1016/S1053-4822(02)00049-9"", ""10.1007/s10869-013-9307-8"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.73.1.11"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2019.01.008"", ""10.1002/job.4030130307"", ""10.1080/02678373.2018.1496158"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2012.08.016"", ""10.1016/j.ijans.2017.11.004"", ""10.1037/ocp0000029"", ""10.1016/S1048-9843(02)00099-1"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-01-2019-0010"", ""10.1111/ijsa.12255"", ""10.1108/IJCHM-01-2018-0100"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01776"", ""10.1002/job.2401"", ""10.1111/apps.12091"", ""10.1007/s12529-014-9410-x""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Social Psychology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1017/S0003055422001216,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Ideology Critique without Morality: A Radical Realist Approach,"What is the point of ideology critique? Prominent Anglo-American philosophers recently proposed novel arguments for the view that ideology critique is moral critique, and ideologies are flawed insofar as they contribute to injustice or oppression. We criticize that view and make the case for an alternative and more empirically oriented approach, grounded in epistemic rather than moral commitments. We make two related claims: (a) ideology critique can debunk beliefs and practices by uncovering how, empirically, they are produced by self-justifying power and (b) the self-justification of power should be understood as an epistemic rather than moral flaw. Drawing on the recent realist revival in political theory, we argue that this genealogical approach has more radical potential, despite being more parsimonious than morality-based approaches. We demonstrate the relative advantages of our view by discussing the results of empirical studies on the contemporary phenomenon of neopatriarchy in the Middle East and North Africa.","[{""name"": ""UGUR AYTAC"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""ENZO ROSSI"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9781118900772"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2017.1392894"", ""10.1093/sp/jxaa018"", ""10.1093/sp/jxaa019"", ""10.1515/9781400835515"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2004.tb00524.x"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1177/0191453715583711"", ""10.1007/s11098-019-01261-9"", ""10.1111/ejop.12193"", ""10.1111/phc3.12475"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12446"", ""10.1080/13698230.2017.1293343"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0245-0"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wrc78"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199892631.001.0001"", ""10.1515/auk-2015-1-204"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0447-9"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1564.001.0001"", ""10.1177/089124388002003004"", ""10.1111/josp.12464"", ""10.1177/00323217211018407"", ""10.1093/esr/jcw037"", ""10.1086/697449"", ""10.1086/710781"", ""10.3138/jcfs.35.2.137"", ""10.1080/13698230.2021.1894020"", ""10.4324/9780203543375"", ""10.1093/bjps/54.2.245"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199734689.013.0020"", ""10.1111/ejop.12476"", ""10.1177/0090591718821896"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000148"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract2021129145"", ""10.1111/1467-9191.00132"", ""10.1177/1474885119865975"", ""10.1177/1474885120918500"", ""10.1177/030631201031001007"", ""10.1007/s11186-019-09350-8"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2004.tb01266.x"", ""10.1093/arisup/akx001"", ""10.1093/0198238207.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400832132"", ""10.1080/24740500.2019.1705269"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199777884.001.0001"", ""10.5840/jpr201511539"", ""10.1017/S1930297500005271"", ""10.1515/mopp-2021-0067"", ""10.1080/13698230.2022.2120660"", ""10.1093/sp/jxx009"", ""10.1093/0199288038.001.0001"", ""10.1080/24740500.2019.1705229"", ""10.1007/s10677-021-10243-y"", ""10.1080/2158379X.2012.661917"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198833659.003.0003"", ""10.3402/gha.v7.23591"", ""10.1017/can.2020.16"", ""10.1080/13698230.2021.1891377"", ""10.1093/arisup/akx008"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.37.11.2098"", ""10.1080/13698230.2017.1293908"", ""10.2307/1161001"", ""10.1086/683535"", ""10.1007/s10677-021-10239-8"", ""10.1086/706766""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Evidence from Sheriff Cooperation with Immigration Authorities,"Is local law enforcement conducted differently based on the party in power? I offer an answer to this question by focusing on a case in which law enforcement is elected and has meaningful independent discretion: sheriff compliance with federal requests to detain unauthorized immigrants. Using a regression discontinuity design in a new dataset of over 3,200 partisan sheriff elections and administrative data on sheriff behavior, I find that Democrats and Republicans comply at nearly the same rate. These results contribute to ongoing research into the role that partisanship plays in local policy making, indicating that law enforcement officers make similar choices across party lines even when they have broad authority. I also present evidence that sheriffs hold more similar immigration enforcement views across party than the general public, highlighting the role of candidate entry and selection in determining the level of partisan polarization.","[{""name"": ""DANIEL M.

10.1017/S0007123418000637,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,High-Profile Criminal Violence: Why Drug Cartels Murder Government Officials and Party Candidates in Mexico,"AbstractThis article explains a surprising wave of lethal attacks by drug cartels against hundreds of local elected officials and party candidates in Mexico, 2007–2012. These attacks are puzzling because criminal organizations tend to prefer the secrecy of bribery over the publicity of political murder. Scholars suggest that war drives armed actors to attack state authorities in search of protection or rents. Using original data on high-profile attacks in Mexico, the authors show that war need arguments underexplain violence. Focusing on political opportunities, they suggest that cartels use attacks to establish criminal governance regimes and conquer local governments, populations and territories. The study presents quantitative and qualitative evidence showing that cartels took advantage of Mexico's political polarization and targeted subnational authorities who were unprotected by their federal partisan rivals. Cartels intensified attacks during subnational election cycles to capture incoming governments and targeted geographically adjacent municipalities to establish control over large territories. The findings reveal how cartels take cues from the political environment to develop their own de facto political domains through high-profile violence. These results question the widely shared assumption that organized criminal groups are apolitical actors.","[{""name"": ""Guillermo Trejo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sandra Ley"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10611-009-9195-z"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000178"", ""10.1017/9781316650073"", ""10.1080/09636410601188463"", ""10.1017/9781316421925"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199328499.001.0001"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2386667"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.01.003"", ""10.1007/s10611-017-9761-8"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000637"", ""10.1177/0022002715587100"", ""10.1017/S0022216X06000708"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00440.x"", ""10.1093/019829736X.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1866802X1700900103"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818462"", ""10.1177/0010414017720703""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Little is known about the needs of veterans with pre-existing mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsData were collected through a cross-sectional online survey from a randomly selected sample (n=1092) of military veterans who have sought help for mental health difficulties from a veteran-specific UK-based charity. The response rate was 25.2% (n=275). Participants were asked to complete a range of standardised mental health outcomes (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, common mental health difficulties (CMDs): 12-Item General Health Questionnaire, difficulties with anger: 5-Item Dimensions of Anger Reactions—Revised and alcohol misuse: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and endorse a list of potential stressors related to changes to daily life resulting from COVID-19. Regression analyses were fitted to explore predictors of mental health severity.ResultsIt was observed that symptoms of common mental disorder and PTSD (69.3% and 65.0%, respectively) were the most commonly reported to have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Lack of social support and reporting increasing numbers of stressors related to COVID-19 were consistently associated with increasing severity of a range of mental health difficulties.ConclusionsOur findings suggest veterans who had pre-existing mental health difficulties prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 may be at increased risk of experiencing CMDs as a result of the pandemic. Intervening to improve levels of social support and offering practical guidance to better manage any additional stressors relating to the pandemic may provide strategies to help reduce the burden of mental health symptoms.","[{""name"": ""Dominic Murphy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Williamson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Baumann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W Busuttil"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N T Fear"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30308-4"", ""10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028"", ""10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102071"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.0894"", ""10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.10227"", ""10.1080/09638237.2017.1385739"", ""10.1002/da.22148"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.11.003"", ""10.1080/20008198.2017.1398001"", ""10.1080/20008198.2018.1556552"", ""10.1016/S0005-7967(99)00123-0""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/jcms.12995,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,0302 Political Science; 0202 Applied Economics,Evaluating the Determinants of EU Funds Absorption across Old and New Member States - the Role of Administrative Capacity and Political Governance,"This article assesses the impact of administrative capacity and political governance factors on the absorption of structural and cohesion funds (SCF). We drew on EU‐27 country level data and developed a dynamic panel data model for the 2007–15 implementation period. By using a tobit estimation technique, the results indicated that government effectiveness and public diversion of funds significantly affect the recipient countries ability to absorb EU funds. The results revealed that increasing government effectiveness and combating corruption had significant stronger boosting effects on the absorption of SCF, especially in the new member states (NMS). This might explain why bottlenecks of administrative capacity and political governance are highly relevant for NMS and why these countries generally faced lower absorption rates, as compared to EU‐15. Moreover, the results also underlined that the recent great recession reduced the ability of countries to absorb SCF. Against our expectations, domestic financial capacity and political decentralization were not shown to be decisive for EU funds absorption. In policy terms, our study suggests a focus on administrative capacity‐building and fighting corruption in NMS and across lagging regions of older member states in order to improve absorption rates, while also focusing more on the efficiency and effectiveness of European cohesion policy. Finally, several suggestions are made on how our analysis can be replicated and taken forward by analysts of the European Union's internal development cohesion policy.","[{""name"": ""Cristian Incaltarau"", ""affiliation"": [""Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi  Iasi Romania""]}, {""name"": ""Gabriela Carmen Pascariu"", ""affiliation"": [""Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi  Iasi Romania""]}, {""name"": ""Neculai‐Cristian Surubaru"", ""affiliation"": [""Maastricht University  Maastricht Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1080/13501763.2012.705051"", ""10.1111/pirs.12351"", ""10.1068/c0662"", ""10.1080/09654313.2013.772744"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2012.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2017.12.001"", ""10.4324/9780203164112"", ""10.4337/9781849804783.00015"", ""10.1111/j.1435-5957.2008.00184.x"", ""10.1177/1465116512440511"", ""10.1080/713601647"", ""10.1080/13501760903464929"", ""10.1080/09654313.2015.1047328"", ""10.1177/1354068816678887"", ""10.1080/00343404.2012.731046"", ""10.1596/29823"", ""10.1080/09668136.2013.832969"", ""10.2307/1913323"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1398774"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12122"", ""10.2307/2951583"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(93)90038-7"", ""10.1080/13597560801979464"", ""10.1007/s11749-007-0046-x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0262.2002.00448.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6435.2009.00451.x"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(03)00109-8"", ""10.1080/01402380412331280813"", ""10.1177/0020852309337670"", ""10.1111/1468-0327.00091"", ""10.1080/00343400601120213"", ""10.1080/01402380802234581"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.01.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-72239-9_4"", ""10.4324/9781315767673"", ""10.1080/00343404.2015.1007933"", ""10.1080/00343404.2019.1608356"", ""10.1080/00343404.2016.1246798"", ""10.1080/21599165.2017.1279606"", ""10.2307/1907382"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-7155-8"", ""10.1111/1477-9552.12146""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Surgery', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

The Violent Origins of Public School Systems in an Era of State-Building,"Why do modern states regulate and provide mass education? This article proposes a theory of education as a state-building tool that is deployed when mass violence threatens the state’s viability. Experiencing mass violence can heighten national elites’ anxiety about the masses’ moral character and raise concerns about the efficacy of repression or concessions alone to maintain social order. In this context, a mass education system designed to teach obedience can become an attractive policy tool to prevent future rebellion and promote long-term order. Consistent with the theory, I detect a cross-national pattern of primary education expansion following civil wars in Europe and Latin America. In a complementary study of the 1859 Chilean civil war, I show that the central government responded by expanding primary schooling in rebel provinces not as a concession but to teach obedience and respect for authority. The theory helps explain why nondemocracies often expanded mass education.","[{""name"": ""AGUSTINA S.

10.1017/S1537592722000901,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Donald Trump and the Lie,"The legitimacy of democratically elected governments rests in part on widespread acceptance of the outcome of elections, especially among those who lost. This “losers’ consent” allows the winners to govern, and when the incumbent is the losing party, it allows for a peaceful transition of power. What happens in a democratic system when one side not only refuses to concede but also actively perpetuates lies about the outcome? This article studies the evolution of public opinion about Donald Trump’s “big lie” using a rolling cross-sectional daily tracking survey, yielding 40 days of polls and more than 20,000 responses from US voters from October 27, 2020, through January 29, 2021. We find that the lie is pervasive and sticky: the number of Republicans and independents saying that they believe the election was fraudulent is substantial, and this proportion did not change appreciably over time or shift after important political developments. Belief in the lie may have buoyed some of Trump supporters’ self-esteem. In reaction to the lie and the threat it brought to the transition of power, there was a significant rise in support for violent political activism among Democrats, which only waned after efforts to overturn the election clearly failed. Even if these findings merely reflect partisan cheerleading, we nonetheless find significant and potentially long-term consequences of the lie. A conjoint experiment shows that Republican voters reward politicians who perpetuate the lie, giving Republican candidates an incentive to continue to do so in the next electoral cycle. These findings raise concerns about the fragility of American democracy.","[{""name"": ""Kevin Arceneaux"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rory Truex"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000290"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2017.10.001"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000604"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.63.5.724"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510274"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000217"", ""10.1002/ejsp.1922"", ""10.1086/700653"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000735"", ""10.1093/poq/nfx042"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000500"", ""10.1177/0956797619864887"", ""10.1177/1065912918768006"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00325.x"", ""10.37016/mr-2020-51"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139172493"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2018.01.004"", ""10.1207/S15324834BASP2403_3"", ""10.1177/0888325418766625"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0447.1983.tb09716.x"", ""10.1177/2053168020959859"", ""10.1007/s11127-005-7163-4"", ""10.1017/S153759271900001X"", ""10.1126/science.abe1715"", ""10.5129/001041515816103220"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2017.07.008"", ""10.1073/pnas.2024125118"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.08.004"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.54.4.569"", ""10.1017/9781108671019"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12834"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102138"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628"", ""10.1017/XPS.2020.46"", ""10.1561/100.00017138"", ""10.1093/0199276382.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF02687585"", ""10.1126/science.aao2998"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070554"", ""10.1017/9781108890960.003"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1093/poq/nfab029"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.2307/2010422"", ""10.1080/09546550902765508"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000011"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.28"", ""10.1177/0963721417718261"", ""10.1017/9781108870504"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.03.004"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1080/17457289.2018.1465061"", ""10.1080/17457289.2020.1790577"", ""10.31234/osf.io/6m4ts"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000052"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226345536.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.89.4.623"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0039"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.34.3.366"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990120"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1525/9780520342057"", ""10.1017/S0022381608080730"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1073/pnas.1517441113""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/psj.12347,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Deserving to Whom? Investigating Heterogeneity in the Impact of Social Constructions of Target Populations on Support for Affirmative Action,"The social construction of target populations has emerged as an influential framework for understanding the public policy process. In particular, target populations have been shown to shape the allocation of benefits and burdens by political elites. However, existing studies focus on the elite level, which overlooks whether public preferences are aligned with the allocation of policy benefits and burdens by political elites. Moreover, many studies treat social constructions as homogenous, which this paper calls into question. Using a nation‐wide survey experiment, I investigate variation in public support for affirmative action policies with randomly assigned target populations. The findings indicate that the public formulates policy preferences on the basis of perceived deservingness of target groups similar to political elites. In addition, the findings uncover heterogeneity in the effect of targeting on public opinion based on ideology and racial/ethnic group identity.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth Bell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2111673"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195157642.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1952796"", ""10.1086/590649"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000092"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000532"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000333"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054"", ""10.1080/08913810608443650"", ""10.1515/9780691212982"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1993.tb00548.x"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00100"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00051"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00452"", ""10.2307/2111433"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174992"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226404486.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001121"", ""10.1086/675501"", ""10.1300/J082v32n03_04"", ""10.1515/9781400822416"", ""10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0155"", ""10.1007/s11205-010-9666-8"", ""10.2307/2010261"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00252.x"", ""10.1521/soco.1990.8.1.73"", ""10.1017/S1049096518000987"", ""10.1177/0010414006295234"", ""10.1111/psj.12014"", ""10.2307/2082436"", ""10.2307/2009452"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00267.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X0000619X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2008.00532.x"", ""10.1017/S1537592704000623"", ""10.2307/2110816"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00380.x"", ""10.1207/S15324834BASP2401_2"", ""10.2307/2952075"", ""10.2307/2960149"", ""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.08502002.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1994.tb01199.x"", ""10.1111/psj.12040"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805288"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00368.x"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.06.020"", ""10.1111/psj.12001"", ""10.2307/2146467"", ""10.1177/00027649921955119"", ""10.1177/106591290605900313"", ""10.2307/2939044"", ""10.1215/03616878-23-1-107"", ""10.2307/1962160"", ""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.00245.x"", ""10.2307/1956650"", ""10.2307/2111693"", ""10.2307/2585401"", ""10.1023/A:1010323227348"", ""10.1086/692795"", ""10.2979/NWS.1998.10.3.27"", ""10.4324/9781315442129""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This divorce of two closely related academic fields has removed political explanations to key developments in the public service from Public Administration research and thus it tends to provide a partial view of the reality that it seeks to capture. There are several developments underway in the public sector, which underscore the political nature of public administration. These developments include the rise of administration politics; a growing emphasis on strategic management; governance‐driven democratization and administrative micro‐politics; the increasing significance of interactive and collaborative forms of governance; the rise of multilevel governance; and the development toward a more active citizenship. We find that in all of these areas, public administration research would benefit from incorporating a political science understanding of power, democracy, governance and citizenship.","[{""name"": ""B.

Radical Right Populist Parties and Strategic Descriptive Representation,"Radical right populist (RRP) parties are often described as Männerparteien, predominantly led by, represented by, and supported by men. Yet recently, these parties have elected more women. Under what conditions do we see this increase in women MPs? This paper presents a novel argument of strategic descriptive representation: electorally struggling RRP parties with large gender gaps in voter support increase their proportion of women MPs to attract previously untapped women voters. To test this argument, we develop the most comprehensive dataset to date on women MPs and gender differences in voter support across Europe and over time, covering 187 parties in 30 countries from 1985 to 2018. Our analyses confirm that RRP parties engage in strategic descriptive representation when they are both struggling electorally and suffering from a gender gap in support. Additional models reveal that this tactic is largely unique to RRP parties.","[{""name"": ""ANA CATALANO WEEKS"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""BONNIE M.

10.1017/pan.2022.16,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Using Conjoint Experiments to Analyze Election Outcomes: The Essential Role of the Average Marginal Component Effect,"AbstractPolitical scientists have increasingly deployed conjoint survey experiments to understand multidimensional choices in various settings. In this paper, we show that the average marginal component effect (AMCE) constitutes an aggregation of individual-level preferences that is meaningful both theoretically and empirically. First, extending previous results to allow for arbitrary randomization distributions, we show how the AMCE represents a summary of voters’ multidimensional preferences that combines directionality and intensity according to a probabilistic generalization of the Borda rule. We demonstrate why incorporating both the directionality and intensity of multi-attribute preferences is essential for analyzing real-world elections, in which ceteris paribus comparisons almost never occur. Second, and in further empirical support of this point, we show how this aggregation translates directly into a primary quantity of interest to election scholars: the effect of a change in an attribute on a candidate’s or party’s expected vote share.

The data set reveals a rapid increase in trade policy activism in February and March 2020 in tandem with the rise in COVID‐19 cases but also uncovers extensive heterogeneity across countries in both their use of trade policy and the types of measures used. Some countries acted to restrict exports and facilitate imports, others targeted only one of these margins, and many did not use trade policy at all. The observed heterogeneity suggests numerous research questions on the drivers of trade policy responses to COVID‐19, on the effects of these measures on trade and prices of critical products, and on the role of trade agreements in influencing the use of trade policy.","[{""name"": ""Simon Evenett"", ""affiliation"": [""University of St  Gallen, St. Gallen Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Matteo Fiorini"", ""affiliation"": [""European University Institute  Fiesole Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Johannes Fritz"", ""affiliation"": [""University of St  Gallen, St. Gallen Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Bernard Hoekman"", ""affiliation"": [""European University Institute  Fiesole Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Piotr Lukaszuk"", ""affiliation"": [""University of St  Gallen, St. Gallen Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Nadia Rocha"", ""affiliation"": [""World Bank  Washington DC USA""]}, {""name"": ""Michele Ruta"", ""affiliation"": [""World Bank  Washington DC USA""]}, {""name"": ""Filippo Santi"", ""affiliation"": [""European University Institute  Fiesole Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Anirudh Shingal"", ""affiliation"": [""S.P.

10.1093/ia/iiab226,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,The impact of colonialism on policy and knowledge production in International Relations,"Abstract Is there an academic–policy divide, and does that gap need to be bridged? For decades, International Relations (IR) scholars have reflected on their roles and responsibilities towards the ‘real world’, while policy-makers have often critiqued the detachment of academic research. In response, there have been increased calls for academics to descend from their ‘ivory tower’. However, the articles in this 100th anniversary special issue of International Affairs interrogate this so-called theory–policy divide and problematize the exchange of knowledge between academics and practitioners, highlighting the colonial underpinnings of their historical entanglements. In this introductory article we bring together the core arguments of the special issue contributions to delineate three prominent dynamics in the academic–practitioner nexus: the role of academia as a supplier of knowledge for colonial policies; the influence of imperial practice and policy-makers in shaping IR and academic knowledge production; and the contestation from academics and/or practitioners against racial hierarchies in knowledge production and policy-making. Confronting the exclusions, amnesias and denials of colonialism in the theory and practice of International Relations is the necessary first step in any process of repair towards a more just and viable politics.","[{""name"": ""Jasmine K Gani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jenna Marshall"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Despite worldwide calls for greater disclosure, empirical analyses of whether and how fiscal transparency actually affects governance outcomes are still limited. This study draws on public choice and principal–agent theories to demonstrate how public disclosure of budgetary information helps deter government corruption. The data from 95 countries over the period 2006–14 provide evidence that more fiscally transparent countries are perceived as less corrupt. We also find that fiscal transparency matters most at the final stages of the budget process when information disclosure reflects actual government spending. Data also confirm that a Citizens Budget can serve as a strong anti‐corruption tool.","[{""name"": ""Can Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Public Policy and Administration Florida International University  Miami FL USA""]}, {""name"": ""Milena I.

Less is known about the potential downsides associated with citizen participation in coproduction of public services. We argue that psychological costs, such as experiences of stigma, stress, and loss of autonomy may arise among citizens in response to coproduction initiatives stimulated or directly imposed by public organizations. We test our propositions in two randomized vignette experiments on a representative sample of Danish citizens. First, we manipulate whether citizens are encouraged to coproduce public services yielding private or collective benefits. Second, we induce perceived self-efficacy among a subsample of citizens. We find that citizens are more likely to experience psychological costs when they are encouraged to coproduce public services resulting in private benefits for relatives or friends in contrast to collective benefits for a larger group of people. Furthermore, these psychological costs are felt to a greater extent among citizens with low self-efficacy. Fusing insights from multiple perspectives, our study pushes the theoretical frontiers of coproduction literature by illustrating how complex emotional responses is an overlooked, but integral part of a more comprehensive theory on the manifestations and effects of citizen coproduction.","[{""name"": ""Mette Kjærgaard Thomsen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Southern Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Baekgaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}, {""name"": ""Ulrich Thy Jensen"", ""affiliation"": [""Arizona State University""]}]","[""10.1177/0095399702034001004"", ""10.1086/686029"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191"", ""10.1257/aer.20121493"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00773.x"", ""10.1017/S0047279414000567"", ""10.1111/puar.12465"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup046"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1983.tb00279.x"", ""10.2307/975300"", ""10.1017/S0144686X11000821"", ""10.1086/341181"", ""10.1177/0265407516649264"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul002"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl008"", ""10.1016/0030-5073(79)90004-7"", ""10.1111/ajps.12360"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus036"", ""10.1111/puar.12094"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy021"", ""10.1002/job.4030140409"", ""10.1017/S000305541100013X"", ""10.1142/9789812793591_0002"", ""10.1080/10967494.2015.1012574"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1111/puar.12765"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1981.tb01208.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9906.1983.tb00035.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8292.2009.00384.x"", ""10.1016/S0144-8188(99)00013-7"", ""10.1177/0164027598201007"", ""10.1080/13607863.2010.505231"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68"", ""10.1177/0002764299042007009"", ""10.1177/009539999400935493"", ""10.1177/014920638401000311"", ""10.2307/3090173"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.996628"", ""10.1093/jopart/muz028"", ""10.1111/puar.12896"", ""10.1002/smi.1368""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Medicine', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7036), ('1001 基础医学', 0.6984)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muz012,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,The Political Psychology of Citizen Satisfaction: Does Functional Responsibility Matter?,"AbstractThe provision of public services is a key responsibility of elected politicians. Research suggests that citizens’ satisfaction evaluations of public services are incomplete representations of service quality and performance. However, little attention has been given to the political nature of service evaluations. Based on the theory of (partisan) motivated reasoning and the literature on responsibility attribution, we argue that citizens provide more favorable evaluations of municipal services when the responsibility for these services is vested in political principals with matching partisanship. Drawing on original data from a two-wave pre-post panel survey of Danish voters in the 2017 municipal elections, we employ a difference-in-differences estimator to identify the effect of a partisan match between voters and elected municipal leaders on citizen satisfaction with municipal services. We furthermore nest a survey experiment in the panel survey to test whether partisan bias in citizen satisfaction emerges when the line of functional responsibility between political principals and public services is clear and not dispersed across multiple actors. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis of partisan bias in satisfaction evaluations. We further demonstrate the importance of clarity of responsibility; partisan bias seems to come into being when the functional responsibility of municipal leaders for public services is clear and not dispersed across multiple actors, pointing toward a possible mechanism of partisan bias in citizen satisfaction.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Jilke"", ""affiliation"": [""Rutgers University-Newark""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Baekgaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}]","[""10.1093/jopart/muv036"", ""10.1177/0010414013489081"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00530.x"", ""10.1080/03003930.2013.834253"", ""10.1111/puar.12406"", ""10.1023/A:1021226224601"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199562978.003.0010"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990089"", ""10.1177/0275074010397333"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1553808"", ""10.1093/pan/mpm009"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy067"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139136709"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00380.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12022"", ""10.1515/9781503620766"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990098"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00402.x"", ""10.2307/3033584"", ""10.1002/9781119125563.evpsych241"", ""10.1017/xps.2014.8"", ""10.1111/padm.12346"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02072.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-011-9183-8"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum034"", ""10.1111/puar.12471"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul020"", ""10.1111/padm.12066"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw049"", ""10.1111/gove.12317"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv021"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00341.x"", ""10.1177/1078087414537610"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1017/S0022381607080097"", ""10.1111/puar.12474"", ""10.1017/9781316676912.017"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus012"", ""10.1177/002224378001700405"", ""10.1111/puar.12337"", ""10.1111/puar.12623"", ""10.1111/padm.12341"", ""10.2307/2111378"", ""10.1177/1078087405281124"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00451.x"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.101.4.632"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.11.004"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy006"", ""10.2307/3381075"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux044"", ""10.1086/257839"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui058"", ""10.1002/pam.21702"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2010.01820.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00863.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jogss/ogz077,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES,0302 Political Science,The Microfoundations of State Cybersecurity: Cyber Risk Perceptions and the Mass Public,"AbstractCybersecurity represents a unique national security challenge for states: data breaches with the potential for national, macro-level consequences are most likely to occur at the micro-level, originating through the security errors of individual computer users. Thus, aspects of national cybersecurity can often critically depend on the personal attitudes and behavior of average citizens connecting online. However, to date, theories of state cybersecurity have almost exclusively focused on the macro-level, and very little is known about how the mass public reacts to—and protects themselves from—cybersecurity threats. This study addresses this gap, drawing on psychological theories of risk perception to explain why the public simultaneously reports great concern about cybersecurity, yet does little to protect their personal safety online. Using a novel survey experiment, we examine how exposure to different types of data breaches impacts citizens’ cyber risk assessments, personal online behavior, and support for various national cybersecurity policies. We find that baseline concerns about cybersecurity and knowledge about safe online practices are very low. However, exposure to a personally relevant data breach heightens risk perception and increases willingness to engage in safer online practices. But these effects are circumscribed—actual online behavior is more resistant to change. These results have important implications for the design of effective state cybersecurity policy.","[{""name"": ""Nadiya Kostyuk"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Michigan, Tufts University""]}, {""name"": ""Carly Wayne"", ""affiliation"": [""Washington University in St. Louis""]}]","[""10.1126/science.aaa1465"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogw006"", ""10.1073/pnas.1322638111"", ""10.2307/2669291"", ""10.1177/106591290105400103"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1306396"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00168"", ""10.1177/016344396018002004"", ""10.1093/med:psych/9780195172492.003.0009"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190665012.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00096.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190221072.003.0009"", ""10.1111/pops.12264"", ""10.1093/pa/52.3.365"", ""10.1353/jod.2010.0010"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2007.09.002"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1498843"", ""10.2337/dc08-0426"", ""10.1093/esr/16.4.427"", ""10.1017/S0022381609990910"", ""10.1177/0956797612447804"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00136"", ""10.1080/09636412.2015.1038188"", ""10.1177/0022002709352845"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.67"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000400"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-102512-194818"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2009.07.002"", ""10.4324/9780203496961"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00144.x"", ""10.1017/eis.2016.14"", ""10.2307/3791678"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000424"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000073"", ""10.1111/ajps.12314"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000014"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000144"", ""10.1080/10584600490518333"", ""10.1080/13504620220145401"", ""10.1177/0022002717737138"", ""10.1093/cybsec/tyz007"", ""10.1017/S002238161100154X"", ""10.2307/2010176"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804250"", ""10.1080/09636412.2013.816122"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198800682.013.12"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb03005.x"", ""10.1023/B:PUCH.0000003735.07840.c7"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2016.01.002"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6606.2006.00070.x"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00266"", ""10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.12.006"", ""10.1177/0267323105058251"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy022"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-2191-0_1"", ""10.1080/01402390.2014.977382"", ""10.1177/089443930001800411"", ""10.1093/poq/nft023"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5982.2006.00393.x"", ""10.1177/089443930001800206"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2003.10.021"", ""10.1080/01402390.2017.1307741"", ""10.3758/s13421-011-0125-9"", ""10.4324/9781315661773"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-04117-4"", ""10.1023/A:1024111006336"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9"", ""10.1177/0022343313518940"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190618094.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190204792.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0894439302238969"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000111"", ""10.1080/10584600590933205"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Concepts of psychological distance and motivated reasoning are tested using multilevel analysis with survey data in 20 countries (N = 18,785). Results suggest that using social media for news is associated with a decrease in climate skepticism across the sample. However, social context at the individual-level (conservative political ideology and low trust in science) and at the macro-level (high gross domestic product and individualism) moderate the effect, and therefore reduce social media’s potential to inform the public about climate change. This study contributes to conversations about the ability of emerging media to address science issues, particularly in developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Trevor Diehl"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Broadcast and Cinematic Arts, Central Michigan University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Brigitte Huber"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Communication, University of Vienna, Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Homero Gil de Zúñiga"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Communication, University of Vienna, Austria"", ""Facultad de Comunicación y Letras, Universidad Diego Portales, Chile""]}, {""name"": ""James Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Psychology, Massey University, New Zealand""]}]","[""10.1126/science.aaa1160"", ""10.1177/0963662506071287"", ""10.4135/9781412986373"", ""10.1080/17524032.2017.1397039"", ""10.1111/reel.12154"", ""10.1177/0093650218813655"", ""10.1038/nature11421"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.01.008"", ""10.1177/1075547012441691"", ""10.1177/009365001028005001"", ""10.1177/1940161211425410"", ""10.1177/1461444817724170"", ""10.1177/0002764212463360"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2012.01574.x"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2039"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2017.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2016.01.006"", ""10.1038/nclimate2943"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2012.01084.x"", ""10.1080/13504622.2018.1523369"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00215"", ""10.1177/1075547015574016"", ""10.1038/nclimate2728"", ""10.1177/0956797612457686"", ""10.1509/jppm.20.1.93.17291"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2011.01198.x"", ""10.1080/09644016.2015.1090371"", ""10.1177/1077699012468696"", ""10.1177/0963662515592558"", ""10.1177/0963662518801170"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/7/4/044005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490323"", ""10.1177/0013916507313920"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.020"", ""10.1017/S002238161000006X"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.02.014"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.1027/1864-1105/a000080"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.11.012"", ""10.1098/rsos.170505"", ""10.1201/b11251"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.03.006""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818319000365,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,"Recapturing Regime Type in International Relations: Leaders, Institutions, and Agency Space","AbstractA wave of recent research challenges the role of regime type in international relations. One striking takeaway is that democratic and autocratic leaders can often achieve similar levels of domestic constraint, which in many issue areas results in similar international outcomes—leading many to question traditional views of democracies as distinctive in their international relations. In this review essay, we use recent contributions in the field to build what we call a “malleable constraints” framework, in which all governments have an institutionally defined default level of domestic audience constraint that is generally higher in democracies, but leaders maintain some agency within these institutions and can strategically increase their exposure to or insulation from this constraint. Using this framework, we argue that regime type is still a crucial differentiator in international affairs even if, as recent studies suggest, democratic and autocratic leaders can sometimes be similarly constrained by domestic audiences and thus achieve similar international outcomes. This framework helps reconcile many competing claims in recent scholarship, including the puzzle of why autocracies do not strategically increase domestic audience constraint more often. Just because autocracies can engage audience constraints and democracies can escape them does not mean that they can do so with equal ease, frequency, or risk.","[{""name"": ""Susan D.

10.1017/psrm.2021.78,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Public opinion on welfare state recalibration in times of austerity: evidence from survey experiments,"AbstractEven though social investment is highly popular, welfare state recalibration remains an uphill battle. When resources are scarce in times of austerity, welfare recalibration involves multidimensional trade-offs. Existing research primarily studied preferences toward individual policies or trade-offs in specific policy fields, failing to capture citizens’ overall social policy priorities. Using two novel survey experiments in three European countries, we show that citizens have clear social policy priorities: pensions and education enjoy a high, family policies a medium, and labor market policies a low priority. However, policy constituencies differ in their relative priorities. Our findings suggest that welfare state recalibration is difficult because trade-offs are unpopular, and distributive conflicts in mature welfare states are mainly about distributing resources to specific social groups.","[{""name"": ""Björn Bremer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Reto Bürgisser"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13501763.2016.1170191"", ""10.1177/0010414018797943"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226245560.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00401706.1970.10488634"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1749715"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669769.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3588941"", ""10.1017/S0047279417000216"", ""10.1111/ajps.12251"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199216352.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0958928713480064"", ""10.1177/0958928716684302"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1111/ajps.12346"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511730108"", ""10.1177/0958928706059829"", ""10.1111/1468-0327.00069"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199645244.003.0006"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.1111/spsr.12115"", ""10.1177/0010414005285755"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1401107"", ""10.1353/wp.1996.0004"", ""10.1093/019926726X.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2950710"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198790488.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230227392"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.30"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1298658"", ""10.4324/9780203099520"", ""10.1111/ajps.12349"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.2"", ""10.1177/0032329299027002004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750588"", ""10.1017/S0043887111000037"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.13"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.42"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1401111"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.11"", ""10.1093/esr/jcy008"", ""10.1332/policypress/9781847429247.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11205-012-0099-4""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1017/S1752971920000147,INTERNATIONAL THEORY,0302 Political Science,"Psychoanalysis, cultures of anarchy, and ontological insecurity","When ontological insecurity looms, what comes next? Is chaos the sole alternative to the maintenance of established role-identities and routines? Or is there a more complex set of possible responses to the dread threat of ontological insecurity? The principal approach to ontological security in International Relations (IR) relies unduly on Giddens' account. Consequently, this approach fails to adequately capture both the variety of ways in which coherent and continuous identities can be maintained and the variety of ways in which the available cultural repertoire can support ontological security differently when challenged. Typically, ontological security is re-established, prior to collapse, through re-balancing of the cultural repertoire to give broader scope to an alternative cultural form and the qualitatively different practices it organizes. Due to misrecognition, this reorganization may proceed without disturbing the ontological security of states-in-interaction. Unconscious processes, encoded into cultural forms, are integral to such variable defenses against ontological insecurity. A re-conceptualization that regards Wendt's cultures of anarchy, and their qualitatively different modes of relating, as dynamically co-present within cultural repertoires, but with potentially variable weightings, complements this approach to ontological in/security.","[{""name"": ""John Cash"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/book4960"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1080/13501760500451709"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1391671"", ""10.7591/9781501726699"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000111"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000093"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000135"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612183"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000123"", ""10.1017/S0260210505006613"", ""10.4324/9780203018200""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000297,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Policy Preferences after Crime Victimization: Panel and Survey Evidence from Latin America,"AbstractCan crime victimization increase support for iron-fist crime-reduction policies? It is difficult to assess the political effects of crime, mainly because of the presence of unmeasured confounders. This study uses panel data from Brazil and strategies for reducing sensitivity to hidden biases to study how crime victims update their policy preferences. It also examines survey data from eighteen Latin American countries to improve the external validity of the findings. The results show that crime victims are more likely to support iron-fist or strong-arm measures to reduce crime, such as allowing state repression. Affected citizens are also found to value democracy less, which might explain their willingness to accept the erosion of basic rights in favor of radical measures to combat delinquency. These findings reveal that exposure to crime can change what people think the state should be allowed to do, which can have important political implications.","[{""name"": ""Giancarlo Visconti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/lar.2013.0040"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195136265.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203312995"", ""10.1257/jel.48.2.399"", ""10.1080/13218719.2015.1034060"", ""10.2753/PIN1099-9922130104"", ""10.2307/2981697"", ""10.1198/000313005X42831"", ""10.1177/2053168016684066"", ""10.1198/jasa.2009.tm08470"", ""10.1080/01621459.2012.703874"", ""10.1002/j.1538-165X.2003.tb00408.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.1177/0022002715587052"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl013"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000299"", ""10.3386/w14825"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00190.x"", ""10.1177/1866802X1200400204"", ""10.1214/09-STS313"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135444"", ""10.1080/01621459.2014.997879"", ""10.1017/S0007123404000201"", ""10.1177/1866802X1801000202"", ""10.1086/683609"", ""10.1017/S0043887110000286"", ""10.1177/14624740122228249"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452.032"", ""10.1177/1866802X1700900301"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2006.tb00364.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00802.x"", ""10.1353/lar.2013.0009"", ""10.1002/yd.275"", ""10.1037/a0020761"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.61.7.651"", ""10.1093/pan/mpv007"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.167"", ""10.1177/0022002717708600"", ""10.1214/12-AOAS583"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000128"", ""10.1057/9780230523791_3"", ""10.1086/267990"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107587991"", ""10.1093/biomet/91.1.153"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-1213-8"", ""10.1198/016214506000001059"", ""10.1146/annurev-statistics-010814-020201"", ""10.1214/08-AOAS187"", ""10.1353/obs.2018.0012"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2014.00224.x"", ""10.1177/1477370804045691"", ""10.1162/003355398555577"", ""10.1002/sim.7036""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Statistics and Probability', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We evaluate this argument by measuring groups’ revealed preferences directly, developing a set of ideal point estimates, IGscores, for over 2,600 interest groups and 950 members of Congress on a common scale. We generate the scores by jointly scaling a large dataset of interest groups’ positions on congressional bills with roll-call votes on those same bills. Analyses of the scores uncover significant heterogeneity in the interest group system, with little conservative skew and notable inter-party differences in preference correspondence between legislators and ideologically similar groups. Conservative bias and homogeneity reappear, however, when weighting IGscores by groups’ PAC contributions and lobbying expenditures. These findings suggest that bias among interest groups depends on the extent to which activities like PAC contributions and lobbying influence policymakers’ perceptions about the preferences of organized interests.","[{""name"": ""JESSE M.

Achieving transparency and accountability has been formulated as a general goal regarding the use of these systems. However, concrete applications differ widely in the degree of risk and the accountability problems they entail for data subjects. The present paper addresses this variation and presents a framework that differentiates regulatory requirements for a range of ADM system uses. It draws on agency theory to conceptualize accountability challenges from the point of view of data subjects with the purpose to systematize instruments for safeguarding algorithmic accountability. The paper furthermore shows how such instruments can be matched to applications of ADM based on a risk matrix. The resulting comprehensive framework can guide the evaluation of ADM systems and the choice of suitable regulatory provisions.","[{""name"": ""Tobias D.

How can this trend be theorized? In what ways is this development resisted and contested by other states and international actors? To what extent can we trace continuity and change in regard to gender and foreign policy? To address these major research questions and to spur cross-national comparative studies, this article advances a theoretical framework on gendering foreign policy. It draws on two strands of research, which rarely engage with one another: international feminist theory (IFT) and foreign policy analysis (FPA). We identify three ways in which comparative analysis of gender in foreign policy can be advanced: first, by highlighting the variations of pro-gender norms and enhancing the analytical assessment of cross-national trends; second, by generating a more robust explanation of the rise, embeddedness, and continuity of, as well as resistance to, pro-gender norms in foreign policy in similar and diverse contexts; and third, by examining both continuity and change in pro-gender norms in order to reveal the contestation around gender, which is at the heart of foreign policy.","[{""name"": ""Karin Aggestam"", ""affiliation"": [""Lund University""]}, {""name"": ""Jacqui True"", ""affiliation"": [""Monash University""]}]","[""10.1017/S0020818304582024"", ""10.1017/S0892679416000241"", ""10.1177/0047117818811892"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-58682-3_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-58682-3"", ""10.1080/14616742.2018.1483206"", ""10.1111/jcms.12558"", ""10.1111/ajps.12337"", ""10.1177/1354066199005001001"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050010"", ""10.1177/0192512113516029"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190875374.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350989559"", ""10.1080/09512748.2016.1264456"", ""10.2307/2600772"", ""10.4135/9781848608290.n17"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00112"", ""10.1093/fpa/orw065"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190638276.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1464993418766583"", ""10.1525/9780520969193"", ""10.7591/9781501707384"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16161-4"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.430"", ""10.2307/3013584"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190204235.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000226"", ""10.1017/9781108277891"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2005.00001.x"", ""10.1111/isqu.12190"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511550362"", ""10.1080/1461674042000324682"", ""10.1080/03050629.2018.1492386"", ""10.1177/1354066110380963"", ""10.4324/9780203881330"", ""10.1093/0199242666.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010836712444825"", ""10.1017/S0020818300035384"", ""10.2307/1148580"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190644031.001.0001"", ""10.1177/000312240607100602"", ""10.1515/9781685859305"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027697"", ""10.2307/1864376"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199982721.001.0001"", ""10.1093/hepl/9780198708902.001.0001"", ""10.1177/03058298880170030801"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199951246.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199265208.003.0009"", ""10.1177/0192512116632372"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-75850-3_7"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00181"", ""10.1093/ia/iiz027"", ""10.1353/wp.1997.0005"", ""10.1057/9780230514690""]",['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

In fact, the CE is considered a tool to attain sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this sense, this paper aims at analysing the interaction between the CE and SDGs in the context of the new 2030 Agenda and the European CE strategy; thus contributing to the scarce empirical literature that links the potential of the European CE strategy to the achievement of the SDGs set by the 2030 Agenda. Three specific research questions have been formulated. First, could the objectives defined in the 2030 Agenda be considered homogeneous, and could they uniquely measure the concept of sustainability? Second, are there significant correlations between the implementation of a CE in the EU and the SDGs? Finally, is the behaviour of the 28 countries that make up the EU homogeneous in terms of the results of the initiatives aimed at the implementation of a CE? From these questions, nine hypotheses are put forward concerning the possible relationships between a CE implementation and the fulfilment of SDGs in the EU. Using a correlation analysis, an exploratory factor analysis, and a cluster analysis, it has been demonstrated that (a) SDGs do not univocally measure the concept of sustainability; (b) there are significant relationships between CE and SDGs in the EU; (c) the behaviour of these European countries is not homogeneous.","[{""name"": ""José Miguel Rodríguez-Antón"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luis Rubio-Andrada"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""María Soledad Celemín-Pedroche"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Soraya María Ruíz-Peñalver"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5539/ass.v9n5p18"", ""10.1080/21681015.2016.1172124"", ""10.1080/09669582.2019.1619748"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71312-0_24"", ""10.3390/socsci8050159"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2020.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2020.10.005"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-1052-6_20"", ""10.1177/2053019619869947"", ""10.1080/03085147.2015.1013353"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2018.11.133"", ""10.4324/9780203022177"", ""10.14207/ejsd.2019.v8n5p409"", ""10.14207/ejsd.2019.v8n2p289"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2017.12.002"", ""10.1515/igbp-2017-0008"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.028"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.041"", ""10.3390/su12030951"", ""10.4103/0970-0218.170955"", ""10.1002/sd.1582"", ""10.3390/su8010043"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.12.098"", ""10.1111/jiec.12597"", ""10.1016/S0195-9255(98)00019-5"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.112"", ""10.1016/j.ecoleco"", ""10.3390/su10020535"", ""10.1007/s10163-007-0182-0"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.019"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2018.09.001"", ""10.1002/2017EF000632"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.224"", ""10.14207/ejsd.2017.v6n3p69"", ""10.1080/13504509.2019.1666754"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.064"", ""10.1016/j.envdev.2015.09.002"", ""10.1111/jiec.12732"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.244"", ""10.1080/13504509.2016.1235624"", ""10.1016/j.clepro.2018.12.271"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2010.05.010""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Building and Construction', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

We combine data from input–output relationships, imports and tariffs, to calculate the impact of the tariff increases by both the United States and China on cumulative tariffs paid by third countries. We show that the tariff hikes increase cumulative tariffs for other countries and thus hurt trade partners further downstream in global supply chains. We also show that this is particularly important for tariff increases on Chinese imports in the United States. These are likely to be used as intermediates in production in the United States, which are then re‐exported to third countries. The most heavily hit third countries are the closest trade partners, namely the EU, Canada and Mexico. We estimate that the tariffs impose an additional burden of around 500 million to 1 billion US dollars on these countries. China's tariffs on US imports have less of an effect.","[{""name"": ""Haiou Mao"", ""affiliation"": [""Wuhan University Wuhan China"", ""Kiel Centre for Globalization Kiel Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Holger Görg"", ""affiliation"": [""Kiel Centre for Globalization Kiel Germany""]}]","[""10.3386/w25672"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3338711"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3526944"", ""10.1086/259151"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-54314-1.00004-5"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2015.05.002"", ""10.1111/1467-9701.00531"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226455037.001.0001"", ""10.1080/1540496X.2018.1446131"", ""10.1257/aer.104.12.4104""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Strategy and Management', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

Yet, almost all Americans are descended from people who originated outside the country, a narrative often evoked by the media and taught in school curricula. Can this narrative increase inclusionary attitudes toward migrants? We draw from scholarship showing that perspective-taking decreases prejudice toward out-groups to investigate whether reminding Americans about their own immigration history increases support for immigrants and immigration. We propose that priming family experiences can indirectly stimulate perspective-taking and induce empathy toward the out-group, which we test with three separate survey experiments conducted over two years. Our findings show that priming family history generates small but consistent inclusionary effects. These effects occur even among partisan subgroups and Americans who approve of President Trump. We provide evidence that increased empathy for immigrants constitutes one mechanism driving these effects.","[{""name"": ""SCOTT WILLIAMSON"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""CLAIRE L.

In this review, we provide an overview of the three main theoretical models that explain different causal pathways. We then synthesize the surge in research using causal inference strategies and show that this literature has generated mixed results about the causal impact of education, even when using similar methods and data. These findings do not provide clear support for any of the three theories. Our next section covers research on civic education and political participation. The quantity of civic education matters little for political participation, but how civic education is taught does matter. Namely, strategies falling under the rubric of active learning show promise. These strategies seem especially effective for historically marginalized students. Our final section calls for more research on how civic education is taught.","[{""name"": ""Claire Willeck"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA;,""]}, {""name"": ""Tali Mendelberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA;,""]}]","[""10.1257/000282805774669916"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9134-9"", ""10.2307/2082425"", ""10.1515/9781400841912-011"", ""10.1086/653627"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9063-z"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00400.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-033011-201728"", ""10.1257/aer.20181169"", ""10.3386/w9588"", ""10.3102/00028312017002253"", ""10.1177/1532673X11419492"", ""10.1080/13569317.2016.1205965"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.217"", ""10.3386/w10568"", ""10.3386/w25018"", ""10.1515/9781400822911"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000351"", ""10.2307/2669367"", ""10.2307/2111481"", ""10.1007/s11109-005-3075-8"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000119"", ""10.1017/9781108770446"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.33"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090719"", ""10.2307/20054169"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00936.x"", ""10.3102/0002831208316951"", ""10.1017/S1049096506060471"", ""10.1561/100.00020106"", ""10.1017/S0022381608080651"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000363"", ""10.1086/268685"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.11"", ""10.1080/10584609.2014.944322"", ""10.2307/1976093"", ""10.2307/1953435"", ""10.1525/9780520949904"", ""10.1093/pan/mpw007"", ""10.1111/ajps.12409"", ""10.1017/S002238161100034X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139005104"", ""10.1017/S1537592720000699"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2003.10.005"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09573-6"", ""10.1080/10888690801910526"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000409"", ""10.1017/9781108355001"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.012003.104840"", ""10.1515/9781400841912"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00425.x"", ""10.1093/pan/mpm012"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1pnc1k7""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Education', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1093/isq/sqab027,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,"Economic Decline, Social Identity, and Authoritarian Values in the United States","AbstractWhy does the contemporary backlash against globalization in the United States have such a substantial authoritarian character? We argue that sustained economic decline has a negative effect on the social identity of historically dominant groups. These losses lead individuals to be more likely to want to enforce social norm conformity—that is, adopt more authoritarian values—as a way to preserve social status and this effect is greater the larger the size of other groups in the population. Central to our account is the expectation of an interactive effect of local economic and demographic conditions in forging value responses to economic decline. The article evaluates this argument using an original 2017 representative survey in the United States. We find that individuals living in relatively diverse regions facing more intense competition from Chinese imports have more authoritarian values. We further find that the greater effect of globalization-induced labor market decline in more diverse areas is also evident for vote choice in the 2016 Presidential election.","[{""name"": ""Cameron Ballard-Rosa"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Amalie Jensen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Copenhagen, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Kenneth Scheve"", ""affiliation"": [""Yale University, USA""]}]","[""10.1086/682384"", ""10.1162/003355300554881"", ""10.1257/aer.103.6.2121"", ""10.1257/aer.20170011"", ""10.3386/w22178"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.61.4.629"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00781.x"", ""10.5964/jspp.v4i2.168"", ""10.1086/682151"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00316"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12319"", ""10.1177/0010414019879947"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190651824.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.04.002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802331"", ""10.1017/9781108645157"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000194"", ""10.1111/iere.12209"", ""10.1177/1948550618759326"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-110713"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000898"", ""10.1177/0010414021997175"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00414.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000394"", ""10.1080/10584609.2011.616874"", ""10.1086/710322"", ""10.1057/s42214-018-0001-4"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2822059"", ""10.1037/h0035588"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.10"", ""10.2307/j.ctvktrvp5"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614712"", ""10.1017/S002238161300131X"", ""10.1177/0010414015576745""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Demography']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz257,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Civil society perspectives on sexual violence in conflict: patriarchy and war strategy in Colombia,"Abstract In international policy circles, conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) is commonly viewed as a weapon of war, a framing that researchers have criticized as overly simplistic. Feminist scholars in particular caution that the ‘weapon of war’ framing decontextualizes sexual violence in conflict from the structural factors of gender inequality that underpin its perpetration. In light of these tensions, how do politically relevant local actors perceive the nature and the origins of conflict-related sexual violence? Civil society organizations often actively confront conflict-related sexual violence on the ground. A better understanding of how their perceptions of this violence align or clash with the globally dominant ‘weapon of war’ narratives therefore has important policy implications. Interviews with representatives of Colombian women's organizations and victims' associations reveal that these civil society activists predominantly view conflict-related sexual violence as the result of patriarchal structures. The mobilized women perceive sexual violence as a very gendered violence that exists on a continuum extending through peace, the everyday and war, and which the presence of arms exacerbates. Strategic sexual violence, too, is understood to ultimately have its basis in patriarchal structures. The findings expose a disconnect between the globally dominant ‘weapon of war’ understanding that is decontextualized from structural factors and a local approach to CRSV that establishes clear linkages to societal gender inequality.","[{""name"": ""Anne-Kathrin Kreft"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We explore whether and to what extent messages priming common national identity or common religious identity, with and without elite endorsements, decrease the use of hostile anti-outgroup language. We find that elite-endorsed messages that prime common religious identity are the most consistently effective in reducing the spread of sectarian hate speech. Our results provide suggestive evidence that religious elites may play an important role as social referents—alerting individuals to social norms of acceptable behavior. By randomly assigning counter-speech treatments to actual producers of online hate speech and experimentally evaluating the effectiveness of these messages on a representative sample of citizens that might be incidentally exposed to such language, this work offers insights for researchers and policymakers on avenues for combating harmful rhetoric on and offline.","[{""name"": ""ALEXANDRA A.

We use analysis of Trump’s campaign rhetoric, his administration’s policies, and their reception to assess these rival claims. In his campaign, Trump narrated American identity as a tale of lost greatness in which a once-unblemished America gave way to globalist elites who have victimized many Americans, particularly traditionalist, predominantly white Christian Americans. His policies have systematically expanded protections for such Americans and sought to increase their share of the American electorate and citizenry, while reducing or eliminating initiatives designed to assist and increase the numbers of non-white, non-Christian American voters and citizens. The evidence thus shows that although Trump does not explicitly endorse white nationalism, his rhetoric and policies articulate not a consistent race-blind nationalism, but a vision of white protectionism.","[{""name"": ""Rogers M.

Access and allocation problems in Global North-South waste trade","AbstractInfamous cases of toxic waste trade and research on its health and environmental implications have made the global waste trade a prominent environmental and social justice issue. Recently, such trade has shifted towards extracting resources from waste as recyclable components and used goods which could create income-generating opportunities and reduce the environmental burdens of waste trade from Global North to Global South countries. Nevertheless, studies highlight persistent problems in the access to these resources and allocation of responsibilities, risks and burdens from processing and disposal of traded waste in Global South countries. This article aims to contribute to the lessons learnt on access and allocation with respect to waste trade by focusing on issues of equity, fairness and distributive justice. Two cases are analysed: trade in discarded electronic and electric equipment (EEE) between the EU and Africa and trade in plastic materials between the UK and China. This study shows that exports of used EEE and recyclable plastic materials exacerbate the environmental burdens of Global South countries while also exporting new environmental risks and social burdens. At the same time, new demands for justice have emerged from Global South countries through waste ship back initiatives, and new international measures have also been adopted. While the access and allocation lens enabled the identification of persistent problems in Global North–South waste trade, directing future Earth System Governance research to the demands emerging from the Global South countries could offer insights into how to better address these problems and deal with growing global inequalities.","[{""name"": ""Benedetta Cotta"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0022278X1300058X"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00166"", ""10.1007/s10784-010-9137-3"", ""10.1007/s10611-012-9383-0"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8594.2011.00376.x"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.08.003"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aat0131"", ""10.1016/j.esg.2019.100006"", ""10.1525/9780520342118"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.053"", ""10.2747/0272-3638.33.1.1"", ""10.1080/03085147.2015.1013353"", ""10.1007/s10784-010-9139-1"", ""10.1057/ejdr.2015.30"", ""10.3390/resources6040052"", ""10.1289/ehp.1509699"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.002"", ""10.1016/S0959-3780(03)00047-5"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-1329-0"", ""10.1017/cls.2018.11"", ""10.1108/MEQ-12-2012-0077"", ""10.1109/MITP.2008.16"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2010.09.014"", ""10.1111/geoj.12077"", ""10.5195/jwsr.2015.11"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2693-2"", ""10.1787/9789264256385-en"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2010.10.023"", ""10.14512/gaia.20.1.9"", ""10.1016/j.aogh.2014.10.001"", ""10.1068/a45728"", ""10.1289/ehp.114-a232"", ""10.1111/jiec.12732"", ""10.1007/s10784-008-9069-3"", ""10.18356/838f78fd-en"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-050511-122532"", ""10.1007/s00170-009-2358-3""]",['Environmental Science'],"['Pollution', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)]]"
10.1017/pan.2020.11,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Using Eye-Tracking to Understand Decision-Making in Conjoint Experiments,"Conjoint experiments are popular, but there is a paucity of research on respondents’ underlying decision-making processes. We leverage eye-tracking methodology and a series of conjoint experiments, administered to university students and local community members, to examine how respondents process information in conjoint surveys. There are two main findings. First, attribute importance measures inferred from the stated choice data are correlated with attribute importance measures based on eye movement. This validation test supports the interpretation of common conjoint metrics, such as average marginal component effects (AMCEs), as measures of attribute importance. Second, when we experimentally increase the number of attributes and profiles in the conjoint table, respondents view a larger absolute number of cells but a smaller fraction of the total cells displayed. Moving from two to three profiles, respondents search more within-profile, rather than within-attribute, to build summary evaluations. However, respondents’ stated choices remain fairly stable regardless of the number of attributes and profiles in the conjoint table. Together, these patterns speak to the robustness of conjoint experiments and are consistent with a bounded rationality mechanism. Respondents adapt to complexity by selectively incorporating relevant new information to focus on important attributes, while ignoring less relevant information to reduce cognitive processing costs.","[{""name"": ""Libby Jenke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kirk Bansak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jens Hainmueller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominik Hangartner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1287/mksc.7.3.271"", ""10.1016/j.humpath.2006.08.024"", ""10.2307/2952076"", ""10.1037/h0026750"", ""10.1016/B978-008044980-7/50017-3"", ""10.3389/fnins.2012.00109"", ""10.1080/01621459.2018.1476246"", ""10.1006/obhd.1996.0087"", ""10.1093/jopart/mug028"", ""10.3758/BF03197692"", ""10.1086/209397"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.30"", ""10.3758/s13428-017-0998-z"", ""10.1016/j.neulet.2005.11.071"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(89)90059-9"", ""10.1086/209535"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791048"", ""10.1038/s41562-019-0537-2"", ""10.1002/bdm.2007"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.92.2.382"", ""10.1093/poq/nfn059"", ""10.4324/9780203875292"", ""10.1177/002224299005400402"", ""10.1038/nature01986"", ""10.1016/0003-6870(79)90138-8"", ""10.1007/s11109-011-9158-9"", ""10.1177/0956797610374738"", ""10.3758/BF03201761"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173933"", ""10.1002/bdm.3960070203"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.40"", ""10.1002/bdm.2129"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1086/208579"", ""10.2307/1962397"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.103.4.650"", ""10.1017/S0140525X99002150"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.93.3.258"", ""10.1006/obhd.1997.2692"", ""10.2307/2669334"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1509/jmr.13.0467"", ""10.1145/2168556.2168625"", ""10.1038/nn.2516"", ""10.2501/S147078531020151X"", ""10.1016/j.visres.2007.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.06.003"", ""10.2307/1884852"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.40.5.843"", ""10.1257/aer.101.2.900""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Decision Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Decision Sciences', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7409), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7377)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

Trust, polarization, populism and COVID-19 deaths across European regions","AbstractWhy have some territories performed better than others in the fight against COVID‐19? This paper uses a novel dataset on excess mortality, trust and political polarization for 165 European regions to explore the role of social and political divisions in the remarkable regional differences in excess mortality during the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic. First, we investigate whether regions characterized by a low social and political trust witnessed a higher excess mortality. Second, we argue that it is not only levels, but also polarization in trust among citizens – in particular, between government supporters and non‐supporters – that matters for understanding why people in some regions have adopted more pro‐healthy behaviour. Third, we explore the partisan make‐up of regional parliaments and the relationship between political division – or what we refer to as ‘uncooperative politics’. We hypothesize that the ideological positioning – in particular those that lean more populist – and ideological polarization among political parties is also linked to higher mortality. Accounting for a host of potential confounders, we find robust support that regions with lower levels of both social and political trust are associated with higher excess mortality, along with citizen polarization in institutional trust in some models. On the ideological make‐up of regional parliaments, we find that, ceteris paribus, those that lean more ‘tan’ on the ‘GAL‐TAN’ spectrum yielded higher excess mortality. Moreover, although we find limited evidence of elite polarization driving excess deaths on the left‐right or GAL‐TAN spectrums, partisan differences on the attitudes towards the European Union demonstrated significantly higher deaths, which we argue proxies for (anti)populism. Overall, we find that both lower citizen‐level trust and populist elite‐level ideological characteristics of regional parliaments are associated with higher excess mortality in European regions during the first wave of the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""NICHOLAS CHARRON"", ""affiliation"": [""The Department of Political Science and Quality of Government Institute University of Gothenburg  Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""VICTOR LAPUENTE"", ""affiliation"": [""The Department of Political Science and Quality of Government Institute University of Gothenburg  Sweden"", ""ESADE Business School  Spain""]}, {""name"": ""ANDRÉS RODRÍGUEZ‐POSE"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Economic Geography London School of Economics GEN  UK""]}]","[""10.1215/03616878-8802162"", ""10.31235/osf.io/dkusw"", ""10.1177/0192512101022004003"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30567-5"", ""10.1016/j.ribaf.2020.101249"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104316"", ""10.3386/w27008"", ""10.1016/j.jhealeco.2021.102531"", ""10.1177/0010414017710258"", ""10.1101/2020.07.29.20164806"", ""10.1177/1354068811436042"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.11.016"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113501"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12401"", ""10.1093/esr/jcv059"", ""10.1332/251569121X16268740317724"", ""10.4337/9781786436672.00017"", ""10.1080/00343404.2013.770141"", ""10.1111/pirs.12437"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3645410"", ""10.1111/puar.13241"", ""10.1016/j.glt.2020.06.003"", ""10.33774/apsa-2020-jf671-v2"", ""10.1017/S0007123411000275"", ""10.1017/9781316822869"", ""10.1177/0010414008315860"", ""10.1177/1354068808097889"", ""10.1086/230995"", ""10.1080/00343404.2019.1654603"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000500"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000097"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12419"", ""10.1177/1354068802008002001"", ""10.1177/00420980211018072"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30411-6"", ""10.31234/osf.io/p5gns"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105236"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1783791"", ""10.1017/S0003055401003045"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1038/s41586-020-2404-8"", ""10.1186/s41937-020-00054-w"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7"", ""10.1080/01402382.2021.1925821"", ""10.1017/dmp.2015.72"", ""10.1016/S1096-2867(96)80012-0"", ""10.1001/jama.2009.2023"", ""10.4324/9780203451656_chapter_2"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12271"", ""10.1111/puar.13214"", ""10.1007/s10464-007-9156-6"", ""10.2196/19218"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1281261"", ""10.1177/0263395718784704"", ""10.1177/2053168016686915"", ""10.4159/9780674042353"", ""10.1111/jors.12541"", ""10.1093/eurpub/ckl004"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.09.035"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12425"", ""10.1073/pnas.2010625117"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0884-z"", ""10.1177/0032321715607514"", ""10.1177/1354068812448691"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3551767"", ""10.1177/0275074020942445""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Modeling and Simulation', 'Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It determines policy's form and effect while also lying at the intersection of politics, policy, and the public. Policy implementation takes place within a given institutional setting and requires specific structure and organization to conduct it both of which allocate decision power and mint specific roles in the implementation process. Nevertheless, current implementation literature tends to overlook implementation arrangements as structures influencing, and influenced by, power. This special issue draws on various aspects of implementation arrangements to demonstrate the significant, yet underexplored, polity of implementation. To do so, this introduction begins by reviewing the conceptual frameworks available in the current implementation scholarship. This is followed by a discussion of the special issue's seven contributions. Finally, the conclusion proposes recommendations for conducting future research on the polity of implementation.","[{""name"": ""Fritz Sager"", ""affiliation"": [""KPM Center for Public Management University of Bern  Bern Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Anat Gofen"", ""affiliation"": [""Federmann School of Public Policy and Governance Hebrew University Jerusalem  Jerusalem Israel""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-531-90407-8_22"", ""10.1111/gove.12602"", ""10.4324/9781315202877"", ""10.1111/gove.12608"", ""10.2307/2149628"", ""10.1111/gove.12589"", ""10.1111/psj.12023"", ""10.4337/9781786437631.00033"", ""10.1111/gove.12567"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb00343.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00001975"", ""10.1177/017084068100200301"", ""10.1111/j.1754-7121.2000.tb01152.x"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1750"", ""10.1093/scipol/scaa042"", ""10.1111/gove.12607"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00761.x"", ""10.1057/9780230524644_9"", ""10.2307/1961840"", ""10.1332/030557316x14788733118252"", ""10.1111/gove.12596"", ""10.1017/S0003055401000120"", ""10.1177/0952076713517733"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00360.x"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55269-3_51"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-32490-2"", ""10.1017/s0143814x1600009x"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.166"", ""10.1002/epa2.1062"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy024"", ""10.1111/gove.12600"", ""10.2307/2094862""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Public Administration']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

This article develops, tests, and defends a theoretical framework that explains the politics of regulatory response to the rise of platform capitalism. Using discourse network analysis and a case study on the regulation of Uber in New York, it shows that the success or failure of regulations depends on the ability of actors to mobilize broad coalition; that narratives affect the composition of these coalitions; and that platform companies have both unique political strengths and vulnerabilities. This article makes substantive contributions to our understanding of the politics of platform capitalism, and it makes theoretical contributions to the literature studies on coalitional politics, ideational institutionalism, and business power.","[{""name"": ""Timo Seidl"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political and Social Sciences, European University Institute  Via dei Roccettini Fiesole, FI Italy""]}]","[""10.1525/cmr.2016.58.3.66"", ""10.1007/BF00159817"", ""10.1080/13501760902983382"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1115533"", ""10.1017/S0007123411000469"", ""10.1017/S1537592703000471"", ""10.1080/13501760802453221"", ""10.1017/S1537592718001093"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080016"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x"", ""10.1080/17449626.2015.1054556"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001442"", ""10.1215/9780822381815-003"", ""10.1515/9780691221380-016"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803963.012"", ""10.1353/wp.2001.0003"", ""10.1080/13569775.2018.1452527"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511761010"", ""10.2307/3105385"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226470993.001.0001"", ""10.1111/psj.12007"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02003.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199286676.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1115538"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2019.02.003"", ""10.1017/9781316756287"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198797012.001.0001"", ""10.1057/eps.2013.26"", ""10.1177/0032329219838932"", ""10.1525/9780520970632"", ""10.1080/13501768880000051"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135342"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X20190000063018"", ""10.1111/psj.12025"", ""10.1017/S1537592710001179"", ""10.2307/2151585"", ""10.1017/S1537592718001081"", ""10.1515/9781400837786"", ""10.5465/amd.2016.0153"", ""10.4159/9780674726123""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ser/mwz001,SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology; 0202 Applied Economics; 0201 Theoretical Economics,The ideational foundations of social democratic austerity in the context of the great recession,"AbstractThe ‘austerity settlement’ has come to define the post-crisis European political economy. Since 2010, parties from across Europe’s political mainstream have implemented austerity and despite the apparent conflict with the interests of their traditional constituents, even social democratic parties have acquiesced to this settlement. However, within the existing literature ‘social democratic austerity’ is currently under-theorized as it is assumed to involve a rather straightforward adaptation of social democrats to neo- and/or ordoliberal ideas. Utilizing rich and original evidence from over 60 elite interviews with key social democratic stakeholders in France, Germany and the UK, this article contests this view. It demonstrates instead that a distinct set of ideas based on New Keynesianism, supply-side economics, and the social investment paradigm provide the ideational foundations for social democratic austerity post-crisis. Understanding this, it is argued, is critical in order to fully appreciate how and why austerity has become dominant in post-crisis Europe.","[{""name"": ""Björn Bremer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political and Social Sciences, European University Institute, San Domenico di Fiesole, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Sean McDaniel"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/1468-0327.00039"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1111072"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856X.2009.00373.x"", ""10.7765/9781847799357"", ""10.1080/13563467.2014.951431"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190600389.001.0001"", ""10.1086/260266"", ""10.4159/9780674020849"", ""10.1162/003355300554999"", ""10.1257/aer.103.3.117"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087230"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1308417"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174947"", ""10.1080/13563467.2012.656082"", ""10.1177/0010414005285755"", ""10.1177/1354068817740745"", ""10.1016/0304-3932(83)90060-0"", ""10.1111/gove.12301"", ""10.1057/fp.2014.8"", ""10.1017/S0007123407000038"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.638117"", ""10.1080/09639489.2017.1375649"", ""10.1016/j.jimonfin.2012.11.003"", ""10.1111/1467-856X.12038"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr003"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-51047-1"", ""10.1093/pa/gsu016"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625633"", ""10.1086/654131"", ""10.1177/0032329214556276"", ""10.1515/9780691221380"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856X.2012.00515.x"", ""10.1080/13563467.2016.1158800"", ""10.4337/roke.2017.03.06"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1106573"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198790488.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.70.s1.8"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.072004.085858"", ""10.1086/260580"", ""10.1093/cje/bet076"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1231708"", ""10.7591/9781501736971"", ""10.1057/cep.2015.36"", ""10.1016/S0167-2231(76)80003-6"", ""10.1177/0032329216655317"", ""10.1080/07036337.2014.990137"", ""10.1080/713601585"", ""10.1080/09692290.2011.552783"", ""10.1093/ser/mww042"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139171830"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12191"", ""10.1080/13563467.2012.656080"", ""10.1257/jep.8.1.3"", ""10.1093/0199253684.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0032329215571291"", ""10.2307/2534285"", ""10.1111/gove.12019"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00474.x"", ""10.1177/0032329215617465"", ""10.1080/14782804.2014.937408""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1111/spsr.12428,SWISS POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"The Welfare Agenda of the Populist Radical Right in Western Europe: Combining Welfare Chauvinism, Producerism and Populism","AbstractRecent scholarship on the populist radical right tends to imprecisely describe the welfare agenda of this party family with reference to its key ideological characteristics of nativism, authoritarianism, and populism. We propose an alternative analytical framework that considers the multidimensionality of welfare state positions and the “deservingness criteria” that underlie ideas about welfare entitlement. Applying this framework to a sample of four European populist radical right parties, we conclude that three interrelated frames inform their welfare agenda. These parties, we argue, advocate social closure not only on the basis of the deservingness criterion of identity (welfare chauvinism), but also on criteria of control, attitude, and reciprocity (welfare producerism) and on an antagonism between the people and the establishment (welfare populism). Understanding the welfare agenda of the populist radical right requires us to move beyond welfare chauvinism and to reconsider the concept of welfare producerism and its interaction with welfare chauvinism.","[{""name"": ""Koen Abts"", ""affiliation"": [""Tilburg University""]}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Dalle Mulle"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies""]}, {""name"": ""Stijn van Kessel"", ""affiliation"": [""Queen Mary University of London""]}, {""name"": ""Elie Michel"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Lucerne""]}]","[""10.1017/S1755773914000125"", ""10.1177/000169939003300303"", ""10.1177/0952872002012002114"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00783.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-23547-6"", ""10.4324/9780203464526"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.12075"", ""10.1177/0192512112455443"", ""10.1177/1354068807075943"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1975.tb01000.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00712.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77435-8_1"", ""10.1111/spsr.12218"", ""10.1111/spol.12325"", ""10.1080/21699763.2018.1483255"", ""10.1093/0199284660.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0002716286485001005"", ""10.1177/0958928714556970"", ""10.1057/fp.2015.17"", ""10.1163/25888072-02011022"", ""10.1177/0261018315624168"", ""10.1080/01402380701617563"", ""10.2307/2669268"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198795452.003.0009"", ""10.1177/1354068805049734"", ""10.1177/0143831X18780317"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12259"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00268.x"", ""10.1111/spsr.12302"", ""10.4324/9781315733159"", ""10.1080/01402382.2020.1720400"", ""10.1007/s11205-012-0099-4"", ""10.1017/S1755773917000133"", ""10.1017/S1755773911000282"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12356"", ""10.1177/0896920509357506"", ""10.1332/0305573002500811"", ""10.1177/0958928706059829"", ""10.4337/9781785367212"", ""10.1006/ssre.1993.1016""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Integrating the study of signaling in IR with research on motivated skepticism and asymmetric updating from political psychology, we show that individuals’ tendencies to embrace information consistent with their overarching belief systems (and dismiss information inconsistent with it) has important implications for how signals are interpreted. We test our theory in the context of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran, combining two survey experiments fielded on members of the American mass public. We find patterns consistent with motivated skepticism: the individuals most likely to update their beliefs are those who need reassurance the least, such that costly signals cause polarization rather than convergence. Successful signaling therefore requires knowing something about the orientations of the signal's recipient.","[{""name"": ""Joshua D. Kertzer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brian C.

10.1111/1467-923X.13005,POLITICAL QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,The Politics of Levelling Up,"Abstract‘Levelling up’ is an expression of a realignment in British politics with the Conservatives presenting themselves as the new party of redistribution. This is not primarily concerned with redistribution between social classes, or even between regions, but rather targets communities that feel they have lost their centrality and standing. This seemingly surprising manoeuvre is facilitated by voters’ distrust of politics, a geography of discontent that reflects uneven patterns of social and economic development, and the Conservative Party's capacity for pragmatic shifts in ideological direction. Yet, the sustainability of this project is uncertain. Levelling up creates opportunities for high‐profile initiatives and symbols of change through which the government can craft a narrative of success. It may also help the Conservatives appeal to voters that lean one way on economics but another on social issues by targeting attention and interventions in specific places—in a way that speaks to some voters’ feelings of having been neglected over many decades and having lost status to other groups in society. The tensions in delivering levelling up reflect the complexity of the changes wrought by globalisation and technological change, but the challenge for progressive forces is to develop a better alternative—a far from easy task.","[{""name"": ""Will Jennings"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lawrence McKay"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gerry Stoker"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S0020818321000473,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,The Assault on Civil Society: Explaining State Crackdown on NGOs,"AbstractNongovernmental organizations are central to contemporary global governance, and their numbers and influence have grown dramatically since the middle of the twentieth century. However, in the last three decades more than 130 states have repressed these groups, suggesting that a broad range of states perceive them as costly. When they choose to repress NGOs, under what conditions do states use violent strategies versus administrative means? The choice depends on two main factors: the nature of the threat posed by these groups, and the consequences of cracking down on them. Violent crackdown is useful in the face of immediate domestic threats, such as protests. However, violence may increase the state's criminal liability, reduce its legitimacy, violate human rights treaties, and further intensify mobilization against the regime. Therefore, states are more likely to use administrative crackdown, especially in dealing with long-term threats, such as when NGOs influence electoral politics. I test this theory using an original data set of administrative crackdowns on NGOs, as well as violent crackdown on NGO activists, across all countries from 1990 to 2013. To shed light on the strategic decision between violent or administrative crackdown, and how states may perceive threats from domestic and international NGOs differently, I provide a case study from India. I conclude by discussing the implications of this crackdown for the use of civil society actors by the international community, as well as donors and citizens in the global South.","[{""name"": ""Suparna Chaudhry"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511762635.006"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2968280"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801449666.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000465"", ""10.1111/1467-7660.00120"", ""10.7312/mend12490"", ""10.1002/jid.3380050308"", ""10.1177/106591290605900101"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2006.00392.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316678527"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1483607"", ""10.1177/0022343308098405"", ""10.1093/sf/soz138"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000623"", ""10.4324/9781315268927-39"", ""10.1111/j.1528-3585.2012.00471.x"", ""10.1093/isr/viv014"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107588561"", ""10.1177/0899764020971045"", ""10.1111/isqu.12041"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0071"", ""10.4324/9781315268927-3"", ""10.1353/hrq.0.0141"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.101405.143216"", ""10.1177/0022343307078940"", ""10.1007/s11558-015-9242-8"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000100"", ""10.2307/2111650"", ""10.1353/jod.2006.0029"", ""10.2307/20047909"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511756245"", ""10.1177/0022002787031002003"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316489031"", ""10.1111/1468-2478.00064"", ""10.1093/isq/sqz088"", ""10.1086/690946"", ""10.1525/sp.2007.54.3.229"", ""10.1080/13569771003593920"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0026"", ""10.1007/s11266-010-9148-2"", ""10.1080/13523270902861038"", ""10.1177/0010414007305817"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00086.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190093235.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jod.1996.0031"", ""10.1017/S0043887110000080"", ""10.1093/isq/sqaa019"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777"", ""10.1007/s11266-009-9103-2"", ""10.1017/psrm.2017.44"", ""10.1177/0010414093026003001"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.02.001"", ""10.1177/0022343313519808"", ""10.1177/0022343302039005007"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706934"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00621.x"", ""10.1177/0022343318751035"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190910976.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050216"", ""10.1177/0022002712468720"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2013.04.001"", ""10.1111/isqu.12039"", ""10.1111/ajps.12416"", ""10.1080/14754835.2019.1579638"", ""10.1353/hrq.0.0152"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(89)90263-5"", ""10.1162/isec.2008.33.1.7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510021"", ""10.1162/016228803322761973"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.903854"", ""10.1177/0022002710374715"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(96)00019-8"", ""10.1177/0010414007313124"", ""10.4324/9780203101391"", ""10.1111/ajps.12013"", ""10.1525/as.2009.49.5.741"", ""10.1007/s11266-020-00240-7"", ""10.2307/2991732""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/padm.12657,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Policy design and public support for carbon tax: Evidence from a 2018USnational online survey experiment,"AbstractPublic support for policy instruments is influenced by perceptions of how benefits and costs are distributed across various groups. We examine different carbon tax designs outlining different ways to distribute tax revenues. Using a national online sample of 1,606 US respondents, we examine support for a $20/ton carbon tax that is: (1) revenue neutral: revenue is returned to citizens via tax cuts; (2) compensation‐focused: revenue is directed to helping actors disproportionately hurt by the tax; (3) mitigation‐focused: revenue funds projects reducing carbon emissions; and (4) adaptation‐focused: revenue is directed to enhancing community resilience to extreme weather events. We find devoting revenue to mitigation raises overall support for carbon tax by 6.3 per cent versus the control (54.9 per cent) where no information on spending is provided. Other frames raise support in specific subgroups only. Revenue neutrality raises support among lower‐income households (+6.6 per cent) and political independents (+9.4 per cent), while compensation increases support among lower‐income repondents (+6.1 per cent).","[{""name"": ""Nives Dolšak"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Marine and Environmental Affairs University of Washington  Seattle USA""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher Adolph"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Washington  Seattle USA""]}, {""name"": ""Aseem Prakash"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Washington  Seattle USA""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jeem.2013.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2006.05.006"", ""10.1038/nclimate2814"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000092"", ""10.2307/1882231"", ""10.2307/3439132"", ""10.1111/psj.12347"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1177/1745691610393980"", ""10.1007/s00199-010-0598-y"", ""10.1086/466560"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.10"", ""10.1002/jae.1156"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025739"", ""10.1080/14693062.2015.1058240"", ""10.1016/0928-7655(96)00003-6"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000508"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2003.10.001"", ""10.1093/reep/res015"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00602.x"", ""10.1126/science.162.3859.1243"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990104"", ""10.1007/s11077-009-9079-1"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2008.06.010"", ""10.1177/2053168015604648"", ""10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol29-No1-9"", ""10.1111/rssb.12027"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139025751"", ""10.2307/2082437"", ""10.1080/14693062.2018.1470963"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2015.08.037"", ""10.1017/S0003055401000235"", ""10.2307/2669316"", ""10.1007/s10584-015-1555-3"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/aa822a"", ""10.1007/s11135-011-9640-9"", ""10.1111/padm.12402"", ""10.1111/psj.12014"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00403.x"", ""10.1257/jep.21.2.153"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.050"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.1994.tb00502.x"", ""10.2307/2009452"", ""10.1080/01402389908425284"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2011.01198.x"", ""10.1093/reep/ren015"", ""10.1016/0022-0531(72)90049-X"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00698.x"", ""10.1002/wcc.276"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/5/1/014007"", ""10.1111/geoj.12008"", ""10.2307/1060731"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807763"", ""10.2307/448442"", ""10.2307/1956018"", ""10.1006/jeem.1995.1061"", ""10.1111/psj.12040"", ""10.1257/jep.9.4.97"", ""10.1111/padm.12347"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2015.07.002"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00298.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070049"", ""10.2307/2151585"", ""10.2307/3439389"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01922.x"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7287.2000.tb00041.x"", ""10.1016/S0962-6298(96)00044-3"", ""10.1038/nclimate2009""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']",['Economics and Econometrics'],"[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1111/pops.12811,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,MOBILISE: A Higher-Order Integration of Collective Action Research to Address Global Challenges,"The past decade has witnessed rapid growth in popular protest, alongside an upsurge in research on collective action. The proliferation of research has been both productive and fragmenting: We have an excellent understanding of the many factors that shape participation in collective action, but we lack a framework that explains how these factors fit together. TheModel of Belonging, Individual differences, Life experience and Interaction Sustaining Engagement(MOBILISE) addresses this gap to explain when, why, how, and for whom, collective action manifests. MOBILISE suggests that participation in collective action is shaped by individual differences (micro) and life experiences which, separately and in combination, lead to the formation of a group consciousness (meso) via the collectivization of grievance. Group consciousness is, in turn, the proximal predictor of collective action. Collective action itself has outcomes for people (dis/empowerment) and societies. These micro and meso processes occur in the context of macro societal factors relating to the cultural, political, and economic environment. MOBILISE highlights the transformational role of interaction in explaining the global reach and rapidity with which popular movements can form.","[{""name"": ""Emma F.

10.1093/jopart/muz023,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,It Depends on What You Share: The Elusive Cost Savings from Service Sharing,"AbstractIntermunicipal cooperation is the most prevalent alternative service delivery method for US local governments. While aspirations for budgetary savings are one motivating factor, increased service quality and regional coordination are also important goals. We use an original 2013 survey of local governments in New York State to assess the level of service sharing and outcomes. We match our survey with 20 years (1996–2016) of service-level costs data to explore the relationships between sharing and costs across 12 common local government services. We contribute to the literature by providing the first multivariate assessment of the effect of cooperation on costs in the United States, and we contribute theoretical insights on the objectives and type of cooperation to explain differences in the effects of cooperation on costs across a variety of services. Our multivariate time series regressions find that service sharing leads to cost reductions in solid waste management, roads and highways, police, library, and sewer services; no difference in costs for economic development, ambulance/EMS, fire, water, and youth recreation; and higher costs in elder services, and planning and zoning. These differences are explained by whether services have characteristics such as asset specificity and the ability to achieve economies of scale on the one hand, or if sharing leads to greater administrative intensity or promotes other objectives such as quality and regional coordination outcomes on the other hand. We also analyze the effect of sharing on service costs over time, and find solid waste, roads and highways, police, and library are the only services where costs show a continued downward trend. These results show the limited role for economies of scale, even in asset specific services. Because cost savings are elusive, public sector reformers should be careful not to assume cost savings from sharing. The theoretical foundations for service sharing extend beyond economies of scale and transaction costs. Scholars should give more attention to organizational form and the broader goals of sharing.","[{""name"": ""Austin M Aldag"", ""affiliation"": [""Cornell University""]}, {""name"": ""Mildred E Warner"", ""affiliation"": [""Cornell University""]}, {""name"": ""Germà Bel"", ""affiliation"": [""Universitat de Barcelona""]}]","[""10.1080/03003930.2017.1411810"", ""10.1080/03003930.2017.1380630"", ""10.4337/9781782544302.00011"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01956.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux030"", ""10.4337/9781782544302.00010"", ""10.1080/13841280500513084"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus059"", ""10.1002/pam.20509"", ""10.1177/1078087419839492"", ""10.1111/padm.12104"", ""10.1080/17487870.2015.1100084"", ""10.1080/03003930.2017.1395741"", ""10.1111/padm.12356"", ""10.1332/030557395782453446"", ""10.1002/pam.10117"", ""10.1093/jopart/mug030"", ""10.1177/0275074008324566"", ""10.1080/13504851.2012.732682"", ""10.4337/9780857936868.00019"", ""10.1080/08111140600704111"", ""10.1080/01900690903188792"", ""10.1080/09540962.2016.1194081"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1438498"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9906.2007.00322.x"", ""10.1177/1078087408324000"", ""10.1111/psj.12023"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux021"", ""10.1111/jors.12388"", ""10.1177/0042098013499080"", ""10.1515/9781400823345"", ""10.1080/03003930.2012.726198"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02596.x"", ""10.1177/107808702401097808"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur006"", ""10.1068/c11166"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.935242"", ""10.1080/15309576.2015.983829"", ""10.1504/IJEM.2016.079848"", ""10.1080/01900692.2015.1029132"", ""10.1177/0020852309341330"", ""10.1007/s13412-018-0483-8"", ""10.1111/ruso.12262"", ""10.1177/0952076711403026"", ""10.1177/0095399711417396"", ""10.1080/03003930.2017.1395740"", ""10.1111/padm.12267"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux015"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024266"", ""10.2307/977185"", ""10.1080/03003930.2017.1322958"", ""10.1017/S0003055400125973"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2016.05.034"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2017.03.005"", ""10.1177/1049731514563578"", ""10.1002/pam.21836"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00681.x"", ""10.4335/14.3.358-378(2016)"", ""10.1080/03003930.2017.1395739"", ""10.2307/1924169"", ""10.1111/1540-6210.00239"", ""10.1002/pam.20020"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8292.2011.00450.x"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2012.06.007"", ""10.1002/pam.2027"", ""10.1177/107808702401097808"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00845.x"", ""10.1177/0739456X16642824"", ""10.1177/0891242413479140"", ""10.1177/0739456X19828058"", ""10.1177/0021886391271004"", ""10.1086/259258"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.02012.x"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1538424""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"
10.1017/S004388712000009X,WORLD POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Institutional Sources of Business Power,"ABSTRACTRecent years have seen a revival of debates about the role of business and the sources of business power in postindustrial political economies. Scholarly accounts commonly distinguish between structural sources of business power, connected to its privileged position in capitalist economies, and instrumental sources, related to direct forms of lobbying by business actors. The authors argue that this distinction overlooks an important third source of business power, which they conceptualize as institutional business power. Institutional business power results when state actors delegate public functions to private business actors. Over time, through policy feedback and lock-in effects, institutional business power contributes to an asymmetrical dependence of the state on the continued commitment of private business actors. This article elaborates the theoretical argument behind this claim, providing empirical examples of growing institutional business power in education in Germany, Sweden, and the United States.","[{""name"": ""Marius R.

10.1093/isq/sqac033,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Infrastructural Geopolitics,"AbstractInvisible and seemingly technical financial infrastructures have become the site of high geopolitics. Crucially, security sanctions are being leveraged through the global financial messaging network SWIFT. This article offers the term “infrastructural geopolitics” to draw attention to the ways in which hegemonic contestation and fracturing play out in and through payment infrastructures. Infrastructures are not passive sites to be used in the service of preexisting hegemonic power but can themselves route, block, challenge, or rework power in particular ways.We focus on the new trade mechanism INSTEX as a lens on the global battle over financial payment infrastructures. How and why has hegemonic contestation taken the shape of, and is in turn shaped by, struggles over payment infrastructure? As a heuristic device to analyze the hegemonic politics of financial infrastructure, we propose three terms that capture the processual nature of infrastructural politics: sedimentation, resurfacing, and fracturing. We apply these to the emergence of the payment infrastructure INSTEX. We explain how hegemonic politics become hardwired in the technical and largely invisible SWIFT infrastructure, which supported postwar financial order and sedimented its uneven power relations. The process of political resurfacing captures the ways in which infrastructural dispositions come to the surface of political discussion again, after 9/11 and through the JCPOA process. In conclusion, the introduction of INSTEX has advanced the possibility of fracturing international payment routes, with multiple alternative infrastructures emerging.","[{""name"": ""Marieke de Goede"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam , The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Carola Westermeier"", ""affiliation"": [""Goethe-University Frankfurt , Germany"", ""Justus-Liebig-University Giessen , Germany""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-64498-1_27"", ""10.1215/9781478002031"", ""10.1177/0967010610382687"", ""10.1177/0305829813481007"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198845225.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2019.102123"", ""10.1111/rego.12338"", ""10.1215/08992363-17-3-445"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1625420"", ""10.1111/ips.12026_1"", ""10.1080/17530350.2022.2028655"", ""10.1080/00141844.2015.1119174"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816675890.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09692290.2020.1830832"", ""10.1080/03050629.2015.1041297"", ""10.1080/09636412.2019.1604985"", ""10.1080/03057070.2010.507568"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00351"", ""10.1353/sais.2013.0008"", ""10.1080/13504851.2018.1486981"", ""10.1177/0263775817698699"", ""10.1177/0263775817698699"", ""10.1177/0967010619868385"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511585401"", ""10.1017/eis.2020.21"", ""10.1080/714000893"", ""10.1080/17450101.2017.1417774"", ""10.1080/19460171003619725"", ""10.1111/spsr.12436"", ""10.1080/14747731.2019.1671111"", ""10.1080/02589346.2020.1712830"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-092412-155522"", ""10.1080/09636412.2019.1604984"", ""10.1080/09692290.2020.1736126"", ""10.1080/09692290.2020.1803951"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9558.2010.01381.x"", ""10.4324/9781003218487-10"", ""10.1080/13604813.2016.1169778"", ""10.1080/02589346.2020.1712831"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.895773"", ""10.1093/isp/ekaa001"", ""10.1215/00382876-2831356"", ""10.1080/13563467.2020.1782368"", ""10.1111/area.12726"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1607766"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1625422"", ""10.1177/0263775819851940"", ""10.1002/9780470756218"", ""10.4324/9780203073025"", ""10.1177/00027649921955326"", ""10.1080/13563467.2019.1584173"", ""10.1080/09692290.2020.1763423"", ""10.14506/ca35.2.04""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Conventional wisdom holds that this strategy works because leaders can signal their benevolent intentions by removing corrupt officials. We argue that fighting against corruption can undermine regime support. By revealing scandals of corrupt officials, corruption investigations can alter citizens' beliefs about public officials and lead to disenchantment about political institutions. We test this argument by examining how China's current anti-corruption campaign has changed citizens' public support for the government and the Communist Party. We analyze the results of two original surveys conducted before and during the campaign, and employ a difference-in-differences strategy to show that corruption investigations, at the margin, suppress respondents' support for the central government and party. We also examine our respondents' prior and posterior beliefs, and the results support our updating mechanism.","[{""name"": ""Yuhua Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bruce J.

These debates have predominantly revolved around authorities’ ‘benign neglect’ of asset bubbles, their deregulatory policies, and the safety nets they provide for speculative exuberance. Most analyses refer to the dominance of pro-market interests and ideas to explain these actions. The present article moves beyond these accounts by showing how an alignment between techniques of monetary governance and ‘unfettered’ financial markets can explain central banks’ endorsement of increasingly fragile structures of liquidity and their strategic ignorance towards growing amounts of debt. We analyze the processes of abstraction and formalization by which the ‘programmes’ and ‘technologies’ of monetary governance have been made compatible with the texture of contemporary finance; and we show how central banks’ attempts to make markets more amenable to their methods of policy implementation shaped new conduits for financial growth. As empirical cases, we discuss the Federal Reserve’s experiments with different policy frameworks in the 1980s and the Bank of England’s twisted path to inflation targeting from 1979 to 1997. These cases allow us to demonstrate that the infrastructural power of contemporary central banking is predicated on the same institutional foundations that have made financialization possible.","[{""name"": ""Timo Walter"", ""affiliation"": [""Staatswissenschaftliche Fakultät, Universität Erfurt, Nordhäuser Straße 63, Erfurt, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Leon Wansleben"", ""affiliation"": [""Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Paulstr. 3, Cologne, Germany""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139506762"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1266714"", ""10.1057/9781137383822"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2016.09.005"", ""10.3386/w5893"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199274543.001.0001"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300100877.001.0001"", ""10.2139/ssrn.901387"", ""10.1080/03085147.2015.1049447"", ""10.1016/0167-2231(83)90024-6"", ""10.1080/096922999347290"", ""10.1057/palgrave.bp.4200074"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv008"", ""10.1023/A:1006903103304"", ""10.1080/17530350.2016.1234404"", ""10.1177/0170840611410836"", ""10.2307/1912324"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12198"", ""10.1086/258750"", ""10.1016/0167-2231(89)90020-1"", ""10.1177/0003122417728240"", ""10.1086/502693"", ""10.1086/367922"", ""10.1016/0304-3932(76)90013-1"", ""10.1086/466620"", ""10.1177/0001839214554830"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1207699"", ""10.1093/ser/mws003"", ""10.15195/v3.a22"", ""10.3386/w13580"", ""10.1093/oxrep/2.4.79"", ""10.2307/2234028"", ""10.1017/S0968565017000233"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000480"", ""10.1017/S0043887113000221"", ""10.1515/9780691188225-012"", ""10.2307/1991806"", ""10.2307/1991641"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511754173"", ""10.1007/s11186-013-9195-y"", ""10.4159/9780674039681"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139015011"", ""10.1093/SER/mwi008"", ""10.1086/669499"", ""10.1080/09692290500240222"", ""10.1177/0306312716676900"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199218233.003.0017"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2012.01424.x"", ""10.1515/9781400836260"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3888-8_1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496172.003"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2008.10.002"", ""10.2307/1883812"", ""10.1086/506677"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7287.1988.tb00540.x"", ""10.1057/9780230377899"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199730346.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb02484.x"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1325765"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107337626.012"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199688661.003.0009"", ""10.4337/9781781950982"", ""10.2307/1883009"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1979.tb02111.x"", ""10.2307/1991550"", ""10.2307/591464"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511496172.017"", ""10.1257/aer.102.2.1029"", ""10.1016/0304-3932(87)90031-6"", ""10.1177/135050840072007"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115437"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.369""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

However, little is known about how moral concerns interact with the widely accepted instrumental goals that aid serves. Moreover, what effects does this interplay have on preferences over policy actions? This article assesses these questions using a survey experiment in which respondents evaluate foreign aid policies toward nasty recipient regimes (those that violate human rights, rig elections, crack down on media, etc.). The results indicate that the publicdoeshave a strong aversion to providing aid to nasty recipient regimes, but that it also appreciates the instrumental benefits that aid helps acquire. Contrary to a mainstay assertion in the literature, the study finds that moral aversion can largely be reversed if the donor government engages more with the nasty country. These findings call into question the micro-foundations of recent theories of foreign aid, and produce several implications for the aid literature.","[{""name"": ""Tobias Heinrich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yoshiharu Kobayashi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00386.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.06.001"", ""10.1080/17457280802305177"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511842177"", ""10.1057/9781403973481"", ""10.1126/science.7455683"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000488"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2011.07.029"", ""10.1177/0738894215581330"", ""10.2307/2600934"", ""10.1177/0022002708316646"", ""10.1017/S0043887100008121"", ""10.1162/003465301750160108"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00057.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.11.006"", ""10.1111/isqu.12136"", ""10.1177/0192512111406095"", ""10.1177/0010414002035006001"", ""10.1111/isqu.12049"", ""10.1515/9781400873821"", ""10.1007/s11558-012-9153-x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491368.005"", ""10.1177/0951629814531669"", ""10.2307/2111319"", ""10.1177/0022002709351104"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090550"", ""10.2307/2600916"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.08.005"", ""10.1017/S002238161300011X"", ""10.7910/DVN/TKTN5J"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050150"", ""10.1177/1532440011406233"", ""10.1080/1747423X.2010.550694"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1111/ajps.12138"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.1080/10478400903028573"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000671"", ""10.1080/09546553.2013.878704"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.24"", ""10.2307/1061453"", ""10.1017/S0043887100020876"", ""10.1162/JEEA.2009.7.2-3.446"", ""10.2307/2669316"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706934"", ""10.1162/002081801317193592"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2011.07.027"", ""10.1023/A:1009874203400"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68925-3"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.08.006"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.289"", ""10.1177/0022002715600762"", ""10.1016/S0022-1996(00)00094-5"", ""10.2307/204819"", ""10.2307/2010075"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00167"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2010.00929.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00727.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.06.011"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wpk93"", ""10.4324/9780203936160"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9256-y"", ""10.1002/jid.1257"", ""10.1111/jssr.12184"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000119"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00635.x"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00121"", ""10.1111/isqu.12025"", ""10.1162/qjec.122.2.693"", ""10.1007/s11127-008-9318-6"", ""10.1080/14754835.2015.1129603"", ""10.3886/ICPSR30141.v1"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2010.0104.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.09.020"", ""10.1353/sor.2010.0024"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000073"", ""10.1111/ajps.12203"", ""10.1177/0022343314544779"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090109"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.081205.095418"", ""10.1111/ajps.12081"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.111605.105008"", ""10.1257/00028280260344669"", ""10.1086/687324"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060406.214132"", ""10.1073/pnas.1306374110"", ""10.1111/1468-2478.00220"", ""10.1177/0022343307078938"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2007.08.001"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054"", ""10.1111/isqu.12045"", ""10.1111/isqu.12041"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1223656"", ""10.1162/rest.91.2.295""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000595,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,How Do Observers Assess Resolve?,"ABSTRACTDespite a plethora of theoretical frameworks, IR scholars have struggled with the question of how observers assess resolve. We make two important contributions in this direction. Conceptually, we develop an integrative framework that unites otherwise disconnected theories, viewing them as a set of heuristics actors use to simplify information-rich environments. Methodologically, we employ a conjoint experiment that provides empirical traction impossible to obtain using alternative research designs. We find that ordinary citizens are ‘intuitive deterrence theorists’ who focus to a great extent on capabilities, stakes, signals and past actions in judging resolve. We also find that observers see democracies as less resolved than autocracies (not more), casting doubt on key propositions of democratic credibility theory. Finally, a conceptual replication shows that a group of elite decision makers converge with the US public in how they interpret costly signals, and in viewing democracies as less resolved than autocracies.","[{""name"": ""Joshua D Kertzer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Renshon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Keren Yarhi-Milo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/156853979X00449"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000046"", ""10.1080/0963-640291906735"", ""10.1073/pnas.0904312106"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00512.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12082"", ""10.1353/book.3419"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00280.x"", ""10.3998/mpub.13938"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2006.08.009"", ""10.2307/2111116"", ""10.1177/0022002797041001004"", ""10.1017/S1752971909990121"", ""10.1111/ajps.12335"", ""10.1177/0738894211430190"", ""10.1017/S0020818300028198"", ""10.1515/9781400824458"", ""10.1177/0002716207305268"", ""10.1017/S002081831400023X"", ""10.1111/ajps.12169"", ""10.1111/ajps.12329"", ""10.2307/2010184"", ""10.1515/9781400877164"", ""10.1007/s12110-015-9220-0"", ""10.1080/09636410701399465"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2012.12.002"", ""10.2307/1964013"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00056"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00715.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080028"", ""10.1086/685751"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2010.00111.x"", ""10.2307/2538549"", ""10.1177/0022002794038002005"", ""10.1515/9780691213095"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-071112-213421"", ""10.1177/0022002718785693"", ""10.1016/0022-5193(74)90111-8"", ""10.1162/016228801753212868"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1257/0002828042002561"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00275.x"", ""10.2307/2009527"", ""10.2307/3791448"", ""10.1016/0022-5193(74)90110-6"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051865"", ""10.1111/ajps.12201"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00058.x"", ""10.1177/0022002701045004005"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000161"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.25"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000488"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1016/j.yhbeh.2004.09.002"", ""10.1353/book.74118"", ""10.1177/0022002701045006005"", ""10.1016/0003-3472(78)90013-1"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000234"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000188"", ""10.1162/002081899550878"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000569"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000107"", ""10.2307/2944796"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000393"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070282"", ""10.1080/09636419708429333"", ""10.1017/S0020818311000026"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120709-145346""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This paper draws from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys to provide a sample of 18 developing and emerging economies to investigate whether global value chains (GVCs) are a vehicle for the transfer of technology. It focuses on one specific channel for technology transfer, namely, the licensing of foreign technology. To control for the possible endogeneity of technology licensing, propensity score matching is combined with a difference-in-differences approach. The results show a positive effect of being involved in two-way trading on the licensing of foreign technology. Firms that become two-way traders are significantly more likely to use foreign-licensed technology than firms starting to export or import. This evidence suggests that the complexity associated with the mode of internationalisation determines the licensing of foreign technology. GVC participation also appears to foster firms’ performance, reflecting my findings that the acquisition of foreign technology leads to significant productivity improvements.","[{""name"": ""Davide Rigo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/smj.2134"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3376129"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3295553"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00049-9"", ""10.1257/aer.97.5.1611"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691168272.001.0001"", ""10.1257/aer.102.7.3140"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2009.05.004"", ""10.1093/qje/qjx002"", ""10.2307/j.ctv24w655w"", ""10.1111/twec.12189"", ""10.1177/1536867X0200200403"", ""10.1007/s10290-019-00371-0"", ""10.1257/jel.20160792"", ""10.1007/s10290-016-0255-z"", ""10.1257/aer.101.1.304"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00527.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2011.04.028"", ""10.1111/twec.12801"", ""10.1007/s10290-012-0138-x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2436411"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2007.03.003"", ""10.1007/s10290-017-0292-2"", ""10.1016/S0022-1996(98)00075-0"", ""10.1080/09692290500049805"", ""10.1257/aer.20150443"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-397874-5.00043-9"", ""10.1257/aer.104.2.459"", ""10.1111/1467-937X.00246"", ""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.3.1051"", ""10.1257/aer.20140883"", ""10.7215/IP_IP_20040501A"", ""10.1111/sjpe.12077"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbn003"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2015.02.005"", ""10.1162/qjec.122.2.569"", ""10.1093/cje/ben016"", ""10.1093/biomet/70.1.41"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-0157-0"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00095"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2009.04.026"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2006.03.004""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Management of Technology and Innovation']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)]]"

While many warnings about political misinformation are valid and enable people to reject misleading information, the quality and validity of misinformation warnings can vary widely. Replicating and extending research from the fields of social cognition and forensic psychology, we find evidence that valid retrospective warnings of misleading news can help individuals discard erroneous information, although the corrections are weak. However, when informative news is wrongly labeled as inaccurate, these false warnings reduce the news’ credibility. Invalid misinformation warnings taint the truth, lead individuals to discard authentic information, and impede political memory. As only a few studies on the tainted truth effect exist, our research helps to illuminate the less explored dark side of misinformation warnings. Our findings suggest general warnings of misinformation should be avoided as indiscriminate use can reduce the credibility of valid news sources and lead individuals to discard useful information.","[{""name"": ""Melanie Freeze"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mary Baumgartner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Bruno"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jacob R.

However, most empirical evidence for this relationship is focused ongeneralized trust, rather than more theoretically appropriate measures ofgroup-based trust. This article evaluates the relationship between ethnic diversity – at the national, regional and local levels – and the degree to which coethnics are trusted more than non-coethnics, a value referred to here as the ‘coethnic trust premium’. Using public opinion data from sixteen African countries, this study finds that citizens of ethnically diverse states express, on average, more ethnocentric trust. However, within countries, regional ethnic diversity is associated with less ethnocentric trust. This same negative pattern between diversity and ethnocentric trust appears across districts and enumeration areas within Malawi. The article then shows, consistent with these patterns, that diversity is only detrimental to intergroup trust at the national level when ethnic groups are spatially segregated. These results highlight the importance of the spatial distribution of ethnic groups on intergroup relations, and question the utility of micro-level studies of interethnic interactions for understanding macro-level group dynamics.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Lea Robinson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1468-0297.00609"", ""10.2307/2086918"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510410"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00717.x"", ""10.1177/0010414016628269"", ""10.7910/DVN/XWTQYE"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00176.x"", ""10.1257/aer.101.7.3221"", ""10.1086/230998"", ""10.2307/1958361"", ""10.1162/003355300555475"", ""10.1017/S0022278X00021455"", ""10.1017/S0007123403000279"", ""10.5129/001041512X13815255434852"", ""10.1080/13510341003700394"", ""10.1023/A:1024419522867"", ""10.1177/0010414017730079"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00443.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.08.005"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190225216.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7287.2010.00215.x"", ""10.1162/003355397555361"", ""10.2307/1885893"", ""10.2307/2096302"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1nzfgvw"", ""10.2307/1388607"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00492.x"", ""10.1257/002205105774431243"", ""10.1257/aer.101.5.1872"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(01)00084-6"", ""10.1177/0010414016633487"", ""10.1007/s11113-007-9062-5"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.018"", ""10.1093/epirev/mxp001"", ""10.1163/156913311X566571"", ""10.1007/s11127-006-9069-1"", ""10.2307/2579183"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.07.019"", ""10.1017/S0022278X00015196"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051853"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.65"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135412"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.133.5.859"", ""10.1080/02589009808729629"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.07.006"", ""10.1017/S0003055404041334"", ""10.1016/S0033-3549(04)50068-7"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9220-x"", ""10.1093/esr/jci022"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000777"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.45.6.1196"", ""10.1177/1532673X03031004001"", ""10.1177/0010414008325286"", ""10.2307/3186119""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/pan.2022.15,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,"Creating and Comparing Dictionary, Word Embedding, and Transformer-Based Models to Measure Discrete Emotions in German Political Text","AbstractPrevious research on emotional language relied heavily on off-the-shelf sentiment dictionaries that focus on negative and positive tone. These dictionaries are often tailored to nonpolitical domains and use bag-of-words approaches which come with a series of disadvantages. This paper creates, validates, and compares the performance of (1) a novel emotional dictionary specifically for political text, (2) locally trained word embedding models combined with simple neural network classifiers, and (3) transformer-based models which overcome limitations of the dictionary approach. All tools can measure emotional appeals associated with eight discrete emotions. The different approaches are validated on different sets of crowd-coded sentences. Encouragingly, the results highlight the strengths of novel transformer-based models, which come with easily available pretrained language models. Furthermore, all customized approaches outperform widely used off-the-shelf dictionaries in measuring emotional language in German political discourse.","[{""name"": ""Tobias Widmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maximilian Wich"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/bs.3830070412"", ""10.1073/pnas.1007420107"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000352"", ""10.1080/026999396380079"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.04.004"", ""10.1086/715165"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00565.x"", ""10.7910/DVN/C9SAIX"", ""10.1177/0093650213514599"", ""10.3162/036298006X201904"", ""10.1177/0956797611409592"", ""10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.372"", ""10.1080/19312458.2018.1455817"", ""10.31234/osf.io/uq8zt"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.26"", ""10.1086/266397"", ""10.1162/tacl_a_00051"", ""10.1111/lsq.12218"", ""10.1007/s11135-016-0412-4"", ""10.1073/pnas.1811987116"", ""10.7910/DVN/L4OAKN"", ""10.1177/0093650202250881"", ""10.1177/0002716215569192"", ""10.1145/1014052.1014073"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9056-y"", ""10.5964/jspp.v7i1.964"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000939"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8640.2012.00460.x"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0168843"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7"", ""10.1080/19331681.2018.1485608"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.671234"", ""10.1080/026999300402763"", ""10.1609/icwsm.v4i1.14009"", ""10.1086/707613"", ""10.3115/v1/P15-2068"", ""10.1177/0010414018797942"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000058"", ""10.1177/0002716215569217"", ""10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.645"", ""10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.119"", ""10.1177/0003122419877135""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['General Social Sciences', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

So far, however, CNA has only been capable of processing dichotomous variables, which greatly limited its scope of applicability. This paper generalizes CNA for multi-value variables as well as continuous variables whose values are interpreted as membership scores in fuzzy sets. This generalization comes with a major adaptation of CNA’s algorithmic protocol, which, in an extended series of benchmark tests, is shown to give CNA an edge over QCA not only with respect to multi-outcome structures but also with respect to the analysis of non-ideal data stemming from single-outcome structures. The inferential power of multi-value and fuzzy-set CNA is made available to end users in the newest version of the R package cna.","[{""name"": ""Michael Baumgartner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathias Ambühl"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4135/9781452226569.n4"", ""10.1177/0049124117701487"", ""10.1007/s10670-013-9438-3"", ""10.1093/pan/mpj019"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.01.002"", ""10.1177/0081175014532763"", ""10.4135/9781452226569.n5"", ""10.1177/0049124109339369"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226702797.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400842995"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-5300-3"", ""10.1007/s11135-014-0026-7"", ""10.1177/0049124115589032""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistics and Probability', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Yet why has health‐care provision significantly expanded since the 2000s? This article argues that as central policies adjusted to incorporate health care as a priority, the cadre assessment system subsequently made it a “hard target,” and thus the competition for office has compelled local cadres to implement health‐care expansion. Apart from the importance of local leaders in policy change as the literature suggests, this article elaborates on the pivotal role of technical bureaucrats by innovatively introducing the “promotion tournament 2.0” model, which emphasizes the knowledge–power coalition between these political actors. By investigating the case of health‐care expansion, this article illustrates the local politics of policy change with various forms of data collected from semi‐structured interviews, newspaper archives, political documents, and official statistics.","[{""name"": ""Yuxi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford""]}]","[""10.1017/S0007123408000215"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2005.05.003"", ""10.1017/S030574101200118X"", ""10.1080/21699763.2017.1288158"", ""10.1353/chn.2018.0030"", ""10.1086/tcj.59.20066378"", ""10.1017/S0305741018001200"", ""10.1080/10670564.2014.882617"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2397.2009.00655.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510243"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1658"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000252"", ""10.1017/S0305741009990592"", ""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123126"", ""10.1017/S030574100005178X"", ""10.1257/jep.11.4.83"", ""10.1086/tcj.57.20066240"", ""10.1017/S0047279412000517"", ""10.1068/a3454"", ""10.1093/heapol/9.4.353"", ""10.1177/2057150X15622376"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.00211"", ""10.1017/S0305741015001289""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz248,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Where is the Anthropocene? IR in a new geological epoch,"Abstract Several disciplines outside the natural sciences, including International Relations (IR), have engaged with the Anthropocene discourse in order to theorize their relevance and translate their practical value in this new phase of the Earth's history. Some IR scholars have called for a post-humanist IR, planet politics, a cosmopolitan view, and ecological security, among other approaches, to recalibrate the theoretical foundations of the discipline, making it more attuned to the realities of the Anthropocene. Existing discussions, however, tend to universalize human experience and gravitate towards western ontologies and epistemologies of living in the Anthropocene. Within this burgeoning scholarship, how is the IR discipline engaging with the Anthropocene discourse? Although the Anthropocene has become a new theoretical landscape for the conceptual broadening of conventional IR subjects, this review reveals the need for sustained discussion that highlights the differentiated human experiences in the Anthropocene. The existing IR publications on the Anthropocene locates the non-spatial narratives of vulnerability and historical injustice, the non-modernist understanding of nature, the agency of the vulnerable, and the amplification of security issues in the Anthropocene. It is in amplifying these narratives that the IR discipline can broaden and diversify the discourse on the Anthropocene and, therefore, affirm its relevance in this new geological age.","[{""name"": ""Dahlia Simangan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Physics and Astronomy', 'Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Astronomy and Astrophysics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiad284,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,"Three Worlds: the West, East and South and the competition to shape global order","Abstract Among the many impacts of Russia's war on Ukraine, the most consequential may be in pushing the world in the direction of Three Worlds—the global West, the global East and the global South. One is led by the United States and Europe, the second by China and Russia, and the third by an amorphous grouping of non-western developing nations. These Three Worlds are not blocs or coherent negotiating groups, but loose, constructed and evolving global factions. This article makes four arguments. First, the Three Worlds system has the makings of a fairly durable pattern of global order, shaping struggles over rules and institutions. Second, the Three Worlds system will encourage a ‘creative’ politics of global order-building. The global West and global East will have incentives to compete for the support and cooperation of the global South. Third, there are deep principles of world order that provide a foundation for the Three Worlds competition. Finally, if the global West is to remain at the center of world order in the decades ahead, it will need to accommodate both the global East and the global South, and adapt itself to a more pluralistic world. But in the competition with the global East for the support of the global South, it has the advantage. The global South's critique of the global West is not that it offers the wrong pathway to modernity, but that it has not lived up to its principles or shared sufficiently the material fruits of liberal modernity.","[{""name"": ""G John Ikenberry"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Rule growth and policy impact from a macro perspective,"AbstractDo more rules improve overall policy performance? To answer this question, we look at rule growth in the area of environmental policy from an aggregate perspective. We argue that impactful growth in rules crucially depends on implementation capacities. If such capacities are limited, countries are at risk of ‘empty’ rule growth where they lack the ability to implement their ever‐growing stock of policies. Hence, rules are a necessary, yet not sufficient condition for achieving sectoral policy objectives. We underpin our argument with an analysis of the impact of a new, encompassing measure of environmental rule growth covering 13 countries from 1980 to 2010. These findings call for ‘sustainable statehood’ where the growth in rules should not outpace the expansion in administrative capacities.","[{""name"": ""JULIAN LIMBERG"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Economy King's College London UK""]}, {""name"": ""YVES STEINEBACH"", ""affiliation"": [""Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science LMU Munich Germany""]}, {""name"": ""LOUISA BAYERLEIN"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political and Social Sciences European University Institute Italy""]}, {""name"": ""CHRISTOPH KNILL"", ""affiliation"": [""Geschwister Scholl Institute of Political Science LMU Munich Germany""]}]","[""10.1017/9781108646888"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9265-x"", ""10.2307/2082979"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi014"", ""10.1177/0010414019843432"", ""10.1080/13501760500161514"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2010.05.055"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.02.016"", ""10.1142/S2010007810000169"", ""10.1007/s11077-011-9140-8"", ""10.1111/gove.12035"", ""10.1093/reep/ren005"", ""10.1257/000282803321947498"", ""10.1093/jel/eqr006"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198268574.001.0001"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.17"", ""10.1177/0263774X15610059"", ""10.1111/rego.12091"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx027"", ""10.1111/rego.12235"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00006061"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316339152"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu028"", ""10.1111/gove.12118"", ""10.1177/0170840605051496"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139795357"", ""10.1080/10967494.2012.725286"", ""10.1080/10967494.2016.1143420"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00228.x"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2005.02.011"", ""10.1111/puar.13274"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-00800-8"", ""10.1111/lapo.12138"", ""10.1111/padm.12063"", ""10.1515/9781503618411"", ""10.4135/9781446200506.n18"", ""10.2307/3088901"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.005"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00230.x"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2013.09.001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12286"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1996.tb00673.x"", ""10.1177/0958928706059833"", ""10.1080/09644016.2015.1081719"", ""10.1111/rego.12297"", ""10.1007/978-3-322-80813-4"", ""10.1111/gove.12297"", ""10.1017/S0143814X18000417"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.004"", ""10.1515/9781400831456"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu056"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup004"", ""10.3402/nstep.v1.28643"", ""10.4135/9781446200506.n17"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.001""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)]]"

It aims to explain and understand the introduction, implementation and effect of health policy instrument mixes. It argues that although ‘presidentialisation’ of executive, and ‘presidential bureaucracy’ under presidential system of government are critical to introduce policies and implement their instrument mixes without delay or being vetoed or watered down which would otherwise occur in the parliamentary system of government, these features of impositional and exclusive policy style pose risks of policy design and implementation failures when the policy problems are poorly diagnosed, their policy solutions are wrong and/or complementary policy instrument mixes implemented ineffectively. However, a temporal, albeit temporary divergence from a dominant administrative tradition and policy style is most likely when a policy issue is esoteric (i.e. technical, scientific and expert-led) and framed as an existential crisis under high uncertainty that require scientific, expert-led, inclusive, early, quick and decisive responses to pressing policy problems.","[{""name"": ""Caner Bakir"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of International Relations, Koç University, College of Administrative Sciences and Economics (CASE), Istanbul, Turkey""]}]","[""10.1017/npt.2018.23"", ""10.1017/S0007123400005317"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8497.2005.00372.x"", ""10.1057/9781137308160"", ""10.1080/13563467.2013.872610"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9261-1"", ""10.1017/npt.2019.16"", ""10.1332/policypress/9781447338956.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14494035.2017.1393589"", ""10.26686/pq.v1i4.4700"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9267-8"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-24714-1"", ""10.1073/pnas.2004911117"", ""10.1332/030557318X15230059735521"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00003287"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2003762"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1991.tb01878.x"", ""10.1016/S1449-4035(04)70030-2"", ""10.1177/0192512112453603"", ""10.1177/0952076715593139"", ""10.2307/1342513"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.2005.00213.x"", ""10.1017/S0144686X99007916"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018701"", ""10.1080/01436597.2014.970866"", ""10.1093/reseval/rvt029"", ""10.2307/976178"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00007960"", ""10.1177/0952076714565416"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-04512-9"", ""10.1108/09513550810855627"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90029-2"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135342"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199663989.001.0001"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-52548-2_7"", ""10.1177/2233865918761111"", ""10.1086/203345"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

10.1093/isr/viac013,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,The Concept of Anxiety in Ontological Security Studies,"Abstract The growing literature on ontological security theory (OST) in international relations, ontological security studies (OSS), is characterized by great internal diversity. This internal pluralism is one of its greatest strengths, but it is also potentially confusing, for example, when different works using an ontological security lens arrive at contradictory conclusions without it being obvious why. In order to make sense of this diversity, this article traces two interrelated conceptual divergences related to the notion of anxiety. The first one concerns the observation that anxiety is seemingly both debilitating and an impediment to action, as well as a call to action, inspiring adaptation and change. The second divergence centers on whether ontological security is at all attainable, which is largely a matter of whether anxiety is best understood as an extraordinary and temporally limited condition or as an ever-present and normal part of life. This article argues that the divergent answers to these questions, and the problems they give rise to, are primarily the result of ambiguity with regard to the key concept of anxiety. The malleable nature of the concept of anxiety engenders deviating interpretations and applications among scholars. While awareness of these issues already goes a long way toward making sense of some of the diversity within OSS, this article further suggests ways to increase the conceptual clarity of anxiety and to address the two issues of change and attainability. Doing so increases our conceptual understanding of OST.","[{""name"": ""Nina C Krickel-Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""Stockholm University, Sweden""]}]","[""10.1080/1369183X.2017.1409176"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.01530.x"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1378084"", ""10.1080/21567689.2020.1851871"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000123"", ""10.1177/00471178211045624"", ""10.1177/03058298070350031501"", ""10.1177/0305829816651934"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000111"", ""10.1080/09636412.2010.505128"", ""10.1017/S0260210520000376"", ""10.1111/pops.12691"", ""10.1080/13600826.2020.1828298"", ""10.4324/9781315692005-12"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.10.009"", ""10.1111/pops.12432"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1567461"", ""10.1177/0010836716653161"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1589419"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1391671"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000147"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1391670"", ""10.1111/insp.12029"", ""10.1111/pops.12334"", ""10.1177/0010836716653160"", ""10.1080/13523260.2012.693776"", ""10.1177/0010836716653159"", ""10.5937/jrs15-25359"", ""10.1080/09557570903104024"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1327528"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00508.x"", ""10.1080/09662839.2018.1497981"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0104-2"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102502"", ""10.1093/fpa/ory012"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1378086"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0083-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20667-3"", ""10.1177/1354066109350055"", ""10.1017/S026021051600019X"", ""10.1093/isr/viy049"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0108-y"", ""10.1177/00471178211045619"", ""10.1080/10357823.2013.852156"", ""10.1080/23340460.2015.1048625"", ""10.1057/s41268-021-00224-0"", ""10.1177/1354066120927073"", ""10.1177/03058298050330031301"", ""10.1093/isq/sqab011"", ""10.1080/13569775.2016.1201314"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000135"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1575796"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000232"", ""10.1177/1354066198004002004"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1378081"", ""10.3998/mpub.11719182"", ""10.1093/isr/viz057"", ""10.1093/isr/viy017"", ""10.1177/0010836717750197"", ""10.1080/09662839.2018.1428565"", ""10.1080/13523260.2012.693823"", ""10.1177/0010836716641137"", ""10.1177/0160597618802646"", ""10.1057/s41268-018-0161-1"", ""10.1017/S175297192000010X"", ""10.1080/09662831003758107"", ""10.1177/1354066119889401"", ""10.1057/s41268-021-00219-x"", ""10.1093/cjip/pon003"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316710982"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000222"", ""10.1177/0010836719832343"", ""10.1177/0967010614552549"", ""10.1093/isr/viy006"", ""10.1111/pops.12553"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.458"", ""10.1057/s41268-018-0164-y"", ""10.1080/13569775.2020.1795372"", ""10.1177/0047117819856397"", ""10.1093/isagsq/ksab037"", ""10.1177/1368431017736995"", ""10.1017/S0260210508008279"", ""10.1080/09662839.2021.1949297"", ""10.1111/ips.12103"", ""10.1057/jird.2013.22"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000093"", ""10.1057/s41268-021-00226-y"", ""10.1177/0967010617695715"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1378062"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0089-x"", ""10.1017/S0260210505006613"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.3366/jipt.2013.0053"", ""10.1080/09557571.2018.1564899"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1596612"", ""10.1177/1354066112437771"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy021"", ""10.1177/1462474509349084"", ""10.1093/isr/viw002"", ""10.1177/0305829817741255"", ""10.1080/09557571.2014.889084"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040"", ""10.1177/0010836716653158"", ""10.1057/s41268-021-00221-3""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12525,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Supply Chain Linkages and the Extended Carbon Coalition,"AbstractWhich firms oppose action to fight climate change? Networks of input sourcing and sales to downstream customers ought to propagate and reinforce opposition to decarbonization beyond direct emitters of CO2. To test this claim, we build the largest data set of public political activity for and against climate action in the United States, revealing that the majority of corporate opposition to climate action comes from outside the highest‐emitting industries. We construct new measures of the carbon intensity of firms and show that policy exposure via carbon‐intensive inputs and sales to downstream emitters explains this large volume of opposition from non‐emitting industries. Sixty‐six percent of U.S. lobbying on climate policy has been conducted by an extended coalition of firms, associations, and other groups that have publicly opposed reducing carbon emissions.

The framework for the formation of an institutional environment to ensure the space for the formation of potential, includes: legislative basis; institutional and legal support for regions to gain importance in the global market. In addition, the existing shortcomings of the State policy of transformation of the space that forms potentialities in the context of intensification of regional development are highlighted, which are characterized by: imperfection of the legislative basis of regional development; unstable relations between different levels of government; disregard for threats and risks in the formation of priority tasks and regional development goals; the practice of not having to implement strategic plans and regional development tasks, etc. It is concluded that the existing state policy on the subject that can influence regional development requires improvements, these improvements will further help to increase the efficiency of management decisions and bring to their full completion the reforms initiated in the direction of political and administrative decentralization in Ukraine.","[{""name"": ""Marta Derhaliuk"", ""affiliation"": [""National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”""]}, {""name"": ""Olha Popelo"", ""affiliation"": [""Chernihiv Polytechnic National University""]}, {""name"": ""Svitlana Tulchynska"", ""affiliation"": [""National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”""]}, {""name"": ""Kostyantyn Mashnenkov"", ""affiliation"": [""“Academician Yuriy Bugay International Scientific and Technical University”""]}, {""name"": ""Danylo Berezovskyi"", ""affiliation"": [""“Academician Yuriy Bugay International Scientific and Technical University”""]}]","[""10.3390/su12239809"", ""10.31297/hkju.19.1.1"", ""10.18371/fcaptp.v1i32.200528"", ""10.4324/9780429438776-8"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123516"", ""10.24115/s2446-62202021721118p.710-720"", ""10.35808/ijeba/331"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/202017510016"", ""10.22381/ghir92201710"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45913-0_32"", ""10.17059/ekon.reg.2020-4-19"", ""10.18778/1508-2008.23.10"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/678/1/012035"", ""10.1109/blackseacom.2018.8433637"", ""10.24115/s2446-622020217extra-c1106p.691-702"", ""10.18778/1231-1952.25.1.05"", ""10.1007/s00521-018-3953-8"", ""10.1109/icmtma.2018.00124"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201710608089""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Management of Technology and Innovation']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)]]"

This paper introduces new data and methods to move from empirical analyses of single policies to the analysis of comprehensive populations of policies and rigorously inferred diffusion networks. We have gathered policy adoption data appropriate for estimating policy innovativeness and tracing diffusion ties in a targeted manner (e.g., by policy domain, time period, or policy type) and extended the development of methods necessary to accurately and efficiently infer those ties. Our state policy innovation and diffusion (SPID) database includes 728 different policies coded by topic area. We provide an overview of this new dataset and illustrate two key uses: (i) static and dynamic innovativeness measures and (ii) latent diffusion networks that capture common pathways of diffusion between states across policies. The scope of the data allows us to compare patterns in both across policy topic areas. We conclude that these new resources will enable researchers to empirically investigate classes of questions that were difficult or impossible to study previously, but whose roots go back to the origins of the political science policy innovation and diffusion literature.","[{""name"": ""Frederick J.

10.1111/1475-6765.12430,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Regional inequality and institutional trust in Europe,"AbstractInequality is a central explanation of political distrust in democracies, but has so far rarely been considered a cause of (dis‐)trust towards supranational governance. Moreover, while political scientists have extensively engaged with income inequality, other salient forms of inequality, such as the regional wealth distribution, have been sidelined. These issues point to a more general shortcoming in the literature. Determinants of trust in national and European institutions are often theorized independently, even though empirical studies have demonstrated large interdependence in citizens’ evaluations of national and supranational governance levels. In this paper, we argue that inequality has two salient dimensions: (1) income inequality and (2) regional inequality. Both dimensions are important antecedent causes of European Union (EU) trust, the effects of which are mediated by evaluations of national institutions. On the micro‐level, we suggest that inequality decreases a person's trust in national institutions and thereby diminishes the positive effect of national trust on EU trust. On the macro‐level, inequality decreases country averages of trust in national institutions. This, however, informs an individual's trust in the EU positively, compensating for the seemingly untrustworthiness of national institutions. Finally, we propose that residing in an economically declining region can depress institutional trust. We find empirical support for our arguments by analysing regional temporal change over four waves of the European Social Survey 2010–2016 with a sample of 209 regions nested in 24 EU member states. We show that changes in a member state's regional inequality have similarly strong effects on trust as changes in the Gini coefficient of income inequality. Applying causal mediation techniques, we can show that the effects of inequality on EU trust are largely mediated through citizens’ evaluations of national institutions. In contrast, residing in an economically declining region directly depresses EU trust, with economically lagging areas turning their back on European governance and resorting to the national level instead. Our findings highlight the relevance of regional inequality for refining our understanding of citizens’ support for Europe's multi‐level governance system and the advantages of causal modelling for the analysis of political preferences in a multi‐level governance system.","[{""name"": ""Jana Lipps"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Comparative and International Studies Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Dominik Schraff"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Comparative and International Studies Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1111/jors.12366"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199687435.003.0009"", ""10.1177/0010414098031005002"", ""10.1177/1465116513495595"", ""10.1177/000312240607100605"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190494254.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070270"", ""10.1007/s10888-010-9129-0"", ""10.1080/09692290802408832"", ""10.1177/1465116515591832"", ""10.1093/erae/jbv024"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00438"", ""10.1177/1465116515581201"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1080/00343404.2012.678824"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793380.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.1017/psrm.2013.24"", ""10.1177/1465116517723499"", ""10.1023/A:1024801923824"", ""10.32614/RJ-2013-031"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.02.001"", ""10.1177/1465116513491018"", ""10.1093/esr/jcm031"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1225785"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.1177/1465116508089086"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1177/1465116503004002004"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199688913.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu034"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.38"", ""10.1017/S000305541000050X"", ""10.1080/00343404.2019.1619928"", ""10.1177/1465116511419250"", ""10.1111/jcms.12463"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199687428.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jcms.12646"", ""10.1093/ser/mww043"", ""10.1177/0022343307087169"", ""10.1108/01443330710722742"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsx024"", ""10.2139/ssrn.824506"", ""10.1177/1465116500001002001"", ""10.1007/s12286-010-0075-9"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1394901"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1170872"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00298.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12115"", ""10.1177/0038038514543294""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/padm.12686,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,"Public servant stereotypes: It is not (at) all about being lazy, greedy and corrupt","AbstractAs stereotypes strongly influence social interactions, this study explores the stereotypical associations regarding public servants, and about various professions in the public sector as well as the for‐profit and nonprofit sectors. This leads to a better understanding of the theoretical and practical challenges, such as citizen behaviour towards public servants, attractiveness of and political decisions about public service jobs. With a mixed‐method analysis of cognitive associations (7,470 associations by 415 respondents for 12 professions), the defining epithets of public servants are clarified, along with their positive or negative connotation. Despite the strongest associations for public servants being positive (caring, helpful and dedicated), as an overall category, it has a less positive connotation compared to some specific professions typical in the public sector (nurse, firefighter and police). However, cognitive associations are substantially more positive for public servants compared to politicians, lawyers and salesmen.","[{""name"": ""Jurgen Willems"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Public Management &amp; Governance Vienna University of Economics and Business  Vienna Austria""]}]","[""10.1080/09585190210158529"", ""10.1207/s15327965pli1504_01"", ""10.1177/0146167299025002008"", ""10.1016/S0148-2963(02)00481-2"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.04.009"", ""10.1177/0899764010365012"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2003.11.007"", ""10.1177/0049124107313901"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.1990.tb00226.x"", ""10.1177/0899764006287207"", ""10.1093/qje/qju023"", ""10.1177/0899764009342897"", ""10.1006/jesp.2001.1511"", ""10.5465/19416520.2015.1028810"", ""10.1111/padm.12613"", ""10.1023/A:1021020920715"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2004.02.005"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011719"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.66.2.127"", ""10.1080/01973533.2012.711691"", ""10.1080/14792779143000033"", ""10.1111/j.1756-8765.2008.01006.x"", ""10.1177/009102600203100206"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(199912)12:4<275::AID-BDM323>3.0.CO;2-M"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.47.1.237"", ""10.1111/puar.12423"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.44633700"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus027"", ""10.1108/09513550810904532"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.284"", ""10.2307/2572414"", ""10.1177/1368430215603462"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1428254"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1421"", ""10.1080/09540962.2018.1556004"", ""10.1177/0020852311407278"", ""10.2753/PMR1530-9576300305"", ""10.1002/nml.21304"", ""10.2307/976618"", ""10.5465/amr.2005.18378873"", ""10.1086/664970"", ""10.1080/01900692.2019.1588302"", ""10.1111/padm.12659"", ""10.1257/000282803322156954"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-073115-103235"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797"", ""10.1007/s11023-015-9371-0"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00688"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293"", ""10.1002/job.1874"", ""10.22140/pv.192"", ""10.1006/jvbe.1999.1742"", ""10.1093/jopart/muz044"", ""10.1002/nml.21119"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02496.x""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Populism and technocracy can combine to form ‘technocratic populism.’ The study assesses the extent to which democratic decay can be traced to the actions of technocratic populists as opposed to institutional factors, civil society, fragmentation and polarization. The main findings of this article are that technocratic populism has illiberal tendencies expressed best in its efforts at executive aggrandizement (cf. Bermeo, 2016). Without an effective bulwark against democratic erosion (cf. Bernhard, 2015), technocratic populism tends to undermine electoral competition (vertical accountability), judiciary independence, legislative oversight (horizontal accountability), and freedom of the press (diagonal accountability). The most effective checks on technocratic populist in power, this study finds, are the courts, free media, and civil society. This article highlights the mechanisms of democratic decay and democratic resilience beyond electoral politics. It indicates that a combination of institutional veto points and civil society agency is necessary to prevent democratic erosion (cf. Weyland, 2020). While active civil society can prevent democratic erosion, it cannot reverse it. Ultimately, the future of liberal democracy depends on the people’s willingness to defend it in the streets AND at the ballot box.","[{""name"": ""Petra Guasti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3370"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-40006-4_5"", ""10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398"", ""10.1017/S1537592715002261"", ""10.1080/21599165.2020.1787160"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2613824"", ""10.1007/s12116-019-09295-0"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0012"", ""10.1080/13698230.2014.995504"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3424"", ""10.1017/9781108697248"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.1156"", ""10.1177/0888325418791723"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1598062"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000538"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3348"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0047"", ""10.1016/j.postcomstud.2016.06.006"", ""10.3167/dt.2020.070207"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-40006-4_3"", ""10.1080/10758216.2019.1580590"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.919"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-40006-4_8"", ""10.1080/13510347.2011.572619"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12038"", ""10.1177/0020852313477761"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-40006-4"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2956464"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659935"", ""10.1007/s12116-018-9262-5"", ""10.1177/0010414018789490"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12217"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i4.3412"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-40006-4_7"", ""10.1515/9781400838745"", ""10.1177/0032321717723511"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3471132"", ""10.1057/9781403920072_4"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726383"", ""10.1086/705704"", ""10.1017/S1537592719003955"", ""10.1017/gov.2019.21""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Cooperation and Competition Among International Organizations,"AbstractInternational organizations (IOs) increasingly pool resources and expertise. Under what conditions do they pool rather than compete when their activities overlap? Drawing on elite interviews, I argue that even though many cooperation decisions are made by staff possessing high degrees of autonomy from member state principals, IOs are more likely to pool resources when their leading stakeholders are geopolitically aligned. Regardless of whether member states directly oversee the negotiation of these arrangements, staff design policies that are amenable to major stakeholders. I test this argument with regression analysis of an original data set that documents patterns of co-financing and information sharing among IOs in the development issue area. I further supplement these tests with an elite survey experiment deployed via LinkedIn to bureaucrats from various development IOs. Across the board, I find evidence consistent with my theory.","[{""name"": ""Richard Clark"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1257/jep.30.1.53"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2013.07.011"", ""10.1007/s11558-009-9070-9"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9321-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511793943"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00577.x"", ""10.1007/s11558-014-9194-4"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080211"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3051044"", ""10.1177/0022002798042001001"", ""10.1007/s11558-016-9252-1"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000264"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3657329"", ""10.2307/2539078"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511712029"", ""10.1007/s11558-014-9197-1"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139979696"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw037"", ""10.1177/0022002715595700"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717799.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592709090070"", ""10.1017/9781108348768.008"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000164"", ""10.7591/9781501733123"", ""10.1080/00220380600741946"", ""10.7591/cornell/9781501705120.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12426"", ""10.54648/EERR2011006"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2008.02.003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199301027.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592710004068"", ""10.1007/s10683-014-9421-0"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070257"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9361.2006.00314.x"", ""10.1086/668278"", ""10.1111/ajps.12531"", ""10.1080/03050620213653"", ""10.1162/002081899551048"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-8058"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139855990"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2008.06.014""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/isq/sqab015,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Military Alliances and Public Support for War,"AbstractHow do military alliances affect public support for war to defend victims of aggression? We offer the first experimental evidence on this fundamental question. Our experiments revealed that alliance commitments greatly increased the American public's willingness to intervene abroad. Alliances shaped public opinion by increasing public fears about the reputational costs of nonintervention and by heightening the perceived moral obligation to intervene out of concerns for fairness and loyalty. Finally, although alliances swayed public opinion across a wide range of circumstances, they made the biggest difference when the costs of intervention were high, the stakes of intervention were low, and the country needing aid was not a democracy. Thus, alliances can create pressure for war even when honoring the commitment would be extremely inconvenient, which could help explain why democratic allies tend to be so reliable. These findings shed new light on the consequences of alliances and other international legal commitments, the role of morality in foreign policy, and ongoing debates about domestic audience costs.","[{""name"": ""Michael Tomz"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jessica L P Weeks"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA""]}]","[""10.1017/pan.2018.19"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.111605.105008"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00197"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139225694"", ""10.1177/2053168018779697"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000188"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000386"", ""10.1086/682074"", ""10.1111/isqu.12012"", ""10.2307/2527230"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00711.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190609528.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0043887116000071"", ""10.1111/isqu.12045"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000247"", ""10.1086/340405"", ""10.1162/0162288054894616"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000137"", ""10.2307/2944796"", ""10.1177/0956797612449177"", ""10.1177/0022002715600762"", ""10.1177/0022002798042003004"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00101.x"", ""10.1515/9781400830091"", ""10.1177/0022002707310003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195168396.001.0001"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-407236-7.00002-4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195305562.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z"", ""10.1162/0011526042365555"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.2307/2585574"", ""10.1162/00208180152507579"", ""10.2307/1962580"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000643"", ""10.1177/0022343314565434"", ""10.1177/0738894215577557"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2010.00122.x"", ""10.1080/03050629.2015.982115"", ""10.1111/ajps.12201"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000073"", ""10.1080/09636412.2011.599201"", ""10.1177/0022002717704890"", ""10.1177/0022343316657405"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00031"", ""10.1017/S0020818303574057"", ""10.1177/0022002700044005006"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00612.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00381.x"", ""10.1017/S002238161100154X"", ""10.1177/002200278102500402"", ""10.1111/ajps.12197"", ""10.1017/S002081830606022X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139107310.029"", ""10.1017/S002081831200029X"", ""10.1017/S0020818311000336"", ""10.1080/09636410390443035"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00262.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.63"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226644592.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt2jbtsp"", ""10.1080/10584609.2010.516802"", ""10.1111/1467-856X.12009"", ""10.1515/9781400824458"", ""10.1111/ajps.12335"", ""10.2307/2586210"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1017/S000305541100027X"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.78.5.853"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070282"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000488"", ""10.1017/S0020818319000341"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00521.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583483"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000343"", ""10.2307/2538540"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316179154""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s11558-021-09431-3,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,0302 Political Science; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Hybrid institutional complexes in global governance,"AbstractMost issue areas in world politics today are governed neither by individual institutions nor by regime complexes composed of formal interstate institutions. Rather, they are governed by “hybrid institutional complexes” (HICs) comprising heterogeneous interstate, infra-state, public–private and private transnational institutions, formal and informal. We develop the concept of the HIC as a novel descriptive and analytical lens for the study of contemporary global governance. The core structural difference between HICs and regime complexes is the greater diversity of institutional forms within HICs. Because of that diversity, HICs operate differently than regime complexes in two significant ways: (1) HICs exhibit relatively greater functional differentiation among their component institutions, and hence suffer from relatively fewer overlapping claims to authority; and (2) HICs exhibit greater informal hierarchy among their component institutions, and hence benefit from greater ordering. Both are systemic features. HICs have characteristic governance benefits: they offer good “substantive fit” for multi-faceted governance problems and good “political fit” for the preferences of diverse constituents; constrain conflictive cross-institutional strategies; and are conducive to mechanisms of coordination, which enhance substantive coherence. Yet HICs also pose characteristic governance risks: individual institutions may take on aspects of problems for which they are ill-suited; multiple institutions may create confusion; HICs can amplify conflict and contestation rather than constraining them; and the “soft” institutions within HICs can reduce the focality of incumbent treaties and intergovernmental organizations and forestall the establishment of new ones. We outline a continuing research agenda for exploring the structures, operations and governance implications of HICs.","[{""name"": ""Kenneth W.

10.1017/S1752971919000095,INTERNATIONAL THEORY,0302 Political Science,From norms to normative configurations: a pragmatist and relational approach to theorizing normativity in IR,"AbstractNormativity matters in international politics, but IR scholarship will benefit from de-reifying ‘norms’ as units into a relational, configurational alternative. The alternative I propose here is the ‘normative configuration’: an arrangement of ongoing, interacting practices establishing action-specific regulation, value-orientation, and avenues of contestation. This responds to recent constructivist scholarship, particularly from relational sociology and practice theory, that implies the need for ontological and analytical alternatives to ‘norms’ as central concepts responsible for establishing rules, institutions, and values in social life. I offer a way of conceptualizing and analyzing normativity consistent with these alternative approaches. Namely, I have brought together a pragmatist theory of action with the social theories of a number of key relational social theorists and philosophers, oriented around a reading of what norms-talk actually does for social enquiry. I then outline a three stage process – de-reification, attributing agency, and tracing transactions – that allows scholars to study transformations in normative configurations. Finally, I discuss what this contributes to the recent turns toward practices and relations, as the latest direction in constructivist scholarship within the discipline.","[{""name"": ""Simon Frankel Pratt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1354066107087766"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107273627"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316534564"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511676185"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527470"", ""10.1017/S002081830002751X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491764"", ""10.1017/S0260210509008377"", ""10.1177/03058298020310010501"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2011.00132.x"", ""10.1162/002081899550959"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000434"", ""10.1177/0020702014544915"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262050920.001.0001"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw036"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812255"", ""10.4135/9781848608290.n3"", ""10.1086/231294"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090195"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027363"", ""10.1515/9781400833177"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805431"", ""10.1017/S0020818300035384"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000045"", ""10.1017/S0260210505006273"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195124415.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0047117808100607"", ""10.1515/9781400830800"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-55235-9"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000337"", ""10.1017/S0003055400185016"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001582"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790348"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16161-4"", ""10.1257/jep.3.4.99"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107415324.004"", ""10.2307/2095141"", ""10.1017/S0020818300033348"", ""10.1177/1354066100006004002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559044"", ""10.1017/S0020818300028587"", ""10.1086/231209"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040"", ""10.1177/1354066199005003002"", ""10.1177/1354066104042934"", ""10.4324/9780203071748"", ""10.1057/jird.2014.1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812507"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1168cx9"", ""10.1017/S175297191000031X"", ""10.1177/1354066113512702"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612183"", ""10.1162/002081898550699"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.136"", ""10.1177/1354066107074284"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00455.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199256044.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000327"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511616037"", ""10.1111/ips.12026_4"", ""10.4159/9780674041660"", ""10.1007/BF02512077"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511557675"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199859948.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818304582024"", ""10.1177/1354066111407690"", ""10.1111/isqu.12202"", ""10.1177/1354066110380963"", ""10.1177/1354066113503481"", ""10.1086/227128"", ""10.1057/9781137342652_10"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00746.x"", ""10.7312/bern12036"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195390087.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Different donors adhere to different rules, principles, and operating procedures. The authors theorize that variation in these aid regimes may generate variation in the effects of aid on state legitimacy. To test their theory, they compare aid from the United States to aid from China, its most prominent geopolitical rival. Their research design combines within-country analysis of original surveys, survey experiments, and behavioral games in Liberia with cross-country analysis of existing administrative and Afrobarometer data from six African countries. They exploit multiple proxies for state legitimacy, but focus in particular on tax compliance and morale. Contrary to expectations, the authors find little evidence to suggest that exposure to aid diminishes the legitimacy of African states. If anything, the opposite appears to be true. Their results are consistent across multiple settings, multiple levels of analysis, and multiple measurement and identification strategies, and are unlikely to be artifacts of sample selection, statistical power, or the strength or weakness of particular experimental treatments. The authors conclude that the effects of aid on state legitimacy at the microlevel are largely benign.","[{""name"": ""Robert A.

During such crises, the ordinary and unnoticed routines that structure everyday life are thrust into the spotlight as people struggle to maintain or recreate a sense of normalcy. Drawing on a range of cases including China, Russia, the UK, and USA, we examine three categories of everyday practice during the COVID-19 pandemic that respond to disruptions in daily routines and seek a return to national normality: performing national solidarities and exclusions by wearing face masks; consuming the nation in the form of panic buying and conspiracy theories; and enforcing foreign policies through social media and embodiment. This analysis thus breaks with existing works on everyday nationalism and banal nationalism that typically focus on pervasively unnoticed forms of nationalism during settled times, and it challenges approaches to contentious politics that predict protest mobilization for change rather than restoration of the status quo ante.

This article conducts a random‐effects meta‐analysis including 545 correlations across 175 primary studies to explore the relationship between emotional labor, burnout, and job satisfaction. The meta‐analysis suggests that emotional labor can be both harmful and beneficial to employees, depending on the emotional labor strategy used, that is, surface acting or deep acting. In addition, the meta‐regression shows that effect sizes between emotional labor and employee outcomes (i.e., burnout and job satisfaction) differ in collectivist and individualist cultures. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for research and practice.","[{""name"": ""Nicole M.

10.1111/ajps.12516,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Does Public Opinion Affect Political Speech?,"AbstractDoes public opinion affect political speech? Of particular interest is whether public opinion affects (i) what topics politicians address and (ii) what positions they endorse. We present evidence from Germany where the government was recently forced to declassify its public opinion research, allowing us to link the content of the research to subsequent speeches. Our causal identification strategy exploits the exogenous timing of the research's dissemination to cabinet members within a window of a few days. We find that exposure to public opinion research leads politicians to markedly change their speech. First, we show that linguistic similarity between political speech and public opinion research increases significantly after reports are passed on to the cabinet, suggesting that politicians change the topics they address. Second, we demonstrate that exposure to public opinion research alters politicians' substantive positions in the direction of majority opinion.","[{""name"": ""Anselm Hager"", ""affiliation"": [""Humboldt‐Universität zu Berlin""]}, {""name"": ""Hanno Hilbig"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard University""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414006297169"", ""10.3982/ECTA11757"", ""10.1080/01621459.2019.1635480"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00331_4.x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2676429"", ""10.1111/ajps.12090"", ""10.1093/pan/mpv005"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1111/j.1741-5705.2002.tb00005.x"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.001"", ""10.1017/S0007123409990068"", ""10.1086/297841"", ""10.1111/j.1939-9162.2010.00006.x"", ""10.1093/pan/mpu019"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.005"", ""10.1177/0010414011405162"", ""10.1177/1465116514551806"", ""10.1111/ajps.12103"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00457.x"", ""10.1080/10584600801985334"", ""10.1111/j.0360-4918.2001.00162.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00338.x"", ""10.1111/j.1741-5705.2006.02574.x"", ""10.1093/ijpor/3.1.53"", ""10.1046/j.1468-2508.2004.00139.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818660"", ""10.1017/S002238160999020X""]",['Social Sciences'],"['General Social Sciences', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0143814X19000047,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Do policy instruments matter? Governments' choice of policy mix and higher education performance in Western Europe,"AbstractGovernments pursue their goals by adopting various mixes of policy instruments. This article proposes a specific operationalisation of these mixes and applies it to the analysis of reforms that many Western European governments have pursued, as they have adopted a similar policy design in their higher education systems (HESs) over the last 20 years. In fact, although these policies have similar templates, performance indicators exhibit remarkable variation between countries. Thus, by applying Qualitative Comparative Analysis to a large data set containing all changes in policy instruments undertaken in the last 20 years in 12 HESs in Western Europe, this article explores the possibility that differences in performance across national HESs could be associated –ceteris paribus– with different policy mixes. This article finds not only that the common template has been applied through very different national policy mixes but also that only a few instruments are regularly linked to good teaching performance, regardless of the other components of the actual policy mix.","[{""name"": ""Giliberto Capano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Pritoni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Giulia Vicentini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9780773581708-008"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-54817-7"", ""10.1111/1468-0327.12002"", ""10.1111/j.1754-7121.2000.tb01152.x"", ""10.4135/9781452226569"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2013.854288"", ""10.2753/PMR1530-9576350410"", ""10.1017/pan.2017.30"", ""10.1080/135017606061071406"", ""10.2304/eerj.2006.5.1.18"", ""10.4337/9781849803366"", ""10.1007/s11162-007-9066-3"", ""10.1177/0002716214541048"", ""10.1057/9781137399854"", ""10.1007/1-4020-3411-3"", ""10.1177/0951692890002001003"", ""10.1007/s11077-009-9079-1"", ""10.4324/9781315769028"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.02003.x"", ""10.1057/9781137477972"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01445.x"", ""10.1093/pan/mpv017"", ""10.1007/s10734-012-9578-4"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur069"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-5971-1"", ""10.1177/0049124113481341"", ""10.1177/0049124112442142"", ""10.1177/0263774X15610059"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0327.2009.00238.x"", ""10.1353/book.3407"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.924206"", ""10.1057/9781137374639"", ""10.1057/9780230370227"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2015.1070334"", ""10.4324/9780203883358"", ""10.1023/A:1027381906977"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226702797.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.02001.x"", ""10.1353/wp.0.0009"", ""10.1163/156913210X12493538729793"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139004244"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01936.x"", ""10.4324/9780203391372"", ""10.1057/s41307-016-0018-4"", ""10.1093/pan/mpj019"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2273.2008.00384.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-17169-9"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-1984-6"", ""10.1111/hequ.12180"", ""10.2307/3110295"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199604104.003.0006"", ""10.1002/pam.10176"", ""10.1086/672949"", ""10.1177/0958928711433656"", ""10.2307/2131904"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9515-3""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055420000957,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Do Commodity Price Shocks Cause Armed Conflict? A Meta-Analysis of Natural Experiments,"Scholars of the resource curse argue that reliance on primary commodities destabilizes governments: price fluctuations generate windfalls or periods of austerity that provoke or intensify civil conflict. Over 350 quantitative studies test this claim, but prominent results point in different directions, making it difficult to discern which results reliably hold across contexts. We conduct a meta-analysis of 46 natural experiments that use difference-in-difference designs to estimate the causal effect of commodity price changes on armed civil conflict. We show that commodity price changes, on average, do not change the likelihood of conflict. However, there are cross-cutting effects by commodity type. In line with theory, we find price increases for labor-intensive agricultural commodities reduce conflict, while increases in the price of oil, a capital-intensive commodity, provoke conflict. We also find that price increases for lootable artisanal minerals provoke conflict. Our meta-analysis consolidates existing evidence, but also highlights opportunities for future research.","[{""name"": ""GRAEME BLAIR"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""DARIN CHRISTENSEN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""AARON RUDKIN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.3474193"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.92.2.500"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvz025"", ""10.1016/0197-2456(86)90046-2"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00463.x"", ""10.1177/0022002705277796"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.33"", ""10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01025.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818300033324"", ""10.1177/0022343304043773"", ""10.7910/DVN/BGCVOW"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000413"", ""10.1093/qje/qjr025"", ""10.1111/rssa.12275"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.07.006"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199228232.001.0001"", ""10.1093/restud/rdt009"", ""10.1086/709993"", ""10.1177/0010414013495358"", ""10.1177/0022002705277545"", ""10.1177/0022002719849623"", ""10.1017/S1537592703000355"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000534"", ""10.1093/oep/gpf064"", ""10.1177/2053168018818232"", ""10.1017/psrm.2017.44"", ""10.1086/688443""]","['Engineering', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Building and Construction', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It has consequences not only on individuals but also on social and political levels. We argue that depressive symptoms impair political participation by reducing the motivation and physical energy of sufferers. We test our hypotheses by conducting regression analyses of four nationally representative cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys that collectively span many democracies. Our results are threefold. First, we find that the severest depressive symptoms lower the probability of voting by 0.05–0.25 points, an effect that is exceeded only by education and age. Second, we show that depressive symptoms negatively affect political interest and internal efficacy, thereby confirming that they diminish political motivation. Third, we find that depressive symptoms most strongly affect physically demanding acts, thereby confirming that they reduce the physical energy required for participation. We conclude by urging scholars to take depressive symptoms seriously in the study of political behavior.","[{""name"": ""CLAUDIA LANDWEHR"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""CHRISTOPHER OJEDA"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/03616878-7367036"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12173"", ""10.1086/687536"", ""10.4324/9781315561691"", ""10.1177/014662167700100306"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2011.12.036"", ""10.1215/03616878-3424450"", ""10.4135/9781849209458"", ""10.1177/0894439317697949"", ""10.2307/2111186"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2008.11.021"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000149"", ""10.1007/BF00992551"", ""10.59962/9780774862691"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000151""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Whether this is achieved, however, largely depends on the degree to which actors with different beliefs coordinate their actions to achieve common policy goals—a behavior known as cross‐coalition coordination. Drawing on the Advocacy Coalition Framework and collaborative governance literatures, this study analyzes cross‐coalition coordination in three collaborative environmental governance processes that seek to manage water in the Colorado River Basin. Through comparative analysis, it highlights the complex relationship among the institutional design of a collaborative governance process, how and why actors choose to engage in cross‐coalition coordination, and the consequent policy outputs they produce. The findings advance policy scholars’ nascent understanding of cross‐coalition coordination and its potential to affect policymaking dynamics.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth A.

We demonstrate the validity of “minimally-supervised” approaches for the creation of a sentiment dictionary from a corpus of text drawn from a specialized vocabulary. We demonstrate the validity of this approach in estimating sentiment from texts in a large-scale benchmarking dataset recently introduced in computational linguistics, and demonstrate the improvements in accuracy of our approach over well-known standard (nonspecialized) sentiment dictionaries. Finally, we show the usefulness of our approach in an application to the specialized language used in US federal appellate court decisions.","[{""name"": ""Douglas R.

Competition among contractors is theorized to drive down costs, encourage innovation, and boost accountability. However, there have been few studies on whether competition actually leads to improved performance among contractors. This analysis examines nearly 25,000 federal contracts to determine how competition is related to performance. Findings indicate that competitively sourced contracts are more likely to suffer from performance problems. However, relationships between contractor and agency correlate with fewer performance problems. This suggests that competition may not be leading to the benefits that many might expect. Instead, relationships and shared experiences, along with other factors, may matter more when seeking to improve contractor performance.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin M Brunjes"", ""affiliation"": [""Daniel J.

By selecting a subset of cases involving episodes or situations characterized by the combination of urgency, threat, and uncertainty, we conduct a plausibility probe to garner insights into a number of central assumptions and dynamics fundamental to understanding collaborative crisis management. Although there is broad agreement among academics and practitioners that collaboration is essential for managing complex risks and events that no single actor can handle alone, in the literature, there are several unresolved claims and uncertainties regarding many critical aspects of collaborative crisis management. Assumptions investigated in the article relate to starting-points and triggers for collaboration, level of collaboration, goal-formulation, adaptation, involvement and role of non-state actors, and the prevalence and impact of political infighting. The results confirm that crises represent rapidly moving and dynamic events that raise the need for adaptation, adjustment, and innovation by diverse sets of participants. We also find examples of successful behaviours where actors managed, despite challenging conditions, to effectively contain conflict, formulate and achieve shared goals, adapt to rapidly changing situations and emergent structures, and innovate in response to unforeseen problems.","[{""name"": ""Charles F Parker"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government & Centre of Natural Hazards and Disaster Science, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Nohrstedt"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government & Centre of Natural Hazards and Disaster Science, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Julia Baird"", ""affiliation"": [""Environmental Sustainability Research Centre, Brock University, St. Catharines, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Helena Hermansson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Security, Strategy and Leadership, Swedish Defense University, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Olivier Rubin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social Sciences and Business, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Erik Baekkeskov"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia""]}]","[""10.1017/9781108667081"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5973.2010.00620.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1007/s11069-006-9036-7"", ""10.1007/BF03396912"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.10.004"", ""10.1007/s10113-019-01546-z"", ""10.1017/9781316339756"", ""10.1111/geoa.12072"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8500.2010.00694.x"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.12021"", ""10.1177/0095399705282879"", ""10.1111/1540-6210.62.s1.18"", ""10.1002/2017EF000764"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1794425"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-32353-4_13"", ""10.1007/s00267-014-0334-7"", ""10.1146/annurev.energy.30.050504.144511"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2010.01883.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq089"", ""10.1177/0002716205285404"", ""10.1111/padm.12203"", ""10.1177/0095399716680058"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00149"", ""10.1177/0275074005280605"", ""10.1177/0095399710362517"", ""10.1108/09653561011070376"", ""10.1080/12294659.2013.10805251"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511509735.012"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2011.03.002"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02134.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00867.x"", ""10.1111/padm.12003"", ""10.1177/0095399712473983"", ""10.1002/rhc3.12055"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvx018"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-04468-2_14"", ""10.1111/geoa.12078"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1523219"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5973.2009.00588.x"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00300"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7660.2004.00360.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00791.x"", ""10.1111/apv.12037"", ""10.1177/0095399711418768"", ""10.1080/14719037.2011.589617"", ""10.1177/0010836713485711"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02858-9"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00587.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article uses quantitative text analysis to investigate how voters describe their ingroups and outgroups in open‐ended survey responses. I look at Switzerland, a paradigmatic case of electoral realignment along a “second,” universalism–particularism dimension of politics opposing the far right and the new left. Keyness statistics and a semi‐supervised document scaling method (latent semantic scaling) serve to identify terms associated with the poles of this divide in voters’ responses, and hence to measure universalist/particularist identities. Based on voters’ own words, the results support the idea of collective identities consolidating an emerging cleavage: Voters’ identity descriptions relate to far right versus new left support, along with known sociostructural and attitudinal correlates of the universalism–particularism divide, and they reveal how groups opposed on this dimension antagonistically demarcate themselves from each other.","[{""name"": ""Delia Zollinger"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zurich""]}]","[""10.1111/1468-4446.12834"", ""10.3917/ripc.121.0009"", ""10.21105/joss.00774"", ""10.1177/0010414021997504"", ""10.1111/0022-4537.00126"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108652698"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-090717-092750"", ""10.1017/9781108914123"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245.009"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1225785"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000125"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00230"", ""10.1515/9780691186740"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511622014"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790720"", ""10.1177/0010414020912283"", ""10.4159/9780674039889"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141107"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12259"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.1111/ajps.12103"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9457-5"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1017/9781108562485"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102199"", ""10.1177/0267323117695735""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Far from being just one more hiccup in the troubled relations between France and its former colonies, the article interprets this sequence as a constitutive effect of French protracted military presence in the Sahel. Specifically, it argues that although France has a rather clear security-driven agenda, its operational moves produced by bureaucratic thinking are questioned by influential sections of Sahelian public opinions who frame the French military presence as a deeply political issue over their country's sovereignty. In addition, being the de facto military guarantor of the security of Sahelian regimes, France constrains the domestic political conversation through the ‘red lines’ it imposes on actors. This externally-induced distortion of the domestic political landscape eventually places Sahelian authorities in front of a dilemma. Pleasing their foreign patrons might cost them the support of the section of public opinion most attached to national sovereignty, and expose them to nationalist entrepreneurs.","[{""name"": ""Yvan Guichaoua"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Individual endorsement of such a worldview (“science-related populist attitudes”) has been conceptualized but not yet measured. Hence, we developed the SciPop Scale, a survey instrument to measure science-related populist attitudes. We tested 17 survey items in a first representative survey and developed an 8-item scale. We then tested German, French, and Italian versions of this scale in a second representative survey, employing confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, and external validity tests. Findings show that the SciPop Scale is a robust and reliable measure of populist demands toward science.","[{""name"": ""Niels G.

10.1017/S0020818320000466,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,The Co-Constitution of Order,"AbstractThe idea of liberal international order as a world order is understood to be constituted as a result of disproportionate Anglo-American influences. This is in line with much of international relations (IR) theory, which typically characterizes the emergence of order as resulting from the diffusion or imposition of norms and institutions from the world's centers of power. This article argues otherwise, its premise being that the international order founded on sovereign equal nation-states was co-constituted as well by the influence of relatively weak actors through decentralized processes of contestation over core international norms. Drawing on international relations, history, and law, this article outlines a framework to interpret the actions and mechanisms by which supposedly weak actors shaped international order. It concisely traces the constitution of order as based on its fundamental norms and assesses the implications of the argument for the current crisis of liberal order, as well as IR theory more broadly, laying out a research agenda for the future.","[{""name"": ""Marcos Tourinho"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781400823963"", ""10.1093/ejil/14.3.437"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491207.012"", ""10.1111/nana.12122"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511862373.015"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801449031.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1354066111425263"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-55235-9"", ""10.1093/jicj/mqr059"", ""10.1162/isec.23.2.40"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316343890"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491306"", ""10.1017/S002081830002703X"", ""10.1093/ejil/12.3.537"", ""10.2307/2539078"", ""10.1017/S002081830003160X"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000570"", ""10.56021/9780801806902"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1177/1354066105050139"", ""10.1515/9781400831661"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139805698"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777"", ""10.1177/0305829814541319"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000521"", ""10.1080/14747731.2014.972063"", ""10.1093/0199251207.003.0003"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812675"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.3138/9781487589349"", ""10.7312/aydi13778"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614262"", ""10.1080/07075332.2015.1064465"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000636"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139015424"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511494222"", ""10.1057/9781137349835"", ""10.1163/19426720-02003003"", ""10.1162/002081800551109"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511494185"", ""10.1093/ejil/chi123""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article argues that SSM can be enhanced by the use of Facebook in at least three ways. This social-networking site helps to address some of the inherent limitations of SSM by learning about local contexts and identifying principal political actors, by gathering background information about and establishing contact with them, and by triangulating information they provide and reaching out to additional key informants. Thus, this article shows how Facebook can provide leverage in overcoming the problem of biased samples and offers concrete empirical illustrations from research on local politics in Latin American countries.","[{""name"": ""Tomas Dosek"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0022343311405698"", ""10.1017/9781108678384"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0201710"", ""10.1108/10662241211199960""]","['Medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Health Professions']","['Epidemiology', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Using panel data from Spain, we show that modern sexism is indeed among the most important attitudinal predictors of voting for the far‐right party Vox. The results also show that internal individual changes in levels of modern sexism impact far‐right voting. Backlash attitudinal change, defined as increases in sexism occurring in a context of feminist momentum, contributed significantly to the recent emergence of the radical right. Our findings indicate that sexism is not a crystalized attitude but rather susceptible to showing short‐term changes with important political consequences. This highlights the importance of understudied context‐dependent individual dynamics of gender backlash in far‐right voting.","[{""name"": ""Eva Anduiza"", ""affiliation"": [""Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona""]}, {""name"": ""Guillem Rico"", ""affiliation"": [""Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1080/13569310500244354"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2015.1023655"", ""10.1080/00313220701265569"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011911"", ""10.1093/poq/nfaa058"", ""10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss023"", ""10.1177/1354068820968839"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2017.07.026"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040507.142213"", ""10.1086/716858"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9468-2"", ""10.1017/S1743923X14000567"", ""10.1111/pops.12492"", ""10.1017/S1743923X19000485"", ""10.1080/21565503.2019.1632065"", ""10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01187.x"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2019.03.001"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00077"", ""10.21308/recp.51.03"", ""10.1093/biomet/80.1.27"", ""10.1017/rep.2017.35"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2018.05.004"", ""10.1017/S0007123421000612"", ""10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00104.x"", ""10.1080/21565503.2019.1633934"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042814-012441"", ""10.1007/s11109‐021‐09704‐y"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2017.12.001"", ""10.1111/ssqu.13049"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2015.1024399"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(97)00012-7"", ""10.1177/0192512100214006"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09567-4"", ""10.1093/0198293259.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12547"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43533-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43533-6_12"", ""10.1177/1360780418764735"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226472157.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190077150.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00344893.2019.1652202"", ""10.1017/S1743923X08000500"", ""10.1017/S1743923X15000562"", ""10.1080/01402382.2020.1777504"", ""10.1007/s11109-014-9274-4"", ""10.1515/9783839449806-007"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.4324/9781003049227"", ""10.1177/1368430217741203"", ""10.1080/10584609.2020.1753867"", ""10.1017/S1743923X08000512"", ""10.1177/0891243218809604"", ""10.1002/polq.12737"", ""10.1177/13684302211017633"", ""10.1017/S1743923X17000083"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2015.1024404"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.2"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.68.2.199"", ""10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00103.x"", ""10.1177/2053168019851680"", ""10.1177/0010414021997159"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy003"", ""10.1177/0957926520977217"", ""10.1177/1354068813511379""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1093/isq/sqaa071,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Promises under Pressure: Statements of Reassurance in US Alliances,"AbstractThe United States frequently reassures allies of its protection by stationing troops abroad, visiting allied countries, and making public statements. Yet the causes of reassurance in asymmetric alliances—those between a great power patron and its weaker allies—are understudied in the academic literature. Indeed, many scholars argue that reassurance can be counterproductive as it invites allies to free ride or provoke their adversaries, knowing that they have their patron's support. Despite the drawbacks, I argue that the United States use reassurance to discourage their allies from seeking outside options and reducing their dependence on the alliance. Patrons such as the United States thus face a dilemma wherein they trade-off between withholding reassurance for short-term leverage and using reassurance to preserve their long-term influence. I test the theory using a new cross-national dataset of US. statements of reassurance from 1950 to 2010, and the results provide stronger support for my hypotheses than for the competing explanations of deterrence, strength from desperation, and shared preferences. The findings have implications for understanding how great powers manage their alliances, and suggest a pathway through which weaker states can shape great powers’ foreign commitments.","[{""name"": ""Brian Blankenship"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Miami""]}]","[""10.1177/0022002715595700"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00197"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139225694"", ""10.1177/0022002712467936"", ""10.1515/9781503627437-009"", ""10.1093/pan/mpq013"", ""10.1111/isqu.12154"", ""10.1007/s11127-009-9491-2"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00036"", ""10.1177/0022002797041001004"", ""10.1177/0738894214559672"", ""10.1515/9781400830091"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00198"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469655697.003.0007"", ""10.4135/9781604265781"", ""10.1177/0022002702046005006"", ""10.1177/0022343301038006006"", ""10.1177/0022002792036002007"", ""10.1177/0022002702046002001"", ""10.1111/isqu.12146"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx070"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw054"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1146649"", ""10.1080/09636412.2011.599201"", ""10.1080/09636412.2018.1483609"", ""10.1515/9780691216119"", ""10.7591/cornell/9781501729188.001.0001"", ""10.1093/isq/sqv008"", ""10.1017/S0020818303574057"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00031"", ""10.1080/03050620500294135"", ""10.1080/03050620213653"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00612.x"", ""10.1177/0095327X12442306"", ""10.1017/S002081831200029X"", ""10.1177/0022343314539826"", ""10.1017/9781316756263"", ""10.1086/697462"", ""10.1177/0022343318808842"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000297"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx028"", ""10.2307/2111499"", ""10.1177/0022002794038002005"", ""10.7591/9781501730689"", ""10.1177/0738894214559680"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00311"", ""10.1111/fpa.12004"", ""10.1080/09636410008429406"", ""10.1080/03050628808434695"", ""10.1017/S0043887109000045"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-06430-4"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00250""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1162/isec_a_00425,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,Prediction and Judgment: Why Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Humans in War,"Abstract Recent scholarship on artificial intelligence (AI) and international security focuses on the political and ethical consequences of replacing human warriors with machines. Yet AI is not a simple substitute for human decision-making. The advances in commercial machine learning that are reducing the costs of statistical prediction are simultaneously increasing the value of data (which enable prediction) and judgment (which determines why prediction matters). But these key complements—quality data and clear judgment—may not be present, or present to the same degree, in the uncertain and conflictual business of war. This has two important strategic implications. First, military organizations that adopt AI will tend to become more complex to accommodate the challenges of data and judgment across a variety of decision-making tasks. Second, data and judgment will tend to become attractive targets in strategic competition. As a result, conflicts involving AI complements are likely to unfold very differently than visions of AI substitution would suggest. Rather than rapid robotic wars and decisive shifts in military power, AI-enabled conflict will likely involve significant uncertainty, organizational friction, and chronic controversy. Greater military reliance on AI will therefore make the human element in war even more important, not less.","[{""name"": ""Avi Goldfarb"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jon R.

Answering this question depends on recognizing long-term patterns of continuity and change in the PRC's policy. A new typology of “assertive” state behaviors in maritime and territorial disputes, and original time-series events data covering the period from 1970 to 2015, shows that the key policy change—China's rapid administrative buildup and introduction of regular coercive behaviors—occurred in 2007, between two and five years earlier than most analysis has supposed. This finding disconfirms three common explanations for Beijing's assertive turn in maritime Asia: the Global Financial Crisis, domestic legitimacy issues, and the ascendancy of Xi Jinping. Focused qualitative case studies of four breakpoints identified in the data indicate that PRC policy shifts in 1973, 1987, and 1992 were largely opportunistic responses to favorable geopolitical circumstances. In contrast, the policy change observed from 2007 was a lagged effect of decisions taken in the 1990s to build specific capabilities designed to realize strategic objectives that emerged in the 1970s.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Chubb"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/0163660X.2014.1002160"", ""10.1093/cjip/poq016"", ""10.1162/ISEC_c_00151"", ""10.1162/isec.2009.34.2.46"", ""10.1080/10670564.2013.766379"", ""10.1017/S0305741018000930"", ""10.1080/10670564.2013.832526"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12655"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00354"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00115"", ""10.2307/2600403"", ""10.1177/00108369921961780"", ""10.1093/cjip/pot019"", ""10.1093/global/guw010"", ""10.1177/073889429601500203"", ""10.2307/422246"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.1991.tb00349.x"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx049"", ""10.1162/isec.2008.32.3.44"", ""10.1177/0738894211413066"", ""10.1017/S0305741000045513"", ""10.2307/2644968"", ""10.1080/09700169908455139"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00137"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00135"", ""10.1016/0308-597X(91)90063-H"", ""10.2307/2539340"", ""10.1080/14799855.2018.1437723"", ""10.1080/00396330600594322"", ""10.1080/00396338.2010.494881"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00310"", ""10.1525/as.2015.55.3.502"", ""10.1017/S0002930000031912""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Gender, Sex, and Protective Measures during COVID-19","AbstractSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, men have been consistently less likely to report wearing a protective face mask. There are several possible reasons for this difference, including partisanship and gender identity. Using a national live-caller telephone survey that measures gender identity, we show that men's gender identities are strongly related to their views of mask wearing, especially when gender identity is highly salient to the individual. The effects of this interaction of sex and gender are shown to be separate from the effects of partisanship. While partisanship is a significant driver of attitudes about face masks, within partisan groups, men who report “completely” masculine gender identities are very different from their fellow partisans.","[{""name"": ""Dan Cassino"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yasemin Besen-Cassino"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00390-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190462802.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0008423917000270"", ""10.1332/251510820X15912551895078"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.88.4.354"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.02.035"", ""10.1177/0891243215584758"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9391-y"", ""10.1111/pops.12573""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1111/jcms.13156,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,0302 Political Science; 0202 Applied Economics,How 'Smart' Are Smart Specialization Strategies?,"AbstractThe introduction of smart specialization (S3) as a fundamental pillar of the 2014 reform of the EU cohesion policy is a significant strategic shift in European development intervention. S3 strategies aimed at mobilizing the economic potential of each country and region of the EU by allowing a more place‐based and bottom‐up approach to development. However, despite the salience that S3 has acquired in a short period of time, there has been no European‐wide evaluation of the extent to which S3 strategies truly reflect the economic characteristics and potential of the territories where they are being implemented. This article examines the characteristics of S3 strategies across Europe – by focusing on their development axes, economic or scientific domains and policy priorities – to assess whether this is the case. The results show that S3 strategies display a proliferation of objectives, a problem that particularly affects areas with weaker quality of government. Moreover, strategies are generally loosely connected with the intrinsic conditions of each region and mostly mimic what neighbouring areas are doing. The lack of more concise and focused S3 strategies is likely to undermine the effectiveness of what is, otherwise, a very interesting and worthwhile policy experiment.","[{""name"": ""Marco Di Cataldo"", ""affiliation"": [""Ca’ Foscari University of Venice  Venice Italy"", ""European Institute, London School of Economics  London United Kingdom""]}, {""name"": ""Vassilis Monastiriotis"", ""affiliation"": [""European Institute, London School of Economics  London United Kingdom""]}, {""name"": ""Andrés Rodríguez‐Pose"", ""affiliation"": [""Cañada Blanch Centre and Department of Geography and Environment London School of Economics  London United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1080/00343404.2010.543126"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-804137-6.00004-8"", ""10.1080/00343404.2018.1437900"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9787.2011.00756.x"", ""10.3280/SCRE2014-001004"", ""10.1111/j.1944-8287.2009.01034.x"", ""10.1016/S0014-2921(02)00307-0"", ""10.3280/SCRE2014-001005"", ""10.1080/09654313.2016.1156058"", ""10.1080/00343404.2013.770141"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2007.04.004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2257.2005.00291.x"", ""10.1080/00343404.2014.946401"", ""10.1080/13673882.2017.11868994"", ""10.1080/00343404.2018.1502422"", ""10.1080/00343404.2018.1498073"", ""10.1007/s10037-011-0063-9"", ""10.1080/00343400601120296"", ""10.1080/00343404.2019.1607970"", ""10.3280/SCRE2014-001006"", ""10.1080/09654313.2016.1170108"", ""10.1111/jcms.12995"", ""10.1007/s11127-010-9714-6"", ""10.1093/icc/dty034"", ""10.3280/SCRE2014-001002"", ""10.1080/00343404.2013.799769"", ""10.1080/09654313.2016.1166177"", ""10.1007/s11127-011-9890-z"", ""10.1080/00343404.2015.1007572"", ""10.1080/00036840210122353"", ""10.1111/rsp3.12277"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.00302"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbu023"", ""10.1080/00343400310001632226"", ""10.2139/ssrn.617544"", ""10.1177/0263774X15603905""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Surgery', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1093/isq/sqab011,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Great Power Narcissism and Ontological (In)Security: The Narrative Mediation of Greatness and Weakness in International Politics,"AbstractWhy do self-representations of weakness pervade public discourse in self-identified great powers? Moreover, why do they intersect with self-representations of greatness? Do such narrative instability, inconsistency, and incoherence simply indicate that great powers are ontologically insecure? This article advances a theoretical explanation that is both embedded in and contributes to scholarship that theorizes ontological (in)security from a Lacanian perspective. The gist, ironically, is that great powers’ quest for greatness is co-constituted with the narrative construction of weakness. The article then challenges the assumption in existing ontological security scholarship that states are generally self-reflexive and experience pride when ontologically secure but shame when ontologically insecure. Since great power narratives reflect persistent, exaggerated, and simultaneous feelings of shame and pride, it argues that narcissism helps better account for great power self-identification and ontological security-seeking. Drawing on psychological research on narcissism, the article develops four narrative forms—shame, pride, denial, and insult—through which self-representations of weakness and greatness, and feelings of shame and pride, can be mediated. Finally, using empirical illustrations from the United States and China, the article analyzes how and with what implications political leaders have narrated about each respective great power's weakness and greatness, with a focus on the period 2006–2020.¿Por qué las autorrepresentaciones de debilidad se extienden en los discursos públicos en las grandes potencias autoidentificadas? Asimismo, ¿por qué se entrecruzan con las autorrepresentaciones de grandeza? ¿La inestabilidad, la incongruencia y la incoherencia narrativa simplemente indican que las grandes potencias son inseguras en términos ontológicos? Este artículo propone una explicación teórica que está incorporada a una erudición, y que contribuye con ella, que teoriza la (in)seguridad desde una perspectiva lacaniana. Irónicamente, la idea es que la búsqueda de grandeza de las grandes potencias está coconstituida con la construcción narrativa de debilidad. Por lo tanto, el artículo desafía el supuesto de la erudición existente de seguridad ontológica que establece que, por lo general, los estados son autorreflexivos y experimentan orgullo cuando están ontológicamente seguros, pero experimentan vergüenza cuando están inseguros en términos ontológicos. Puesto que las narraciones de las grandes potencias reflejan sentimientos persistentes, exagerados y simultáneos de vergüenza y orgullo, se sostiene que el narcisismo ayuda mejor a dar cuenta de la autoidentificación y de la búsqueda de seguridad ontológica de las grandes potencias. Al recurrir a la investigación psicológica sobre el narcisismo, el artículo desarrolla cuatro formas de narraciones: vergüenza, orgullo, negación e insulto, a través de las cuales se pueden mediar las autorrepresentaciones de debilidad y grandeza, así como los sentimientos de vergüenza y orgullo. Por último, usando ejemplos empíricos de los Estados Unidos y de China, el artículo analiza cómo y con qué consecuencias los líderes políticos han narrado sobre la debilidad y la grandeza de cada gran potencia, y se centra en el período que va de 2006 a 2020.Pourquoi les auto-représentations de faiblesse imprègnent-elles le discours public des grandes puissances autoproclamées ? De plus, pourquoi ces auto-représentations de faiblesse s'entrecroisent-elles avec des auto-représentations de grandeur ? De telles instabilités, inconstances et incohérences narratives indiquent-elles simplement que les grandes puissances sont ontologiquement insécurisées ? Cet article avance une explication théorique qui est à la fois intégrée et contributrice aux recherches qui théorisent l’(in)sécurité ontologique d'un point de vue lacanien. Ironiquement, l'idée générale est que la quête de grandeur des grandes puissances se constitue conjointement avec la construction narrative de la faiblesse. Cet article remet ensuite en question l'hypothèse des recherches existantes sur la sécurité ontologique, qui est que les États sont généralement auto-réflexifs et qu'ils ressentent de la fierté lorsqu'ils sont ontologiquement sécurisés mais de la honte lorsqu'ils sont ontologiquement insécurisés. Étant donné que les discours des grandes puissances reflètent des sentiments persistants, exagérés et simultanés de honte et de fierté, cet article soutient que le narcissisme aide à mieux prendre en compte l'autoproclamation des grandes puissances et leur quête de sécurité ontologique. Cet article s'appuie sur une recherche psychologique sur le narcissisme pour présenter quatre formes narratives—de la honte, de la fierté, du déni et de l'insulte—par le biais desquelles les auto-représentations de faiblesse et de grandeur, et les sentiments de honte et de fierté, peuvent être communiqués. Enfin, cet article utilise des illustrations empiriques des États-Unis et de Chine pour analyser la manière dont et les implications avec lesquelles les dirigeants politiques ont discouru sur les faiblesses et grandeurs respectives de chacune des grandes puissances en se concentrant sur la période 2006–2020.","[{""name"": ""Linus Hagström"", ""affiliation"": [""Swedish Defence University, Sweden""]}]","[""10.1017/S0020818313000337"", ""10.1515/9780748691142"", ""10.5040/9798216001980"", ""10.1177/1354066112445290"", ""10.1521/jscp.2010.29.8.874"", ""10.5465/amr.1997.9708210722"", ""10.1080/09662839.2018.1497982"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1567461"", ""10.1177/0010836716653161"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.75.1.219"", ""10.1002/pchj.26"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1391670"", ""10.1111/pops.12334"", ""10.1177/0263395718776215"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2007.00645.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511607356"", ""10.1177/030437548801300401"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790768"", ""10.1037/a0016904"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2008.02.005"", ""10.2307/2600810"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0104-2"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0083-3"", ""10.1177/1354066109350055"", ""10.1521/jscp.2015.34.10.877"", ""10.1080/10510974.2014.991044"", ""10.1080/03637751.2016.1182638"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000546"", ""10.1177/1354066120927073"", ""10.1093/cjip/pos011"", ""10.1177/1354066113518356"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1623498"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000251"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000144"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1575796"", ""10.1080/10584600490273254"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316154670"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000232"", ""10.1177/1354066198004002004"", ""10.1080/10357820208713357"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00364.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00396.x"", ""10.1177/0160597618802646"", ""10.1057/s41268-018-0161-1"", ""10.1037/pspp0000013"", ""10.1093/cjip/pon003"", ""10.1080/09523360500386450"", ""10.1017/S0020818303571028"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000222"", ""10.1007/s12144-018-9866-y"", ""10.1177/0967010614552549"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2011.12.042"", ""10.1057/s41286-017-0024-z"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.11643/issn.2217-995X151SPN56"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12752"", ""10.2307/1148580"", ""10.1002/polq.12394"", ""10.4337/9781782544241"", ""10.1080/09557571003739164"", ""10.1075/jnlh.1.2-3.04nar"", ""10.1093/cjip/pox004"", ""10.1177/1354066196002004002"", ""10.1111/ips.12103"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190876791.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230622951"", ""10.1080/0163660X.2011.537974"", ""10.3998/mpub.5031921"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0089-x"", ""10.1017/S0260210505006613"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.1516/AL5W-9RVJ-WKG2-B0CK"", ""10.1177/1354066112437771"", ""10.1177/0305829814536629"", ""10.1080/15298860802505053"", ""10.1080/08037060902727795"", ""10.1080/10670564.2020.1744387"", ""10.1017/S175297191800026X"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muaa048,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Everything Is Relative: How Citizens Form and Use Expectations in Evaluating Services,"Abstract In recent years, studies of citizen satisfaction have increasingly relied on the expectancy–disconfirmation model, which highlights the role that expectations play in driving citizen evaluations of government services. But most empirical studies within public administration of the relationship between expectations and satisfaction indicate that expectations have little-to-no net effect on satisfaction. We argue that these results may be largely driven by the weaknesses of existing measurement approaches and inattention in many studies to the distinction between two types of expectations: those about what should happen (normative expectations) versus those about what will happen (predictive expectations). Distinguishing between these two types of expectations is important because they are likely to have different—and perhaps even opposite—effects on satisfaction. We recruited 972 US residents via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to complete a survey vignette experiment and found that normative expectations are strongly (and negatively) related to satisfaction levels, whereas predictive expectations are barely related to satisfaction at all. We also find that comparative performance information generally has a much stronger effect on predictive expectations than on normative expectations. These findings suggest that theories of satisfaction should more consistently distinguish between different types of expectations. Our results also leave us somewhat optimistic about the ability of ordinary residents to follow a reasonable process when assigning normative meaning to performance information.","[{""name"": ""Nathan Favero"", ""affiliation"": [""American University"", ""Aarhus University""]}, {""name"": ""Minjung Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""American University""]}]","[""10.1177/002224377301000106"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv036"", ""10.1111/puar.12406"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw028"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1177/002224379303000102"", ""10.2307/975299"", ""10.1177/0275074010397333"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1553808"", ""10.1080/14719037.2017.1295099"", ""10.1509/jmr.12.0407"", ""10.1080/14719037.2017.1282000"", ""10.1108/08876040610674571"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2004.02.002"", ""10.1111/padm.12346"", ""10.1177/0275074018765822"", ""10.30636/jbpa.31.72"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy048"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu026"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum034"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01962.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muz012"", ""10.1017/9781316676912.007"", ""10.1177/0952076718779665"", ""10.1111/1540-6210.00241"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus012"", ""10.1177/002224378001700405"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux023"", ""10.1177/0963721414531598"", ""10.2307/975862"", ""10.1111/puar.12623"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur004"", ""10.2307/3110378"", ""10.1080/10967494.2016.1276493"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2003.08.011"", ""10.1086/257839"", ""10.1002/pam.20020"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui058"", ""10.1002/pam.21702"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00863.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00377.x""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

While prior studies have examined the separate effects of inequality and immigration on redistribution preferences, the interaction between inequality and communal identity has been largely overlooked. This article explains that inequality triggers selective solidarity. Individuals exposed to inequality become more supportive of redistribution – but only if the redistribution benefits native-born citizens. Inequality therefore reinforces the already popular opinion that native citizens deserve welfare priority and widens the gap between support for natives and support for immigrants. This study first provides cross-national evidence with survey data linked to contextual socio-economic indicators from advanced industrialized countries. To evaluate causally identified effects, it then presents the results of a survey experiment administered to a nationally representative sample of Italian citizens. The findings imply that economic inequality can increase support for populist radical right parties that advocate discrimination in access to welfare services based on native citizenship.","[{""name"": ""Gabriele Magni"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1559-1816.1999.tb02295.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070142"", ""10.1257/jel.49.1.3"", ""10.1177/0958928710374376"", ""10.1017/XPS.2017.12"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.3886/ICPSR36876.v1"", ""10.1017/S000305540400098X"", ""10.1177/0956797614553947"", ""10.1093/ser/mwm006"", ""10.1093/0199267669.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2998640"", ""10.3886/ICPSR36734.v1"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12194"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400067"", ""10.1073/pnas.1706253114"", ""10.1080/01402380701617563"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000128"", ""10.1017/psrm.2017.18"", ""10.1177/0003122413513022"", ""10.1086/665800"", ""10.1016/0047-2727(75)90016-X"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt035"", ""10.1086/321019"", ""10.1162/003355300554935"", ""10.1257/jep.27.3.79"", ""10.3386/w24733"", ""10.1093/qje/qju022"", ""10.1093/restud/rdt040"", ""10.1086/694201"", ""10.1017/XPS.2018.2"", ""10.1093/esr/jcp017"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226293660.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0958928712440198"", ""10.1177/0958928706059829"", ""10.1086/678312"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-091515-030034"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000326"", ""10.1177/0958928709104737"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000113"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00545.x"", ""10.5129/001041512801283013"", ""10.1162/003355399556151"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2012.06.002"", ""10.1177/0010414006295234"", ""10.1086/687324"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2008.00211.x"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(00)00172-9"", ""10.1177/0010414019830714"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1177/1088868310387615"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2011.02218.x"", ""10.1257/aer.20130360"", ""10.1561/100.00015099"", ""10.1073/pnas.1511536112"", ""10.2307/2946692"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00191.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12153"", ""10.1525/9780520378513"", ""10.1177/1532673X04271903"", ""10.1093/ser/mwl002"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990360"", ""10.1017/S0043887118000096"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(00)00141-9"", ""10.2307/2096070"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226921853.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000849"", ""10.1177/0003122412458508"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1177/1465116505057816"", ""10.1038/nature15392"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00641.x"", ""10.1037/a0015141"", ""10.1093/0199240981.001.0001"", ""10.1057/s41269-017-0050-4"", ""10.1162/00335530151144078"", ""10.1111/ajps.12212"", ""10.1038/nature04981"", ""10.1177/0020715212451987"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000046"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2004.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.09.014""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12375,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Dynamics of protest and electoral politics in the Great Recession,"AbstractThis article links the consequences of the Great Recession on protest and electoral politics. It innovates by combining the literature on economic voting with social movement research and by presenting the first integrated, large‐scale empirical analysis of protest mobilisation and electoral outcomes in Europe. The economic voting literature offers important insights on how and under what conditions economic crises play out in the short‐run. However, it tends to ignore the closely connected dynamics of opposition in the two arenas and the role of protests in politicising economic grievances. More specifically, it is argued that economic protests act as a ‘signalling mechanism’ by attributing blame to decision makers and by highlighting the political dimension of deteriorating economic conditions. Ultimately, massive protest mobilisation should, thus, amplify the impact of economic hardship on the electoral losses of incumbents and mainstream parties more generally. The empirical analysis to study this relationship relies on an original semi‐automated protest event dataset combined with an updated dataset of electoral outcomes in 30 European countries from 2000 to 2015. The results indicate that the dynamics of economic protests and electoral punishment are closely related and point to a destabilisation of European party systems during the Great Recession.","[{""name"": ""BJÖRN BREMER"", ""affiliation"": [""Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies  Cologne Germany""]}, {""name"": ""SWEN HUTTER"", ""affiliation"": [""Freie Universität Berlin &amp; WZB Berlin Social Science Center  Germany""]}, {""name"": ""HANSPETER KRIESI"", ""affiliation"": [""European University Institute, Florence, Italy &amp; Laboratory for Comparative Social Research National Research University Higher School of Economics  Russian Federation""]}]","[""10.1177/1354068817740743"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199357505.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000199"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi014"", ""10.1002/9780470999103.ch3"", ""10.1177/1354068811436042"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9236-2"", ""10.1057/ap.2014.12"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755934"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12018"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803987.014"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12153"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12527"", ""10.1177/0010414006288974"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12122"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1181871"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816691180.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108652780"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000275"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-21-4-431"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-24-3-251"", ""10.1017/9781108891660"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12318"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.003.0027"", ""10.2307/2939043"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12024"", ""10.1017/S1537592710001234"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816686513.003.0019"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805431"", ""10.1086/226464"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000531"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12177"", ""10.1007/BF02092232"", ""10.2307/2111378"", ""10.1177/0011392115602937"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12191"", ""10.1057/s41295-017-0092-z"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1376272"", ""10.1093/sf/sow075""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic,"AbstractUsing weekly variation from April 23 to June 23 2020, we exploit the surge in unemployment over the coronavirus pandemic to identify the effects on mental health outcomes and the role of marital status as a protective factor for households. We find that married respondents are 1–2 percentage points less likely, relative to their unmarried counterparts, to experience mental health problems following declines in work‐related income since the start of the pandemic. Our results suggest that the combination of intrafamily substitution and the psychological benefits of marriage helps insure against unanticipated fluctuations in job and income loss.","[{""name"": ""Clara E.

A review of existing knowledge and an agenda for future research,The claim that evidence-based policy (EBP) produces better outcomes has gained increasing support over the last three decades. Knowledge brokering (KB) is seen as a way to achieve improved policymaking and governments worldwide are investing significant resources in KB initiatives. It is therefore important to understand the range of these activities and to investigate whether and how they facilitate EBP. This article critically reviews the extant literature on KB. It identifies six important limitations: the existence of multiple definitions of KB; a lack of theory-based empirical analysis; a neglect of knowledge brokering organisations; insufficient research on KB in social policy; limited analysis of impact and effectiveness; and a lack of attention to the role played by politics. The paper proposes an agenda for future research that bridges disciplinary boundaries in order to address these gaps and contribute new insights into the politics of evidence use.,"[{""name"": ""Eleanor MacKillop"", ""affiliation"": [""Cardiff University, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Sarah Quarmby"", ""affiliation"": [""Cardiff University, UK""]}, {""name"": ""James Downe"", ""affiliation"": [""Cardiff University, UK""]}]","[""10.1332/147084413X674001"", ""10.4337/9781784719326.00023"", ""10.1080/19460171.2014.957335"", ""10.1093/scipol/scv008"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-8598-7_12"", ""10.1332/030557317X15052303355719"", ""10.1057/s41293-017-0068-2"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.11.089"", ""10.1177/000276427902200308"", ""10.1332/174426413X662734"", ""10.1017/S1755773914000277"", ""10.1332/174426413X662806"", ""10.47678/cjhe.v48i1.187983"", ""10.1002/eet.1752"", ""10.3402/gha.v8.26004"", ""10.1332/174426418X15299595767891"", ""10.1093/pubmed/fdx150"", ""10.1111/hir.12097"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856x.2007.00269.x"", ""10.1332/030557318X15333033508220"", ""10.1332/174426412X654068"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.08.013"", ""10.1332/030557310X550169"", ""10.4324/9780203934753"", ""10.4102/sajs.v106i5/6.247"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.00958.x"", ""10.1177/016224390102600401"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.011"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.09.051"", ""10.1016/S0191-3085(02)24003-4"", ""10.1287/orsc.13.3.290.2772"", ""10.1007/s11625-015-0314-8"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2013.04.004"", ""10.1332/174426418X15299595170910"", ""10.1057/9781137266989"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur035"", ""10.1186/s12961-016-0133-0"", ""10.1093/heapol/czv107"", ""10.1016/j.crm.2015.04.001"", ""10.1177/1355819616653981"", ""10.1332/174426413X671941"", ""10.1186/s12889-016-2832-4"", ""10.1258/135581903322029520"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2013.07.008"", ""10.1111/j.1465-3435.2007.00296.x"", ""10.1080/13563475.2017.1345301"", ""10.1136/bmj.39038.593380.AE"", ""10.1186/1472-6963-13-158"", ""10.1186/s13643-017-0481-z"", ""10.1186/s12913-018-3314-4"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-12-552"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71955-9_1"", ""10.1332/174426422X16419160905358"", ""10.1177/1075547009359797"", ""10.1093/scipol/sct051"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2009.05.002"", ""10.1332/030557308783431643"", ""10.1186/s13643-017-0411-0"", ""10.1332/204674312X645547"", ""10.1332/030557310X550150"", ""10.1111/puar.12464"", ""10.1332/174426415X14298824732060"", ""10.1177/1098214017716326"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-0575-6_29"", ""10.1177/1356389016638752"", ""10.1186/1478-4505-12-34"", ""10.1890/090145"", ""10.5888/pcd12.140546"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2008.12.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818110"", ""10.1111/padm.12365"", ""10.14507/epaa.v21n2.2013"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511509889"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2014.09.001"", ""10.1332/030557306775212188"", ""10.1186/s13012-017-0662-0"", ""10.1332/174426413X662743"", ""10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.11.008"", ""10.1057/9781137026583"", ""10.1186/1478-4505-9-S1-S15"", ""10.1080/01442872.2012.695933"", ""10.1332/030557311X574216"", ""10.1093/scipol/scs114"", ""10.3390/su9111962"", ""10.2471/BLT.05.028308"", ""10.1332/0305573042009444"", ""10.1332/174426409X463811"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.021"", ""10.1057/jphp.2010.33"", ""10.1332/030557318X15230059147191"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2005.00101.x"", ""10.1177/0266666908101261"", ""10.1080/19460171.2007.9518511""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Finance', 'Education']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

10.1093/ia/iiab221,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Contesting liberal peace: Russia's emerging model of conflict management,"Abstract Russia has begun to promote itself internationally as a mediator of conflict and as a ‘peacemaker’. Russian officials cite its extensive experience in managing numerous post-Soviet conflicts and its more recent experience of intervention in civil wars in Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia considers all these activities forms of ‘peacemaking’, but its approach differs radically from the model of liberal peacebuilding that has dominated international practice in the post-Cold War era. It prioritizes authoritarian stability over justice, human rights and democracy and advocates short-term goals of conflict management over long-term goals of conflict resolution. In this article I explain why Russia's norms of peacemaking and conflict management diverged so markedly from liberal peacebuilding norms. I argue that Russia is no longer simply contesting western norms, but developing its own distinct model of conflict management.

In this manuscript, I argue for greater use of “mirror experiments” in political science, or controlled survey experiments that use real politicians and mimic real world situations. This article demonstrates that cognitive burden, brought on by the lack of familiarity with a hypothetical politician, can bias experimental results. Without prior knowledge of a politician, attitudes toward political actors are artificially malleable in laboratory settings, exaggerating treatment effects on traditional approval questions. This article concludes with two empirical demonstrations of these issues, and provides a set of criteria for judging when realistic or hypothetical survey vignettes should be used.","[{""name"": ""Jared McDonald"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science and Public Administration, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, NC, USA""]}]","[""10.1086/297760"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edt014"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195122657.003.0006"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00449.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054"", ""10.4135/9781412986045"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00608.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.1"", ""10.2307/2944796"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl008"", ""10.1017/S0003055401003045"", ""10.1111/ajps.12201"", ""10.3998/mpub.12857"", ""10.1017/S000305540400108X"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1002/acp.1602"", ""10.1017/S002238161100154X"", ""10.2307/2082427"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pan/10.4.325"", ""10.2307/3791741"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.00161"", ""10.2307/3791529"", ""10.2307/2111765"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.377"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.2307/2111542"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070282"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1126/science.7455683"", ""10.1086/296365""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Explaining the adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation using the multiple streams framework,"AbstractWhy and how the regulation of emerging technologies occurs is not clear in the literature. In this study, we adapt the multiple streams framework – often used for explaining agenda‐setting and policy adoption – to examine the phenomenon. We hypothesize how technological change affects policy‐making and identify conditions under which the streams can be (de‐)coupled. We trace the formulation of the General Data Protection Regulation to show that the regulation occupied the legislative agenda when a policy window was exploited through policy entrepreneurship to frame technological change as a problem for data privacy and legislative harmonization within the European Union. Although constituencies interested in promoting internet technologies made every effort to stall the regulation, various actors, activities, and events helped the streams remain coupled, eventually leading to its adoption. We conclude that the alignment of problem, policy, politics, and technology – through policy entrepreneurship – influences the timing and design of technology regulation.","[{""name"": ""Nihit Goyal"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management Delft University of Technology  Delft The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Howlett"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Simon Fraser University  Burnaby British Columbia Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Araz Taeihagh"", ""affiliation"": [""Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy National University of Singapore  Singapore""]}]","[""10.1080/13501763.2011.520879"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.781824"", ""10.1057/9781137032225_4"", ""10.1017/S0143814X18000223"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00099"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2001.tb02073.x"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2015.06.038"", ""10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.01.011"", ""10.1080/13691180903473814"", ""10.5325/jinfopoli.6.2016.0479"", ""10.1111/psj.12111"", ""10.1016/j.eneco.2011.06.001"", ""10.1177/0894439303259890"", ""10.1080/13501760110083509"", ""10.1080/17489725.2011.637081"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2017.10.003"", ""10.1080/13698570701782437"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2010.07.001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2009.01303.x"", ""10.1177/0020702017741909"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.04.043"", ""10.4324/9780203878231"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2010.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.05.014"", ""10.1017/S0020589315000512"", ""10.2307/1229519"", ""10.1177/0963662505048949"", ""10.3390/en11051198"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2019.09.002"", ""10.4337/9781789904987.00012"", ""10.1002/pad.1855"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001442"", ""10.1080/09537325.2012.674671"", ""10.1007/s10460-019-09956-9"", ""10.1007/s11077-015-9231-z"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12089"", ""10.1007/s11051-010-0038-8"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.01.014"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12064"", ""10.1080/18918131.2017.1314110"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.09.010"", ""10.1111/jcms.12810"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2011.01.005"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12097"", ""10.1093/idpl/ipr018"", ""10.1111/psj.12073"", ""10.1080/10361140220148188"", ""10.1002/poi3.246"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6478.2004.00287.x"", ""10.3390/en11051277"", ""10.3390/su11205791"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-5170-5_3"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1090.1014"", ""10.1093/idpl/ipq009"", ""10.1093/idpl/ipq004"", ""10.1080/13563467.2016.1201804"", ""10.17645/pag.v3i2.290"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080041"", ""10.1080/01402381003794605"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2012.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2012.07.002"", ""10.1002/poi3.102"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2015.02.002"", ""10.1080/13669877.2012.729522"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.06.024"", ""10.1080/03932729.2018.1532705"", ""10.1007/s11077-015-9227-8"", ""10.1017/aju.2019.80"", ""10.1007/BF00136406"", ""10.1093/scipol/scs084"", ""10.1007/s11077-015-9239-4"", ""10.1038/nenergy.2017.84"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.09.033"", ""10.1002/bse.1808"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2008.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.06.098"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2009.01049.x"", ""10.1177/0169796X17710072"", ""10.1093/idpl/ipq003"", ""10.1080/713601583"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139003735"", ""10.1080/14636778.2010.528194"", ""10.1111/rego.12170"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.08.004"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.923625"", ""10.1177/1075547009340345"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2015.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2011.01.001"", ""10.1111/rego.12158"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00005614"", ""10.1177/0010414096029004002"", ""10.1080/13501760801996717"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9243-3"", ""10.1080/13876988.2015.1095428""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiab167,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Why NATO survived Trump: the neglected role of Secretary-General Stoltenberg,"Abstract The election of Donald Trump posed an existential challenge to NATO. At the end of his tenure, however, the US president had neither withdrawn membership nor substantially undermined the alliance from within. This article helps explain the puzzle of why NATO survived Trump's presidency. Extant explanations emphasize domestic factors such as the US foreign policy machinery and entrenched liberal ideology, structural reasons and Trump's idiosyncratic personality. While these accounts possess some explanatory value, they remain incomplete as they omit one central factor: NATO's leadership. Drawing on more than twenty original interviews with senior officials, the article demonstrates that particularly Secretary-General Stoltenberg's strategic responses were a necessary factor in changing Trump's stance on burden-sharing and helped maintain a robust deterrence policy toward Russia. These findings carry important implications both for theoretical debates on international organizations' agency in fending off contestation and policy debates on which actors shape NATO by emphasising the hitherto understated role of the secretary-general.","[{""name"": ""Leonard August Schuette"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Preferences for tax progressivity in the wake of the financial crisis,"AbstractProgressive taxation is an effective redistributive tool in times of growing inequality. However, like all public policies, an increase in tax progressivity is unlikely if it lacks popular demand. Has the financial crisis affected the demand for progressive taxation? Building on research that has identified fairness beliefs as the main factor pushing for taxes on the rich, I argue that the Great Recession and states’ reactions to it have caused a general shift in tax policy preferences. As a consequence, demand for tax progressivity is higher in crisis countries. Multilevel analyses using survey data for 32 countries show support for my argument. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the politics of redistribution in the 21st century.","[{""name"": ""Julian Limberg"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00474.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060280"", ""10.1093/esr/jcr011"", ""10.1111/ajps.12001"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12295"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu030"", ""10.1016/0047-2727(80)90004-3"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77h28"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000226"", ""10.4135/9781608718276"", ""10.1017/S000305540505149X"", ""10.1017/S0047279410000668"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.03.005"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000147"", ""10.1017/S0043887111000037"", ""10.1177/0010414008330595"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.11.017"", ""10.1093/ser/mwp005"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.1177/0002716213497452"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv014"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000603"", ""10.1017/S1537592707072210"", ""10.1111/geer.12050"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.11.007"", ""10.1086/686972"", ""10.1080/09692290.2015.1127269"", ""10.1017/S1537592705050048"", ""10.1093/ser/mwt012"", ""10.1111/jeea.12082"", ""10.1177/0010414016666834"", ""10.1177/0032329215602893"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi014"", ""10.1177/0010414015617961"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199357505.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592707072222"", ""10.1017/S1537592705050036"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu007"", ""10.1111/ajps.12264"", ""10.4135/9781412993869"", ""10.1257/0002828054825655"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.2007.00048.x"", ""10.1177/0002716213496054"", ""10.1177/0003122412458508"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1053511"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000517"", ""10.1017/S1537592705050292"", ""10.5089/9781475505054.001"", ""10.1561/100.00005052"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052615-025442"", ""10.1086/687324"", ""10.1017/S0022050714000321"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-6175"", ""10.31222/osf.io/s42ba"", ""10.32614/CRAN.package.interplot"", ""10.1177/0010414012463904"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00589.x"", ""10.1177/0032329210365042"", ""10.1257/aer.20162015"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2004.09.014"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1155472"", ""10.1057/cep.2014.48"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400067"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx063"", ""10.4159/9780674287013"", ""10.1515/9780691187402"", ""10.4324/9780203852279"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr004"", ""10.1353/wp.2003.0022"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2739221"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(00)00141-9""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Accounting']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)]]"

We find that a country's own COVID‐19 deaths and lockdowns significantly reduced its imports from China, suggesting that the negative demand effects prevailed over the negative supply effects of the pandemic. On the contrary, COVID‐19 deaths in the main trading partners of a country (excluding China) induce more imports from China, partially offsetting countries’ own effects. The net effect of moving from the pre‐pandemic situation to another where the main variables are evaluated at their 2020 mean is, on average, a reduction of nearly 10% in imports from China. There is also significant heterogeneity. For example, the negative own effects of the pandemic vanish when we restrict the sample to medical goods and are significantly mitigated for products with a high ‘work‐from‐home’ share or a high contract intensity for products exported under processing trade and for capital goods. We also find that deaths and lockdowns in previous months tend to increase current imports from China, partially offsetting the contemporaneous trade loss, suggesting that trade is not simply ‘destroyed,’ but partially ‘postponed’.","[{""name"": ""Xuepeng Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Kennesaw State University  Kennesaw Georgia USA""]}, {""name"": ""Emanuel Ornelas"", ""affiliation"": [""Sao Paulo School of Economics‐FGV CEPR, CESifo and CEP‐LSE  Sao Paulo Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Huimin Shi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Economics Institute of China's Economic Reform &amp; Development Renmin University of China  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1257/000282803321455214"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-9975"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00287"", ""10.1057/imfer.2010.15"", ""10.1146/annurev‐economics‐082912‐110201"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4035651"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2021.103534"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2011.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104235"", ""10.1257/aer.20101557"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3848341"", ""10.1111/twec.13117"", ""10.1038/s41562‐021‐01079‐8"", ""10.1111/deve.12275"", ""10.1162/qjec.122.2.569"", ""10.1111/jors.12559"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3567558""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Modeling and Simulation']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)]]"

10.1093/jogss/ogaa038,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES,0302 Political Science,"The Islamic State's Pattern of Sexual Violence: Ideology and Institutions, Policies and Practices","AbstractThe Islamic State (IS), which controlled significant territory in Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2017, engaged in a wide repertoire of violence against civilians living in these areas. Despite extensive media coverage and scholarly attention, the determinants of this pattern of violence remain poorly understood. We argue that, contrary to a widespread assumption that the IS wielded violence indiscriminately, it systematically targeted different social groups with distinct forms of violence, including sexual violence. Our theory focuses on ideology, suggesting it is a necessary element of explanations of patterns of violence on the part of many armed actors. Ideologies, to varying extent, prescribe organizational policies that order or authorize particular forms of violence against specific social groups and institutions that regulate the conditions under which they occur. We find support for our theory in the case of sexual violence by IS by triangulating between several types of qualitative data: official documents; social media data generated by individuals in or near IS-controlled areas; interviews with Syrians and Iraqis who have knowledge of the organization's policies including victims of violence and former IS combatants; and secondary sources including local Arabic-language newspapers. Consistent with our theory, we find that the organization adopted ideologically motivated policies that authorized certain forms of sexual violence, including sexual slavery and child marriage. Forms of violence that violated organizational policies but were nonetheless tolerated by many commanders also occurred and we find evidence of two such practices: gang rape of Yazidi women and forced marriage of Sunni Muslim women.","[{""name"": ""Mara Redlich Revkin"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, US""]}, {""name"": ""Elisabeth Jean Wood"", ""affiliation"": [""Yale University, New Haven, US""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2010.01207.x"", ""10.1080/00396338.2015.1047251"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjk2x5j"", ""10.5040/9781350222557"", ""10.1017/9781316392737"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2015.11.007"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000064"", ""10.1017/S0043887109990219"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000221"", ""10.7591/9781501705984"", ""10.1177/0022343311405698"", ""10.1086/680262"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2018.01.007"", ""10.1177/0022002702046001007"", ""10.1177/0022343313514073"", ""10.1017/S1537592716004114"", ""10.1177/0022343316653645"", ""10.1515/9781501726484"", ""10.1080/09546550701246866"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818462"", ""10.1080/00396338.2017.1282675"", ""10.1177/0010414013489382"", ""10.1017/S1537592716002875"", ""10.1086/706597"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104981"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0142209"", ""10.7591/cornell/9781501713736.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781107706477"", ""10.1017/S1537592712000709"", ""10.7591/9780801455681"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00292"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808654"", ""10.1080/15295036.2017.1393094"", ""10.1177/0032329208329755"", ""10.1017/S1816383115000077"", ""10.1177/0032329218773710"", ""10.1177/0022343317720487"", ""10.1017/S004388711100030X""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Collaborative innovation seems ideal as it builds on diversity to generate innovative public value outcomes, but there is a catch since diversity may clash with the need for constructing a common ground that allows participating actors to agree on a joint and innovative solution. The challenge for collaborative innovation – taming the snake in paradise – is to nurture the diversity of views, ideas and forms of knowledge while still establishing a common ground for joint learning. While we know a great deal about the dynamics of the mutually supportive processes of collaboration, learning and innovation, we have yet to understand the role of institutional design and leadership in spurring collaborative innovation and dealing with this tension. Building on extant research, the article draws suitable cases from the Collaborative Governance Data Bank and uses Qualitative Comparative Analysis to explore how multiple constellations of institutional design and leadership spur collaborative innovation. The main finding is that, even though certain institutional design features reduce the need for certain leadership roles, the exercise of hands-on leadership is more important for securing collaborative innovation outcomes than hands-off institutional design.","[{""name"": ""Jacob Torfing"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social Sciences and Business, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Daniela Cristofoli"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Business Administration and Law, Universita Degli Studi Di Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Peter A Gloor"", ""affiliation"": [""MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Albert J Meijer"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Governance, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Benedetta Trivellato"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology and Social Research, Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy""]}]","[""10.1177/1473095205058494"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux030"", ""10.4324/9780203795958"", ""10.1108/JKM-11-2016-0504"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8691.00337.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00731.x"", ""10.1504/IJMCP.2006.009645"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2011.00306.x"", ""10.1080/14719037.2019.1577905"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1192165"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.01.003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00268.x"", ""10.1111/padm.12209"", ""10.56021/9780801840388"", ""10.1016/S0160-791X(98)00037-2"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.02054.x"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.26586092"", ""10.1016/0048-7333(91)90072-X"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195304121.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195304121.001.0001"", ""10.1002/smj.2370"", ""10.1177/1476127018786487"", ""10.1111/puar.12136"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2006.03.002"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-54984-2_10"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197263839.001.0001"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197263839.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0095399716667157"", ""10.1080/09537329808524310"", ""10.1177/00953990122019712"", ""10.4324/9780203643457"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.12.005"", ""10.1257/aer.97.1.150"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02134.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12032"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.806575"", ""10.1080/01900692.2018.1498102"", ""10.1177/0149206316679252"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.01.004"", ""10.1177/009539979702900201"", ""10.1080/09540962.2011.545532"", ""10.1111/puar.12706"", ""10.3998/mpub.9739"", ""10.5040/9781501397813"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1xp3v5s"", ""10.2307/2393698"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut039"", ""10.1093/pan/mpj019"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139004244"", ""10.1057/jibs.2009.36"", ""10.1080/09537320802292651"", ""10.2196/humanfactors.8083"", ""10.1111/j.0033-3298.2005.00463.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01753.x"", ""10.1177/0095399711418768"", ""10.1177/0095399711418768"", ""10.1353/book48834"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1430248"", ""10.1111/padm.12559"", ""10.1111/padm.12559"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01791.x"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.10.112"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00783.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv017"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy082""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

In this article, we propose an informational mechanism linking in‐person diplomacy to leader survival. A foreign power visits an incumbent in order to reap a future policy concession; the visit is only worth the effort if the incumbent remains in power long enough to deliver on the deal. A diplomatic visit thus provides a visible and credible signal of the visitor's high confidence in the incumbent's stability in office. Domestic opponents, facing incomplete information as to the incumbent's strength, observe the signal and are deterred from mounting a challenge. Using data on U.S. diplomatic visits from 1960 to 2013, we find strong empirical support for our predictions: A visit with the U.S. president substantially reduces the risk of a leader's removal from office.","[{""name"": ""Matt Malis"", ""affiliation"": [""New York University""]}, {""name"": ""Alastair Smith"", ""affiliation"": [""New York University""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414019879945"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9256-y"", ""10.1561/100.00017123"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4292.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001485"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070451"", ""10.1177/0022343308100719"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090768"", ""10.1561/100.00013036"", ""10.1163/187119108X323646"", ""10.1017/S002081830003201X"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr040"", ""10.1093/isq/sqv008"", ""10.1177/0022002709351104"", ""10.1177/0951629819875517"", ""10.1086/697462"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000297"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2007.01062.x"", ""10.2307/2586306"", ""10.1177/0022002701045001002"", ""10.1007/BF00123001"", ""10.2307/2585485"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2005.00397.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139027755"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000252""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Examining data gathered shortly after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri alongside reactions to a novel officer-involved shooting, we unpack the processes by which racial divisions emerge. Even in a controlled information environment, white Americans preferred information that supported claims of a justified shooting. Conversely, Black Americans preferred information that implied that the officer behaved inappropriately. These differences stemmed from two distinct processes: we find some evidence for a form of race-based motivated reasoning and strong evidence for belief updating based on racially distinct priors. Differences in summary judgments were larger when individuals identified strongly with their racial group or when expectations about the typical behaviors of Black Americans and police diverged. The findings elucidate processes whereby individuals in different social groups come to accept differing narratives about contentious events.","[{""name"": ""Hakeem Jefferson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fabian G.

10.1017/S0007123419000437,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Racial Attitudes Through a Partisan Lens,"AbstractThe conventional wisdom is that racial attitudes, by forming through early socialization processes, are causally prior to most things political, including whites' party identifications. Yet a broad literature demonstrates that partisanship can shape mass attitudes. The author argues that this influence extends even to presumptively fundamental predispositions like racial attitudes. The study applies cross-lagged models to panel data from the 1990s and 2000s to demonstrate that whites align their racial attitudes with their party loyalties. The results demonstrate that partisanship has a more pronounced influence in the latter time period, which is consistent with a view that changes in the political context can make partisanship a more likely causal force on other attitudes. Racial concerns not only provide a foundation for political conflict: my results reveal that political processes can increase or decrease racial animus.","[{""name"": ""Andrew M.

In recent years, new data on partisanship and ideology have transformed the study of local politics. Much of the ensuing scholarship has concluded that local politics resembles politics in state and national governments: partisan and ideological. I argue that such a conclusion is premature. So far, this newer literature has been insufficiently attentive to the policies US local governments make—and to the fact that they are mostly different from the issues that dominate national politics. Going forward, scholars should prioritize measurement of preferences on these local government issues, develop theories of when and why local political divisions will mirror national partisanship and ideology, and investigate why there are links between some local policies and national partisanship and ideology—and whether those links also exist for core local government issues.","[{""name"": ""Sarah F.

AfD Party Organisation Between Collective Leadership, Internal Democracy, and ""Movement-Party"" Strategy","This article analyses the formal and lived organisation of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD, Alternative for Germany). We show that the party is exceptional among what is usually understood as the populist radical right (PRR) party family, at least from an organisational perspective: The AfD sharply contradicts the “standard model” of PRR party organisation, which emphasises “charismatic” leadership and the centralisation of power as key features. Instead, studying the AfD’s efforts to adopt some elements of a mass-party organisation and its relatively decentralised decision-making underlines the importance of “movement-party” strategy, collective leadership, and internal democracy—concepts that are usually associated with Green and left-wing parties. Our analysis shows how the party’s organisation is essential for understanding its development more broadly as it reflects and reinforces sharp intra-party conflict. From this perspective, the case of the AfD sheds new light on the relationship between PRR party organisation and electoral success, indicating the importance of strong ties to parts of society over effective internal management as long as demand for anti-immigration parties is high. We conclude that even though AfD quickly built up a relatively inclusive organisational structure, the role of both its leadership and its rank-and-file is still a matter of controversy.","[{""name"": ""Anna-Sophie Heinze"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Manès Weisskircher"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.17645/pag.v9i4.5002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976254"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1004230"", ""10.1111/jcms.12920"", ""10.1093/pa/53.3.457"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.082103.104918"", ""10.1080/09644008.2014.982546"", ""10.1177/1354068815626604"", ""10.4324/9781315123851"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000538"", ""10.4324/9781003049258"", ""10.1177/1354068813511381"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58197-6_9"", ""10.5771/9783748908104"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-10638-6_14"", ""10.1017/gov.2021.33"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-10638-6_8"", ""10.4135/9781848608047.n24"", ""10.1080/01402382.2018.1490484"", ""10.1177/1354068820980304"", ""10.1145/3328529.3328562"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12487"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-23-3-367"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2021.1907897"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2020.1864001"", ""10.1177/1354068818754600"", ""10.1057/s41269-017-0057-x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198758631.001.0001"", ""10.1109/ICDMW.2016.0069"", ""10.1080/13608746.2018.1428889"", ""10.1080/23745118.2019.1602925"", ""10.1515/fjsb-2020-0040"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12859"", ""10.4324/9781315123851-8""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The technique aims to fix the logic of the network at an intermediate layer or at the last layer. NNrepair first uses fault localization to find potentially faulty network parameters (such as the weights) and then performs repair using constraint solving to apply small modifications to the parameters to remedy the defects. We present novel strategies to enable precise yet efficient repair such as inferring correctness specifications to act as oracles for intermediate layer repair, and generation of experts for each class. We demonstrate the technique in the context of three different scenarios: (1) Improving the overall accuracy of a model, (2) Fixing security vulnerabilities caused by poisoning of training data and (3) Improving the robustness of the network against adversarial attacks. Our evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 models shows that NNrepair can improve the accuracy by 45.56% points on poisoned data and 10.40% points on adversarial data. NNrepair also provides small improvement in the overall accuracy of models, without requiring new data or re-training.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Usman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Divya Gopinath"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Youcheng Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yannic Noller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Corina S.

Review of studies in Iberoamerica 2017-2020","El objetivo de este artículo es realizar una revisión de las investigaciones sobre desinformación en el ámbito de Iberoamérica entre 2017 y 2020. Para ello, se siguen las normas APA para revisiones y se analizan alrededor de 60 trabajos publicados en revistas indexadas de Iberoamérica, así como libros publicados sobre la temática. Los resultados se muestran agrupados en tres partes: En la primera se revisan los tres conceptos fundamentales relacionados con la desinformación: el propio término de desinformación, así como posverdad e infodemia. En la segunda, se estudian los principales productos de desinformación: noticias falsas, desórdenes informativos y bulos, atendiendo a sus tipos, temáticas, formatos, y canales. En la tercera parte se presentan las principales estrategias contra la desinformación, revisando los trabajos publicados de dos de ellas: la curación de contenidos y la verificación de hechos. Los autores más destacados sobre la temática a nivel cuantitativo son Magallón-Rosa con 6 trabajos, Ufarte-Ruiz con 4 y García-Marín con 3 trabajos. Asimismo, se pueden destacar por su análisis de la desinformación en el área de Iberoamérica los estudios de Palau-Sampio (2018), Vizoso y Vázquez-Herrero (2019) y Rodríguez-Pérez (2020), por su análisis de las tipologías de bulos el trabajo de Salaverría et al (2020) y por las propuestas sobre curación los trabajos de López-Borrull con colaboradores. Entre las conclusiones, se ha visto que el fenómeno de la desinformación es altamente poliédrico, pero que la sociedad tiene instrumentos para afrontarlo, como la curación y la verificación o fact cheking.","[{""name"": ""Javier Guallar"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Barcelona""]}, {""name"": ""Lluís Codina"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad Pompeu Fabra""]}, {""name"": ""Pere Freixa"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad Pompeu Fabra""]}, {""name"": ""Mario Pérez-Montoro"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Barcelona""]}]","[""10.31009/hipertext.net.2018.i17.07"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.13"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.12"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.08"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.sep.03"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.09"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.jul.17"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.jul.19"", ""10.20318/recs.2020.5531"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.02"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.jul.11"", ""10.3145/thinkepi.2018.33"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.jul.07"", ""10.1344/bid2020.44.5"", ""10.3145/thinkepi.2019.e13e07"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.nov.17"", ""10.5209/esmp.65246"", ""10.5209/esmp.59949"", ""10.26441/rc18.1-2019-a12"", ""10.54886/scire.v1i2.4446"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.jul.12"", ""10.6035/2174-0992.2017.13.1"", ""10.5209/hics.66267"", ""10.24137/raeic.6.12.5"", ""10.14198/medcom2020.11.2.4"", ""10.31009/hipertext.net.2018.i17.05"", ""10.4185/rlcs-2018-1312"", ""10.15847/obsobs12520181374"", ""10.20318/recs.2020.5446"", ""10.20318/recs.2020.5375"", ""10.7764/cdi.44.1418"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.06"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.14"", ""10.18566/comunica.n40.a05"", ""10.26441/rc19.1-2020-a14"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.may.15"", ""10.20318/recs.2020.5417"", ""10.36105/stx.2020n4.01"", ""10.33732/ixc/10/02Limite"", ""10.14198/medcom2020.11.2.3"", ""10.21134/mhcj.v0i9.267"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.jul.02"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.01"", ""10.15581/003.32.1.127-144""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/rego.12239,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Mainstreamed voluntary sustainability standards and their effectiveness: Evidence from the Honduran coffee sector,"AbstractVoluntary Sustainability Standards have become a popular private governance framework for more sustainable agri‐food value chains. Yet, amid increasing concerns over the decoupling of standards and practices, it is still unclear to what extent agricultural standard requirements are implemented on the ground, and what may account for such differential implementation. This study employs a novel dataset of 659 Honduran coffee producers to examine this puzzle, focusing on the most widely used standards in the coffee sector (Common Code for the Coffee Community, Fairtrade, Fairtrade/organic, UTZ Certified, and Rainforest Alliance). It first presents results on implementation and behavioral change, based on matched groups of certified and non‐certified farmers, for eight representative social and environmental sustainability practices. Analyzing determinants of implementation success, it finds that the stringency of rules – if they are known by farmers – and the level of farm‐gate prices are significantly correlated with farmers’ performance and lower levels of decoupling across a majority of indicators. These results speak to the importance of supporting small‐scale actors’ awareness of and financial capacity to comply with proposed sustainability rules.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Dietz"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science Westfälische Wilhelms‐Universität Münster Münster Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Janina Grabs"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science Westfälische Wilhelms‐Universität Münster Münster Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Estrella Chong"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science Westfälische Wilhelms‐Universität Münster Münster Germany""]}]","[""10.1080/00220388.2017.1327663"", ""10.5840/beq20112114"", ""10.1177/1070496510368506"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300190533.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.environ.33.013007.103754"", ""10.1080/01436590701336580"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv023"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.01.005"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7660.2008.00465.x"", ""10.1177/0170840612443622"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2277-6"", ""10.1080/21513732.2017.1316520"", ""10.5465/19416520.2012.684462"", ""10.2202/1469-3569.1338"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00527.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.09.006"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400231"", ""10.1086/662706"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7679.2011.00515.x"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/aa625e"", ""10.1016/j.dib.2018.05.048"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.03.026"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9237-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1622-5"", ""10.1162/glep.2006.6.2.55"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr029"", ""10.1007/s11077-015-9219-8"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.01.005"", ""10.2307/41166152"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.03.013"", ""10.1111/rego.12212"", ""10.1007/s10784-004-1010-9"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2009.01.002"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.1995.tb00139.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198268574.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-937X.00044"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.01.004"", ""10.18356/4109f32e-en"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0443-z"", ""10.1177/0007650315584303"", ""10.1093/biosci/biu038"", ""10.4337/9781784715410.00018"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2012.05.028"", ""10.1007/s13412-013-0118-z"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.12.004"", ""10.2307/1556362"", ""10.1111/joms.12144"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9485-2"", ""10.1177/0032329209338922"", ""10.1111/j.1564-9121.2007.00003.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139381840"", ""10.1108/02686900310482722"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.08.029"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2015.11.007"", ""10.1111/j.1564-913X.2015.00040.x"", ""10.1086/226550"", ""10.15173/glj.v3i1.1112"", ""10.1016/j.wdp.2017.11.004"", ""10.3390/su9020246"", ""10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.012003516.x"", ""10.5465/AMR.2006.19379621"", ""10.1111/j.1944-8287.2009.01065.x"", ""10.1080/0963818042000216794"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2008.10.001"", ""10.1177/0170840612443629"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00166.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.02.002"", ""10.1108/13598541111115356"", ""10.5751/ES-05595-180321"", ""10.2189/asqu.2010.55.3.361"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.12.001"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-6977-2"", ""10.1080/09614524.2012.696586"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.08.021"", ""10.1093/eurrag/29.2.271"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.08.027"", ""10.2307/2667086"", ""10.5465/amr.2012.0218"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2005.02.007""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Plant Science', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

While many have already argued for the potential benefits of employing co-creation in government strategies aiming to enhance public value, few have considered the implications of such a strategy for public leadership. Drawing on recent strands of theory on leadership and management, we specify how public leaders can use co-creation as a tool to achieve policy goals, and we illustrate this specification by showing how politicians and public and non-profit managers perform the public leadership of co-created public value in Gentofte, Denmark and Minneapolis‒St Paul, USA. The main proposition is that this kind of public leadership does not only involve a strategic effort to engage, inspire and mobilise actors with relevant governance assets – including legitimacy, authority and capabilities – but also to align their understandings of what is valuable for the public.","[{""name"": ""Eva Sørensen"", ""affiliation"": [""Roskilde University, Denmark and NORD University, Norway""]}, {""name"": ""John Bryson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Minnesota, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Barbara Crosby"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Minnesota, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-8500.2008.00593.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1200665"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-36431-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-36431-8_1"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2011.00306.x"", ""10.1177/0275074014532826"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00665.x"", ""10.1177/0891242414535468"", ""10.1111/puar.12432"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1192164"", ""10.1332/030557319X15613696433190"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1157744"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2006.02.001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00779.x"", ""10.2307/3311976"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-36431-8_16"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.01.004"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(96)00023-X"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2007.00379.x"", ""10.1177/0275074005282584"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.12134"", ""10.1177/0275074005282583"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00020"", ""10.3390/admsci9030051"", ""10.2307/2139277""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"
10.1093/polsoc/puab007,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,From crisis to reform? Exploring three post-COVID pathways,"Abstract Crises are often viewed as catalysts for change. The coronavirus disease crisis is no exception. In many policy sectors, proponents of reform see this global crisis both as a justification and an enabler of necessary change. Policy scholars have paid ample attention to this crisis-reform thesis. Empirical research suggests that these proponents of crisis-induced change should not be too optimistic. The question remains why some crises give rise to reform whereas so many others do not. This paper focuses on one particular factor that crisis researchers have identified as important. Crisis research suggests that the outcome of the meaning-making process—the efforts to impose a dominant frame on a population—shapes the prospects of postcrisis change. The paper offers three ideal-typical framing scripts, which researchers can use to study postcrisis trajectories.","[{""name"": ""Arjen Boin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Leiden University , Leiden, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Paul ‘t Hart"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht University School of Governance, Utrecht University , Utrecht, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1080/13501760151146487"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198783848.001.0001"", ""10.1002/rhc3.12193"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511756122"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72680-5"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5973.1996.tb00087.x"", ""10.1080/13501760802453221"", ""10.1111/j.0033-3298.2004.00390.x"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.12161"", ""10.1111/gove.12161"", ""10.1111/puar.12612"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2014.10.003"", ""10.1108/13563281011085466"", ""10.1017/S0007123499000083"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edz054"", ""10.4135/9781452243283"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.05.012"", ""10.1111/1468-0491.00215"", ""10.1093/wbro/8.2.143"", ""10.2307/422246"", ""10.1177/0038038596030002004"", ""10.1017/9781108860116"", ""10.1515/1944-4079.1108"", ""10.4269/ajtmh.20-0812"", ""10.1177/0093650210368256"", ""10.1017/9781108348997"", ""10.1177/0010414093025004002"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5973.2007.00505.x"", ""10.1332/030557320X15894563823146"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00005602"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puab017"", ""10.1080/25741292.2020.1813358"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.1995.tb00195.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5973.2009.00579.x"", ""10.1038/s41467-020-20435-2"", ""10.1177/1464884913519032"", ""10.1002/jclp.22270"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.00108"", ""10.1111/jssr.12677"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17531-3"", ""10.18278/epa.1.2.3"", ""10.1111/rego.12238"", ""10.1093/jhuman/huaa035"", ""10.1017/9781108551663"", ""10.1177/1742715020927111"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198831990.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2392337"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.00039"", ""10.4324/9781315778853-10"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5973.1993.tb00005.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2010.00372.x"", ""10.1080/10584609.2018.1478472"", ""10.1007/BF00141381"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.12259"", ""10.1002/epa2.1089""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/polp.12468,POLITICS & POLICY,0302 Political Science,Federalism and the polities of oil and gas pipelines in Canada (Alberta) and the United States (Texas),"AbstractIn recent years, pipeline policy has been a significant and controversial issue in Canadian politics. In the United States, pipeline projects to increase transportation capacity for Texas oil have also been high on the energy agenda, but they have not permeated national politics like in Canada. In fact, new pipelines to transport oil and gas out of Texas' Permian Basin have multiplied without generating serious national controversy or intergovernmental conflicts. This article develops an explanation for these distinct political outcomes in Canada and the United States. The article identifies three factors that have contributed to pipeline projects triggering serious intergovernmental conflicts in Canada around Alberta oil but not in the United States in relation to the transportation of Texas oil: (1) pipeline structures and the regulatory framework for oil and gas; (2) the ideological and political support for, or opposition to, oil and gas development; and (3) the level of Indigenous opposition to pipeline projects.Related ArticlesAsh, John S. 2011. “Radiation or Riots: Risk Perception in Nuclear Power Decision Making and Deliberative Approaches to Resolving Stakeholder Conflict.” Politics &amp; Policy 39(2): 317–44. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747‐1346.2010.00237.x.Mahafza, Zachary, Jonathan M.

10.1093/isq/sqaa044,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Demanding Truth: The Global Transitional Justice Network and the Creation of Truth Commissions,"AbstractSince 1970, scores of states have established truth commissions to document political violence. Despite their prevalence and potential consequence, the question of why commissions are adopted in some contexts, but not in others, is not well understood. Relatedly, little is known about why some commissions possess strong investigative powers while others do not. I argue that the answer to both questions lies with domestic and international civil society actors, who are connected by a global transitional justice (TJ) network and who share the burden of guiding commission adoption and design. I propose that commissions are more likely to be adopted where network members can leverage information and moral authority over governments. I also suggest that commissions are more likely to possess strong powers where international experts, who steward TJ best practices, advise governments. I evaluate these expectations by analyzing two datasets in the novel Varieties of Truth Commissions Project, interviews with representatives from international non-governmental organizations, interviews with Guatemalan non-governmental organization leaders, a focus group with Argentinian human rights advocates, and a focus group at the International Center for Transitional Justice. My results indicate that network members share the burden—domestic members are essential to commission adoption, while international members are important for strong commission design.","[{""name"": ""Kelebogile Zvobgo"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Southern California and College of William & Mary""]}]","[""10.1111/ips.12024"", ""10.1080/13510340801991114"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2015.1093887"", ""10.1080/1475483032000132999"", ""10.1093/ijtj/ijt025"", ""10.1017/S1537592719000756"", ""10.1177/0010836712454273"", ""10.1353/jod.1993.0004"", ""10.1177/0010414012463905"", ""10.1080/14754830903530326"", ""10.1093/ijtj/ijx011"", ""10.1177/0022343307075124"", ""10.1177/0022002708326745"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511607011"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000070"", ""10.1177/0022002706287115"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080247"", ""10.1017/S0003055401000119"", ""10.1007/s11558-013-9175-z"", ""10.1093/icc/11.2.355"", ""10.1353/hrq.2012.0058"", ""10.1177/0022343311431600"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00621.x"", ""10.1093/ijtj/iju003"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000259"", ""10.1177/0022343309353108"", ""10.1086/682150"", ""10.1093/ijtj/ijx015"", ""10.1177/0022002716655441"", ""10.1177/0022002711431417"", ""10.1007/s11558-012-9146-9"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001242"", ""10.1080/01436590701806848"", ""10.1177/0022343307082067"", ""10.1515/9781400832033-009"", ""10.1080/14754835.2013.824277"", ""10.18352/erlacs.9645"", ""10.1177/0022343310382205"", ""10.1177/0022343318784101"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777"", ""10.1163/9789004479579_008"", ""10.1023/B:GEJO.0000033585.03206.2c"", ""10.1177/0022343307078953"", ""10.1353/sof.2006.0036"", ""10.1017/S0922156505002827"", ""10.1177/0022343310394696"", ""10.1093/ijtj/ijr036"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080143"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000550"", ""10.1515/9781400824465"", ""10.1177/0032321717715397"", ""10.1080/14754835.2018.1543017"", ""10.1080/14754835.2020.1786358""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This study contributes to theory development by exploring deliberative practices in frontline organizations and their implications for decision-making. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnographic study in three Danish child welfare agencies, the analysis clarifies the multiple purposes of deliberation in everyday practice and shows how deliberation is enabled and structured by formalized and informal deliberative organizational routines. Findings show that deliberation may influence individual decision-making or amount to collective decision-making. Depending on how deliberative organizational routines are enacted, deliberation may serve to enhance professional judgment, ensure appropriate justification for decisions, and alleviate uncertainty and emotional strain. Yet, while deliberation represents a productive form of collective coping, deliberative routines may also obscure transparency and reify dysfunctional group dynamics. A conceptual framework is developed to support further research into the purposes, practices, and implications of deliberation across diverse street-level contexts.","[{""name"": ""Anne Mette Møller"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}]","[""10.1093/jopart/muy083"", ""10.1080/01900692.2011.635278"", ""10.1080/10967494.2016.1235641"", ""10.1002/car.2485"", ""10.51952/9781447345527"", ""10.3998/mpub.15149"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq093"", ""10.1177/00953990022019470"", ""10.1287/orsc.2.1.40"", ""10.4135/9781452230153"", ""10.1080/2156857X.2018.1426547"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9515.2011.00766.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226206868.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bcq074"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198759485.003.0002"", ""10.1287/orsc.1100.0612"", ""10.2307/3556620"", ""10.1093/jopart/mun034"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2206.2010.00724.x"", ""10.1111/cfs.12100"", ""10.1108/QROM-09-2012-1100"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut037"", ""10.4337/9781786437631.00033"", ""10.1086/680319"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bct138"", ""10.1177/0730888411406824"", ""10.4324/9781315704852"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.05.038"", ""10.1111/puar.12952"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.841980"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02524.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199793358.003.0007"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.854401"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00650.x"", ""10.4337/9781786437631.00022"", ""10.1080/13691457.2015.1030365"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw070"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy002"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02131.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muz019"", ""10.1111/padm.12598"", ""10.1111/padm.12357"", ""10.1111/spol.12550"", ""10.4337/9781786437631.00034"", ""10.1111/1467-9930.00089"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024272"", ""10.1093/jpo/joz003"", ""10.1111/puar.12719"", ""10.1093/jpo/jov002"", ""10.9783/9780812209846"", ""10.1111/puar.12837"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy018"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199603831.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14719037.2017.1299199"", ""10.1177/0095399718760587"", ""10.1177/0095399718761651"", ""10.1177/0018726706073194"", ""10.1177/1350508407074224"", ""10.1111/rego.12101"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024289"", ""10.4135/9781446278925.n4"", ""10.1177/0275074015577110"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy024"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.841978"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu056"", ""10.4135/9781446278925"", ""10.4159/9780674981423"", ""10.1111/padm.12340""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

We reflect on this question in the context of governmental responses to Covid‐19 in four steps. First, we argue that blunders occur because of systemic weaknesses that stimulate poor policy choices. Second, we review and assess the performance of governments on Covid‐19 across a range of advanced democracies. Third, in the light of these comparisons we argue that the UK system of governance has proved itself vulnerable to failure at the time when its citizens most needed it. Finally, we outline an agenda of reform that seeks to rectify structural weaknesses of that governance capacity.","[{""name"": ""Jen Gaskell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gerry Stoker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Will Jennings"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Devine"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Health Professions'],['General Health Professions'],"[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12448,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Bring in the experts? Citizen preferences for independent experts in political decision-making processes,"AbstractDo citizens welcome the involvement of independent experts in politics? Theoretical and empirical work so far provides conflicting answers to this question. On the one hand, citizens may demand expert involvement in political decision‐making processes in order to ensure efficient and effective governance solutions. On the other hand, citizens can be distrustful of experts and reject the unaccountable and non‐transparent nature of expert‐based governance. This note investigates citizen preferences for the involvement of experts in different stages of political processes and across ‘hard’ and ‘easy’ political issues. Results show that, in the absence of explicit output information, respondents prefer independent experts over national elected representatives in the policy design and implementation stages, across political issues. For the crucial stage of decision making, respondents show no difference in their evaluation of processes that delegate decisions to experts or to elected representatives, with the exception of environmental policy, where expert decision making is preferred. These findings are relevant for ongoing discussions on how to incorporate independent experts in political decision making in a way that citizens find legitimate and on how to address increased citizen dissatisfaction with the representative democratic functions performed by political parties, governments and politicians.","[{""name"": ""ERI BERTSOU"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zurich Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1111/1475-6765.12338"", ""10.4324/9780429342165"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1242046"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000538"", ""10.2307/1955648"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.03.006"", ""10.4324/9780429342165-15"", ""10.1177/0032321719844122"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000508"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12191"", ""10.1007/s10584-017-2015-z"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12000"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613722"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw026"", ""10.1080/01402382.2020.1778917"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.30"", ""10.1007/1-4020-3754-6_1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659935"", ""10.1017/S104909651100165X"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12271"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12217"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12234"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006554"", ""10.4324/9780429342165-4"", ""10.1007/s11186-006-9012-y"", ""10.1002/gch2.201600008"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12358"", ""10.1515/9781400822782""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

In some cases, the risk of democratization to authoritarian incumbents is so low that ending authoritarianism might not mean exiting power at all. This article develops a unified theory of authoritarian-led democratization under conditions of relatively low incumbent risk. We argue that the party strength of the authoritarian incumbent is the most pivotal factor in authoritarian-led democratization. When incumbent party strength has been substantial enough to give incumbent authoritarian politicians significant electoral victory confidence, nondemocratic regimes have pursued reversible democratic experiments that eventually culminated in stable, thriving democracies. Evidence from Europe's first wave of democratization and more recent democratic transitions in Taiwan and Ghana illustrate how party strength has underpinned authoritarian-led democratization across the world and across modern history.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Beatty Riedl"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA;""]}, {""name"": ""Dan Slater"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA;""]}, {""name"": ""Joseph Wong"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2S2, Canada;""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Ziblatt"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA;""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511843686"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804960"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174657"", ""10.1017/S0022278X12000365"", ""10.56021/9780801856501"", ""10.2307/2010527"", ""10.1515/9781400862030.139"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625626"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510052"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.1017/S1598240800006275"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.115"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613388"", ""10.1017/S1537592718001044"", ""10.1353/jod.2001.0026"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1017/9781108560566"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000012"", ""10.2307/4150169"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815362"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451"", ""10.1017/S0022278X0005535X"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.08.018"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107045484"", ""10.1017/9781108560566.007"", ""10.1007/s12116-013-9144-9"", ""10.1515/9781588261625"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760891"", ""10.1017/jea.2017.26"", ""10.1017/S1537592713002090"", ""10.1017/9781108560566.011"", ""10.1177/0010414012463902"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139519076"", ""10.1017/S0022278X03004269"", ""10.4324/9780203893111"", ""10.1017/9781139030335"", ""10.1017/9781108560566.012""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

On the Relationship Between Conspiratorial Thinking and Political Orientations,"While research on conspiracy theories and those who believe them has recently undergone a renaissance, there still exists a great deal of uncertainty about the measurement of conspiratorial beliefs and orientations, and the consequences of a conspiratorial mindset for expressly political attitudes and behaviors. We first demonstrate, using data from the 2012 American National Election Study, that beliefs in a variety of specific conspiracy theories are simultaneously, but differentially, the product of both a general tendency toward conspiratorial thinking and left/right political orientations. Next, we employ unique data including a general measure of conspiratorial thinking to explore the predictors of specific conspiracy beliefs. We find that partisan and ideological self-identifications are more important than any other variable in predicting ‘birther’ beliefs, while conspiratorial thinking is most important in predicting conspiracy beliefs about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.","[{""name"": ""Adam M. Enders"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Steven M. Smallpage"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert N.

Such models require costly manual labeling of documents. In this paper, we introduce active learning, a framework in which data to be labeled by human coders are not chosen at random but rather targeted in such a way that the required amount of data to train a machine learning model can be minimized. We study the benefits of active learning using text data examples. We perform simulation studies that illustrate conditions where active learning can reduce the cost of labeling text data. We perform these simulations on three corpora that vary in size, document length, and domain. We find that in cases where the document class of interest is not balanced, researchers can label a fraction of the documents one would need using random sampling (or “passive” learning) to achieve equally performing classifiers. We further investigate how varying levels of intercoder reliability affect the active learning procedures and find that even with low reliability, active learning performs more efficiently than does random sampling.","[{""name"": ""Blake Miller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fridolin Linder"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Walter R.

Hygienic Borders and Deterrence Humanitarianism during Covid-19","Abstract This article investigates how the security-humanitarian rationale that underpins migration governmentality has been restructured by and inflected in light of hygienic-sanitary borders which enforce racialised confinement in the name of both migrants' and citizens' safety from infection by Covid-19. Focusing on the politics of migration containment along EUrope's frontiers, examining in particular border reinforcements carried out by Italy, Malta and Greece, we interrogate how the pandemic has been exploited to enact deterrence through hygienic-sanitary border enforcements. These enforcements are underpinned by an ambivalent security-humanitarian narrative that crafts migrants as subjects who cannot be protected by EU member states from the pandemic if allowed inside, and, at once, as potential vehicles of contagion - ‘Corona spreaders’ - and thus as dangers on a bacterial-hygienic level. Our article demonstrates that these EUropean border measures are more than temporary responses to an unprecedented health crisis. Rather, the pandemic has been seized as an opportunity to strengthen existing deterrence measures and hamper migrants' access to asylum through biopolitical and spatial tactics that aim to restructure the border regime. While emphasising the historical trajectories and continuities underwriting these current developments, we contend that the pandemic functions as an accelerator of dynamics of migrant incarceration and containment.","[{""name"": ""Martina Tazzioli"", ""affiliation"": [""Goldsmiths College, SE14 6NW, London, United Kingdom""]}, {""name"": ""Maurice Stierl"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Sheffield, Northumberland Road, Sheffield, S10 2TU, United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1111/maq.12139"", ""10.9783/9780812291728"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1300297"", ""10.1177/03058298040330020101"", ""10.1080/09502386.2014.891630"", ""10.1111/anti.12337"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1361543"", ""10.1177/0967010608088774"", ""10.1525/california/9780520271166.001.0001"", ""10.22439/fs.v0i18.4654"", ""10.1080/23337486.2017.1375624"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00263"", ""10.1177/0263775818762132"", ""10.1177/1354066116661227"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2011.01.005"", ""10.1177/0309132512460903"", ""10.1111/ips.12076"", ""10.1177/0263775819891167"", ""10.1177/0967010618796670"", ""10.1177/0263775820925487"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2019.1573661"", ""10.4324/9781351270489"", ""10.1111/anti.12320"", ""10.1093/ips/olz014"", ""10.1177/0263775820925492"", ""10.1525/9780520950535"", ""10.1080/14650045.2020.1728743"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198747024.001.0001"", ""10.1111/geoj.12119""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/gov.2020.1,GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION,0302 Political Science,Who Supports Citizens Selected by Lot to be the Main Policymakers? A Study of French Citizens,"AbstractDespite their multiplication over the last 15 years, studies on the support for assemblies composed of citizens selected by lot are rare and the few that exist analyse citizens’ attitudes towards such mini-publics as consultative bodies associated with traditional representative institutions. In this article, we examine support for citizens selected by lot as new policymakers who take the most important political decisions instead of political representatives. We contrast support for this radical democratic innovation with support for two other reforms that increase citizen participation: generic support for a greater involvement of citizens in policymaking, and specific support for citizen-initiated referendums. The goal is to understand whether the drivers of support for citizens selected by lot overlap or differ from the drivers of support for other forms of citizen participation. We rely upon data from the 2017 French Election Study.","[{""name"": ""Camille Bedock"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jean-Benoit Pilet"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0003055410000298"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198733607.001.0001"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.29"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659935"", ""10.1177/0032321719843967"", ""10.2307/2082425"", ""10.3917/rfsp.685.0873"", ""10.3989/ris.2012.01.29"", ""10.1007/BF00989890"", ""10.4324/9780203969311"", ""10.2307/2998592"", ""10.1080/01402380903065256"", ""10.1177/0192512114544068"", ""10.4324/9780203713181"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199567843.001.0001"", ""10.3917/nqf.243.0036"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199268436.001.0001"", ""10.17645/pag.v7i2.1900"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12191"", ""10.2307/2111186"", ""10.1086/267373"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2009.12.004"", ""10.1177/0032321716672224"", ""10.1093/0199264996.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613722"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.02.012"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.03.006"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203155196"", ""10.1057/s41253-017-0045-6"", ""10.1177/1532673X7900700207"", ""10.1007/s11133-017-9367-6"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000161"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139600002"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12021"", ""10.5477/cis/reis.154.83"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1057/fp.2014.6"", ""10.1177/1478929918807713"", ""10.1093/0198295685.003.0003"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1242046"", ""10.1057/s41253-017-0043-8"", ""10.1177/0032329218789890"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609848"", ""10.3917/puf.tiber.2017.03"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198779582.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0198295685.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1177/1065912907304108"", ""10.5129/001041520X15670823829196""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Given that core values shape subsequent political predispositions, as well as the demonstrated asymmetry of elite polarization, this article hypothesizes that egalitarianism and moral traditionalism moderate the relationship between ideology and partisanship in that the latter relationship will have increased over time only among individuals who maintain conservative value orientations. An analysis of pooled American National Election Studies surveys from 1988 to 2012 supports this hypothesis. The results enhance scholarly understanding of the role of core values in shaping mass belief systems and testify to the asymmetric nature and mass public reception of elite cues among liberals and conservatives.","[{""name"": ""Robert N.

We find that while punctuated gradualism favors tailored responses to pandemic management it is weaker when coordination and resourcing are to be undertaken during non-crisis situations and that, while the level of cooperation among Canadian jurisdictions has progressively increased over the years, policy is still almost exclusively handled at the federal, provincial and territorial levels. Furthermore, the model appears to have critical ‘blind spots’ in terms of vulnerable communities that do not emerge as such until after a crisis hits.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Riccardo Migone"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and Public Administration, JOR 724, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt1w0df2t"", ""10.2307/825812"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1783790"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1787628"", ""10.1080/14461242.2014.11081968"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00216.x"", ""10.3138/9781487513450"", ""10.1515/9780773548718"", ""10.4161/hv.8.1.17622"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.05.031"", ""10.1016/S1449-4035(02)70001-5"", ""10.3138/9781442668034"", ""10.4324/9781315111247-1"", ""10.1080/15265160903197598"", ""10.1515/9780773596290-005"", ""10.4324/9781351263047-2"", ""10.2307/3550225"", ""10.3201/eid1201.051254"", ""10.3109/00365548.2012.749423"", ""10.1017/S0143814X99000203"", ""10.1007/s11558-018-9303-x"", ""10.1515/9780773566002"", ""10.1017/S0047279406000110"", ""10.1093/jhmas/jrl042"", ""10.3138/9781442653320-004"", ""10.1007/BF03403782"", ""10.1017/S0008423920000311"", ""10.1111/j.1750-2659.2010.00184.x"", ""10.1177/0010414004271080"", ""10.1007/s11069-019-03584-6"", ""10.1057/9780230289635_2"", ""10.3138/9781487577711"", ""10.1017/S0008423920000281"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1783793"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.02.009"", ""10.3390/pathogens5040066"", ""10.3138/9781442675445"", ""10.1186/1471-2334-11-90"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2015.04.006"", ""10.1111/j.1754-7121.1980.tb00043.x"", ""10.12927/hcq.2007.18839"", ""10.1515/9780773575332"", ""10.1515/9780773576858"", ""10.1007/s11077-020-09381-4"", ""10.24124/c677/20151282"", ""10.1016/j.ajic.2009.10.002""]",['Health Professions'],['General Health Professions'],"[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

10.1093/ia/iiaa165,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,The party scene: new directions for political party research in foreign policy analysis,"Abstract Research on political parties and foreign policy has grown in recent years in response to disciplinary and real-world changes. But party research still bears the imprint of earlier scepticism about the role of parties. The result is scholarship which is disaggregated, which avoids difficult cases for parties, and which has focused more on showing that parties matter relative to structural accounts of foreign policy-making. This article takes stock of recent research on political parties, party politics and their role in foreign policy-making. We argue that it is time for party research not only to embrace the question of whether parties matter but also how, when and where they matter. This requires a move away from most-likely cases and the realist foil towards an embrace of the complexity of party positions. Building on International Relations, comparative politics and foreign policy analysis scholarship, we suggest four avenues deserving of greater scholarly focus: 1) ideological multidimensionality; 2) parties as organizations and the role of entrepreneurs; 3) parties as transnational foreign policy actors; and 4) the interaction between parties and the changing global order. We propose how these literatures can help identify new research questions, contribute to theory development and help define scope conditions. This will hopefully help scholars establish benchmarks for judging the efficacy of parties in foreign policy-making.","[{""name"": ""Stephanie C Hofmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benjamin Martill"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz194,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,The institutionalization of the Indo-Pacific: problems and prospects,"Abstract Although the term ‘Indo-Pacific’ has become popular in the foreign policy discourse of some countries, we have yet to see any significant institution-building in the Indo-Pacific region. Borrowing insights from functional institutionalism and political leadership studies of international regimes, we introduce a ‘leadership–institution’ model to explore the problems and prospects of institutionalizing the Indo-Pacific. Through a comparative case study of the institutionalization of the Asia–Pacific vs the Indo-Pacific, we argue that two crucial factors contributed to the slow institutionalization of the Indo-Pacific as a regional system in world politics: the lack of ideational leadership from an epistemic community and the weak executive leadership from a powerful state. While ideational leaders can help states identify and expand common interests in cooperation, executive leadership will facilitate states to overcome operational obstacles in cooperation, such as the ‘collective action’ problem and the ‘relative gains’ concern. The future of institution-building in the Indo-Pacific will depend on whether and how these two leadership roles are played by scholars and states in the region. In the conclusion, we discuss the challenges of institutionalizing the Indo-Pacific and highlight China as a wild card in the future of Indo-Pacific regionalism.","[{""name"": ""Kai He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Huiyun Feng"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Demography']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)]]"

A two-wave questionnaire was distributed to 400 employees. In the first wave, the questionnaire was used to collect data on participants’ perceptions of perceived injustice and organizational politics. After two weeks, the second wave of data collection was conducted by sending another questionnaire to the same respondents to collect data on their organizational and interpersonal deviance.FindingsEmpirical findings revealed that perceived interactional injustice results in interpersonal deviance, and perceived distributive and procedural injustice results in organizational deviance. Moreover, the direct relationship between perceived injustice and deviant behaviors was stronger when the perception of politics factor was high.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first to test the detrimental effect of perception of politics on deviance in a public organization in Pakistan.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Nisar Khattak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roxanne Zolin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Noor Muhammad"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0149206312455243"", ""10.1007/BF01048015"", ""10.5465/amr.1999.2202131"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.1.52"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.91.3.653"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01972"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1999)25:4<281::AID-AB4>3.0.CO;2-J"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.85.3.349"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.2.410"", ""10.1287/orsc.4.3.352"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135156"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.43670894"", ""10.1108/PR-09-2018-0368"", ""10.1006/obhd.2001.2958"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.386"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.425"", ""10.1037/a0025208"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199269136.003.0001"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.90.6.1241"", ""10.1108/PR-07-2018-0241"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.02.080176.002003"", ""10.1177/0149206307309260"", ""10.2307/256422"", ""10.1108/PR-08-2018-0290"", ""10.1177/002224378802500207"", ""10.2307/2092623"", ""10.1006/obhd.1993.1004"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.1.228"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.44.3.513"", ""10.1016/S0001-8791(02)00048-9"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.74.2.273"", ""10.2307/2090864"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00664.x"", ""10.1002/job.563"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.91.1.126"", ""10.1177/014920639702300502"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2006.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2010.09.009"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1937-2"", ""10.1007/s10869-012-9269-2"", ""10.2307/256728"", ""10.1002/job.2280"", ""10.2307/2391032"", ""10.2307/2667109"", ""10.2307/256489"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-11-2017-0140"", ""10.1037/a0028085"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.4.1159"", ""10.1007/BF01419445"", ""10.2307/256591"", ""10.1037/apl0000040"", ""10.5465/amr.1996.9602161571"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.78.4.679"", ""10.5465/ame.1995.9503133495"", ""10.1108/02683940310465036"", ""10.1080/1528008X.2019.1619498"", ""10.1037/str0000080"", ""10.2307/20159586"", ""10.1037/a0036464"", ""10.2307/256693"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-031413-091225"", ""10.1016/S0749-5978(02)00036-5"", ""10.1037/apl0000311"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.3.529"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.82.3.434"", ""10.1177/1558689806292430"", ""10.1007/BF02198075"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2009.01138.x"", ""10.1108/MD-09-2017-0860""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Less attention, however, has been paid to how political struggles can also center upon issues of who can or should feel what emotion and whose feelings matter. Precisely, we theorize a distributive politics of emotion that can manifest in three general forms, all of which have their own properties and logics of contestation. The first centers on emotional obligations, understood as an actor's duties to feel and express specific emotions. The second concerns emotional entitlements, or the rights an actor enjoys to either feel or not feel certain emotions. And the third involves hierarchies of emotional deference, that is, the varying degrees of priority accorded to different actors’ feelings. We illustrate how the politics of emotions can unfold on the international stage by looking at developments in the so-called history problem within Sino-Japanese relations.","[{""name"": ""Karl Gustafsson"", ""affiliation"": [""Stockholm University, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Todd H Hall"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford, UK""]}]","[""10.1080/13439006.2015.1123132"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000337"", ""10.1093/ips/olx024"", ""10.1515/9780748691142"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9265-x"", ""10.1177/1755088219830428"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226304007.003.0006"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139109437"", ""10.4324/9781315091822-3"", ""10.1093/ia/iiaa054"", ""10.1080/13576270410001652550"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897559.013"", ""10.1080/09512748.2010.495999"", ""10.1162/016228800560327"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840470"", ""10.1080/10357823.2013.852156"", ""10.1080/09512748.2014.970053"", ""10.1177/0047117819864410"", ""10.1177/0010836720966376"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000144"", ""10.1111/pops.12608"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511770463"", ""10.4324/9780429331220-9"", ""10.1086/227049"", ""10.1525/9780520951853"", ""10.1080/21624887.2014.921454"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316154670"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000232"", ""10.1080/00201748908602185"", ""10.4324/9780429331220-7"", ""10.1093/isq/sqz018"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-041916-020042"", ""10.1177/0160597618802646"", ""10.1111/amet.12035"", ""10.1177/1755088218824349"", ""10.4324/9780429331220"", ""10.1017/S175297191400030X"", ""10.1177/0967010614552549"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794349.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592704040459"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050058"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000244"", ""10.1080/714005337"", ""10.4159/9780674249578"", ""10.2307/2645631"", ""10.4324/9781315749716"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190878900.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108658058"", ""10.1162/002081800551109"", ""10.4324/9780203644317"", ""10.4324/9780203983690"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2011.01049.x"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.9.1.3"", ""10.4324/9780429331220-8"", ""10.1080/09512740601133195"", ""10.1080/09512748.2014.970049"", ""10.1177/1754073911410747"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511627224"", ""10.1017/S0260210598001028"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612183"", ""10.1057/9781137301239_2"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We develop a theoretical framework suggesting two mechanisms influencing refugees’ preferences. First, refugees’ lived experiences in their country of origin prior to displacement and in their new host country create a trade-off in feelings of being anchored to their origin or host country. Second, firsthand exposure to traumas of war provides some refugees with a sense of competency and self-efficacy, leading them to prefer to return home. We test these relationships with data from a survey among Syrian refugees hosted in Lebanon. We find refugees exposed to violence during the war have a sense of attachment to Syria and are most likely to prefer return. Refugees who have developed a detachment from Syria or an attachment to Lebanon are less likely to prefer return.","[{""name"": ""FATEN GHOSN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""TIFFANY S.

10.1093/isq/sqz077,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,The Chilling Effect of International Investment Disputes: Limited Challenges to State Sovereignty,"AbstractDespite suggestions that international investment disputes impose a chilling effect on governments’ autonomy to set regulatory policies, we lack empirical confirmation of the phenomenon and what explains its heterogeneity across countries. Using a novel dataset of nine anti-smoking regulations in ninety-two countries from 1973 to 2016, I confirm the presence of the chilling effect, but also its boundaries. I show that countries have been significantly slower in implementing two anti-smoking policies formally challenged under investment law, while the adoption of seven undisputed regulations in this issue area continued unimpeded. Qualitative evidence from respondent and third-party governments confirm the policy-specificity of the chilling effect and show that both developed and developing countries were affected by the chill, albeit differently. By providing the first empirical confirmation of a regulatory chill and by defining its limited scope in one of the most high-profiled international investment disputes to date, my findings indicate that, even though multinational corporations can constrain state sovereignty, their effects are not necessarily expansive or indefinite.","[{""name"": ""Carolina Moehlecke"", ""affiliation"": [""Fundação Getulio Vargas & the University of Texas at Austin""]}]","[""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490257"", ""10.1017/S0020818311000099"", ""10.1017/S0043887113000324"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199286546.003.0020"", ""10.1093/jwelb/jwn003"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0343.2007.00317.x"", ""10.2202/1469-3569.1011"", ""10.1111/1521-9488.00225"", ""10.1177/0002716204272516"", ""10.1515/9781685853716"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00452.x"", ""10.1093/icsidreview/sit015"", ""10.1093/jleo/16.2.334"", ""10.3998/mpub.3425019"", ""10.1017/S000305541500057X"", ""10.1086/702231"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000903"", ""10.1561/100.00008068"", ""10.1177/1532440015596088"", ""10.1162/002081800551352"", ""10.1080/13563460500204241"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001241"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12355"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000212"", ""10.1007/s00038-014-0585-3"", ""10.54648/JOIA2007035"", ""10.1177/1065912907313077"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00295.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00218.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00346.x"", ""10.1017/S0043887113000312"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001078"", ""10.1093/jiel/jgq048"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559143"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139043809.034"", ""10.2307/j.ctt227270j"", ""10.1093/jnlids/idv038"", ""10.1353/book.72244""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000387,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,The Big Reveal: COVID-19 and Globalization's Great Transformations,"AbstractAnalysis of the post-COVID world tends to gravitate to one of two poles. For some, the pandemic is a crisis that will reshuffle the decks, producing a fundamental reordering of global politics. For others, the basic principles of the international order are likely to remain much the same, driven largely by the emerging bipolar system between the US and China. We find both narratives dissatisfying, as the former overinterprets the causal role of the pandemic itself, while the latter underappreciates the critical ways in which global politics have been transformed beyond the state-centered system of the Cold War. We argue instead that the pandemic exposes underlying trends already at work and forces scholars to open the aperture on how we study globalization. Most centrally, we contend that globalization needs to be seen not just as a distributional game of winners and losers but rather a more profoundly transformational game that reshapes identities, redefines channels of power and authority, and generates new sites for contentious politics. We draw on emerging work to sketch out a theoretical frame for thinking about the politics of globalization, and assess some of the key policy arenas where COVID-19 is accelerating the transformative effects of globalization. In so doing, we suggest a roadmap to a post-pandemic research agenda for studying global markets that more fully captures these transformations and their implications for world politics.","[{""name"": ""Kathleen R.

10.1111/1758-5899.12865,GLOBAL POLICY,0302 Political Science,The Adjustment of International Institutions to Global Power Shifts: A Framework for Analysis,"AbstractAs powers such as China and India rise, and powers such as the US or the UK decline, international institutions such as the United Nations Security Council, the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund come under pressure to adapt to new power realities. In the wake of global power shifts, both emerging and established powers may challenge the institutional status quo. Contrary to what most power transition and power shift theories assume, challengers do not always draw on power bargaining to pursue institutional adjustment. In some issue areas, they do, but in others they employ alternative strategies including strategic cooptation, rhetorical coercion and principled persuasion. In order to contribute to a better understanding of institutional adjustments to global power shifts, the introduction to this special issue theorizes these various strategies. First, we conceptualize power bargaining, strategic cooptation, rhetorical coercion and principled persuasion as distinct strategies for institutional adjustment. Second, we elaborate on the conditions under which challengers choose particular strategies. Third, we specify the conditions under which challengers are able to achieve institutional adaptation through a particular strategy. Finally, we discuss broader implications for the future of the international order and the management of global power shifts.","[{""name"": ""Andreas Kruck"", ""affiliation"": [""LMU Munich""]}, {""name"": ""Bernhard Zangl"", ""affiliation"": [""LMU Munich""]}]","[""10.1017/S1537592709090033"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00328"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12348"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09352-2"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00225"", ""10.1093/cjip/pop014"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12167"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12767"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000019"", ""10.1177/1354066118768871"", ""10.1017/S002081830909002X"", ""10.2307/2657608"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0343.2006.00160.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511664267"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12050"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12643"", ""10.1017/S1537592709090069"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.927387"", ""10.1093/ia/iix241"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139855990"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12041"", ""10.1177/1354066107074284"", ""10.1017/S1752971919000101"", ""10.1177/0022002715576571"", ""10.2307/2539020"", ""10.1017/9781316570463"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-09151-5"", ""10.1007/s11558-014-9188-2"", ""10.1177/1354066104045542"", ""10.2307/1148580"", ""10.1177/0002716207311699"", ""10.7591/9781501732058"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226351841.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316460191.001"", ""10.1162/002081800551109"", ""10.2307/1912531"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1162/002081801551414"", ""10.1177/1354066109342922"", ""10.2307/2539149"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00044"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4711.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11558-012-9161-x"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12178"", ""10.1017/9781316856444"", ""10.1007/s11558-016-9246-z"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198819974.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

While prior studies have focused on partisan motivations, we demonstrate that some individuals circulate hostile rumors because they wish to unleash chaos to “burn down” the entire political order in the hope they gain status in the process. To understand this psychology, we theorize and measure a novel psychological state, the Need for Chaos, emerging in an interplay of social marginalization and status-oriented personalities. Across eight studies of individuals living in the United States, we show that this need is a strong predictor of motivations to share hostile political rumors, even after accounting for partisan motivations, and can help illuminate differences and commonalities in the frustrations of both historically privileged and marginalized groups. To stem the tide of hostility on social media, the present findings suggest that real-world policy solutions are needed to address social frustrations in the United States.","[{""name"": ""MICHAEL BANG PETERSEN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""MATHIAS OSMUNDSEN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""KEVIN ARCENEAUX"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0963721420917703"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2818659"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2018.11.006"", ""10.1515/auk-2021-0019"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2018.01.004"", ""10.2307/2937956"", ""10.1520/JFS14732J"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000290"", ""10.1111/josi.12021"", ""10.1111/ajps.12234"", ""10.1111/pops.12587"", ""10.1111/ajps.12616"", ""10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.586"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.52.5.907"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.211"", ""10.1037/pspi0000033"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.42.1.116"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2010.09.003"", ""10.1525/9780520342057"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2014.01.016"", ""10.1037/pspp0000013"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3131087"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.670"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2013.09.003"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000885"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.61.3.204"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0701_5"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0228882"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1038/s41586-021-03344-2"", ""10.1073/pnas.0904312106"", ""10.1037/a0030398"", ""10.31389/lseppr.6"", ""10.1177/09567976211031847"", ""10.1177/0956797620922476"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102138"", ""10.1207/s15327752jpa5101_6"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0064"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1177/0146167202239051"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.46"", ""10.7910/DVN/1SU7J4""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055421000186,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Studying Policy Design Quality in Comparative Perspective,"This article is a first attempt to systematically examine policy design and its influence on policy effectiveness in a comparative perspective. We begin by providing a novel concept and measure of policy design. Our Average Instrument Diversity (AID) index captures whether governments tend to reuse the same policy instruments and instrument combinations or produce policy solutions that are carefully tailored to the policy problem at hand. Second, we demonstrate that our AID index is a valid and reliable measure of policy design quality with a strong explanatory power for the outcome variables tested. Analyzing the composition of environmental policy portfolios in 21 OECD countries, we show that higher levels of AID are positively associated with a country’s policy effectiveness in environmental matters. Based on this finding, we analyze, in a third step, the factors that lead countries to adopt more or less diverse policy portfolios. We find that the policy design quality is significantly improved when policy makers are not bound by high institutional constraints and, more importantly, are backed by well-equipped bureaucracies.","[{""name"": ""XAVIER FERNÁNDEZ-I-MARÍN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""CHRISTOPH KNILL"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""YVES STEINEBACH"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4337/9781786431356"", ""10.1111/psj.12095"", ""10.1111/gove.12032"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1186208"", ""10.1080/25741292.2019.1632616"", ""10.1111/rego.12297"", ""10.1111/gove.12338"", ""10.4324/9781351252928-21"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00096"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.03.012"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000532"", ""10.1111/1467-9299.00298"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-18388-3"", ""10.2307/1934352"", ""10.1177/0952076719827068"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00342.x"", ""10.1177/001041408001300305"", ""10.1007/s11077-011-9140-8"", ""10.1111/lsq.12231"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-4149"", ""10.1111/rego.12174"", ""10.1177/0952076719827062"", ""10.1080/09644016.2019.1549772"", ""10.1080/09644016.2013.755839"", ""10.1177/1354068815597896"", ""10.1038/163688a0"", ""10.1080/01402389408425031"", ""10.7910/DVN/M5SDCH"", ""10.1080/14494035.2019.1579502"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316339152"", ""10.1002/sim.3107"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2006.04.009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790997"", ""10.3390/su10061896"", ""10.1111/psj.12333"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1991.tb01878.x"", ""10.1080/13501760500161357"", ""10.2307/2082436"", ""10.1017/9781108555081"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9265-x"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0158-5"", ""10.1016/S0308-597X(03)00086-1"", ""10.4324/9781351252928"", ""10.1111/1468-0343.00066"", ""10.1017/S0143814X10000152"", ""10.1017/9781108646888"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12226"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1988.tb00694.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001297"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2012.00548.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12406"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00199"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01150.x"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00112.x"", ""10.1007/s11077-019-09365-z"", ""10.1080/09644010802055634"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur054"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edz006"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00275.x"", ""10.1111/puar.13274"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.00086"", ""10.1177/0010414004271080"", ""10.2307/2586011"", ""10.1111/1467-9930.00065"", ""10.17645/pag.v1i2.95"", ""10.1017/S0143814X0000221X"", ""10.18637/jss.v070.i09"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-01968-6_2"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.923625"", ""10.1177/2158244019900568"", ""10.1080/01442870902863851"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3708920"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198268574.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400831456"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199656646.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1876404511200046"", ""10.2307/2939044"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1152995"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2016.04.004""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Yet, contrary to expectations, in ranked societies—where social status is a cleavage—elites can instead build cross-class coalitions to undertake a strategy ofbureaucratic weakeningto limit future redistributive taxation. We study a case where status hierarchies were particularly extreme: the post-Civil War American South. During Reconstruction, under federal oversight, per capita taxation was higher in counties where slavery had been more extensive before the war, as predicted by standard theoretical models. After Reconstruction ended, however, taxes fell and bureaucratic capacity was weaker where slavery had been widespread. Moreover, higher intrawhite economic inequality was associated with lower taxes and weaker capacity after Reconstruction in formerly high-slavery counties. These findings on the interaction between intrawhite economic inequality and pre-War slavery suggest that elites built cross-class coalitions against taxation where whites sought to protect their racial status.","[{""name"": ""PAVITHRA SURYANARAYAN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""STEVEN WHITE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.01008.x"", ""10.1177/2332649215582251"", ""10.1080/21565503.2017.1419435"", ""10.1561/100.00005052"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195387421.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s12116-008-9028-6"", ""10.1017/S0003055406062083"", ""10.1353/wp.0.0021"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781650"", ""10.3386/w9259"", ""10.1017/S0898588X06000071"", ""10.1353/book.72114"", ""10.1017/9781108556323"", ""10.1177/0010414021997164"", ""10.1007/BF00138861"", ""10.1177/0010414015592646"", ""10.2307/1889973"", ""10.1093/0199267669.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511843686"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139583749"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615658"", ""10.1257/aer.98.1.267"", ""10.1017/9781108555722"", ""10.1017/S0022050719000755"", ""10.1017/9781316875568"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1177/030639687201300401"", ""10.1080/01419870.2015.1110610"", ""10.2307/2209873"", ""10.2307/2197687"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226194899.001.0001"", ""10.1086/686631"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804960"", ""10.1093/sf/sor021"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469620879.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511471049"", ""10.1162/0033553041382175"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051506"", ""10.1515/9781400880225"", ""10.2307/2209719"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000715"", ""10.1016/0047-2727(75)90016-X"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2004.07.004"", ""10.1007/s10797-008-9069-9"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226505015.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226845272.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414018758752"", ""10.1177/0049124115613783"", ""10.1006/exeh.1994.1001"", ""10.1086/688053"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7170.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1854452"", ""10.7312/davi93210"", ""10.1017/S0043887119000157"", ""10.1086/642601"", ""10.2307/j.ctv113175m"", ""10.1525/9780520909540"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2119048"", ""10.7312/flem90658"", ""10.7312/stap92550"", ""10.1007/s12116-012-9122-7"", ""10.1086/222839"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2005.08.008""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

This article examines the relationship between race, celebrity, and social movements, specifically Colin Kaepernick’s protest of police violence and whether his activism mobilizes black Americans to political action. Using the 2017 Black Voter Project (BVP) Pilot Study, we explore African American political engagement in the 2016 election, a time devoid of President Obama as a mobilizing figure. We find African Americans who strongly approve of Kaepernick’s protest engage in politics at elevated rates, even after accounting for alternative explanations. Moreover, approval for Kaepernick also moderates other forces rooted in group identity, such as identification with the Black Lives Matter movement. In the end, Kaepernick and the protest movement he leads offers a powerful mobilizing force for African Americans.","[{""name"": ""Christopher C. Towler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nyron N.

10.1093/fpa/oraa006,FOREIGN POLICY ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Patterns of Political Ideology and Security Policy,"AbstractRecent studies on political ideology suggest the existence of partisan divides on matters of foreign and security policy, challenging the notion that “politics stops at the water's edge.” However, when taken as a whole, extant work provides decidedly mixed evidence of party-political differences outside domestic politics. This article first conducts a systematic empirical analysis of the relationship between parties’ left–right positions and their general attitude toward peace and security missions, which suggests that right-leaning parties tend to be more supportive of military operations. Yet, the results also show that the empirical pattern is curvilinear: centrist and center–right parties witness the highest level of support for military missions, while parties on both ends of the political spectrum show substantially less support. The second part of our analysis examines whether the stronger support of rightist parties for peace and security missions translates into a greater inclination of right-wing governments to actually deploy forces for military operations. Strikingly, our results suggest that leftist governments were actually more inclined to participate in operations than their right-leaning counterparts. The greater willingness of left-wing executives to deploy military forces is the result of their greater inclination to participate in operations with inclusive goals.","[{""name"": ""Tim Haesebrouck"", ""affiliation"": [""Ghent University""]}, {""name"": ""Patrick A Mello"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Erfurt""]}]","[""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00083.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00564.x"", ""10.1177/1354068812462931"", ""10.1111/isqu.12164"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199244003.003.0002"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199244003.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00622.x"", ""10.1080/13523260.2018.1500819"", ""10.1162/002081898753162839"", ""10.1177/0022002715626248"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139245920"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.01912.x"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1177/0010414007313117"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2007.00058.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199296316.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.978355"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000058"", ""10.1080/03932729.2011.628090"", ""10.1057/jird.2012.11"", ""10.1057/9781137386519"", ""10.1080/13523260.2018.1522737"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1dgn6j9"", ""10.1080/725289044"", ""10.1177/2053168016686915"", ""10.7591/9781501729621"", ""10.1177/0022002707300842"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2006.00032.x"", ""10.1177/2515245918805755"", ""10.1111/isqu.12159"", ""10.1017/S1755773914000319"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199640041.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1240413"", ""10.1017/S1755773918000097""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055423000023,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,How Deliberation Happens: Enabling Deliberative Reason,"We show, against skeptics, that however latent it may be in everyday life, the ability to reason effectively about politics can readily be activated when conditions are right. We justify a definition of deliberative reason, then develop and apply a Deliberative Reason Index (DRI) to analysis of 19 deliberative forums. DRI increases over the course of deliberation in the vast majority of cases, but the extent of this increase depends upon enabling conditions. Group building that activates deliberative norms makes the biggest difference, particularly in enabling participants to cope with complexity. Without group building, complexity becomes more difficult to surmount, and planned direct impact on policy decisions may actually impede reasoning where complexity is high. Our findings have implications beyond forum design for the staging of political discourse in the wider public sphere.","[{""name"": ""SIMON NIEMEYER"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""FRANCESCO VERI"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JOHN S.

10.1111/rego.12356,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Grounding transnational business governance: A political-strategic perspective on government responses in the Global South,"AbstractRecent scholarship on transnational business governance has begun to examine public‐private interactions and the active role of governments. We make two key contributions that integrate and expand this literature. First, in juxtaposition to functionalist accounts, we foreground the fundamentally political and often contentious character of these interactions. As private transnational governance schemes and standards “hit the ground,” private‐public interactions, we argue, are embedded in national political arenas and tied to domestic distributional struggles among competing regulatory coalitions. Building upon multiple empirical streams of research, we develop a political‐strategic framework that maps the diversity of Southern government responses (substitute, adopt, repurpose, replace, or reject) to transnational private governance. Our framework shows that government responses are a function of both strategic fit with domestic industrial capabilities and structures, and strength of developmental state capacity. Second, our proposed framework adopts the vantage point of Global South governments and industries, particularly how development challenges and strategic options within global value chains affect their understanding of, and responses to, transnational schemes and standards. This is an important corrective to a Northern bias in the private governance literature.","[{""name"": ""José Carlos Marques"", ""affiliation"": [""Telfer School of Management University of Ottawa  Ottawa Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Burkard Eberlein"", ""affiliation"": [""Schulich School of Business York University  Toronto Canada""]}]","[""10.1007/s11558-010-9092-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139979696"", ""10.1257/aer.20140044"", ""10.1016/j.fishres.2015.11.020"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.05.009"", ""10.1093/019926113X.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.09.007"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12385"", ""10.22459/NPD.12.2015.18"", ""10.1177/0019793920925424"", ""10.1086/518871"", ""10.2202/1565-3404.1278"", ""10.1111/rego.12051"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794332.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01954.x"", ""10.1111/isqu.12166"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2007.00021.x"", ""10.1177/0170840618815928"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2010.01076.x"", ""10.1080/15387216.2013.849850"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2012.05.011"", ""10.1111/1468-0491.00199"", ""10.1111/rego.12053"", ""10.1111/rego.12395"", ""10.1111/gove.12164"", ""10.1177/0002716213486468"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511488542"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000076"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12619"", ""10.1111/rego.12096"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053532"", ""10.1080/713600072"", ""10.1111/j.1759-5436.2001.mp32003010.x"", ""10.1111/bjir.12242"", ""10.2202/1469-3569.1011"", ""10.1177/0170840619847720"", ""10.1111/rego.12030"", ""10.1057/9780230623361"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.1080/09644016.2017.1343767"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.11.015"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01519.x"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.01.005"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12406"", ""10.1111/gove.12035"", ""10.1057/9780230304697"", ""10.1016/S0022-1996(98)00075-0"", ""10.1080/09692290500049805"", ""10.1057/9780230281356"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2016.02.001"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2010.01080.x"", ""10.1080/03085147.2011.607364"", ""10.4337/9781849806756"", ""10.1111/rego.12005"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12525"", ""10.1016/S0304-3878(03)00124-X"", ""10.1111/rego.12151"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2007.01034.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.06.012"", ""10.1007/s10460-017-9816-6"", ""10.1177/0007650315623014"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174701"", ""10.1080/00220388.2013.874558"", ""10.1111/glob.12180"", ""10.1007/s10460-014-9511-9"", ""10.1515/9780804765602"", ""10.1007/s13412-013-0118-z"", ""10.1504/IJTG.2004.004548"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-4978"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr028"", ""10.1017/9781316224908"", ""10.1177/0170840619852142"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00379"", ""10.1002/smj.2204"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12398"", ""10.1073/pnas.0900555106"", ""10.1073/pnas.0913714108"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106439"", ""10.1017/S0003975600004239"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.08.029"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2377-3"", ""10.1057/9780230277243_1"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12397"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.31193458"", ""10.1080/13563467.2016.1273341"", ""10.1177/0032329206297185"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139794961.008"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.12.002"", ""10.1111/1477-7053.00106"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199694761.001.0001"", ""10.5465/amp.2013.0094"", ""10.1068/a37369"", ""10.4337/9781843769743.00018"", ""10.1080/13600818.2014.909400"", ""10.4337/9781843769743.00010"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808678"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01133.x"", ""10.1111/rego.12220"", ""10.1080/13600818.2014.905524"", ""10.1287/orsc.1090.0514"", ""10.1073/pnas.1000968108"", ""10.5040/9781350218826"", ""10.1111/rego.12303"", ""10.1186/s41180-018-0018-y"", ""10.1016/S1096-7508(01)00035-0"", ""10.1111/rego.12332"", ""10.2307/j.ctvcm4jbh"", ""10.1093/isr/viw001"", ""10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.01.019"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00950.x"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00335"", ""10.1111/gove.12267"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1418759"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.10.017"", ""10.1179/102452908X357310"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283.002"", ""10.1007/s11077-009-9084-4"", ""10.4337/9781847202895.00008"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106445"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790997"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2016.01.002"", ""10.1057/9780230246966_1"", ""10.1080/15693430512331333384"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2006.12.002"", ""10.1080/135017697344064"", ""10.1515/9780691187181"", ""10.1177/1070496516640857"", ""10.7591/9781501720383"", ""10.4337/9781788114738.00008"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-42724-3_7"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2015.10.003"", ""10.1093/ser/mws029""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

However, there are so many definitions of what they can do that it is difficult to use this concept in a systematic, analytical way. Starting with a critique of the tendency to overstretch the concept of the policy entrepreneur, we propose a more parsimonious conceptualisation by de-personalising entrepreneurial actions and by focusing on a specific pattern of action whose main task is to promote innovation. Thus, policy entrepreneurship is conceptualised as a pattern of action (involving different types of actors) focused on innovation promotion that is pursued by activities such as framing a problem, developing solutions, building a coalition in support, and seeking opportunities and attention. We also highlight prevalent resources for those activities. We then apply this conceptualisation to two cases of urban planning in Italy to discuss the activities of successful policy entrepreneurship as a collective effort.","[{""name"": ""Giliberto Capano"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bologna, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Maria Tullia Galanti"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Milan, Italy""]}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"
10.1017/psrm.2018.40,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Fixed effects in rare events data: a penalized maximum likelihood solution,"AbstractMost agree that models of binary time-series-cross-sectional data in political science often possess unobserved unit-level heterogeneity. Despite this, there is no clear consensus on how best to account for these potential unit effects, with many of the issues confronted seemingly misunderstood. For example, one oft-discussed concern with rare events data is the elimination of no-event units from the sample when estimating fixed effects models. Many argue that this is a reason to eschew fixed effects in favor of pooled or random effects models. We revisit this issue and clarify that the main concern with fixed effects models of rare events data is not inaccurate or inefficient coefficient estimation, but instead biased marginal effects. In short, only evaluating event-experiencing units gives an inaccurate estimate of the baseline risk, yielding inaccurate (often inflated) estimates of predictor effects. As a solution, we propose a penalized maximum likelihood fixed effects (PML-FE) estimator, which retains the complete sample by providing finite estimates of the fixed effects for each unit. We explore the small sample performance of PML-FE versus common alternatives via Monte Carlo simulations, evaluating the accuracy of both parameter and effects estimates.

10.1017/S1743923X20000197,POLITICS & GENDER,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Feminist Mobilization and the Abortion Debate in Latin America: Lessons from Argentina,"AbstractWhen Argentine president Mauricio Macri announced in March 2018 that he supported a “responsible and mature” national debate regarding the decriminalization of abortion, it took many by surprise. In a Catholic country with a center-right government, where public opinion regarding abortion had hardly moved in decades—why would the abortion debate surface in Argentina when it did? Our answer is grounded in the social movements literature, as we argue that the organizational framework necessary for growing the decriminalization movement had already been built by an emergent feminist movement of unprecedented scope and influence: Ni Una Menos. By expanding the movement's social justice frame from gender violence to encompass abortion rights, feminist activists were able to change public opinion and expand the scope of debate, making salient an issue that had long been politically untouchable. We marshal evidence from multiple surveys carried out before, during, and after the abortion debate and in-depth interviews to shed light on the sources of abortion rights movements in unlikely contexts.","[{""name"": ""Mariela Daby"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mason W.

We directly answer these claims by collecting a surfeit of attitudinal measures to simultaneously estimate the relationship between cognitive beliefs about the racial status quo and emotional reactions to racism. First, we uncover that two higher-order dimensions undergird whites’ racial attitudes. Second, we validate a four-item version of our new battery using the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study.","[{""name"": ""Christopher D.

10.1017/psrm.2021.9,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Estimating logit models with small samples,"AbstractIn small samples, maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of logit model coefficients have substantial bias away from zero. As a solution, we remind political scientists of Firth's (1993,Biometrika,80, 27–38) penalized maximum likelihood (PML) estimator. Prior research has described and used PML, especially in the context of separation, but its small sample properties remain under-appreciated. The PML estimator eliminates most of the bias and, perhaps more importantly, greatly reduces the variance of the usual ML estimator. Thus, researchers do not face a bias-variance tradeoff when choosing between the ML and PML estimators—the PML estimator has a smaller biasanda smaller variance. We use Monte Carlo simulations and a re-analysis of George and Epstein (1992,American Political Science Review,86, 323–337) to show that the PML estimator offers a substantial improvement in small samples (e.g., 50 observations) and noticeable improvement even in larger samples (e.g., 1000 observations).","[{""name"": ""Carlisle Rainey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kelly McCaskey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jmva.2005.05.010"", ""10.1093/biomet/80.1.27"", ""10.1177/1532440014563644"", ""10.1080/00401706.1979.10489724"", ""10.32614/CRAN.package.brglm2"", ""10.1111/ajps.12102"", ""10.3998/mpub.23784"", ""10.1515/spp-2015-0001"", ""10.1177/0738894213508691"", ""10.2307/1964223"", ""10.1214/aos/1176344552"", ""10.1177/1532440014561644"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1968.tb00724.x"", ""10.1177/0022002713499718"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-4541-9"", ""10.1080/13510347.2016.1263617"", ""10.1093/pan/mpi009"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001394"", ""10.1093/pan/mpw014"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a004868"", ""10.1111/ajps.12149"", ""10.1002/wics.1296"", ""10.1016/S0895-4356(96)00236-3"", ""10.1080/03050629.2018.1407319"", ""10.1093/biomet/asp055"", ""10.2307/2669316"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00429.x"", ""10.1093/aje/kwk052"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-3242-6"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1988.tb01723.x"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(93)01556-2""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/1758-5899.12965,GLOBAL POLICY,0302 Political Science,Emerging Consensus on 'Ethical AI': Human Rights Critique of Stakeholder Guidelines,"AbstractVoluntary guidelines on ‘ethical practices’ have been the response by stakeholders to address the growing concern over harmful social consequences of artificial intelligence and digital technologies. Issued by dozens of actors from industry, government and professional associations, the guidelines are creating a consensus on core standards and principles for ethical design, development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). Using human rights principles (equality, participation and accountability) and attention to the right to privacy, this paper reviews 15 guidelines preselected to be strongest on human rights, and on global health. We find about half of these ground their guidelines in international human rights law and incorporate the key principles; even these could go further, especially in suggesting ways to operationalize them. Those that adopt the ethics framework are particularly weak in laying out standards for accountability, often focusing on ‘transparency’, and remaining silent on enforceability and participation which would effectively protect the social good. These guidelines mention human rights as a rhetorical device to obscure the absence of enforceable standards and accountability measures, and give their attention to the single right to privacy. These ‘ethics’ guidelines, disproportionately from corporations and other interest groups, are also weak on addressing inequalities and discrimination. We argue that voluntary guidelines are creating a set of de facto norms and re‐interpretation of the term ‘human rights’ for what would be considered ‘ethical’ practice in the field. This exposes an urgent need for action by governments and civil society to develop more rigorous standards and regulatory measures, grounded in international human rights frameworks, capable of holding Big Tech and other powerful actors to account.","[{""name"": ""Sakiko Fukuda‐Parr"", ""affiliation"": [""The New School""]}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth Gibbons"", ""affiliation"": [""FXB Center for Health and Human Rights"", ""Harvard T.H.

The Effects of Exposure to Participatory and Deliberative School Board Meetings,"Would public meetings incite more civic engagement if they were structured in ways that are simply more engaging? I addressed this question by conducting an original survey with an oversample of racial and ethnic minorities and individuals from low-income households. The survey featured a randomized experiment in which each study participant was shown a short clip of an actual school board meeting that was (1) a standard meeting with no public participation, (2) a meeting with public participation, or (3) a meeting with deliberation (public participation followed by a reasoned response from the school board). The experience of viewing the more participatory and deliberative school board meetings led to increased trust in local officials and a stronger willingness to attend school board meetings in the future. This study has significant implications for civic engagement, local politics, and public school governance.","[{""name"": ""JONATHAN E.

10.1017/S0260210522000018,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,Contested disaster nationalism in the digital age: Emotional registers and geopolitical imaginaries in COVID-19 narratives on Chinese social media,"AbstractThis article examines how affective narratives of the COVID-19 pandemic on Chinese social media reinforce and challenge established scripts of national identity, political legitimacy, and international geopolitical imaginary. Taking theoretical insights from the scholarship on trauma, disaster nationalism, and politics of emotions, I structure the analysis of social media posts from state media and private accounts around three emotional registers: grief as a crucial site of control and contestation during the initial stage of the outbreak; gandong (being moved in a positive way) associated with stories of heroic sacrifices, national unity, and mundane ‘heart-warming’ moments; and enmity in narratives of power struggles and ideological competition between China and ‘the West’, especially the United States. While state media has sought to transform the crisis into resources for strengthening national belonging and regime legitimacy through a digital reworking of the long-standing repertoire of disaster nationalism, alternative articulations of grief, rage, and vernacular memory that refuse to be incorporated into the ‘correct collective memory’ of a nationalised tragedy have persisted in digital space. Furthermore, the article explicates the ways in which popular narratives affectively reinscribe dominant ideas about the (inter)national community: such as the historical imagination of a continuous nationhood rising from disasters and humiliation, positive energy, and a dichotomous view of the international order characterised by Western hegemony and Chinese victimhood. The geopolitical narratives of the pandemic build on and exacerbate binary oppositions between China and ‘the West’ in the global imaginary, which are co-constructed through discursive practices on both sides in mutually reinforcing ways. The lens of emotion allows us to attend to the resonances and dissonances between official and popular narrativisations of the disaster without assuming a one-way determinate relationship between the two.","[{""name"": ""Chenchen Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/9781137025661_13"", ""10.1080/13621020903466258"", ""10.22459/MIC.05.02.2020.19"", ""10.1111/0018-2656.00055"", ""10.1017/S0260210508007821"", ""10.1177/1754073917723167"", ""10.5749/vergstudglobasia.3.1.0162"", ""10.1177/0038038520969114"", ""10.1007/s11366-020-09690-8"", ""10.1007/s11366-007-9005-3"", ""10.1093/ips/olz001"", ""10.4324/9780367220952"", ""10.1017/S026021051200054X"", ""10.1080/13621025.2015.982965"", ""10.4324/9780429331220"", ""10.1177/1868102619899409"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226120041.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13569317.2020.1750759"", ""10.1177/1354066119850253"", ""10.1017/S0260210512000599"", ""10.1080/14616742.2021.1927134"", ""10.4324/9780203700372"", ""10.1353/chn.2018.0000"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000317"", ""10.1177/1750698017693669"", ""10.1080/14616696.2019.1616795"", ""10.1080/10670564.2021.1893560"", ""10.1080/10670564.2021.1893557"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199549955.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0163443707080539"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551109"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316154670"", ""10.1177/030437540402900204"", ""10.1177/019027250907200102"", ""10.1007/s11366-020-09692-6"", ""10.17813/maiq.7.2.70rg70l202524uw6"", ""10.1080/01419870.2020.1749687"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t89jrt.16"", ""10.1080/10670564.2018.1458063"", ""10.16997/wpcc.17"", ""10.1080/14672715.2020.1803094"", ""10.1177/1354066119850249"", ""10.22459/MIC.05.02.2020.20"", ""10.1177/1750698012458309"", ""10.1080/09502386.2021.1898037"", ""10.1093/ips/olz013"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840470"", ""10.1057/9780230627482"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226650746.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10670564.2013.861145"", ""10.22459/MIC.06.01.2021.02"", ""10.1111/1468-5884.00226""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ips/olab013,INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY,0303 Sociology; 0302 Political Science,Colonial Lives of the Carceral Archipelago: Rethinking the Neoliberal Security State,"AbstractMass incarceration, police brutality, and border controls are part and parcel of the everyday experiences of marginalized and racialized communities across the world. Recent scholarship in international relations, sociology, and geography has examined the prevalence of these coercive practices through the prism of “disciplinary,” “penal,” or “authoritarian” neoliberalism. In this collective discussion, we argue that although this literature has brought to the fore neoliberalism's reliance on state violence, it has yet to interrogate how these carceral measures are linked to previous forms of global racial ordering. To rectify this moment of “colonial unknowing,” the collective discussion draws on decolonial approaches, Indigenous studies, and theories of racial capitalism. It demonstrates that “new” and “neoliberal” forms of domestic control must be situated within the global longue durée of racialized and colonial accumulation by dispossession. By mapping contemporary modes of policing, incarceration, migration control, and surveillance onto earlier forms of racial–colonial subjugation, we argue that countering the violence of neoliberalism requires more than nostalgic appeals for a return to Keynesianism. What is needed is abolition—not just of the carceral archipelago, but of the very system of racial capitalism that produces and depends on these global vectors of organized violence and abandonment.","[{""name"": ""Sabrina Axster"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ida Danewid"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Asher Goldstein"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matt Mahmoudi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cemal Burak Tansel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lauren Wilcox"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1462474514548807"", ""10.4324/9780203385937"", ""10.5749/j.ctt20h6vpx"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691593.001.0001"", ""10.24043/isj.361"", ""10.4324/9781315743752"", ""10.1017/eis.2016.7"", ""10.1017/S0260210506007054"", ""10.1177/0020702018768480"", ""10.1093/ips/olab003"", ""10.5749/j.ctv10vm2vw"", ""10.1177/0967010617712683"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12317"", ""10.1177/1462474517738984"", ""10.1080/17539153.2015.1005932"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2013.787512"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.bjc.a047651"", ""10.2307/j.ctt17kk9p8"", ""10.1177/0896920509347144"", ""10.1080/08935696.2013.843250"", ""10.1080/14747731.2018.1502497"", ""10.1353/aq.2012.0033"", ""10.3138/cjccj.2018-0029"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469651231.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11186-014-9212-9"", ""10.1515/9781503605282"", ""10.1177/1354066119858388"", ""10.1080/10383441.2009.10854638"", ""10.1086/495654"", ""10.3917/polaf.152.0101"", ""10.1080/13698010600955958"", ""10.1177/0263775820929698"", ""10.1525/california/9780520285705.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1743923X15000100"", ""10.7202/1050851ar"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-15881-2"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjhzpv2"", ""10.1177/0002716206296780"", ""10.1080/14616742.2018.1447310"", ""10.1093/ips/oly031"", ""10.1057/s41296-020-00399-0"", ""10.1177/0010836719850219"", ""10.1017/S0020743810000425"", ""10.1007/s10612-012-9165-0"", ""10.1177/0003122410382640"", ""10.1177/000486589703000104"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469631189.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0026749X9900339X"", ""10.1080/03086539708582998"", ""10.59962/9780774837750"", ""10.1215/07990537-2378892"", ""10.1177/1462474518802336"", ""10.1215/01642472-2006-009"", ""10.5749/jcritethnstud.1.1.0076"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjsf4fx"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748692361.001.0001"", ""10.1080/08854300.2018.1563447"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139343282"", ""10.1093/bjc/azx077"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1417372"", ""10.4324/9780203814949.ch2_2_a"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097774"", ""10.1080/15295036.2017.1309056"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cg8m6"", ""10.4159/9780674919808"", ""10.1177/1024529418807074"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226768786.001.0001"", ""10.1215/00382876-7381146"", ""10.1111/anti.12583"", ""10.1093/migration/mnz003"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139045643"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1417366"", ""10.1023/A:1004870517612"", ""10.1080/13621020903466357"", ""10.1353/tae.2017.0090"", ""10.1353/tae.2017.0090"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2008.00037.x"", ""10.1080/1362102022000011612"", ""10.1177/1362480608093311"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.06.033"", ""10.1080/1369801032000135602"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7379.2003.tb00151.x""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['General Health Professions', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiac166,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Breaking with convention? Zeitenwende and the traditional pillars of German foreign policy,"Abstract On 27 February 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz addressed the Bundestag and announced a watershed moment (Zeitenwende) for Germany's conduct of foreign affairs. Against the backdrop of the historical pillars of German foreign policy, this article reviews the core implications of the Zeitenwende doctrine. It analyses how the new policy continued or transformed traditional notions underpinning Germany's external relations: Westbindung (integration into the West) and European integration, multilateralism, the pursuit of a rules-based international order and NATO membership, hesitant leadership, Ostpolitik and Wandel durch Handel (transformation through trade), as well as a foreign policy not relying on military means. It argues that Zeitenwende represented a break with some traditional notions, such as Ostpolitik and Wandel durch Handel, and to some extent the non-military foreign policy. However, Zeitenwende also reconfirmed other traditions: Westbindung, a commitment to multilateralism and the rules-based order, as well as the reluctance to assert German leadership. With Zeitenwende, Germany remained firmly committed to the EU and NATO as the country acknowledged that it must do more for its own, and for Europe's, security. Zeitenwende represented Germany's coming to terms with, and final acceptance of, the realities of the post-Cold War European order.","[{""name"": ""Bernhard Blumenau"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Two canonical answers have been interstate wars and contracts between rulers and the ruled in the early modern period. New scholarship has pushed back the historical origins of the European state to the Middle Ages, and focused on domestic institutions such as parliaments, universities, the law, inheritance rules, and cities. It has left open questions of the causes of territorial fragmentation, the structural similarities in state administrations, and the policy preoccupations of the state. One answer is a powerful but neglected force in state formation: the medieval Church, which served as a rival for sovereignty, and a template for institutional innovations in court administrations, the law, and the formation of human capital. Church influence further helps to explain why territorial fragmentation in the Middle Ages persisted, why royal courts adopted similar administrative solutions, and why secular states remain concerned with morality and social discipline.","[{""name"": ""Anna Grzymala-Busse"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA;""]}]","[""10.1017/S0020818316000308"", ""10.1111/ajps.12379"", ""10.1177/0010414019830716"", ""10.1017/9781108241380.005"", ""10.1017/S0022050700076531"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2016.07.007"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.531"", ""10.2307/1051071"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023141"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000561"", ""10.1086/699246"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000096"", ""10.1007/PL00003862"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00284"", ""10.1093/past/47.1.51"", ""10.1111/1521-9488.00206"", ""10.1111/jeea.12117"", ""10.1093/qje/qju007"", ""10.1515/9781400876990"", ""10.1017/S0022050700037268"", ""10.2307/840129"", ""10.2307/205042"", ""10.1017/S0022050712000307"", ""10.1177/0305829811401459"", ""10.1086/467294"", ""10.1007/s10887-016-9129-4"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-064428"", ""10.1086/339721"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511529016"", ""10.1017/9781316493694.003"", ""10.1257/jep.29.4.227"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2281.1992.tb00924.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226304861.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781316493694.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791307"", ""10.1515/9781400866458"", ""10.1177/0090591702030004002"", ""10.1111/jeea.12177"", ""10.1515/9781400865840"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198204022.003.0008"", ""10.1016/j.eeh.2016.11.002"", ""10.1017/9781316493694"", ""10.1017/S000305541400015X"", ""10.1007/s00199-010-0570-x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511570896"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226532387.001.0001"", ""10.1111/isqu.12153"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0042"", ""10.1007/s40803-017-0053-2"", ""10.1017/ssh.2018.7"", ""10.1007/BF00149495"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.6.121901.085827"", ""10.1515/9781400830800"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511819438"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451"", ""10.1515/9781400865550"", ""10.1162/00208180151140577"", ""10.1515/9781400845552"", ""10.1017/S0043887100002604"", ""10.3386/w17206"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198731481.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521414104.005"", ""10.1017/9781139568272"", ""10.1007/s10602-018-9258-1"", ""10.1017/S0043887116000319"", ""10.1177/0032329215571279"", ""10.1017/9781108241380.003"", ""10.1515/9780691213057"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.5.101501.145837"", ""10.1017/9781316493694.004"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000173"", ""10.1017/S0022050706000374"", ""10.1017/9781316493694.002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511497599"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0289.2011.00612.x"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521362894.014"", ""10.1257/jep.27.4.165""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Demography', 'History']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiaa061,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Between the bear and the dragon: multivectorism in Kazakhstan as a model strategy for secondary powers,"Abstract Kazakhstan has followed a foreign policy of multivector diplomacy since its independence from the former Soviet Union. While multivectorism was a strategy of necessity in its early years, it has evolved to empower Kazakhstan to effectively protect its independence and negotiate its relationship with the great powers on its borders and further afield. After the 2014 Russian seizure of Crimea it is noteworthy that Kazakhstan has maintained positive relations with Russia while asserting its sovereignty and independent foreign policy. In this article we investigate how Kazakhstan has negotiated the rise of China, taking advantage of the economic opportunities it presents. We trace the foreign policy of Kazakhstan from independence forward, examining its relationships with its Great Power neighbours and its role in international organizations and negotiations. We posit that multivectorism is similar to the strategy of omni-enmeshment and complex balancing seen in south-east Asia. Both are effective methods for secondary powers to protect their sovereignty and to coexist with Great Powers without becoming their client states. Kazakhstan's approach to foreign policy is an exemplar for secondary states. This article contributes to the literature on the strategic decision-making of secondary powers and to the theoretical analysis of the foreign policy of Kazakhstan during a critical moment of transition from the long-time rule of Nursultan Nazarbayev to the presidency of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Vanderhill"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sandra F Joireman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roza Tulepbayeva"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1017/S1752971920000135,INTERNATIONAL THEORY,0302 Political Science,"Anxiety, time, and ontological security's third-image potential","In this article, we begin to extend ontological security to third-image theorizing. We argue that the autobiographical conceptions of international agents, along with other stories told about international politics, constitute ‘the international’ as a system, society, community, or inhabitable realm beyond and between first- and second-image relations. To develop this point, we focus on the relationship between narrative, anxiety, and time. We contend that ontological security issues resound in the third image once we shift from treating the international realm as social agents' external environment to treating it as a collective project in its own right. Doing so highlights the promise of ontological security studies for further differentiating international fear and anxiety, for enabling novel explanations of international phenomena, and for elaborating third-image identity formation as a wide-ranging timing effort to surmount a dynamic, processual environment full of interconnected coordination challenges.","[{""name"": ""Andrew R.

10.1093/isq/sqz088,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,When States Crack Down on Human Rights Defenders,"Abstract Research suggests that civil society mobilization together with the ratification of human rights treaties put pressure on governments to improve their human rights practices. An unexplored theoretical implication is that pressure provokes counterpressure. Instead of improving treaty compliance, some governments will have an interest in demobilizing civil society to silence their critics. Yet we do not know how and to what extent this incentive shapes governments’ policies and practices regarding civil society organizations. In this article we argue and show—using a new global database of government-sponsored restrictions on civil society organizations—that when governments have committed to human rights treaties and, at the same time, continue to commit severe human rights abuses, they impose restrictions on civil society groups to avoid monitoring and mitigate the international costs of abuses.","[{""name"": ""Kristin M Bakke"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London and Peace Research Institute Oslo""]}, {""name"": ""Neil J Mitchell"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London""]}, {""name"": ""Hannah M Smidt"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Zurich and GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1530-9134.2009.00206.x"", ""10.1080/13642987.2015.1075301"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511756245"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199982660.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jhuman/huw012"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0026"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000254"", ""10.1353/hrq.2013.0046"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000091"", ""10.1177/0192512115622046"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050125"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139237161.008"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.02.001"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000070"", ""10.1093/ia/iiy060"", ""10.1177/0022343302039005007"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080247"", ""10.1086/428442"", ""10.2307/797642"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000488"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000306"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00732.x"", ""10.1017/S002081831300012X"", ""10.1017/S0043887100008030"", ""10.1177/0022002711431417"", ""10.1162/002081800551163"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00694.x"", ""10.1177/0022002705281667"", ""10.1080/14754835.2015.1103158"", ""10.1353/hrq.2001.0041"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139237161"", ""10.1007/s11558-015-9238-4"", ""10.1017/psrm.2013.15"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000693"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511851964"", ""10.1515/9780691187228"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051919"", ""10.1017/S002081830808003X"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-0484-7_world_development_indicators""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S002081832000051X,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,What's in a Name? Metaphors and Cybersecurity,"AbstractFor more than a decade, the United States military has conceptualized and discussed the Internet and related systems as “cyberspace,” understood as a “domain” of conflict like land, sea, air, and outer space. How and why did this concept become entrenched in US doctrine? What are its effects? Focusing on the emergence and consolidation of this terminology, I make three arguments about the role of language in cybersecurity policy. First, I propose a new, politically consequential category of metaphor:foundational metaphors,implied by using particular labels rather than stated outright. These metaphors support specific ways to understand complex issues, provide discursive resources to some arguments over others, and shape policy contestation and outcomes. Second, I present a detailed empirical study of US military strategy and doctrine that traces the emergence and consolidation of terminology built on the “cyberspace domain.” This concept supported implicit metaphorical correspondences between the Internet and physical space, yielding specific analogies and arguments for understanding the Internet and its effects. Third, I focus on the rhetorical effects of this terminology to reveal two important institutional consequences: this language has been essential to expanding the military's role in cybersecurity, and specific interests within the Department of Defense have used this framework to support the creation of US Cyber Command. These linguistic effects in the United States also have implications for how other states approach cybersecurity, for how international law is applied to cyber operations, and for how International Relations understands language and technological change.","[{""name"": ""Jordan Branch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s40803-019-00129-8"", ""10.1093/cybsec/tyz007"", ""10.1080/09636412.2015.1038188"", ""10.1177/0967010613478323"", ""10.56021/9780801837753"", ""10.4324/9781315618371-7"", ""10.21236/ADA617790"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7736.001.0001"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i2.1333"", ""10.21236/ADA601645"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190204792.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173865.011"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00136"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37481-4_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-55007-2"", ""10.1111/j.1528-3585.2010.00417.x"", ""10.1353/sais.2018.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-060518-025407"", ""10.1080/02684527.2012.708530"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190650384.001.0001"", ""10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0025"", ""10.1177/1354066199005002003"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1306396"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2009.00572.x"", ""10.4324/9781317353836"", ""10.1108/DPRG-05-2017-0023"", ""10.2307/3481336"", ""10.5325/jinfopoli.3.2013.0030"", ""10.1080/23738871.2018.1514417"", ""10.2307/1229390"", ""10.1017/S0260210505006844"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000181"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i2.1335"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300181357.001.0001"", ""10.5210/fm.v17i7.3848"", ""10.1093/cybsec/tyy009"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190221072.003.0002"", ""10.1017/S1752971915000081"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135342"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169288"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1trkjd1"", ""10.1177/1354066107087766"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491306"", ""10.1080/13875868.2014.945587"", ""10.4324/9780203096710"", ""10.1111/polp.12202"", ""10.1017/aju.2017.58"", ""10.1007/978-94-6265-207-1_6"", ""10.1162/002081800551109"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i2.1385"", ""10.2307/3481337"", ""10.1515/9780691212913"", ""10.1017/S0002930000016894"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816802"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1871.001.0001"", ""10.1111/misr.12023"", ""10.1017/9781316822524"", ""10.1177/1354066107074284"", ""10.1177/0305829812449195"", ""10.1017/S089267941800059X"", ""10.1111/geoj.12009"", ""10.1080/09636412.2013.816122"", ""10.1177/1354066106069322"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00592.x"", ""10.37514/RNT-J.1996.3.6.21"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-030810-110815"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511559044"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190913113.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01495939308402915"", ""10.1093/isr/viz022""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"
10.1111/padm.12850,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Unpacking value destruction at the intersection between public and private value,"AbstractPublic services do not always create value. Rather, when poorly organized and/or delivered, they can destroy value and make service users' lives worse. However, such “value destruction” is presently weakly conceptualized in public management theory. Consequently, this paper is devoted to the empirical examination of value destruction and hence its conceptualization. At the heart of the paper, we recognize the multiplicity of public value and private value objectives in complex public service environments and the dyadic tension between these two value constellations. Drawing upon qualitative data derived from public carbon reduction projects, we establish a conceptual framework. This framework accounts both for the types of value destruction and for the tension between public and private value. Subsequently, the framework disentangles the value destruction concept into four categories: value ignorance, value disproportion, value backlash, and value exploitation. Finally, the implications of this new conceptual framework for public management theory and practice are explored.","[{""name"": ""Tie Cui"", ""affiliation"": [""Business School Edinburgh Napier University  Edinburgh UK""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen P.

Based on the existing literature, the authors introduce a typology of openness indicators, which distinguishes between ‘real’ and ‘financial’ openness as well as ‘de-facto’ and ‘de-jure’ measures of openness. They use data collected on these indicators to analyze trends in openness over time and to conduct a correlation analysis across indicators. Finally, they illustrate the potential consequences of employing different openness measures in a growth regression framework.","[{""name"": ""Claudius Gräbner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philipp Heimberger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jakob Kapeller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Florian Springholz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/0033553041382139"", ""10.2307/30035946"", ""10.1257/jep.30.1.95"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2008.06.006"", ""10.2307/2937943"", ""10.1016/j.jmoneco.2013.06.003"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2009939"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00592"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2005.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.jfs.2013.04.004"", ""10.1086/451959"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2015.05.008"", ""10.1080/00036840500392078"", ""10.1257/aer.20160600"", ""10.1057/s41308-018-0053-9"", ""10.1002/ijfe.208"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2012.11.008"", ""10.1080/14747731.2014.887389"", ""10.1257/aer.89.3.379"", ""10.1111/obes.12275"", ""10.1007/s11558-019-09344-2"", ""10.1016/0304-3878(95)00042-9"", ""10.1007/s10887-006-9009-4"", ""10.1007/s10888-011-9171-6"", ""10.1073/pnas.0900943106"", ""10.1111/twec.12586"", ""10.1057/imfer.2013.7"", ""10.1057/imfsp.2008.36"", ""10.2139/ssrn.495625"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2007.02.003"", ""10.5089/9781484300336.001"", ""10.1162/0034653041811789"", ""10.1111/j.0378-5920.2004.00611.x"", ""10.1080/14747731.2014.944336"", ""10.1111/twec.12174"", ""10.1057/imfer.2011.18"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhn034"", ""10.1257/jel.44.4.973"", ""10.1257/jep.32.2.73"", ""10.2307/2534573"", ""10.1057/imfsp.2008.28"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2010.01243.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2011.01404.x"", ""10.1016/j.jpolmod.2004.04.010"", ""10.2202/1524-5861.1751"", ""10.1007/s11293-010-9217-3"", ""10.1093/wber/lhn007"", ""10.1016/j.jedc.2016.03.009"", ""10.1002/9781119454205.ch10"", ""10.1016/S0304-3878(03)00068-3""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Based on codings of 1809 party manifestos in 19 countries since 1945, this article addresses the question of where the political ideal to democratize homeownership came from. While conservative parties have defended homeownership across countries and time, centre-left parties have oscillated between a pro-homeownership and a pro-rental position. The former occurs in Anglo-Saxon, Northern and Southern European countries, while the latter prevails among German-speaking countries. Beyond partisan effects, once a country has a majority of homeowners and parties defending homeownership, larger parties are more likely to support it. The extent of centre-left parties’ support for homeownership is further associated with higher homeownership rates, more encouraging mortgage regimes and a bigger housing bubble burst after 2007. The ideational origins of the financialization of housing and private Keynesianism are, after all, not only conservative and market-liberal.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Kohl"", ""affiliation"": [""Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Paulstr. 3, 50676 Köln, Germany"", ""Uppsala University, Sociology, Institute for Housing and Urban Research, Trädgårdsgatan 18, 75309 Uppsala, Sweden""]}]","[""10.1080/0267303042000204340"", ""10.1177/0020715217712779"", ""10.1353/wp.0.0009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511730108"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000045"", ""10.1177/0959680113512731"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856X.2009.00377.x"", ""10.2307/421789"", ""10.1515/9781400886203"", ""10.1017/S0022050700011906"", ""10.1177/0032329215571288"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12015"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2008.00202.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1990.tb00234.x"", ""10.1515/9781400822416"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiv017"", ""10.4324/9781315166247"", ""10.4324/9781315628455"", ""10.1177/0032329218755750"", ""10.1177/0958928714556969"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1449"", ""10.1080/02673037.2015.1061107"", ""10.1080/02673039608720847"", ""10.1177/0032329211434690"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226774220.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074333""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

The article first sets the background by exploring the main features of EMU before COVID‐19. Subsequently, it examines the multiplicity of policies deployed by the EU institutions to contain the socio‐economic damages of the pandemic – including, most crucially, the EU recovery fund ""Next Generation EU"" – and underlines their transformative effect on the EU architecture of economic governance. As the article argues, the responses to COVID‐19 have produced a significant rebalancing of EMU, bridging the asymmetry between EU monetary and economic policy. Finally, the article considers whether the COVID‐19‐related responses are likely to be only temporary, or rather a new normal for EMU, and sheds light on further constitutional adaptations which are needed to sustain this unprecedented transfer of fiscal power to the EU level.","[{""name"": ""Federico Fabbrini"", ""affiliation"": [""Dublin City University  Dublin""]}]","[""10.4337/9781788972345.00015"", ""10.1017/9781316877135"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc774qh"", ""10.30950/jcer.v12i1.696"", ""10.4337/9781788972345.00008"", ""10.1017/S1574019615000292"", ""10.1111/jcms.13276"", ""10.1080/00213624.1991.11505186"", ""10.1093/019829638X.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198749134.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198871262.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108680981"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511493997"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750380"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1982709"", ""10.54648/COLA2013161"", ""10.1017/9781316282557"", ""10.1080/07036337.2020.1730348"", ""10.4337/9781788972345.00009"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2180248"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3677152"", ""10.1093/0199241767.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716242.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1041417"", ""10.5040/9781509940653"", ""10.4337/9781788972345.00010"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107297289"", ""10.4337/9781789900859""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/pops.12669,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,The Influence of Identity Salience on Framing Effectiveness: An Experiment,"Efforts to influence attitudes on highly polarizing issues, such as climate change, often fail because individuals interpret political messages through the lens of their partisan identities. However, shifting the identity lens through which an individual interprets a message may result in more effective political communication. Through a preregistered survey experiment (n = 978), this study tested how priming either a partisan or a nonpartisan (parental) identity influenced the effectiveness of a climate change frame on several attitudinal outcomes. Findings suggest that identity salience—specifically partisan identity salience—can influence the effectiveness of a frame. Among Republican parents, receiving a message about the impact of climate change on future generations increased climate change concern and intended proclimate political behaviors, but this framing effect disappeared when a partisan identity was first primed. Among Democrat parents, framing had no significant effect until a partisan identity was first primed. The findings offer important insight into the role that identity salience plays in framing effectiveness and suggest that political communication on polarized issues is likely to be more effective at building bipartisan agreement when nonpartisan identities are salient.","[{""name"": ""Emily P.

Legislators who share descriptive features with disadvantaged groups do not necessarily represent their group interests. Instead, Members of Parliament (MPs) strategically choose when to engage with the policy topic of their corresponding groups. MPs represent their respective group at the beginning of their career because it confers credibility when they have no legislative track record and few opportunities to demonstrate expertise. These group-specific efforts are replaced by other legislative activities at later stages of their careers. The authors apply this theoretical expectation across four disadvantaged groups – women, migrants, low social class and the young – and thereby offer a broad perspective on descriptive representation.

10.1093/afraf/adz024,AFRICAN AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science; 0705 Geography,THE MOTIVATIONS AND DYNAMICS OF ZIMBABWE'S 2017 MILITARY COUP,"ABSTRACT Robert Mugabe resigned as Zimbabwe’s president in November 2017, following a military action called Operation Restore Legacy. This article examines the motivations and dynamics of Operation Restore Legacy, which it characterizes as a coup by military generals that had significant commonalities with historical coups in Africa. This characterization, which is informed by the accounts of coup participants and a reading of the literature, challenges interpretations of the coup as ‘a non-coup-coup’, ‘very Zimbabwean’, or ‘special’. The article argues that the coup was a vote of no confidence in Mugabe’s leadership, which succeeded because soldiers from Zimbabwe’s 1970s independence war subscribed to the coup’s stated ideal to restore liberation struggle principles in the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front party as well as party members who had been sidelined. Liberation war veterans held decisive army and air force command posts when the coup occurred. The article’s emphasis on liberation struggle principles as a crucial determinant of the coup’s success is a counterpoint to game theoretic approaches to coup dynamics that disregard political beliefs as a consequential factor in the realization of coups. In respect of motivations, the article advances interrelating motives and contends that the coup’s catalyst was Mugabe’s refusal to meet his generals on 13 November 2017, for vital talks on widening differences between both parties. Sealing off dialogue catalyzed the coup.","[{""name"": ""Blessing-Miles Tendi"", ""affiliation"": [""African Politics in the University of Oxford’s Department of Politics and International Relations""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It provides an account of the origins of TWAIL and the political and intellectual context in which it emerged during the 1990s. It outlines some of the key themes and concerns of TWAIL – including ‘colonial continuities’, ‘capitalism, imperialism and political economy’, and ‘TWAIL and History’. It argues that the distinction between the ‘First’ and ‘Third’ Worlds continues to be relevant by examining the operation of this distinction in various fields of international law, such as the use of force, international migration law and human rights. The Foreword then outlines two of the author’s current research projects on themes that have been of major interest to TWAIL scholars: first, human rights and their relationship to imperialism; and second, race and reparations. The Foreword concludes by arguing that ‘Third World Approaches to International Law’ are relevant, not simply for the ‘third world’, but for the entire globe; it urges us to consider TWAIL as a cosmopolitan project.","[{""name"": ""Antony Anghie"", ""affiliation"": [""Professor of Law, National University of Singapore and University of Utah , USA"", ""Head of Teaching and Researching International Law in Asia unit, Centre for International Law, National University of Singapore""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000181,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,"Power, Control, and the Logic of Substitution in Institutional Design: The Case of International Climate Finance","AbstractHow do powerful states control international organizations (IOs)? In contrast to the conventional wisdom that treats weighted voting rules as the primary means that powerful states use to codify their asymmetric control in institutional design, we propose that funding rules are equally important. Our framework develops a logic of substitution whereby permissive earmark rules—that allow donors to stipulate how their contributions to an IO are used—are a design substitute for weighted voting from wealthy states’ perspective. Whether asymmetric control is incorporated in design through voting or funding rules depends on whether egalitarian norms emphasizing political and legal equality, or shareholder norms emphasizing influence commensurate with financial power, govern voting and representation rights at the IO. Focusing on the domain of climate finance, we demonstrate that weighted voting rules are used at international climate finance institutions (ICFIs) associated with multilateral development banks, but that wealthy states pursued permissive earmark rules at ICFIs within the United Nations system where egalitarian norms are strong. In this way, powerful donors can exert control over resource allocation even when developing states appear to hold equal influence on governing bodies. In addition to providing a reassessment of how power translates into control at IOs, our framework offers insight into forum-shopping behavior and sheds light on substitution dynamics that involve other dimensions of design across a range of issue areas.","[{""name"": ""Erin R.

10.1017/psrm.2021.36,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,Politicians unleashed? Political communication on Twitter and in parliament in Western Europe,"AbstractTwitter is a prominent communication tool for politicians with two potential uses: as a “substitute” channel to circumvent constraints from other political arenas, or as an “amplifier” that reinforces party messages. Using a novel dataset containing tweets and parliamentary speeches by members of parliament (MPs) in seven countries, we estimate politicians’ positions and intra-party dissent on European integration. We find that MPs’ sentiment about Europe on Twitter is a valid measure of their party's position, while also uncovering intra-party disagreements. Our results suggest that most MPs amplify the partisan message, but MPs who participate less in parliamentary debate tend to have larger differences with their party on Twitter. Social media thus can free politicians from their party's grip.","[{""name"": ""Bruno Castanho Silva"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sven-Oliver Proksch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/1369183X.2019.1665990"", ""10.1080/10584609.2019.1666942"", ""10.21105/joss.00774"", ""10.31235/osf.io/cd2qs"", ""10.1111/jcom.12259"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1334728"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511576614"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000817"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2013.782330"", ""10.1111/jcc4.12143"", ""10.1111/lsq.12218"", ""10.1080/13572334.2011.545181"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042214-044157"", ""10.1080/19331681.2014.994158"", ""10.1016/0261-3794(94)00035-2"", ""10.1007/s11127-019-00644-0"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9228-2"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.025"", ""10.1177/0894439315602662"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.26"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1181871"", ""10.1080/15205436.2015.1045149"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107477971"", ""10.1177/1354068816654325"", ""10.1080/13572330600739413"", ""10.1386/jmpr.11.2.145_1"", ""10.1093/pan/mpu011"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0145406"", ""10.1177/1461444813487955"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12350"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0128337"", ""10.1017/S002238161100171X"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.671234"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00565.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139680752"", ""10.1080/17512786.2013.802481"", ""10.1080/19331681.2016.1160263"", ""10.1177/1461444814562445""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1111/psj.12341,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Multiple Partial Couplings in the Multiple Streams Framework: The Case of Extreme Weather and Climate Change Adaptation,"In this paper, I draw insights from a detailed case study of adaptation policymaking to develop a novel interpretation of John Kingdon's original work that shows how policy entrepreneurs can couple the problem, policy, and political streams through multiple partial couplings. Researchers and policymakers often assume that extreme weather opens a window to adopt policies aimed at adapting to long‐term climate change. However, empirical evidence shows that crises can redirect attention to urgent, short‐term goals. Using the Multiple Streams lens in an abductive case study, I investigate how these competing forces interact to influence the policy process. By unpacking Kingdon's familiar “streams” metaphor and elaborating his overlooked concept of partial couplings, I illustrate how the policy entrepreneurs' strategy of issue linking explains Australia's adoption of the 2007 Water Act, one of the world's first major adaptation policies, at the height of its decade‐long Millennium Drought. Employing this novel theoretical understanding offers new insights into this important case. I conclude by developing tentative hypotheses for testing in future studies.","[{""name"": ""Dana A.

10.1111/ajps.12563,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Multidimensional Representation,"AbstractThe study of representation is a major research field in quantitative political science. Since the early 2000s, it has been accompanied by a range of important conceptual innovations by political theorists working on the topic. Yet, although many quantitative scholars are familiar with the conceptual literature, even the most complex quantitative studies eschew engaging with the “new wave” of more sophisticated concepts of representation that theorists have developed. We discuss what we take to be the main reasons for this gap between theory and empirics, and present four novel conceptions of representation that are both sensitive to theorists’ conceptual impulses and operationalizable for quantitative scholars. In doing so, we advance an alternative research agenda on representation that moves significantly beyond the status quo of the field.","[{""name"": ""Fabio Wolkenstein"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher Wratil"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400882731"", ""10.1177/1065912916675737"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2010.00835.x"", ""10.1177/1354068811436037"", ""10.1177/0010414006299095"", ""10.1080/17457280903450724"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000058"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr048"", ""10.1177/0010414015626447"", ""10.1111/ajps.12018"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001708"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000223"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00096.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2006.00568.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00449.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810060"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000602"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12201"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs052"", ""10.1177/0032321717723514"", ""10.2307/439692"", ""10.2307/1951941"", ""10.1017/S0003055400265143"", ""10.1111/ajps.12000"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1111/ajps.12164"", ""10.1017/S000712341000013X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00584.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511576614"", ""10.1177/1354068813519967"", ""10.2307/1963634"", ""10.1007/s11127-010-9649-y"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000856"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00337.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000189"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3049294"", ""10.2307/2109198"", ""10.1080/714003903"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00515"", ""10.1525/9780520340503"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139680752"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00365.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090261"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000190"", ""10.1177/0010414015621078"", ""10.1017/S1537592715000079"", ""10.1057/palgrave.cpt.9300234"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00309.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199579389.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000471"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000137"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000375"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139175104.007"", ""10.2307/2082973"", ""10.1080/13572339808420538"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12119"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000074"", ""10.1111/lsq.12147""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['General Social Sciences', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Monetary, fiscal and financial dominance in the Eurozone","Abstract The rise of central bankers to the status of new ‘masters of the universe’ has been matched by mounting allegations of political overreach. In the Eurozone, for instance, the European Central Bank has increasingly been accused of straying into the fiscal realm. Why do politically independent central banks engage intensely and publicly with government policies, thereby threatening the neat separation between monetary and fiscal policy that was meant to protect central banks themselves from interference? While existing political economy accounts have focused squarely on the issues of government debt and central bankers’ fears of fiscal dominance, we argue for the emerging role of ‘financial dominance’ throughout the crisis, thereby shedding light on the structural forces that master the new masters of the universe. To this end, we pursue a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative text analysis techniques with a qualitative understanding of the context in which central banks communicate on fiscal policy.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Diessner"", ""affiliation"": [""European Institute, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Giulio Lisi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Government, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139506762"", ""10.2307/2077833"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2012.12.001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190600389.001.0001"", ""10.1086/261167"", ""10.1111/1467-856X.12044"", ""10.1162/002081802760403748"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00226"", ""10.1257/jel.46.4.910"", ""10.1007/s11127-011-9843-6"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000058"", ""10.1162/jeea_a_00025"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1252415"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00159"", ""10.1080/03050620903329025"", ""10.1111/jcms.12426"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grs038"", ""10.1093/wber/9.3.397"", ""10.1080/07036337.2015.1079370"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1019551"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64012-9_4"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-071112-221121"", ""10.1177/0003122417728240"", ""10.1080/09692299408434269"", ""10.1080/09538259.2014.881010"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1207699"", ""10.1080/09692290.2014.932829"", ""10.1016/S0176-2680(98)00015-9"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511720567"", ""10.1093/qje/qjx045"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198755739.003.0008"", ""10.1080/1350176042000273568"", ""10.1007/s10663-014-9260-4"", ""10.1080/09692290.2013.804854"", ""10.7591/9781501731624"", ""10.1007/s11186-007-9043-z"", ""10.1086/260580"", ""10.1111/1468-0491.t01-1-00209"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1069374"", ""10.1017/S1537592717002171"", ""10.1080/713601585"", ""10.1017/S1053837215000061"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000416"", ""10.1111/jcms.12351"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1186389"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262019576.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1465116518769753"", ""10.1111/j.1759-3441.2011.00106.x"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801452352.001.0001"", ""10.1080/07036337.2013.774786""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

Recent scholarship on historical East Asian orders challenges these notions. The fundamental organizing principle in historical East Asia was hierarchy, not sovereign equality. The region was characterized by hegemony, not balance of power. This emerging research program has direct implications for enduring questions about the relative importance of cultural and material factors in both international orders and their influence on behavior—for describing and explaining patterns of war and peace across time and space, for understanding East Asia as a region made up of more than just China, and for more usefully comparing East Asia, Europe, and other regions of the world.","[{""name"": ""David C.

10.1093/ia/iiaa171,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Infrastructure and Chinese power,"Abstract China's increasing material capabilities stand at the heart of the US–China power transition debate. The focus on material power reflects a realist definition of power based on the possession of resources. However, material capabilities do not necessarily translate into influence and do not always determine outcomes. Non-material power matters at least as much as material capabilities. This article argues that China under President Xi Jinping views power differently from previous generations of Chinese leaders. While material power remains important, Xi has paid greater attention to strengthening Chinese non-material power, in particular structural power and discursive power. This article examines Chinese structural and discursive power, the third and fourth faces of power, through the lens of Xi's mega-infrastructure vision, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It argues that power, both material and non-material, is embedded in infrastructure. Specifically, the article uses case-studies of Chinese construction of high-speed railways in Laos and Indonesia to illustrate the effects of Chinese structural and discursive power. Based on field work and in-depth interviews, the cases show that China is relatively successful in wielding structural and discursive power in Laos and Indonesia, despite the differences in the two countries’ political systems, and economic and population sizes. Chinese domination, however, does not mean that subordinate states do not have agency. For instance, there is resistance against the narrative of a pre-eminent Chinese civilization in Chinese discourse, as the Indonesia case demonstrates. Exploring the different facets of Chinese power is critical for a proper understanding of how China strives to shape the structure and discourse of the global order.","[{""name"": ""Selina Ho"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"
10.1111/twec.13209,WORLD ECONOMY,0302 Political Science; 0201 Theoretical Economics; 0202 Applied Economics; 1202 Business Administration,Global value chain participation and its impact on industrial upgrading,"AbstractParticipation in global value chains (GVCs) has become a central topic in trade and development policy. It has opened new ways to achieve industrial upgrading. However, some theoretical models suggest that not all countries will upgrade through participation in GVCs. Using panel data from the World Input‐Output Database, we examine the effects of backward and forward GVC participation on three dimensions of industrial upgrading (process, product and skill upgrading). We find that backward GVC participation provides more upgrading opportunities for developing countries as it enables a less developed country to import sophisticated inputs. This activates learning through embodied knowledge. In contrast, forward participation has higher level of upgrading effect on developed countries.","[{""name"": ""Kailan Tian"", ""affiliation"": [""NCMIS, MADIS Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Erik Dietzenbacher"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Economics and Business University of Groningen Groningen Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Richard Jong‐A‐Pin"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Economics and Business University of Groningen Groningen Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1007/s10842-011-0107-4"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.010"", ""10.1111/twec.12189"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2013.10.002"", ""10.1007/s10368-014-0271-1"", ""10.1257/0895330042632753"", ""10.1111/twec.12801"", ""10.1093/icc/dtp032"", ""10.1080/09535314.2012.761180"", ""10.1080/09692290500049805"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2011.07.004"", ""10.1016/S0022-1996(00)00093-3"", ""10.1080/0034340022000022198"", ""10.1257/aer.104.2.459"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-8007"", ""10.1093/wbro/lkr007"", ""10.1142/S179396901250001X"", ""10.1111/jors.12121"", ""10.1016/j.jmoneco.2006.05.009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511626982"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.12.016"", ""10.1080/00220388.2019.1702159"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.05.013"", ""10.1257/mac.2.2.227"", ""10.1093/qje/qjs047"", ""10.1257/0895330042162403"", ""10.1080/09535314.2019.1610728"", ""10.1093/jeg/lby056"", ""10.18356/a3836fcc-en"", ""10.3386/w23222""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Strategy and Management', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"

We theorize that parties select candidates based on gendered criteria, leading to the (s)election of more disciplined women. Moreover, we argue that gendered expectations about proper behavior limit women legislators’ ability to act independently from their parties. Using surveys from over 800 parliamentarians across 17 African legislatures, we find that women report significantly higher levels of party discipline than do their men copartisans. From this survey data and new legislative speech data, we also find support for our proposed causal mechanisms. Further, we find that among women parliamentarians, party discipline is negatively correlated with the prioritization of womens rights. A qualitative case study of the Namibian Parliament illustrates our findings. We discuss the implications of our results for women’s legislative effectiveness, for the substantive representation of women’s interests in policy making, and for the continued democratization of emerging party systems.","[{""name"": ""AMANDA CLAYTON"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""PÄR ZETTERBERG"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1743923X16000453"", ""10.1017/S1468109910000058"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199830091.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511782220"", ""10.5129/001041516819197539"", ""10.1515/9781626371118-005"", ""10.1057/9781137296740"", ""10.1080/00344890802079573"", ""10.1177/0010414015574880"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490996"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2008.00593.x"", ""10.7910/DVN/WQ1R5X"", ""10.2307/4150149"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174657"", ""10.1177/0010414018758767"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2009.01279.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123403000164"", ""10.1111/lsq.12184"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12141"", ""10.1177/0010414020926194"", ""10.1017/9781316562888"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316534281"", ""10.4324/9780429284311"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107045484"", ""10.1177/0010414006297342"", ""10.1017/9781108684651"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511576614"", ""10.1177/1354068814549346"", ""10.1177/1065912919861443"", ""10.1515/9781626371255"", ""10.1515/9781626371255-008"", ""10.1080/00344893.2014.951232"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.109.3.573"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000382"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316336014"", ""10.1017/S1743923X13000196"", ""10.1016/0261-3794(94)00035-2"", ""10.1111/ajps.12075"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2021.1882826"", ""10.1177/0010414006299095"", ""10.1093/pa/gsw011"", ""10.1515/9781626371118"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2013.05.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139519755"", ""10.1086/697251"", ""10.1017/S0022278X04000370"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.5"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2020.102369"", ""10.1017/S1743923X18000673"", ""10.1177/0010414013516068"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199830091.003.0008""]",['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Yet, most research examines a single context at a time—usually US national elections, where partisanship is strong—and employs surveys and experiments, raising concerns that citizens’ responses may not reflect how they actually vote. By analyzing returns from thousands of nonpartisan local elections, we test whether patterns of women's win rates relative to men's match expectations for how the electoral effects of gender stereotyping should vary by context. We find women have greater advantages over men in city council than mayoral races, still greater advantages in school board races, and decreasing advantages in more conservative constituencies. Thus, women fare better in stereotype-congruent contexts and worse in incongruent contexts. These effects are most pronounced during on-cycle elections, when voters tend to know less about local candidates.","[{""name"": ""Sarah F.

Given the significant growth of studies concerned with this phenomenon over the last decade, this forum critically engages with the present state of the field. First, we canvass some of the most important theoretical developments to demonstrate the heterogeneity of the debate. Second, we expand on the theme of complexity and investigate its multiple facets as a window into pushing the debate forward. Third, we draw the contours of a future research agenda by highlighting some contemporary problems, puzzles, and challenges to empirical data collection. In essence, we seek to connect two main literatures that have been talking past each other: external support in civil wars and proxy warfare. The forum bridges this gap at a critical juncture in this new and emerging scholarship by offering space for scholarly dialogue across conceptual labels.","[{""name"": ""Niklas Karlén"", ""affiliation"": [""Swedish Defence University, Stockholm, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Vladimir Rauta"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Reading, Reading, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Idean Salehyan"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Texas, Denton, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew Mumford"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Belgin San-Akca"", ""affiliation"": [""Koç University, Istanbul, Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Alexandra Stark"", ""affiliation"": [""New America, Washington, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Michel Wyss"", ""affiliation"": [""Military Academy at ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Assaf Moghadam"", ""affiliation"": [""Reichman University, Herzliya, Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Allard Duursma"", ""affiliation"": [""ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Henning Tamm"", ""affiliation"": [""University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Erin K Jenne"", ""affiliation"": [""Central European University, Vienna, Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Milos Popovic"", ""affiliation"": [""Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""David S Siroky"", ""affiliation"": [""Arizona State University, Tempe, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Vanessa Meier"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford, Oxford, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Alexandra Chinchilla"", ""affiliation"": [""Dartmouth College, Hanover, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Kit Rickard"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London, London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Giuseppe Spatafora"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford, Oxford, UK""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198855057.001.0001"", ""10.9783/9780812295023"", ""10.1177/001083678401900405"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2017.1366621"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.02.002"", ""10.1080/01402390.2016.1202822"", ""10.1080/00396338.2013.823022"", ""10.1016/j.orbis.2016.05.009"", ""10.1080/01436597.2017.1333417"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2020.1738682"", ""10.1111/j.1528-3585.2009.00389.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051915-045433"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000284"", ""10.1080/01436599913938"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2015.1018024"", ""10.1080/14702436.2020.1807338"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.526"", ""10.1177/002234338101800404"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000041"", ""10.1177/0022002715576746"", ""10.1017/9781108784979"", ""10.1080/03050629.2021.1848824"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1386936"", ""10.1163/15718069-BJA10013"", ""10.1177/0022343320940749"", ""10.2307/jj.4256610"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.013.641"", ""10.1177/0022343319885181"", ""10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00323.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000286"", ""10.1177/0022343317700465"", ""10.1080/09546553.2017.1282861"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2020.1835002"", ""10.1177/0022343398035001002"", ""10.2307/2600702"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.032108.135916"", ""10.2307/2555889"", ""10.1080/01402390.2013.878656"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491511"", ""10.1353/book26554"", ""10.1177/0022002720912823"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00759.x"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy034"", ""10.2307/3013515"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00377"", ""10.1017/S0020818303572010"", ""10.1177/0022002719826645"", ""10.4324/9781003213710"", ""10.1080/09546553.2015.1092437"", ""10.1080/03050629.2017.1414812"", ""10.1177/0047117818802436"", ""10.1080/03071847.2020.1736437"", ""10.1080/13523260.2020.1800240"", ""10.1080/13698249.2021.1860578"", ""10.1177/0022002702046001004"", ""10.1177/0022002706291579"", ""10.1177/0022343313505303"", ""10.1177/0022002709357890"", ""10.1017/S0020818311000233"", ""10.1017/S002081831400006X"", ""10.1177/0022002713498698"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190250881.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0022002715600761"", ""10.1080/03050629.2021.1922899"", ""10.1177/0022343307075121"", ""10.4324/9780203799451"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00252"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw033"", ""10.1111/ajps.12196"", ""10.1177/0022343314523807""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/twec.13311,WORLD ECONOMY,0302 Political Science; 0201 Theoretical Economics; 0202 Applied Economics; 1202 Business Administration,Estimating the economic effects of sanctions on Russia: An Allied trade embargo,"AbstractThis article contributes to the ongoing discussion on the use of sanctions as a coercive tool of international policymaking, focusing on the economic effects of the sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Using CGE modelling, we explore the short‐ to medium‐term economic effects of a possible trade embargo by Allied countries imposed on Russia. We consider the Allied trade embargo as a set of comprehensive trade sanctions that include (i) import‐related measures, (ii) export‐related measures, (iii) FDI‐related measures and (iv) increased trade costs between Russia and non‐Allies. We find that Russia would sustain sizable losses upwards of 14% of real GDP from an Allied trade embargo, even in the short run. Allied economies are unevenly affected by the sanctions, with real GDP losses between 0.1% and 1.6%. Non‐Allied economies benefit from some trade diversion but experience even larger losses from the increased costs of trading and doing business with Russia. China joining the embargo resulted in greater economic losses for Russia; Allied economies and China would be adversely affected by this move. Finally, Russia would suffer significantly higher losses if it were enacting countersanctions, rather than resigning itself to being a sanction target.","[{""name"": ""Kornel Mahlstein"", ""affiliation"": [""Sidley Austin LLP Geneva Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Christine McDaniel"", ""affiliation"": [""Mercatus Center at George Mason University Arlington Virginia USA""]}, {""name"": ""Simon Schropp"", ""affiliation"": [""Sidley Austin LLP and The George Washington University Washington, DC USA""]}, {""name"": ""Marinos Tsigas"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Consultant Economist Rockville Maryland USA""]}]","[""10.21642/GTAP.WP91"", ""10.1017/9781108881364.010"", ""10.1023/A:1008739609685"", ""10.1007/BF00123638"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4148464""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Development']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12513,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,"Emotions, governmental trust and support for the restriction of civil liberties during the covid-19 pandemic","AbstractThe Covid‐19 pandemic brought unprecedented governmental restrictions to personal and political freedoms. This article investigates individual‐level differences in mass support for the restriction of civil liberties during the first wave of the Covid‐19 pandemic. Employing theories of affect and decision making, it assesses the extent to which different emotional reactions toward the pandemic influenced attitudes toward mobile phone surveillance and the implementation of curfews. We test our hypotheses in five advanced European democracies using panel data which allow us to identify the role of emotions in support for restrictive policies controlling for individual heterogeneity. The results suggest that experiencing fear about Covid‐19 had a strong positive impact on supporting these measures, while hope and anger only played a minimal role. Importantly, the findings indicate that emotions moderate the impact of trust toward the government, a key variable for supporting the restriction of civil liberties during the pandemic. Specifically, experiencing fear was associated with higher acceptance of civil liberty restrictions. Further, experiencing fear substantially decreased the effect of trust in the government, rendering those who lack trust toward the government more supportive of civil liberty restrictions. These findings help us understand the psychological mechanisms that leads citizens to swiftly decide to sacrifice their civil liberties in the light of threat. Further, they offer empirical support for the causal role of affect in political decision‐making.","[{""name"": ""PAVLOS VASILOPOULOS"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics University of York UK""]}, {""name"": ""HALEY MCAVAY"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology University of York UK""]}, {""name"": ""SYLVAIN BROUARD"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Political Research (CEVIPOF), Sciences Po France""]}, {""name"": ""MARTIAL FOUCAULT"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Political Research (CEVIPOF), Sciences Po France""]}]","[""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.3.1015"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139963107"", ""10.4135/9781412993869"", ""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.31235/osf.io/dkusw"", ""10.31234/osf.io/8e4pa"", ""10.1177/1536867X20930984"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107279247"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00561.x"", ""10.1126/science.abd9006"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12401"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00130.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199760107.013.0006"", ""10.1101/2021.09.08.21263310"", ""10.1017/S0008423920000335"", ""10.1080/17457289.2021.1924750"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00054.x"", ""10.1177/1478929920948684"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.61.4.629"", ""10.1111/1475‐6765.12467"", ""10.1080/01402382.2021.1900669"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1630470"", ""10.1111/spsr.12462"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12419"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00077"", ""10.1177/019027250707000303"", ""10.1080/01402382.2021.1930463"", ""10.1111/pops.12225"", ""10.1093/poq/nfv083"", ""10.1007/s11469‐020‐00281‐5"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105236"", ""10.2307/2586304"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00514.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802331"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226574431.003.0009"", ""10.1080/13501763.2021.1942151"", ""10.1080/01402382.2021.1925821"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00248.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00626.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00805.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.1037/pspp0000083"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.01433"", ""10.1080/026999300402763"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146"", ""10.1007/s11109‐021‐09729‐3"", ""10.1007/s11673-020-10016-9"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226574431.003.0006"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00440.x"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.65"", ""10.1111/pops.12571"", ""10.1145/358916.361990"", ""10.1111/spsr.12450"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00772.x"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12425"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-0928-y"", ""10.1073/pnas.2010625117"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.48.4.813"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2017.12.003"", ""10.31124/advance.13333697.v1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614712"", ""10.1111/pops.12463"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2017.07.003"", ""10.2307/2657610"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000939"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00625.x"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy003"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0884-z"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12115"", ""10.1111/pops.12639"", ""10.1111/pops.12439"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9241-5"", ""10.1111/pops.12693"", ""10.1093/sf/soy027"", ""10.5964/jspp.v5i1.471"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12424""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

I review the history of the debate and summarize patterns visible in data available today. I find a strong and consistent relationship between higher income and both democratization and democratic survival in the medium term (10–20 years), but not necessarily in shorter time windows. Building on several recent studies, I sketch out a new conditional modernization theory, which can account for such lags. The key idea is that the effect of development on democracy is triggered by disruptive events such as economic crises, military defeats, or—most generally—leader change. Political outcomes depend on both the development level and, at intermediate income ranges, how citizens coordinate. Waves of leader turnover in autocracies correlate with temporarily stronger links between income and democratization, which, in turn, coincide with the first two waves of democracy.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Treisman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095-1472, USA;""]}]","[""10.1146/annurev-economics-080213-041119"", ""10.1162/003355302320935025"", ""10.1257/aer.98.3.808"", ""10.1086/700936"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510809"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316227107"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511843686"", ""10.1177/003232928501400102"", ""10.3386/w16832"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2007.01.018"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804960"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000402"", ""10.1177/0010414012463905"", ""10.1353/wp.2003.0019"", ""10.1177/0010414005276666"", ""10.2307/20031707"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00463.x"", ""10.1086/690951"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625626"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510052"", ""10.1093/restud/rdt020"", ""10.1093/qje/qjr038"", ""10.1093/jleo/ewp011"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790881"", ""10.1257/mac.1.2.55"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000162"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12282"", ""10.2307/2010422"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609336"", ""10.1353/jod.1996.0068"", ""10.1353/jod.0.0089"", ""10.2307/1951731"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00595.x"", ""10.1007/s10887-013-9100-6"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511575839"", ""10.1525/9780520336582"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804946"", ""10.1515/9781400841929"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000082"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77h28"", ""10.1177/0010414015581050"", ""10.1080/13510347.2012.737321"", ""10.1111/ajps.12135"", ""10.2307/2952354"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107045279""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

A firm-level study,"AbstractIn the last decade, a growing number of studies have addressed the ongoing debate about whether corruption “sands” or “greases” the wheels of business at the firm level. This study revisits this debate and proposes a comprehensive theoretical framework to test whether corruption harms or boosts firm performance, as well as the extent to which this relationship is mediated by the countries’ institutional settings, the size and strategic behaviour of the firms, and market competition. Based on a sample of 21,250 firms located in 117 emerging and developing countries, and resorting to instrumental variable (IV) estimations, three main results were found: (a) regardless of the proxy used for corruption and firm performance, the former clearly harms the latter; (b) corruption “greases the wheels” of business for African firms but it “sands the wheels” for firms in Latin America, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Southern Asia; and (c) the negative impact of corruption on performance is mitigated for larger and exporting firms.","[{""name"": ""Lurdes Martins"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Economics and Management University of Minho Braga Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Jorge Cerdeira"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Economics and Management University of Minho Braga Portugal"", ""Institute of Sociology (IS‐UP) University of Porto Porto Portugal"", ""CEOS.PP   ISCAP P.Porto Porto Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Aurora A.C.

This article makes the contrasting case that core values concerning equality and government intervention versus individualism and free enterprise are fundamental orientations that can themselves shape partisanship. The authors evaluate these arguments in the British case using a validated multiple-item measure of core values, using ordered latent class models to estimate reciprocal effects with partisanship on panel data from the British Household Panel Study, 1991–2007. The findings demonstrate that core values are more stable than partisanship and have far stronger cross-lagged effects on partisanship than vice versa in both polarized and depolarized political contexts, for younger and older respondents, and for those with differing levels of educational attainment and income, thus demonstrating their general utility as decision-making heuristics.","[{""name"": ""Geoffrey Evans"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anja Neundorf"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1017/S0007123405000347"", ""10.4159/9780674043848"", ""10.1201/9780203489437"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674428522"", ""10.4135/9781412984713"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-22368-8"", ""10.1177/0010414005285758"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199226436.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.02.003"", ""10.1086/229744"", ""10.1080/1368988042000258763"", ""10.1007/BF01498826"", ""10.1177/2041905816666122"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199296316.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2110772"", ""10.1080/13689880600950535"", ""10.1177/0010414011421764"", ""10.1093/poq/nfi058"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199244003.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2111402"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00197"", ""10.2307/2669334"", ""10.1023/A:1021226224601"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00196.x"", ""10.2307/2111583"", ""10.4324/9781315859057"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00671.x"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000618"", ""10.2307/591118"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001575"", ""10.1177/1354068897003001003"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2003.10.001"", ""10.1093/parlij/54.4.590"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00270"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198755753.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006815"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2009.05.005"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000964"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080210"", ""10.1017/S0007123498000222"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000642"", ""10.2307/2111666"", ""10.1016/0261-3794(92)90032-2"", ""10.1093/pa/gsv005"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-02048-5"", ""10.2307/2647642"", ""10.1257/jep.20.2.97"", ""10.1086/590649"", ""10.1080/13689880108413051"", ""10.1017/S0007123410000463"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9236-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511596872"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00454.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00380.x"", ""10.7910/DVN/VJTN9Z"", ""10.2307/2111130"", ""10.4135/9781446286395"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00161.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000318""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S000305542000115X,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Control without Confirmation: The Politics of Vacancies in Presidential Appointments,"Scholarship on separation of powers assumes executives are constrained by legislative approval when placing agents in top policy-making positions. But presidents frequently fill vacancies in agency leadership with unconfirmed, temporary officials or leave them empty entirely. I develop a novel dataset of vacancies across 15 executive departments from 1977 to 2016 and reevaluate the conventional perspective that appointment power operates only through formal channels. I argue that presidents’ nomination strategies include leaving positions empty and making interim appointments, and this choice reflects presidents’ priorities and the character of vacant positions. The evidence indicates that interim appointees are more likely when positions have a substantial capacity to act on presidential expansion priorities and suggest that presidents can capitalize on their first-mover advantage to evade Senate confirmation. The results further suggest that separation of powers models may need to consider how deliberate inaction and sidestepping of formal powers influence political control and policy-making strategies.","[{""name"": ""CHRISTINA M.

10.1111/1475-6765.12414,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,"Under pressure. Economic constraints, electoral politics and labour market reforms in Southern Europe in the decade of the Great Recession","AbstractEven when subject to comparable exogenous constraints during the Eurozone crisis and in its immediate aftermath, governments in Southern Europe have pursued distinct labour market reform agendas. What room for manoeuvre did governments of crisis‐struck peripheral countries really have in shaping their labour market reform strategies, and how can we account for the observed variation? We address these questions by making a twofold contribution to the debate on the political economy of austerity in the Eurozone periphery. First, through the first systematic analysis of all labour market and collective bargaining (CB) reforms implemented in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece over 2009–2019, we identify those elements of core labour market deregulation common across Southern European countries (namely, the loosening of employment protection for workers on open‐ended contracts and the decentralisation of CB to the firm level); and those elements of variation, both cross‐country and cross‐party, in the content of corollary labour market interventions that accompanied this core deregulation. Second, we explain these similarities and variations in reform outcomes as the product of the interaction of two factors: economic constraints and electoral dynamics. We argue that the implementation of the common core of deregulation is linked to the exogenous pressure to improve export competitiveness to which Southern European countries have been subjected since the crisis. Through the combination of survey data analysis and qualitative evidence, we then show empirically how the variation in the corollary measures accompanying deregulation is linked to the class composition of the electoral social blocs Southern European partisan governments rely on or aim to assemble. Based on this analysis, we identify four ideal‐typical labour market reformist strategies attempted by Southern European governments during the decade of the Great Recession. The analysis highlights that although domestic politics plays a crucial role in shaping structural adjustment under crisis conditions, not all reform strategies are equally viable within the framework of Economic and Monetary Union.","[{""name"": ""FABIO BULFONE"", ""affiliation"": [""Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies  Germany""]}, {""name"": ""ARIANNA TASSINARI"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social and Political Sciences European University Institute  Italy""]}]","[""10.1111/1475-6765.12317"", ""10.1080/13608746.2019.1644809"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.964644"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198787815.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ser/mwn018"", ""10.4324/9781315408422-2"", ""10.1093/indlaw/dws029"", ""10.1017/9781139088381"", ""10.1177/0032329216638053"", ""10.3998/mpub.9726915"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245"", ""10.1177/0010414019879963"", ""10.1093/ser/mwz040"", ""10.1177/1388262718763668"", ""10.1177/0032329216656840"", ""10.4324/9781315839486"", ""10.1080/13608746.2018.1525914"", ""10.1177/0010414016633224"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu026"", ""10.1017/S1755773916000217"", ""10.1111/jcms.12289"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1370442"", ""10.1093/indlaw/dws031"", ""10.1177/0958928715608795"", ""10.1177/0958928711418858"", ""10.2307/j.ctt21216s2.8"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12190"", ""10.1057/9780230504592"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12259"", ""10.1080/13608746.2019.1644813"", ""10.3167/ip.2015.300108"", ""10.1093/ser/mww042"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.920981"", ""10.1080/09692290.2020.1737564"", ""10.1179/1024529412Z.00000000013"", ""10.1057/cep.2014.42"", ""10.1080/13608746.2018.1433478"", ""10.1057/cep.2014.40"", ""10.1080/13608746.2019.1644811"", ""10.1177/0010414015617967""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/poq/nfaa044,PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology; 0503 Journalism and Communication,UNDERSTANDING WILLINGNESS TO SHARE SMARTPHONE-SENSOR DATA,"Abstract The growing smartphone penetration and the integration of smartphones into people’s everyday practices offer researchers opportunities to augment survey measurement with smartphone-sensor measurement or to replace self-reports. Potential benefits include lower measurement error, a widening of research questions, collection of in situ data, and a lowered respondent burden. However, privacy considerations and other concerns may lead to nonparticipation. To date, little is known about the mechanisms of willingness to share sensor data by the general population, and no evidence is available concerning the stability of willingness. The present study focuses on survey respondents’ willingness to share data collected using smartphone sensors (GPS, camera, and wearables) in a probability-based online panel of the general population of the Netherlands. A randomized experiment varied study sponsor, framing of the request, the emphasis on control over the data collection process, and assurance of privacy and confidentiality. Respondents were asked repeatedly about their willingness to share the data collected using smartphone sensors, with varying periods before the second request. Willingness to participate in sensor-based data collection varied by the type of sensor, study sponsor, order of the request, respondent’s familiarity with the device, previous experience with participating in research involving smartphone sensors, and privacy concerns. Willingness increased when respondents were asked repeatedly and varied by sensor and task. The timing of the repeated request, one month or six months after the initial request, did not have a significant effect on willingness.","[{""name"": ""Bella Struminskaya"", ""affiliation"": [""Assistant professor in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Vera Toepoel"", ""affiliation"": [""Professor in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Peter Lugtig"", ""affiliation"": [""Associate professor in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Marieke Haan"", ""affiliation"": [""Assistant professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Annemieke Luiten"", ""affiliation"": [""Data collection specialist at Statistics Netherlands, Heerlen, the Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Barry Schouten"", ""affiliation"": [""Senior methodologist at Statistics Netherlands, The Hague, the Netherlands, and professor in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1177/0894439315574825"", ""10.1002/mar.20070"", ""10.1002/9781119041702.ch7"", ""10.29115/SP-2013-0020"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2015.12.022"", ""10.1002/9781118490082"", ""10.1086/269338"", ""10.1086/317990"", ""10.1177/1745691616650285"", ""10.1002/9781118763520.ch10"", ""10.1177/075910639504800109"", ""10.1136/jech-2017-209703"", ""10.1007/s11301-014-0111-y"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz007"", ""10.1177/0894439318816389"", ""10.1093/poq/nfu054"", ""10.1007/BF02295996"", ""10.1515/9780804772891"", ""10.1177/0907568212440014"", ""10.1177/1536867X0400400404"", ""10.1108/IntR-02-2015-0032"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.08.414"", ""10.1002/9781119041702.ch25"", ""10.1093/poq/nfu001"", ""10.1080/13645579.2014.899101"", ""10.1177/0759106310387713"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-15834-7_2"", ""10.1177/0049124115626176"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1177/2378023118779832"", ""10.1093/geronb/gbx063""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

We argue that economic sociologists should treat racism as a constitutive, structuring force, analytically co-equal with capitalism, patriarchy and nationalism. Our article has three aims. First, we document how canonical and award-winning works of economic sociology do not discuss race and racism, and do not engage with the contemporary sociology of race. Second, we identify six key insights from the sociology of race and suggest how they could influence economic sociology: the emergence of race out of racism, an understanding of racism as structural, the role of whiteness, the intersections between racism and other systems of oppression, the ideology of colorblind racism and the fundamental connections between racism and capitalism. Third, we conclude by discussing recent research that bridges the two subfields and lays the groundwork for an understanding of ‘racialized markets’ and ‘racialized economies’.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Hirschman"", ""affiliation"": [""Sociology Department, Brown University, Providence RI, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Laura Garbes"", ""affiliation"": [""Sociology Department, Brown University, Providence RI, USA""]}]","[""10.1177/0891243206289499"", ""10.1177/000312240707200301"", ""10.1111/1756-2171.12115"", ""10.9783/9780812293098"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226246376.001.0001"", ""10.9783/9780812294897"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674416345"", ""10.2307/2657316"", ""10.1515/9781685850272"", ""10.1177/0002764215586826"", ""10.1177/0896920513504600"", ""10.1086/669573"", ""10.1086/588738"", ""10.1146/annurev.economics.102308.124448"", ""10.1086/669608"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9558.2010.01370.x"", ""10.1177/2332649218783220"", ""10.2307/800672"", ""10.4324/9780203900055"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112142"", ""10.1007/s11186-006-9020-y"", ""10.2307/272191"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1007/s12114-014-9201-2"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2015.10.001"", ""10.1515/9780691229270"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12082"", ""10.1086/230450"", ""10.4324/9780203076828"", ""10.1177/0003122418767438"", ""10.1177/0735275114551611"", ""10.1086/494777"", ""10.1177/2332649216632242"", ""10.1080/01419870701568858"", ""10.1086/228311"", ""10.4159/9780674977792"", ""10.2307/3088922"", ""10.2307/1341787"", ""10.1086/678200"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.710585"", ""10.1177/0896920516670463"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00873.x"", ""10.1353/jaas.2015.0017"", ""10.4324/9781315527499"", ""10.1177/2332649218755178"", ""10.1177/000312240607100404"", ""10.1177/0002764298041007008"", ""10.1177/0003122418781774"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131647"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674067202"", ""10.1111/j.0735-2751.2004.00237.x"", ""10.1177/0891243216649929"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262134606.001.0001"", ""10.1111/cico.12179"", ""10.1017/S0010417514000061"", ""10.1086/426800"", ""10.1177/0003122415609730"", ""10.1093/ser/mwn016"", ""10.1093/socpro/spx012"", ""10.1177/0020731418759876"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1pwt9w5"", ""10.1177/0896920509347141"", ""10.4324/9780203076804"", ""10.1177/000312240907400505"", ""10.1515/9780691229270-011"", ""10.1073/pnas.1706255114"", ""10.1163/9789004291225_015"", ""10.1177/0003122418822335"", ""10.1111/soc4.12433"", ""10.1353/jer.2014.0043"", ""10.17351/ests2016.74"", ""10.2307/3097201"", ""10.4159/9780674988590"", ""10.1080/01419870.2016.1140793"", ""10.1177/0003122410380868"", ""10.1017/S1742058X13000180"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071312-145639"", ""10.1111/soc4.12493"", ""10.1177/2329496516686620"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226073675.001.0001"", ""10.1093/sf/soy051"", ""10.1177/000312240507000204"", ""10.7591/9781501717505"", ""10.1177/000312240607100403"", ""10.1177/0003122410388491"", ""10.2307/2096399"", ""10.1177/2332649217743771"", ""10.7758/9781610448840"", ""10.1177/0002764213503329"", ""10.1177/1476127006064068"", ""10.1111/soc4.12446""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1146/annurev-polisci-051120-125514,ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Three Faces of Climate Justice,"There is overwhelming consensus about the science of climate change. Climate politics, however, remains volatile, driven by perceptions of injustice, which motivate policy resistance and undermine policy legitimacy. We identify three types of injustice. The first pertains to the uneven exposure to climate change impacts across countries and communities within a country. Socially, politically, and economically disadvantaged communities that have contributed the least to the climate crisis tend to be affected the most. To address climate change and its impacts, countries and subnational units have enacted a range of policies. But even carefully designed mitigation and adaptation policies distribute costs (the second justice dimension) and benefits (the third justice dimension) unevenly across sectors and communities, often reproducing existing inequalities. Climate justice requires paying careful attention to who bears the costs and who gets the benefits of both climate inaction and action.","[{""name"": ""Nives Dolšak"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Marine and Environmental Affairs, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Aseem Prakash"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science and Center for Environmental Politics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA;""]}]","[""10.1080/13504851.2018.1542482"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102187"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00578"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6584.1998.tb02825.x"", ""10.1177/0739456X16645166"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.015"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173513"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab81c1"", ""10.1177/1070496503256500"", ""10.1111/0022-4537.00184"", ""10.1038/s41560-020-0641-6"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2014.07.006"", ""10.1111/gec3.12121"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0249315"", ""10.1016/j.tej.2017.10.006"", ""10.1080/08941920290069308"", ""10.1086/706793"", ""10.1111/padm.12657"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025739"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.011"", ""10.5840/eip20211292"", ""10.1093/afraf/adl042"", ""10.3197/096327106778226293"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.08.030"", ""10.1016/j.eneco.2012.03.007"", ""10.2143/EP.11.1.504779"", ""10.1257/jep.27.1.87"", ""10.1080/17524032.2018.1508046"", ""10.1007/s00181-013-0728-z"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112291"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2009.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2015.11.017"", ""10.7135/UPO9781843313465.014"", ""10.3197/096327197776679185"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7093.2007.00117.x"", ""10.1007/s10584-020-02697-3"", ""10.3386/w27205"", ""10.3390/cli8010012"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2014.06.006"", ""10.1177/2378023118816795"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2020.10.003"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx043"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2017.11.015"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.065"", ""10.1080/17524032.2019.1569544"", ""10.3763/cpol.2007.0468"", ""10.1002/pam.20404"", ""10.1007/s10806-018-9711-1"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1995.tb00511.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0220696"", ""10.1002/eet.1883"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120838"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-082508-094348"", ""10.1086/711307"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2015.08.011"", ""10.1016/S2542-5196(19)30241-4"", ""10.1080/13552070215911"", ""10.1111/geoj.12008"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.07.004"", ""10.1515/9781400834402"", ""10.1007/s10584-018-2287-y"", ""10.1596/29461"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab4bfc"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052213-040359"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1002/wcc.275"", ""10.1056/NEJM199607113350203"", ""10.1007/s10584-018-2272-5"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.02.014"", ""10.1126/science.aaz6003"", ""10.1038/s41558-020-0805-1"", ""10.1080/09644016.2021.1892982"", ""10.1007/s10784-014-9266-1"", ""10.1038/s41893-018-0204-z"", ""10.1080/13552070802696839"", ""10.1073/pnas.1818859116"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.101928"", ""10.1017/S1537592715001218"", ""10.1073/pnas.2023554118"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111944"", ""10.1146/annurev-resource-110519-040938"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0159668"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.109967""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000077,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,The Right to Dominate: How Old Ideas About Sovereignty Pose New Challenges for World Order,"AbstractA principal theme of international relations scholarship following the Cold War was the apparent erosion of state sovereignty caused by globalization's integrative effects and the proliferation of international institutions and networks. In recent years, however, scholars have noted a reverse trend: the reassertion of traditional, or Westphalian, state sovereignty. By contrast, I highlight another recent trend that has gone largely overlooked: the reaffirmation of older “extralegal” and “organic” versions of sovereignty by three of the world's most powerful states—Russia, China, and the United States. After tracing the genealogy of these older concepts, I consider how and why they have gained prominence in the official discourse of all three countries. I also explore the implications of this shift, which not only illustrates the importance of “norm retrieval” in international affairs, but also raises questions about the foundations of international order. Contrary to Westphalian sovereignty, which emphasizes the legal equality of states and the principle of noninterference in domestic affairs, the extralegal and organic versions offer few constraints on state action. If anything, they appear to license powerful states to dominate others.","[{""name"": ""Roland Paris"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0020818300000837"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139108812"", ""10.1057/ip.2012.7"", ""10.1017/S0043887109000082"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-5971-2"", ""10.1111/j.0022-3840.1973.00819.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199595303.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315231952-11"", ""10.1017/S0260210500113701"", ""10.1086/702687"", ""10.1080/10758216.2015.1113884"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00218"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0071"", ""10.1080/13510347.2012.641297"", ""10.1093/cjip/pos001"", ""10.1080/01436597.2018.1447376"", ""10.2307/797591"", ""10.1515/9781400869800"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1017/S0034670512000514"", ""10.1017/S1352325202081016"", ""10.1007/s40647-018-0233-z"", ""10.1017/ajil.2018.105"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22059-4_12"", ""10.5810/kentucky/9780813192635.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2095581"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521243247.017"", ""10.2307/2095521"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0025"", ""10.1080/10670564.2016.1184894"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-75505-2"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00206"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-13740-7_13"", ""10.4324/9781315123837"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0022"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1204985"", ""10.1017/S0031819100018994"", ""10.1057/978-1-352-00023-8_1"", ""10.1080/07399339209516006"", ""10.2307/1229436"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy041"", ""10.4159/9780674029453"", ""10.1080/10670564.2015.1030951"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000126"", ""10.5305/amerjintelaw.109.1.0068"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12660"", ""10.3318/isia.2017.28.12"", ""10.4324/9780203697078"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199924844.001.0001"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00351"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12392"", ""10.1057/9781137312983_2"", ""10.1080/09512748.2019.1651383"", ""10.1162/002081899551020"", ""10.1163/187465609X430845"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7rjt2"", ""10.1177/0010836702037001689"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00210"", ""10.1080/13504630600555559"", ""10.1093/ejil/9.4.599"", ""10.1162/DAED_a_00467"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511497599"", ""10.1162/00208180151140577"", ""10.1353/wp.2001.0006"", ""10.1093/cjip/pox012"", ""10.2307/2539078"", ""10.1080/00330124.2018.1547979"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cgb1w"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2016.11.001"", ""10.1057/9780230605121"", ""10.1177/1470594X05049439"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-74445-2_17"", ""10.1016/S0883-0355(99)00032-4"", ""10.3998/mpub.6504652"", ""10.1093/isr/viy008"", ""10.5129/001041518822704872"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-4951-4_4"", ""10.1515/9780691213057"", ""10.1515/9781400823253"", ""10.1162/002081801551414"", ""10.1093/jhuman/huw012"", ""10.1017/S0020818300004732"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1080/713682944""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

How did the general public understand these protests, and where does support for the movement stand overall? We answer this question by drawing on several national surveys from 2020 and then examining the results of a framing experiment we conducted in June 2020. We structure the story we find in two parts—the partisans and the persuadables—both of whom are important to understanding public views of Black Lives Matter. Democrats and Republicans differ strongly in their views of the movement but are similar in the firmness of those views, which did not change in response to our framing experiment. Nonpartisans, in contrast, were more persuadable, though their reactions to some of our frames were conditioned by racial resentment. We conclude by setting the movement in historical context and assessing its impact, which we describe as complicated and contradictory but consequential.","[{""name"": ""Kevin Drakulich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Megan Denver"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00031305.2017.1322143"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000544"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.611"", ""10.1177/0002716218811309"", ""10.1086/693907"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469653662.001.0001"", ""10.1177/2378023118803189"", ""10.1073/pnas.1805161115"", ""10.1177/0003122414555885"", ""10.1177/2153368712459769"", ""10.1080/07418825.2018.1516797"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12622"", ""10.1177/1354068815605676"", ""10.1111/1745-9125.12189"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190265960.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12902"", ""10.1093/socpro/spu003"", ""10.1080/10304312.2018.1525920"", ""10.1017/S0898588X07000211"", ""10.1037/xge0000920"", ""10.1177/1462474515604041"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00281"", ""10.2307/2095528"", ""10.4135/9781452229614"", ""10.1111/ajps.12081"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074246"", ""10.1177/2332649220922564"", ""10.1177/2053168018822174"", ""10.4159/9780674969223"", ""10.1093/sf/sox031"", ""10.1007/BF00212732"", ""10.1177/00220027211013097"", ""10.1177/0022002720939304"", ""10.1515/9780691218250"", ""10.1111/1745-9125.12239"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1341965"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316287002.005"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000413"", ""10.1080/15205436.2021.1884724"", ""10.1086/229213"", ""10.5040/9798216188131.ch-002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199842766.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1742058X1600031X"", ""10.1093/poq/nfn063"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.09.015"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226472157.001.0001"", ""10.1093/esr/jcp006"", ""10.1111/lasr.12552"", ""10.1177/1464884918778722"", ""10.1007/s12103-020-09561-1"", ""10.3758/s13428-012-0265-2"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-15327-2"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjsf4fx""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1017/S1537592719002688,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,The Dynamics of Racial Resentment across the 50 US States,"Although many scholars who study the role of racial animus in Americans’ political attitudes and policy preferences do so to help us understand national-level politics, (racialized) policy is largely shaped at the state level. States are laboratories of policy innovation whose experiments can exacerbate or ameliorate racial inequality. In this article, we develop state-level scores of racial resentment. By using linear multilevel regression and poststratification weighting techniques and by linking nationally representative survey data with US Census data, we create time-varying, dynamic state-level estimates of racial resentment from 1988 to 2016. These measures enable us to explore the extent to which subnational levels of racial attitudes fluctuate over time and to provide a comparative analysis of state-level racial resentment scores across space and time. We find that states’ levels of racial animus change slowly, with some exhibiting increases over time while others do just the opposite. Southern states’ reputation for having the highest levels of racial resentment has been challenged by states across various regions of the United States. Many states had their lowest levels of symbolic racism decades ago, contrary to the traditional American narrative of racial progress.","[{""name"": ""Candis Watts Smith"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rebecca J.

While some have argued that Taiwan’s success with COVID‐19 is based on its experience with SARS, I argue that we should not attribute Taiwan’s effective response solely to its SARS experience. The country’s success mainly lies in three factors: (1) reliance on the mask policy as the main disease prevention measure and the ability to quickly expand mask production capacity; (2) use of big data and technology to enhance effective implementation of disease prevention and detection measures; and (3) strong state‐society relations favoring transparency, communication, and collaboration. The first two factors can trace their roots to the country’s developmental state model. Democracy provides the institutional underpinning for a vibrant civil society and the synergy between state and civil society, strengthening Taiwan’s crisis governance legitimacy and increasing citizens’ voluntary compliance.","[{""name"": ""Wei‐Ting Yen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-5973.2010.00620.x"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3562796"", ""10.1017/9781108552738"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.3151"", ""10.1017/err.2020.25"", ""10.1017/S002081831900002X"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.2648""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Epidemiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)]]"

It highlights the main strands in this literature, presents the fundamental findings discovered so far, responds to the critiques that have recently surfaced, and offers guidance about where scholarship on strategic communication might most profitably head. The critiques discussed here centre on two aspects: (i) the claim that an agency's communication choices are to some extent driven by the distinctive logic of the media rather than by reputational concerns, and (ii) the argument that strategic communication provides only short‐term solutions to emerging threats and is therefore overemphasized in the literature. Future agendas include, for example, the selection of audience segmentation strategies, and the management of competing and even contradictory communication for segmented audiences when agencies enjoy exclusive jurisdiction, as opposed to cases in which other agencies share the same stage.","[{""name"": ""Moshe Maor"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Hebrew University of Jerusalem  Jerusalem Israel""]}]","[""10.1080/10967494.2013.849167"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux013"", ""10.1080/10584600490481307"", ""10.1287/orsc.1.2.177"", ""10.5771/9783845262703-162"", ""10.3224/dms.v12i1.03"", ""10.1111/puar.12406"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw028"", ""10.1111/1467-6478.00215"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-76672-0_9"", ""10.1332/030557318X15407316633243"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2007.00378.x"", ""10.1111/gove.12161"", ""10.1111/puar.12612"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1679227"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1603248"", ""10.2307/3088394"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.23.1.52"", ""10.1515/9781400835119"", ""10.1017/S1537592710002070"", ""10.1080/01900692.2015.1064133"", ""10.2307/256405"", ""10.1111/gove.12173"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut041"", ""10.1016/0363-8111(93)90003-U"", ""10.1057/9781137396822_2"", ""10.1080/1553118X.2018.1456434"", ""10.1177/0149206309348788"", ""10.1111/psj.12088"", ""10.1017/S1755773916000126"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-76672-0_7"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.01830.x"", ""10.1093/0199243638.001.0001"", ""10.1332/030557315X14431855320366"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199596706.013.0007"", ""10.1080/10410236.2010.544282"", ""10.1332/030557319X15579230420144"", ""10.1007/s11186-007-9043-z"", ""10.1080/13501769709696342"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00676.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01470.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01536.x"", ""10.17645/pag.v4i2.570"", ""10.1332/030557317X14843233064353"", ""10.1017/S0143814X19000278"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus047"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01601.x"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.996627"", ""10.1111/padm.12543"", ""10.1016/S0361-3682(97)00008-1"", ""10.1111/spsr.12118"", ""10.1111/gove.12438"", ""10.1080/1366987032000047806"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01153.x"", ""10.4135/9781452233451.n10"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux044"", ""10.1016/j.pubrev.2006.05.018"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199596706.013.0020""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']",['Strategy and Management'],"[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.17645/pag.v9i3.4251,POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE,0302 Political Science,Ressentiment: A Complex Emotion or an Emotional Mechanism of Psychic Defences?,"&lt;em&gt;Ressentiment &lt;/em&gt;is central for understanding the psychological foundations of reactionary politics, right-wing populism, Islamic fundamentalism, and radicalism. In this article we theorise &lt;em&gt;ressentiment &lt;/em&gt;as an emotional mechanism which, reinforcing a morally superior sense of victimhood, expedites two parallel transvaluation processes: What was once desired or valued, yet unattainable, is reassessed as something undesirable and rotten, and one’s own self from being inferior, a loser, is reassessed as being noble and superior. We establish negative emotions of envy, shame, and inefficacious anger as the main triggers of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt;, with their associated feelings of inferiority and impotence, which target the vulnerable self. We identify the outcomes of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment &lt;/em&gt;as other-directed negative emotions of resentment, indignation, and hatred, reinforced and validated by social sharing. We map the psychological structure of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment &lt;/em&gt;in four stages, each employing idiosyncratic defences that depend on the ego-strength of the individual to deliver the transvaluation of the self and its values, and finally detail how social sharing consolidates the outcome emotions, values, and identities in &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt; through shallow twinship bonds with like-minded peers. Our interdisciplinary theoretical account integrates classic philosophical scholarship of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt; and its contemporary proponents in philosophy and sociology, which highlight envy as the prime driver of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt;; it also considers the sociological approaches that focus on the repression and transmutation of shame and its social consequences, as well as the psychoanalytic scholarship on psychic defences and political psychology models on the emotionality of decision-making. We conclude the article by elaborating the political implications of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt; as the emotional mechanism of grievance politics.","[{""name"": ""Mikko Salmela"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tereza Capelos"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0160597618802517"", ""10.1111/pops.12540"", ""10.12681/sas.11493"", ""10.4324/9780203713105"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i3.4026"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-9025-1_14"", ""10.1521/pdps.2015.43.4.523"", ""10.4324/9781351212472"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199793532.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173308"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i3.3961"", ""10.1177/1754073917751229"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i3.3979"", ""10.1037/a0016904"", ""10.31234/osf.io/7fmrx"", ""10.1177/0022002708314665"", ""10.1111/bjp.12365"", ""10.1017/S0047279413000056"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i3.3877"", ""10.1080/13511610.2021.1952551"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i3.4053"", ""10.1177/001872675901200401"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226006147.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0160597618802552"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i3.4000"", ""10.1111/1475-682X.00015"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139014977.008"", ""10.12775/RF.2015.006"", ""10.1007/s13164-021-00546-5"", ""10.1007/s11097-020-09668-0"", ""10.1177/0539018417734419"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.93.3.431"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i3.4261"", ""10.1163/2208522X-02010057"", ""10.1007/s11097-018-9604-9"", ""10.5539/res.v10n4p49"", ""10.1525/si.2007.30.4.501"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12098"", ""10.1037/0021-843X.103.1.44"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199684823.001.0001""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12501,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Public opinion towards welfare state reform: The role of political trust and government satisfaction,"AbstractThe traditional welfare state, which emerged as a response to industrialization, is not well equipped to address the challenges of today's post‐industrial knowledge economies. Experts and policymakers have therefore called for welfare state readjustment towards a ‘social investment’ model (focusing on human skills and capabilities). Under what conditions are citizens willing to accept such future‐oriented reforms? We point at the crucial but hitherto neglected role of citizens’ trust in and satisfaction with government. Trust and satisfaction matter because future‐oriented reforms generate uncertainties, risks and costs, which trust and government satisfaction can attenuate. We offer micro‐level causal evidence using experiments in a representative survey covering eight European countries and confirm these findings with European Social Survey data for 22 countries. We find that trust and government satisfaction increase reform support and moderate the effects of self‐interest and ideological standpoints. These findings have crucial implications not least because they help explain why some countries manage – but others fail – to enact important reforms.","[{""name"": ""JULIAN L.

10.1111/ajps.12560,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Paper Cuts: How Reporting Resources Affect Political News Coverage,"AbstractMedia outlets provide crucial inputs into the democratic process, yet they face increasingly severe economic challenges. I study how a newly salient manifestation of this pressure, reduced reporting capacity, influences political coverage. Focusing on newspapers in the United States, where industry‐wide employment fell over 40% between 2007 and 2015, I use panel data to assess the relationship between reporting capacity and political coverage. Staff cuts substantially decrease the amount of political coverage newspapers provide. Across different samples and measurement approaches, a typical cutback to a newspaper's reporting staff reduces its annual political coverage by between 300 and 500 stories. These political news declines happen against the backdrop of similar reductions in nonpolitical coverage, meaning the share of newspaper articles focused on politics remains stable over this period. This demonstrates that economic pressure affects the political information environment by shaping the media's capacity to cover politics.","[{""name"": ""Erik Peterson"", ""affiliation"": [""Texas A&amp;M University""]}]","[""10.1257/mic.20170306"", ""10.1017/psrm.2017.43"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226065601.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1107158"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy051"", ""10.1017/S0022381608081140"", ""10.7560/750548"", ""10.3982/ECTA7195"", ""10.1257/000282806776157551"", ""10.1515/9781400841417"", ""10.4159/9780674973572"", ""10.1086/679749"", ""10.1086/694105"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226530406.001.0001"", ""10.1017/psrm.2016.54"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00183.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195181234.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1339221"", ""10.1111/ajps.12291"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000965"", ""10.3368/jhr.51.2.0414-6298R1"", ""10.3998/mpub.10442"", ""10.1017/psrm.2017.44"", ""10.5040/9780755695171.ch-002"", ""10.1086/692740"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09556-7"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000360"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139878425"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000569"", ""10.1080/13645579.2011.638221"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000156"", ""10.1177/1078087419838058"", ""10.1080/105846003901365"", ""10.1080/08997764.2013.785553"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2013.1785"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.762817"", ""10.1086/652903"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107477971"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080213-041101"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000577"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1288551""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/psj.12239,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Moral Panics and Punctuated Equilibrium in Public Policy: An Analysis of the Criminal Justice Policy Agenda in Britain,"How and when issues are elevated onto the political agenda is a perennial question in the study of public policy. This article considers how moral panics contribute to punctuated equilibrium in public policy by drawing together broader societal anxieties or fears and thereby precipitating or accelerating changes in the dominant set of issue frames. In so doing they create opportunities for policy entrepreneurs to disrupt the existing policy consensus. In a test of this theory, we assess the factors behind the rise of crime on the policy agenda in Britain between 1960 and 2010. We adopt an integrative mixed‐methods approach, drawing upon a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. This enables us to analyze the rise of crime as a policy problem, the breakdown of the political‐institutional consensus on crime, the moral panic that followed the murder of the toddler James Bulger in 1993, the emergence of new issue frames around crime and social/moral decay more broadly, and how—in combination—these contributed to an escalation of political rhetoric and action on crime, led by policy entrepreneurs in the Labour and Conservative parties.","[{""name"": ""Will Jennings"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephen Farrall"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emily Gray"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Colin Hay"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226039534.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00389.x"", ""10.1080/13501760600924167"", ""10.1093/pan/mpq038"", ""10.1057/9781137328793"", ""10.1111/ajps.12098"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316471029"", ""10.1057/bp.2015.36"", ""10.1093/bjc/azq015"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199540815.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674496088"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226190174.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791093"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135218"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-15881-2"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01522.x"", ""10.1177/096466399500400203"", ""10.1111/gove.12214"", ""10.1057/9780230390409"", ""10.1017/S0007123409990068"", ""10.1093/pan/mpv035"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.00176"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-21282-8_10"", ""10.1177/1362480612471151"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190228705.001.0001"", ""10.1086/592810"", ""10.1093/biomet/75.2.335"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.bjc.a048427"", ""10.1111/psj.12036"", ""10.2307/2132002"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2004.00283.x"", ""10.1017/S0898588X07000211"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198254164.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1391541""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12779,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Keyword-Assisted Topic Models,"AbstractIn recent years, fully automated content analysis based on probabilistic topic models has become popular among social scientists because of their scalability. However, researchers find that these models often fail to measure specific concepts of substantive interest by inadvertently creating multiple topics with similar content and combining distinct themes into a single topic. In this article, we empirically demonstrate that providing a small number of keywords can substantially enhance the measurement performance of topic models. An important advantage of the proposed keyword‐assisted topic model (keyATM) is that the specification of keywords requires researchers to label topics prior to fitting a model to the data. This contrasts with a widespread practice of post hoc topic interpretation and adjustments that compromises the objectivity of empirical findings. In our application, we find that keyATM provides more interpretable results, has better document classification performance, and is less sensitive to the number of topics.","[{""name"": ""Shusei Eshima"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard University""]}, {""name"": ""Kosuke Imai"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard University""]}, {""name"": ""Tomoya Sasaki"", ""affiliation"": [""Massachusetts Institute of Technology""]}]","[""10.1145/1553374.1553378"", ""10.1017/psrm.2016.44"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000352"", ""10.4135/9781849209731.n8"", ""10.21105/joss.00774"", ""10.1086/699246"", ""10.1145/2133806.2133826"", ""10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.993"", ""10.1086/683073"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-88564-1_15"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(97)00115-2"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000194"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000467"", ""10.1002/sam.11415"", ""10.1093/pan/mpp034"", ""10.1111/ajps.12000"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40722-2_7"", ""10.1111/ajps.12291"", ""10.1017/S000305542000101X"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000698"", ""10.1145/3238250"", ""10.1109/ICDMW.2011.125"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000965"", ""10.18653/v1/P16-2088"", ""10.1080/01621459.2021.2024436"", ""10.1177/1354068819875605"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00590.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00427.x"", ""10.1086/687540"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316257340.004"", ""10.1111/ajps.12103"", ""10.1080/01621459.2016.1141684"", ""10.1177/0894439320907027"", ""10.1109/ICDE.2017.99"", ""10.3115/v1/N15-1074"", ""10.1017/pan.2021.33""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['General Social Sciences', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

We conduct a statistical analysis of the list experiment capturing degrees of noncompliance with social distancing rules and estimate ideological effect heterogeneity. A semiparametric analysis examines the functional form of the relationship between ideology and the propensity to violate public health guidelines.ResultsOur analyses reveal substantial heterogeneity between countries. Ideology plays an outsized role in the United States. No association of comparable magnitude is found in the majority of the other countries in our study. In many settings, the impact of ideology on health‐related behaviors is nonlinear.ConclusionOur results highlight the importance of taking a comparative perspective. Extrapolating the role of ideology from the United States to other advanced industrialized societies might paint an erroneous picture of the scope of possible nonpharmaceutical interventions. Heterogeneity limits the extent to which policymakers can learn from experiences across borders.","[{""name"": ""Michael Becher"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse and IE School of Global and Public Affairs Madrid Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Stegmueller"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Duke University Durham North Carolina USA""]}, {""name"": ""Sylvain Brouard"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Political Research (CEVIPOF) Sciences Po Paris France""]}, {""name"": ""Eric Kerrouche"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Political Research (CEVIPOF) Sciences Po Paris France""]}]","[""10.3386/w26946"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3569368"", ""10.1101/2020.03.27.20042820"", ""10.3386/w27008"", ""10.1023/A:1021226224601"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0884-z"", ""10.2307/2991772"", ""10.1086/320036"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr048"", ""10.1016/j.csda.2004.10.011"", ""10.1017/S0008423920000335"", ""10.1017/XPS.2020.25"", ""10.1007/978-1-4612-6333-3"", ""10.1086/518532"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1"", ""10.1002/9781118150382.ch11"", ""10.1214/ss/1038425655"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199760107.013.0019"", ""10.1111/ssqu.13036"", ""10.1073/pnas.2012520117"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990098"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000052"", ""10.1126/sciadv.abc2717"", ""10.1073/pnas.2007835117"", ""10.1007/s42001-020-00089-2"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006815"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp065"", ""10.1177/1354068895001001004"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0011711"", ""10.1198/jasa.2011.ap10415"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339"", ""10.1017/S0022381600053470"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0249596"", ""10.31234/osf.io/cy4hk"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.475"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000262"", ""10.1007/s11109-014-9279-z"", ""10.1257/jep.28.4.149"", ""10.1257/jep.14.3.137"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3569098"", ""10.1101/2020.05.09.20096388"", ""10.1145/358916.361990"", ""10.2307/2110990"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1979.tb01055.x"", ""10.1098/rstb.2011.0029"", ""10.1177/0963721411402596"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.05.002"", ""10.1093/ije/dyp152"", ""10.1093/eurpub/ckp077"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp067"", ""10.30636/jbpa.31.151"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0887-9""]","['Mathematics', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Applied Psychology', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Health']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)]]"
10.1017/psrm.2021.35,POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS,0302 Political Science,How government-controlled media shifts policy attitudes through framing,"AbstractResearch shows that government-controlled media is an effective tool for authoritarian regimes to shape public opinion. Does government-controlled media remain effective when it is required to support changes in positions that autocrats take on issues? Existing theories do not provide a clear answer to this question, but we often observe authoritarian governments using government media to frame policies in new ways when significant changes in policy positions are required. By conducting an experiment that exposes respondents to government-controlled media—in the form of TV news segments—on issues where the regime substantially changed its policy positions, we find that by framing the same issue differently, government-controlled media moves respondents to adopt policy positions closer to the ones espoused by the regime regardless of individual predisposition. This result holds for domestic and foreign policy issues, for direct and composite measures of attitudes, and persists up to 48 hours after exposure.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Pan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zijie Shao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yiqing Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5129/001041515816103220"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2007.00610.x"", ""10.1257/aer.97.3.852"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1080/09546553.2018.1484356"", ""10.1257/aer.20171765"", ""10.18653/v1/D18-1393"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00077"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.68.2.292"", ""10.2307/2111150"", ""10.17645/mac.v3i1.248"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02547.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190696726.001.0001"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.46"", ""10.2307/2647553"", ""10.1080/10584609.2013.828143"", ""10.1093/qje/qju020"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054"", ""10.1086/703208"", ""10.1521/soco.1990.8.1.73"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01616.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000380"", ""10.1002/9780470997130.ch29"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3679076"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000014"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2005.05.004"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080028"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv030"", ""10.1086/690616"", ""10.1080/09668136.2016.1274019"", ""10.3758/CABN.6.2.110"", ""10.1257/jep.33.4.100"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000650"", ""10.1177/0010414010394773"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01539.x"", ""10.2307/2952075"", ""10.1086/690951"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000837"", ""10.1515/9780824887070-011"", ""10.1007/s11109-015-9321-9"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00051"", ""10.2307/2669312"", ""10.1016/S0363-8111(03)00047-X"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195090635.001.0001"", ""10.1257/0895330042632690""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

This review assesses these advances, focusing on the tension between elites’ expertise, on the one hand, and resentment of elites as selfish or unrepresentative of the people's interests, on the other. What remains missing in the literature on elites and foreign policy are the dynamics of elite politics. The same elites can behave very differently in different settings, and elites frequently do not get what they want on foreign policy despite strong preferences. To understand this variation, we need more research on three kinds of elite politics: how elites attain their positions; their incentives once they arrive in those positions; and how elites relate to each other and to mass publics. Without attending to elite politics, we miss important sources of state behavior.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth N.

We examine a specific channel through which incumbents can seek to prevent the emergence of a strong opposition that might threaten them in future elections. We present a formal model demonstrating that incumbents can strategically induce opposition fragmentation by appointing some opposition members to ministerial cabinet positions. Opposition politicians who have the opportunity to secure a cabinet position in an incumbent’s government tend to compete for office independently rather than coalescing into broad-based parties or electoral alliances. The model shows that weaker incumbents are more likely to rely on this cooptation strategy. Using original data on presidential elections across African countries during 1990–2016, we show that past cooptation of opposition politicians is associated with a more fragmented opposition field in subsequent elections.","[{""name"": ""LEONARDO R.

Attention is paid to the most common forms of public participation: patrolling; provide information on criminals or criminal acts committed; participation in anti-corruption measures; assistance in the resocialization of offenders; aiding victims of crime; strengthening the security of one's own property; participation in information on anti-criminal measures. Methodologically it is a documentary research. In conclusion, the benefits of public participation in crime prevention, based on international crime prevention, can be divided into two groups: basic and additional. The main advantages are reduction of crime and delinquency; improve security in relevant areas of cities; reducing citizens' fear of crime; strengthening the service function of the police forces in relation to the inhabitants of territorial communities; improve police partnerships with the public.","[{""name"": ""Yevhen Leheza"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Administrative and Customs Law, University of Customs and Finance, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Yuliia Dorokhina"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Institute of Law of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv""]}, {""name"": ""Oleksandr Shamara"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Law, Dniprovsky Humanitarian University Dnipro, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Serhii Miroshnychenko"", ""affiliation"": [""University of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Vita Moroz"", ""affiliation"": [""Dnipropetrovsk state University of Internal Affairs""]}]","[""10.30525/2256-0742/2018-4-3-147-157"", ""10.18356/ef90929e-en""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"
10.1093/cjip/poz018,CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science,China's Rise and Balance of Power Politics,"Abstract The post-Cold War international system, dominated by the United States, has been shaken by the relative downturn of the US economy and the simultaneous rise of China. China is rapidly emerging as a serious contender for America’s dominance of the Indo-Pacific. What is noticeable is the absence of intense balance of power politics in the form of formal military alliances among the states in the region, unlike state behaviour during the Cold War era. Countries are still hedging as their strategic responses towards each other evolve. We argue that the key factor explaining the absence of intense hard balancing is the dearth of existential threat that either China or its potential adversaries feel up till now. The presence of two related critical factors largely precludes existential threats, and thus hard balancing military coalitions formed by or against China. The first is the deepened economic interdependence China has built with the potential balancers, in particular, the United States, Japan, and India, in the globalisation era. The second is the grand strategy of China, in particular, the peaceful rise/development, and infrastructure-oriented Belt and Road Initiative. Any radical changes in these two conditions leading to existential threats by the key states could propel the emergence of hard-balancing coalitions.","[{""name"": ""Zhen Han"", ""affiliation"": [""Postdoctoral Scholar at the Centre for International Environment and Resource Policy (CIERP), The Fletcher School, Tufts University""]}, {""name"": ""T V Paul"", ""affiliation"": [""James McGill Professor of International Relations, the Department of Political Science, McGill University""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1162/glep_a_00684,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,Backlash to Climate Policy,"Abstract Hard climate policy (e.g., regulation, taxes/pricing, phaseouts) is needed to meet ambitious climate targets, but when such policy is introduced, it can sometimes trigger backlash. Backlash involves an abrupt and forceful negative reaction by a significant number of actors seeking to reverse a policy, often through extraordinary means that transgress established procedures and norms. Yet, explanations of policy backlash remain nascent and fragmented. I synthesize insights from within and beyond climate politics to argue that contested legitimacy is central to climate policy backlash, which provokes attempts toward delegitimation. I develop a conceptual pathway to explain the occurrence of climate policy backlash and generate hypotheses about how practices of delegitimation occur, and their effects. This contributes to explaining why backlash occurs, highlighting ideational factors alongside interests and institutions. Overall, I suggest the need for a contextually embedded approach to understanding the volatile dynamics of backlash, bringing political sociology into conversation with political economy.","[{""name"": ""James J.

10.1093/isr/viz025,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Algorithms at War: The Promise, Peril, and Limits of Artificial Intelligence","AbstractHow might rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies affect the construction and application of military power? Despite the emerging importance of AI systems in defense modernization initiatives, there has been little empirical or theoretical study from the perspective of the international relations (IR) and security studies fields. This article addresses this shortcoming by describing AI developments and assessing the manner in which AI is likely to affect military organizations. We focus specifically on military power, as new methods and modes thereof will alter the constitution of security relationships around the world and affect the ability of states to bargain, signal, and influence in the twenty-first century. We argue that, though rapid adoption of AI technologies stands to transform states’ ways of war on a number of fronts, an AI revolution brings with it new forms of risk that must be reconciled with the widespread integration of algorithmic systems across military functions. Where new technology promises a transformation of the character of military power in some veins, it also complicates the cognitive aspects of decision-making and bureaucratic interactions in security institutions. The speed with which complex integrated AI systems enable entirely new modes of war also stands to detach human agency in a potentially destabilizing fashion from the conduct of warfare on several fronts. Preventing the negative externalities of these “ghosts in the machine” will involve significant efforts to educate decision makers, promote accountability, and restrain irresponsible employment of AI.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin M Jensen"", ""affiliation"": [""Marine Corps University""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher Whyte"", ""affiliation"": [""Virginia Commonwealth University""]}, {""name"": ""Scott Cuomo"", ""affiliation"": [""United States Marine Corps""]}]","[""10.1515/9780804773805"", ""10.1017/S000305540025853X"", ""10.2307/2538934"", ""10.2307/2626666"", ""10.1080/01402390.2015.1088838"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199232024.003.0003"", ""10.1080/01402390.2011.574979"", ""10.1016/j.orbis.2014.11.007"", ""10.7591/9781501733567"", ""10.56021/9780801837753"", ""10.1109/MCI.2014.2307227"", ""10.2307/20047487"", ""10.1080/01402390.2010.489712"", ""10.1515/9780804786768"", ""10.1515/9780804777155"", ""10.1080/01402390.2012.669737"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00136"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.67"", ""10.1515/9781400835102"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00257"", ""10.1515/9780804797382"", ""10.1080/14702436.2018.1497928"", ""10.2307/2539119"", ""10.1038/505146a"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00138"", ""10.1515/9780691212913"", ""10.2307/2539120"", ""10.1515/9781400887477"", ""10.1109/MAHC.2010.44"", ""10.1080/09636412.2014.965000"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817335"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190849184.001.0001"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00099"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1080/00207543.2016.1221162"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00034"", ""10.2307/2538420"", ""10.1109/MIE.2016.2615575"", ""10.1177/0022002783027002001"", ""10.3998/mpub.10847"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-26485-1_33"", ""10.1080/01402390.2010.489706"", ""10.2307/j.ctvvngzd"", ""10.1080/00396338.2018.1518374"", ""10.4324/9780203341551"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.5.092601.141138"", ""10.1080/01402390.2011.608939"", ""10.7591/9781501732317"", ""10.1515/9780804790468"", ""10.1177/0022002716652687"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(95)00039-H"", ""10.2307/2009557"", ""10.2307/2538637"", ""10.1016/j.orbis.2007.01.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511601019.006"", ""10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190204792.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190618094.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10845-017-1325-3""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Safety Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

We contribute to this debate by providing the most encompassing comparative and longitudinal account of affective polarization so far. We resort to a newly assembled dataset able to track partisan affect, with varying time series, in eighteen democracies over the last six decades. We present results based on two different operational measures of affective polarization: Reiljan's Affective Polarization Index, based on reported partisans only, and Wagner's weighted distance from the most liked party, based on the whole electorate. Our reassessment of affective polarization among partisans confirms that an intensifying trend is observable in a number of countries but it is, by no means, generalizable to all established democracies. Regarding the longitudinal assessment of affective polarization among the electorate, we confirm that US citizens have become more affectively polarized over time.","[{""name"": ""Diego Garzia"", ""affiliation"": [""Assistant Professor, Institute of Political Studies, University of Lausanne , Lausanne, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Frederico Ferreira da Silva"", ""affiliation"": [""Senior Researcher, Institute of Political Studies, University of Lausanne , Lausanne, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Simon Maye"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Assistant, Institute of Political Studies, University of Lausanne , Lausanne, Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.11.001"", ""10.1126/science.abe1715"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102300"", ""10.1017/9781108914123"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102337"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00552"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy014"", ""10.1177/0002764218759581"", ""10.1093/poq/nfv045"", ""10.1111/ajps.12089"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.1086/703069"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00333.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102199"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.04.009""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

The organizational structure of financial management bodies was studied and the participation of state legislatures in financial policy was emphasized. Also, a review of materials and methods was carried out based on the analysis of documents for the regulation of public financial activity. The methodology included a comprehensive analysis and generalization of the available scientific and theoretical material, as well as the formulation of relevant conclusions. During the research, the methods of scientific cognition were used: terminological, logical-semantic, functional, system-structural, logical-normative, comparative. It is concluded that the participation of all the higher powers of government is fundamental in the formation and implementation of public policy in the field of finance; this requires a wide range of bodies and institutions exercising control over financial activities; concentration of financial management in a single-line ministry, as well as distribution among several ministries and a clear division of powers between financial management bodies, among other aspects.","[{""name"": ""Vyacheslav Tylchyk"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Administrative Law and Process and Customs Security, Doctor of Law, University of State Fiscal Service of Ukraine, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Tetiana Matselyk"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Financial Law, National University of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine, 31 University Street, Irpin, 08205, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Viktor Hryshchuk"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Law Enforcement Activity, State Tax University, 31 University Street, Irpin, 08201, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Olena Lomakina"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Administrative and Constitutional Law, Faculty of Maritime Law, Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding, 9 Heroiv Stalinhradu Ave., Mykolaiv, 54025, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Markiian Sydor"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Administrative Law Disciplines, Law Faculty, Lviv State University of Internal Affairs, 26 Horodotska Street, Lviv, 79007, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Yevhen Leheza"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Administrative and Customs Law, University of Customs and Finance, Dnipro, Ukraine""]}]","[""10.15408/jch.v9i2.22234"", ""10.30525/2256-0742/2018-4-3-147-157"", ""10.46398/cuestpol.3764.10"", ""10.5089/9781451843347.001""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

This became more relevant in a context like the current one, where there is no consensus around which economic policies might lead the country back onto a stable growth path. Using a systemic approach in which we analyse the growth model, the role of Spain in the European division of labour, the financial sector, the labour market, the public sector, and the distribution of income, we contend that, in contrast with several narratives concerning the crisis in Spain: (i) the ‘living-beyond-our-means’ discourse is not true; and (ii) certain political and economic aspects, usually missing in those narratives, are essential to understanding the recent evolution of Spain.","[{""name"": ""Luis Buendía"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Economía y Estadística, Universidad de León, León, Spain""]}]","[""10.1177/1469540513493203"", ""10.1057/9781137319944"", ""10.1093/wentk/9780199936441.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0143831X12445625"", ""10.1093/cpe/bzs009"", ""10.1111/ajes.12031"", ""10.1080/13563467.2014.999759"", ""10.1108/17422040910938749"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00115"", ""10.4337/9781783476565.00015"", ""10.1177/102425890601200306"", ""10.1177/0010414099032006001"", ""10.1080/13608740902995828"", ""10.1177/0002764214534664"", ""10.1093/cje/bev078"", ""10.1111/j.1467-923X.2010.02118.x"", ""10.1080/02757206.2015.1111882"", ""10.1111/twec.12130"", ""10.4324/9781315761954"", ""10.1057/9781137267160_5"", ""10.1093/0199240523.003.0012"", ""10.7866/HPE-RPE.14.3.1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Often presenting itself as a cosmopolitan continent of nations, it is, in fact, a continent of national projects buttressed by colonial endeavours. These have included colonial emigration and settlement, dispossession, appropriation, extraction, and enslavement. While particular national governments have played a central role – Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, for example – populations from across the European continent have also participated. This article sets out the ‘varieties of colonialism’ at the heart of the European project and asks what a decolonial project of Europe might look like. I argue it would be one that places the colonial histories of Europe at the centre of our understandings of the present and which seeks redress of the injustices associated with that history through postcolonial reparative action.","[{""name"": ""Gurminder K.

Partisanship, Social Media Frames, and Perceptions of Health Risk in Brazil","ABSTRACTIn these polarized and challenging times, not even perceptions of personal risk are immune to partisanship. This article introduces results from a new survey with an embedded social media experiment conducted during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Descriptive results show that progovernment and opposition partisans report very different expectations of health and job risks. Job and health policy have become wedge issues that elicit partisan responses. The analysis exploits random variation in the survey recruitment to show the effects of the president’s first speech on national television on the perceived risk and the moderating effect of partisanship. The article presents a framing experiment that models key cognitive mechanisms driving partisan differences in perceptions of health risks and job security during the COVID-19 crisis.","[{""name"": ""Ernesto Calvo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tiago Ventura"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00380.x"", ""10.1086/683609"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3582908"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01304.x"", ""10.1017/S002238161000006X"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0182-160"", ""10.1561/100.00014074"", ""10.31219/osf.io/ps2wx"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1007/s11109-007-9044-7"", ""10.1017/9781108553742"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.1515/9781503616776"", ""10.2307/422200"", ""10.1162/003355397555226"", ""10.3998/mpub.23045"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510366"", ""10.1177/1532673X09331613"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy007"", ""10.1177/0002716214554758"", ""10.1177/0002716214555474"", ""10.1007/BF00992330"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00594"", ""10.3386/w26946""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12502,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,When Do Leaders Free-Ride? Business Experience and Contributions to Collective Defense,"AbstractThe logic of free‐riding expects that individuals will underinvest in public goods, but people often behave in ways that are inconsistent with this prediction. Why do we observe variation in free‐riding behavior? This study addresses this question by examining contributions to an important international public good—collective defense in military alliances. It develops a behavioral theory of free‐riding in which the beliefs of world leaders are important for explaining investments in public goods. The argument holds that leaders with business experience make smaller contributions to collective defense because they are egoistic and more comfortable relying on a powerful ally for their defense. An analysis of defense expenditures in 17 non‐U.S. members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from 1952 to 2014 provides evidence consistent with the theory. The findings suggest that leaders with business experience are more likely than other heads of government to act as self‐interested utility maximizers.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Fuhrmann"", ""affiliation"": [""Texas A&amp;M University""]}]","[""10.1002/ejsp.324"", ""10.1016/S1090-9516(99)00033-4"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.2307/2010357"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.37.2.122"", ""10.1086/261712"", ""10.1348/014466607X244970"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511996429"", ""10.1017/S0020818300035232"", ""10.1017/S004388711300021X"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000219"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000247"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2011.11.009"", ""10.1257/aer.20130954"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00027"", ""10.1162/003355399556151"", ""10.1016/S0165-1765(01)00394-9"", ""10.1086/678308"", ""10.1177/0018726705058911"", ""10.1080/10242690302924"", ""10.1093/isq/sqw045"", ""10.1177/0022002715590878"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001570"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000400"", ""10.1093/icc/11.2.355"", ""10.1177/0022002718785679"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139149334"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(03)00092-7"", ""10.1080/09636412.2013.786909"", ""10.1162/003355305774268165"", ""10.1086/296367"", ""10.1017/S0043887115000180"", ""10.1002/per.420"", ""10.1080/00396338.2015.1046229"", ""10.1177/0022002700044005006"", ""10.1080/03050620213653"", ""10.1111/1540-8520.00004"", ""10.2307/2937945"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000477"", ""10.4159/9780674041660"", ""10.2307/1927082"", ""10.1177/106591299404700208"", ""10.1017/S0020818300035335"", ""10.2307/2585925"", ""10.2307/2111515"", ""10.1177/0738894214522916"", ""10.1006/obhd.1993.1029"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000412"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000107"", ""10.1177/0022002793037003003"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.1980.tb00588.x"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801449222.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491658"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.joep.2011.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2010.02.013"", ""10.2307/2944711"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00479.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00280.x"", ""10.1177/0022002718785693""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Demography', 'Safety Research']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1093/isp/ekz032,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES PERSPECTIVES,0302 Political Science,What's Feminist about Feminist Foreign Policy? Sweden's and Canada's Foreign Policy Agendas,"AbstractAcross politics and public discourse, feminism is experiencing a global renaissance. Yet feminist academic work is divided over the burgeoning use of the term, particularly in reference to economic and international development policy. For some, feminism has been co-opted for neoliberal economic ends; for others, it remains a critical force across the globe. This article explores the nascent feminist foreign policies of Sweden and Canada. Employing a discourse analysis of both states’ policy documents, it asks what the term “feminist” meant in preliminary attempts at constructing a feminist foreign policy. It argues that although both use the term “feminist,” they understand the term very differently, with Sweden centering it in domestic and international commitments to change, while Canada places greater emphasis on the private sector. This suggests that this policy agenda is still developing its central concepts, and is thus ripe for intervention on the part of policymakers and civil society organizations.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Thomson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bath""]}]","[""10.1017/S0892679416000241"", ""10.1177/0047117818811892"", ""10.4135/9781446217887"", ""10.1177/1464993415592737"", ""10.1080/01436597.2015.1022525"", ""10.1080/14616742.2015.1071994"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12046"", ""10.1332/251510818X15272520831120"", ""10.1215/9780822372929"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316343579"", ""10.1057/9780230303911"", ""10.1525/california/9780520286382.001.0001"", ""10.1332/251510818X15272520831166"", ""10.1080/09692290.2013.849277"", ""10.1080/13563467.2014.951614"", ""10.1215/9780822390442"", ""10.1080/14616742.2013.849968"", ""10.1086/688182"", ""10.1111/gwao.12287"", ""10.1080/14616742.2011.611659"", ""10.1177/0192512116629820"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511779930""]",['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1093/ips/olab003,INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Toward a Critique of Algorithmic Violence,"AbstractQuestions about how algorithms contribute to (in)security are under discussion across international political sociology. Building upon and adding to these debates, our collective discussion foregrounds questions about algorithmic violence. We argue that it is important to examine how algorithmic systems feed (into) specific forms of violence, and how they justify violent actions or redefine what forms of violence are deemed legitimate. Bringing together different disciplinary and conceptual vantage points, this collective discussion opens a conversation about algorithmic violence focusing both on its specific instances and on the challenges that arise in conceptualizing and studying it. Overall, the discussion converges on three areas of concern—the violence undergirding the creation and feeding of data infrastructures; the translation processes at play in the use of computer/machine vision across diverse security practices; and the institutional governing of algorithmic violence, especially its organization, limitation, and legitimation. Our two-fold aim is to show the potential of a cross-disciplinary conversation and to move toward an interactional research agenda. While our approaches diverge, they also enrich each other. Ultimately, we highlight the critical purchase of studying the role of algorithmic violence in the fabric of the international through a situated analysis of algorithmic systems as part of complex, and often messy, practices.Les questions concernant la manière dont les algorithmes affectent l’(in)sécurité deviennent de plus en plus courantes en sociologie politique internationale. Notre discussion collective s'appuie sur ces débats et les enrichit en abordant les questions portant sur la violence algorithmique. Nous soutenons qu'il est important d'analyser et de discuter de la manière dont les systèmes algorithmiques alimentent (et entretiennent) des formes spécifiques de violence, ainsi que de la façon dont ils justifient des actes violents ou redéfinissent les formes de violence jugées légitimes. Cette discussion collective réunit différents points de vue disciplinaires et conceptuels pour ouvrir un débat sur la violence algorithmique en se concentrant à la fois sur des exemples spécifiques et sur les défis à relever pour la conceptualiser et l’étudier. Cette discussion se concentre sur trois sujets de préoccupation : la violence qui sous-tend la création et l'alimentation des infrastructures de données, les processus de conversion en jeu dans l'utilisation de la vision informatique/machine à travers diverses pratiques de sécurité, et la gouvernance institutionnelle de la violence algorithmique, en particulier son organisation, sa limitation et sa légitimation. Notre double objectif est de montrer le potentiel d'une discussion interdisciplinaire et d'avancer vers un programme de recherche interactionnel. Bien que nos approches divergent, elles s'enrichissent mutuellement. Notre but est de mettre en évidence les possibilités analytiques ouvertes par l'étude de la violence algorithmique et de son role dans la fabrique des relations internationales, par le biais d'une étude des systèmes algorithmiques dans le cadre de pratiques complexes et désordonnées.Las preguntas acerca de cómo afectan los algoritmos a la (in)seguridad son cada vez más comunes en la Sociología Política Internacional. A fin de construir y sumar a estos debates, nuestro Debate Colectivo pone en primer plano las preguntas sobre la violencia algorítmica. Sostenemos que es importante abrir el debate acerca de cómo los sistemas algorítmicos alimentan (en) formas específicas de violencia, cómo justifican las acciones violentas o redefinen qué formas de violencia se consideran legítimas. A partir de la reunión de diferentes puntos de vista disciplinarios y conceptuales, este Debate Colectivo abre una conversación sobre la violencia algorítmica centrándose tanto en sus instancias específicas como en los desafíos de su conceptualización y estudio. En general, el debate converge en tres áreas de interés: la violencia que sustenta la creación y alimentación de las infraestructuras de datos, los procesos de traducción en juego en la utilización de la visión de la computadora/máquina a través de diversas prácticas de seguridad y el gobierno institucional de la violencia algorítmica, especialmente su organización, limitación y legitimación.

10.1017/S0260210520000169,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,The quiet failures of early neoliberalism: From rational expectations to Keynesianism in reverse,"AbstractWhile the last few decades of political economic history give the impression that the logic of neoliberalism is inexorable, this article argues that once we look further backwards and dig into recently declassified archives documenting the early days of neoliberal theory and practice, we find a messier picture. Economic policymakers in Thatcher and Reagan's administrations in the early 1980s did not set out to ‘fail forwards’ by generating a crisis that would enable a statist kind of neoliberalism. The key ideas that they drew on and the policies that they used to put them into practice sought to transform the economy indirectly, through a set of performative policy devices that they believed would generate a dramatic shift in people's inflationary expectations, lowering inflation without provoking a major recession. Archival records make it clear that these efforts were not only a failure, but also one that policymakers were acutely aware of at the time. By examining these quiet failures in economic policy, we can better understand how these governments simultaneously failed in their early efforts to introduce neoliberal economics and yet ultimately succeeded in transforming their economies in important respects – and in legitimising those transformations by narrating failure as a kind of inevitable success.","[{""name"": ""Jacqueline Best"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0018246X12000118"", ""10.1080/21693293.2013.765741"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139857086"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_472457"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087230"", ""10.1515/9781503604445"", ""10.1080/104277102200004767"", ""10.2307/422246"", ""10.1080/13563467.2018.1484714"", ""10.1080/03085147.2015.1049447"", ""10.1080/08935696.2013.843250"", ""10.1057/9781137369543"", ""10.1093/jpo/jou006"", ""10.1080/13563467.2016.1113948"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511528125.005"", ""10.1016/0022-0531(72)90142-1"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-23387-8"", ""10.1080/03085147.2015.1049447"", ""10.2218/finsoc.v4i2.2871"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580576.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1qft0n6"", ""10.4159/9780674919808"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1115890"", ""10.1093/isq/sqx010""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

A new wave of scholarship on status in international relations has converged on a central definition of status, several causal pathways, and the claim that the pursuit of status tends to produce conflict. The authors take stock of the status literature and argue that this convergence is not only a sign of progress, but also an obstacle to it. They find that the consensus definition conceals critical contradictions between standing and membership, that its causal pathways are promising but often in tension with each other, and that the literature may be overlooking the ways in which status can help states avoid conflict and promote cooperation under certain conditions.","[{""name"": ""Paul K.

To test this claim, we draw from an original survey conducted in Catalonia before the 2017 regional election, which followed a suspended declaration of independence. Trade shocks produce differential effects depending on market specialization: Respondents working in sectors and at firms specializing in the host state market disproportionately oppose secession, whereas those specializing in foreign markets show no aversion to independence. Exclusion from public insurance strengthens preference for secession among the long‐term unemployed. Support for secession also increases with skill levels but not because of expected postindependence factor returns. The skilled population shows a better understanding of the institutional design of interterritorial redistribution. In a context of autonomy retraction, this group is more skeptical of the accommodation of regional demands within the union. Overall, we advance an individual‐level materialistic approach to the study of secession.","[{""name"": ""Maria Jose Hierro"", ""affiliation"": [""Yale University""]}, {""name"": ""Didac Queralt"", ""affiliation"": [""Yale University""]}]","[""10.1111/1468-0297.00326"", ""10.1162/003355300555411"", ""10.1177/0010414015581681"", ""10.1111/ajps.12079"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070270"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139042796"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr048"", ""10.2307/3551558"", ""10.1787/9789264254053-en"", ""10.1162/003355300555420"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2011.07.005"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1016/j.socec.2007.08.002"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000200"", ""10.1080/13608746.2012.701898"", ""10.1017/S0020818300033178"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.1017/S0007123400000028"", ""10.1515/9780691214863"", ""10.1017/S0008423900008672"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199548477.003.0042"", ""10.1111/1468-0262.00467"", ""10.1017/S1755773914000174"", ""10.1080/13537113.2015.1003485"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2018.01.004"", ""10.1177/0010414013520524"", ""10.1162/003465301750160108"", ""10.1016/S0022-1996(00)00094-5"", ""10.1080/13597566.2013.775945"", ""10.1177/0010414013516927"", ""10.1177/0010414004272538"", ""10.1515/9780773587502"", ""10.1017/S1743923X15000264""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

The CIG-survey includes surveys among national populations of organized interests in 9 European countries and at the European Union level. Although surveys are a useful and reliable way to collect data on a variety of topics, there are also numerous pitfalls and challenges in surveying interest groups, especially across multiple countries. Despite the prominent use of surveys in interest group research, systematic reflections on this method are scarce and data sets are not always properly archived or openly accessible. This article elaborates upon the practical implications and reflects on the lessons learnt during from the implementation of the CIG-survey. Moreover, we highlight how the fuzzy boundaries of interest communities obfuscate sampling and that surveying interest organizations requires researchers to navigate through a specific organizational context to reach and motivate respondents. We also demonstrate how a careful survey plan can positively affect response rates and enable the creation of robust comparative data sets.","[{""name"": ""Jan Beyers"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Danica Fink-Hafner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""William A.

10.1017/S0020818320000612,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Tariffs As Electoral Weapons: The Political Geography of the US-China Trade War,"AbstractIn response to President Trump instigating conflict over trade with China, the Chinese government countered by issuing tariffs on thousands of products worth over USD 110 billion in US exports. We explore whether China's tariffs reflected a strategy to apply counterpressure by hurting political support for the president's party. We also assess the strategy's impact on the 2018 midterm elections and examine the mechanism underlying the resulting electoral shift. We find strong evidence that Chinese tariffs systematically targeted US goods that had production concentrated in Republican-supporting counties, particularly when located in closely contested Congressional districts. This apparent strategy was successful: targeted areas were more likely to turn against Republican candidates. Using data on campaign communications, local search patterns online, and an original national survey, we find evidence that voters residing in areas affected by the tariffs were more likely to learn about the trade war, recognize its adverse impact, and assign the Republicans responsibility for the escalating dispute. These findings demonstrate how domestic political institutions can be a source of vulnerability in interstate disputes.","[{""name"": ""Sung Eun Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yotam Margalit"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/isqu.12057"", ""10.1017/psrm.2016.47"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1017/S0022050700019549"", ""10.1515/9780691220178"", ""10.1162/002081802760199863"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3349000"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090183"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1pd2k7j"", ""10.2307/2586014"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1642232"", ""10.1515/9780691190358"", ""10.1111/ajps.12280"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0327.2007.00195.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000194"", ""10.1093/qje/qjz036"", ""10.1017/S000305541000050X"", ""10.1086/682151"", ""10.3386/w22178"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000394"", ""10.1017/S0020818312000057"", ""10.1177/0010414015574879"", ""10.1257/jep.33.4.187"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190651824.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00294.x"", ""10.1080/03050629.2014.945582"", ""10.2307/2111778"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edx024"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2010.01001.x"", ""10.3386/w26434"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000076"", ""10.1017/S0003055406062241"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/pan.2022.10,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Sentiment is Not Stance: Target-Aware Opinion Classification for Political Text Analysis,"AbstractSentiment analysis techniques have a long history in natural language processing and have become a standard tool in the analysis of political texts, promising a conceptually straightforward automated method of extracting meaning from textual data by scoring documents on a scale from positive to negative. However, while these kinds of sentiment scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the document’s stance with respect to a given target—how positively or negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group—as this reflects the author’s underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document’s sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in the data and leading to faulty conclusions.","[{""name"": ""Samuel E.

Drawing on the rationale of the special issue, we highlight key dynamics in which knowledge shape climate policies and propose a decolonial approach at the nexus of academic knowledge production and policy formation by accounting for diverse ways of knowing climate justice. To this end, the article asks how to develop a decolonial approach to researching climate justice in order to identify the meaning-in-use of climate justice by affected people in what we describe as sensitive regions of the Arctic and the Mediterranean. To this end, the article develops a research design that accounts for diverse ways of knowing. The article proceeds as follows: first, we will discuss how diverse ways of knowing are related to global climate governance and climate justice; second, we outline our practice-based research framework that addresses research ethics, decolonial approaches and norm contestation; and third, we discuss how our approach can inform not only the co-production of research in climate governance, but also current debates on climate justice.","[{""name"": ""Jan Wilkens"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alvine R C Datchoua-Tirvaudey"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Indeed, it is a tragic event that has cost the lives of thousands of civilians who have been victims of war crimes and serious violations of their fundamental rights. In this sense, the objective of this editorial is twofold, on the one hand, to present volume 40, number 73 of Political Questions and, on the other, to briefly explain the causes and geopolitical consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is concluded that the invasion of Putin’s Russia in Ukraine can trigger a prolonged and extensive conflict that can even confront NATO directly with Russia. Ideologically, it is a conflict that means a clash between different political models such as the liberal democracies of the West (ensuring human rights, adherence to the principles of international law - the sovereignty of the country, freedom of speech, free movement around the world, etc.) with the militarist and neoconservative authoritarianism of tsarist roots.","[{""name"": ""Jorge J.

We provide a concise review focused on the development of public administration education over this time. Next, we discuss scholarship in top journals on public administration education, Journal of Public Affairs Education and Teaching Public Administration. We use Denhardt's (2001) big questions in public administration education as a framework to examine this scholarship. We conclude by discussing the future of public administration education and advocating a community‐based approach to pedagogy practice and research in the field.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Farrell"", ""affiliation"": [""Cardiff Business School Cardiff University  Cardiff Wales UK""]}, {""name"": ""William Hatcher"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social Sciences Augusta University  Augusta Georgia USA""]}, {""name"": ""John Diamond"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Public Policy and Professional Practice Edge Hill University  Ormskirk England""]}]","[""10.1080/15236803.2021.1891396"", ""10.1177/0952076712458789"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1820289"", ""10.1080/15236803.1998.12022006"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1996.tb00890.x"", ""10.1080/15236803.2017.12002286"", ""10.1080/10877789.1997.12023454"", ""10.1111/1467-9299.00309"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8500.1993.tb00302.x"", ""10.2307/975554"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1809243"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00125"", ""10.1080/10877789.1997.12023425"", ""10.1177/0952076712450046"", ""10.1080/15236803.2021.1929020"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvab003"", ""10.1080/09540969409387823"", ""10.1177/0144739418823824"", ""10.1080/15236803.2019.1568099"", ""10.1177/0095399712452658"", ""10.1080/09540962.2020.1788783"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03008-7_99-1"", ""10.1177/0144739417740180"", ""10.1177/0144739414522479"", ""10.1080/15236803.2016.12002262"", ""10.1080/15236803.2018.1429822"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1923.tb02135.x"", ""10.1080/15236803.2012.12001683"", ""10.1080/15236803.2007.12001467"", ""10.2307/977361"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1759760"", ""10.15760/hgjpa.2016-1.6"", ""10.1080/15236803.2014.12001782"", ""10.1080/10877789.1997.12023452"", ""10.1177/0144739412462169"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12984-2"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1839851"", ""10.1080/15236803.2017.12002288"", ""10.1177/0144739417708836"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195683769.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0095399710386309"", ""10.1177/0144739420963154"", ""10.1080/15236803.2013.12001730"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1820288"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1972.tb00107.x"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1776076"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1855696"", ""10.1093/pa/gsg114"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024411"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq016"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1744798"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvz018"", ""10.1080/15236803.2005.12001397"", ""10.1177/002085239806400402"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-31816-5_3856-1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1993.tb00987.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.1987.tb00654.x"", ""10.2307/1950136"", ""10.1080/15236803.2005.12001398"", ""10.1177/0144739418764530"", ""10.2307/976631"", ""10.1080/15236803.2021.1921343"", ""10.2307/974004"", ""10.1080/15236803.2019.1607804"", ""10.1080/15236803.2020.1809242"", ""10.1080/15236803.1998.12022040"", ""10.1080/15236803.2021.1954469"", ""10.1177/0275074020941669""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Public Administration']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"
10.1093/isr/viz007,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"Populism, Hindu Nationalism, and Foreign Policy in India: The Politics of Representing ""the People""","AbstractThere is today a growing sense of a global rise of populism. Right-wing populist leaders and parties claim to represent the people and pit them against a “corrupt” elite and “dangerous” Others. However, the international dimensions of populism remain largely unexplored in the populism and international relations (IR) literature. By analyzing the relationship between foreign policy and populism, this article seeks to show how the phenomenon of populism can be integrated into IR theory and how IR scholarship can inform debates on populism. The article argues that poststructuralist IR, with its focus on foreign policy as a boundary-drawing practice that demarcates the Self from the Other, allows us to study how populist actors can use foreign policy as a site for the reproduction of their claim to represent the people. To grasp this, the article identifies different discursive strategies through which the people/elite antagonism can be constructed and interacts with other antagonisms such as the inside/outside divide of nationalism. It illustrates its arguments with a case study on India's foreign policy discourse under the Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi, who has promised to purify India from a corrupt elite and pursue an “India first” policy.","[{""name"": ""Thorsten Wojczewski"", ""affiliation"": [""King's India Institute, King's College London, Strand, London, WC2R 2LS, United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1057/9780230592100_1"", ""10.1057/9780230339545"", ""10.1177/030437548701200401"", ""10.4324/9781315733975"", ""10.1093/ia/iiw003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199458325.003.0014"", ""10.1093/ia/iiw006"", ""10.1080/00472336.2014.948902"", ""10.1177/1527476415573957"", ""10.1093/ia/iiw001"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ip.8897388"", ""10.1080/00358530410001679567"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.467"", ""10.1353/apr.2008.0030"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.1080/0955757042000245924"", ""10.1353/jod.2003.0076"", ""10.1080/0163660X.2017.1328929"", ""10.1080/00358533.2016.1180760"", ""10.1515/9781400823055"", ""10.1093/ia/iix241"", ""10.1093/ia/iiw036"", ""10.1515/9781400828036"", ""10.1353/jod.2017.0044"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1142/9789813203860_0006"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2009.00089.x"", ""10.1093/ia/iiw005"", ""10.1142/9789813203860_0007"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12336"", ""10.1093/ia/iiw028"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1fx4gtn"", ""10.1057/jird.2013.22"", ""10.4324/9780203552223"", ""10.1142/10348"", ""10.1353/jod.2014.0068"", ""10.1353/sais.2007.0019"", ""10.1080/00856401.2014.939738"", ""10.4324/9780203767108"", ""10.1080/00856400208723505"", ""10.4324/9781315099460""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0260210522000031,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,Machine learning political orders,"AbstractA significant set of epistemic and political transformations are taking place as states and societies begin to understand themselves and their problems through the paradigm of deep neural network algorithms. A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders – from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic – with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data.","[{""name"": ""Louise Amoore"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13501760500043928"", ""10.1111/cogs.12049"", ""10.1177/1354066117738854"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1177/0967010616680753"", ""10.1017/eis.2017.14"", ""10.1080/03085147.2012.686719"", ""10.1177/0263276411417430""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Using the case of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the production of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) of the Synthesis Report published in 2014, it sheds light on the procedural, visual, and rhetorical arrangements in the weaving of an intergovernmental expert consensus. Drawing on ethnographic methods, the main point of the article is that the consensus emerging from the approval of the SPM is best understood as an accumulation and juxtaposition of scientific/diplomatic consensuses. It shows that these consensuses result from a layering of compromises negotiated at various stages in the assessment process and contingent on the issues at stake and the strategies of actors. In this context, consensus is not reached on individual statements but on the document as a whole, as both authors and governments seek to have their perspectives reflected. Finally, the article draws attention to the entanglement between the scientific and diplomatic rhetoric in the fabric of the SPM, which tends to construct climate change as a decontextualized and nonpolitical problem.","[{""name"": ""Kari De Pryck"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0020818316000321"", ""10.1177/1354066117741529"", ""10.3366/epi.2010.0203"", ""10.7312/bern12036"", ""10.4324/9781351169080-7"", ""10.2307/2201255"", ""10.1111/ropr.12258"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2010.10.003"", ""10.1111/1468-2478.4701006"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262050920.001.0001"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00390"", ""10.1016/S0959-3780(01)00009-7"", ""10.1007/s10784-005-1749-7"", ""10.1038/nclimate2954"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001442"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262016506.003.0005"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107589735.024"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00323"", ""10.1111/ropr.12255"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00503"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.07.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107415416"", ""10.4324/9780203413845"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2016.11.001"", ""10.1177/1354066102008001003"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00269"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.10.003"", ""10.1111/tran.12064"", ""10.1177/016224390102600405"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3292.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108159906"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226602158.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0306312712448130"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2017.11.017"", ""10.4000/books.iheid.2450"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2017.02.006"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-55104-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511494444"", ""10.3354/cr008089"", ""10.1016/S0959-3780(03)00023-2"", ""10.1177/030631289019003001"", ""10.1111/jopp.12037"", ""10.1080/13511610.2014.962014"", ""10.1038/520027a"", ""10.1126/science.1255302""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muaa036,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Institutional Mechanisms for Local Sustainability Collaboration: Assessing the Duality of Formal and Informal Mechanisms in Promoting Collaborative Processes,"Abstract To address complex and cross-cutting policy problems, multiple independent administrative units within an organization often work together to accomplish a larger objective. Within local governments, doing this requires administrative mechanisms able to facilitate interdepartmental collaboration, through which the efforts of individual units contribute to city-wide policy goals. Research increasingly finds that informal elements of collaboration, such as casual communications, ad hoc meetings, and voluntary working groups, are important for building strong and trusting collaborative ties. Conversely, a nontrivial number of studies also suggest that formal mechanisms, such as mandates, rules, and authority, are necessary for ensuring and sustaining credible commitment over time. This research empirically examines the types of coordination mechanisms employed by US local governments to promote intragovernmental efforts to collaborate around the issue of sustainability—a complex and broad objective that transcends city departments’ traditional boundaries. It particularly focuses on assessing the relative contributions of formal and informal mechanisms toward achieving that end. Results from structural equation modeling analyses of 506 city governments indicate that informal mechanisms are positively and significantly associated with promoting cross-departmental collaboration. Interestingly, the results further show that formal mechanisms, while lacking a direct association with collaboration, have important implications for facilitating collaborative processes indirectly through their influence on informal mechanisms. Overall, our findings suggest a critical need for balancing the two approaches when forging interdepartmental collaboration. Implications for policy and future research are also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Angela Y S Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Kansas State University""]}, {""name"": ""Rachel M Krause"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Kansas""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher V Hawkins"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Central Florida""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00666.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024374"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a003504"", ""10.1177/0275074012447676"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00402.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00686.x"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6094-3_15"", ""10.1177/0891242417710325"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv023"", ""10.1177/0275074019869376"", ""10.5465/amr.1998.1255632"", ""10.1080/15309576.2015.1031016"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur011"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux021"", ""10.1177/0899764009360823"", ""10.2753/PMR1530-9576360203"", ""10.1080/09640568.2017.1379959"", ""10.1111/1467-9299.00089"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui011"", ""10.1080/1471903032000146964"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq061"", ""10.1080/15309576.2018.1526091"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00595.x"", ""10.1111/psj.12067"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2019.1680273"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2005.00295.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024269"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.06.007"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02133.x"", ""10.5465/amj.2015.0680"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00664.x"", ""10.15626/MP.2018.870"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024273"", ""10.1080/14719037.2015.1066417"", ""10.1177/0891242414535247"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy078"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.02.013"", ""10.1080/15309576.2017.1400993"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00485.x"", ""10.2307/2393698"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-62397-6_12"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02547.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut027"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00355.x"", ""10.1177/0951692894006001002"", ""10.1002/pam.21836"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00598.x"", ""10.1177/0021886310381782"", ""10.1257/jep.5.2.25"", ""10.1177/0275074011398119"", ""10.1177/0275074019867421"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00663.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum036"", ""10.1287/orsc.13.2.179.536"", ""10.3390/su11236860"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv017"", ""10.1111/1475-4762.00105"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul021"", ""10.15353/joci.v4i3.2946"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2010.06.008"", ""10.1080/03003930.2019.1615464"", ""10.1177/1078087409337297"", ""10.1086/651257""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

Once thought to be exclusive to countries with high levels of general violence, recent evidence suggests that harassment and intimidation of political elites in the UK is more widespread than previously thought. Using data from the 2017 general election candidate survey, we find that four in every ten candidates experienced at least one type of harassment. Evidence suggests that women and young candidates are more likely to suffer from harassment and intimidation. We conclude by formulating an agenda for future research, focussing, in particular, on the perception of harassment and the effect of harassment on political careers.","[{""name"": ""Sofia Collignon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wolfgang Rüdig"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Gender Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1146/annurev-polisci-051120-112501,ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Government Responsiveness in Developing Countries,"When and how do governments deliver public goods and services in response to citizen preferences? We review the current literature on government responsiveness, with a focus on public goods and service delivery in developing countries. We identify three types of actors that are commonly present in these accounts: politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens. Much of this literature examines interactions between dyads of these actors. The study of electoral accountability and constituency services emphasizes relationships between citizens (or voters) and politicians. Studies of bureaucratic incentives and political oversight of bureaucrats emphasize interactions between politicians and bureaucrats. Finally, studies of bureaucratic embeddedness and citizen oversight of bureaucrats elaborate the interactions between bureaucrats and citizens. We argue that an emerging literature that considers interactions between all three types of actors provides rich theoretical and empirical terrain for developing our understanding of responsiveness and accountability in low- and middle-income countries and beyond.","[{""name"": ""Guy Grossman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA;""]}, {""name"": ""Tara Slough"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics, New York University, New York, NY, USA;""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414019879945"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00611"", ""10.1257/aer.20171867"", ""10.1257/aer.20140774"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105369"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-063016-104324"", ""10.1257/aer.20180326"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-031710-103823"", ""10.1017/S1537592720000043"", ""10.1086/699209"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000459"", ""10.1257/pol.20190664"", ""10.3386/w26925"", ""10.1257/pol.2.1.1"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.04.004"", ""10.1111/1467-937X.00253"", ""10.1111/ajps.12591"", ""10.1086/694101"", ""10.1086/706862"", ""10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.735"", ""10.1257/app.20150027"", ""10.1177/0010414012453448"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00532.x"", ""10.1257/aer.20130874"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2019.04.004"", ""10.1111/ajps.12495"", ""10.1111/ajps.12458"", ""10.1093/jopart/muaa026"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190945398.001.0001"", ""10.1017/pan.2020.14"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00515.x"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2020.102523"", ""10.1257/aer.20130397"", ""10.1086/678766"", ""10.1093/qje/qjaa039"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.46"", ""10.3368/jhr.56.3.0119-9969R1"", ""10.1257/aer.20181491"", ""10.1017/XPS.2017.14"", ""10.1093/ej/ueaa112"", ""10.3982/ECTA17497"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt008"", ""10.1177/0010414020912290"", ""10.1086/690948"", ""10.1111/ajps.12371"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.11.008"", ""10.1017/9781108381390"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139175104.003"", ""10.1111/ajps.12471"", ""10.1162/qjec.2008.123.2.703"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000491"", ""10.1111/ajps.12548"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00286.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-031710-103314"", ""10.1525/9780520918665"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-052209-121553"", ""10.1111/ajps.12071"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000331"", ""10.1086/708339"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000648"", ""10.1177/0010414016666862"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.07.001"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051418-051214"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000502"", ""10.1257/pol.20150029"", ""10.1017/S0043887115000209"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-032657"", ""10.1086/711057"", ""10.1017/S000305542000012X"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48535-5"", ""10.1093/wbro/lki002"", ""10.1257/aer.20180277"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-032210-144356"", ""10.1017/9781108185899"", ""10.1093/ej/ueaa046"", ""10.1257/aer.20191972"", ""10.31235/osf.io/5gt8y"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.03.014"", ""10.1017/XPS.2020.47"", ""10.1086/702625"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139175104.001"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-8256-1"", ""10.1111/ajps.12530"", ""10.1111/lsq.12310"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.10"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000479"", ""10.1086/517935"", ""10.5129/001041519X15619975411262"", ""10.1111/ajps.12355"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022705"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000601"", ""10.1086/711719"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808661"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12418"", ""10.1086/683256"", ""10.1086/708243"", ""10.3386/w28673"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000046"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070153"", ""10.1257/pol.6.2.338"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.123839"", ""10.1257/aer.20171339"", ""10.1162/rest_a_01060"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2017.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104996""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/ssqu.13079,SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Gender differences in perceived risk of COVID-19,"AbstractObjectiveWe examine gender‐based differences in perceived risks related to COVID‐19.MethodsWe analyze published findings from COVID‐related research on beliefs and attitudes about the health risks posed by the pandemic. We also design and administer a pair of online survey experiments (n = 502) to test if and how responsive men's attitudes are to information about male‐specific risks.ResultsAcross 16 studies, men consistently express lower perceived risk of contracting COVID‐19 and less concern about the potential health consequences if they were to catch it. Our experimental results are mixed: Results for one information treatment indicate that men report greater relative risk of adverse outcomes. Men in one of the risk information treatments express less concern for their health if they were to contract the disease. Risk perceptions are positively correlated with self‐reported propensity toward protective behaviors.ConclusionOur review of recent studies finds a small‐but‐consistent gap in men and women's beliefs about their health risks related to the present pandemic. These risk beliefs are crucial determinants of whether individuals take protective measures. Our experimental results suggest that informing men of male‐specific risks associated with COVID‐19 can reduce their risk perceptions and perceptions of risk and widen the gap between men and women's perceptions.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Lewis"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Oxford  Oxford UK""]}, {""name"": ""Raymond Duch"", ""affiliation"": [""Nuffield College, University of Oxford  Oxford UK""]}]","[""10.1172/JCI139306"", ""10.1037/0278-6133.26.2.136"", ""10.1207/s15324796abm2702_7"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.125.3.367"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2011.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2020.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2020.110220"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.05.036"", ""10.1080/13669877.2020.1758193"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2009.05.001"", ""10.1080/713670162"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-00977-7"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3638879"", ""10.1017/S1930297500000346"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2020.00152"", ""10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570"", ""10.1007/s10964-009-9409-9"", ""10.1038/s41467-020-19741-6"", ""10.1002/brb3.1745"", ""10.1136/gpsych-2020-100213"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8287.1998.tb00551.x"", ""10.4054/DemRes.2005.13.17"", ""10.1016/0162-3095(85)90041-X"", ""10.1098/rsos.200742""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Applied Psychology', 'Health', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This article reports findings from an innovative online survey experiment based on a two-wave panel design. The findings show that, despite the expectation that campaign effects are generally small for high-salience issues – such as Brexit – the potential for campaign effects was high for the pro-EU frames. This suggests that within an asymmetrical information environment – in which the arguments for one side of an issue (anti-EU) are ‘priced in’, while arguments for the other side (pro-EU) have been understated – the potential for campaign effects in a single direction are substantial. To the extent that this environment is reflected in other referendum campaigns, the potential effect of pro-EU frames may be substantial.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Goodwin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Hix"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Pickup"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/107769900408100104"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01624.x"", ""10.1017/S1755773909990233"", ""10.1515/9781400832576"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.00139"", ""10.1177/1465116508089087"", ""10.1177/1465116512453957"", ""10.1177/1465116514562918"", ""10.1177/0267323106060987"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00451.x"", ""10.1177/1465116512469287"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107477971"", ""10.1177/1465116511417296"", ""10.1177/0010414009332465"", ""10.4324/9781315799582"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00294.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070554"", ""10.1075/idjdd.13.1.06vre"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00100"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000493"", ""10.1561/100.00015139"", ""10.1007/BF00992793"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00688.x"", ""10.1515/9780691188386-007"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199549948.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00451.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2012.01129.x"", ""10.1177/0093650210384934"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000667"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01580.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00403.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2011.546566"", ""10.1111/ajps.12157"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1017/9781316584408"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00051""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The rise of China continues and the leadership of the USA has come under strain, while the global economy remains trapped in a phase of stagnation. We argue that, to capture these dynamics, EU studies would benefit from tracing the interactions between global order and contemporary dynamics within the EU. European integration has been decisively shaped by two phases of US‐led global order in the past. However, we argue that a new global disorder has emerged. The decentring of globalization, geopolitical turbulence, monetary and financial instabilities and ideological fluidity are reshaping the context within which EU integration unfolds. This presents an old European question but under a new set of volatile conditions: how to secure a degree of relative autonomy within a rapidly changing global political economy.","[{""name"": ""Scott Lavery"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Relations University of Sheffield  Sheffield""]}, {""name"": ""Davide Schmid"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of History, Politics and Philosophy Manchester Metropolitan University  Manchester""]}]","[""10.1093/ia/iiz254"", ""10.1080/00396338.2012.690978"", ""10.1080/13563460307171"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1308417"", ""10.7591/9780801465666"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199546282.013.0033"", ""10.1177/1354066115612558"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12096"", ""10.1080/13563467.2019.1680963"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678666"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7rpfs"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00351"", ""10.1177/1354066117720987"", ""10.1080/13563469808406330"", ""10.1111/tran.12204"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2d8qx3s"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190233235.003.0011"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.43"", ""10.4324/9781351251945-16"", ""10.1093/ia/iix241"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1699148"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1370442"", ""10.1080/09692290.2020.1734856"", ""10.7591/9780801454790"", ""10.30950/jcer.v14i4.1037"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1534876"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qgqfg.20"", ""10.4324/9780203411865"", ""10.4324/9780203855522"", ""10.1057/s41311-017-0044-x"", ""10.1162/wash.2007.30.2.137"", ""10.5040/9781350389199"", ""10.30950/jcer.v12i4.807"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098"", ""10.1111/johs.12217"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-60891-8"", ""10.1080/13501769780000011"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12437"", ""10.1177/1369148115612791"", ""10.4324/9780203166802"", ""10.1177/1354066112461286"", ""10.1057/9780230305601""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12340,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,"Errors have been made, others will be blamed: Issue engagement and blame shifting in prime minister speeches during the economic crisis in Europe","AbstractThis article investigates prime ministers’ communication strategies during the most recent economic crisis in Europe. It argues that when electoral risk is high but governments’ policy options are severely limited, prime ministers will use specific communication strategies to mitigate electoral risks. Two such communication strategies are analysed – issue engagement and blame shifting – by applying state‐of‐the‐art quantitative text analysis methods on 5,553 speeches of prime ministers in nine European Union member states. Evidence is found for both strategies. Prime ministers talk about the economy more in response to both high (domestic) unemployment and low (domestic) gross domestic product growth. Furthermore, it is found that the (domestic) unemployment rate is the most consistent predictor of blame shifting: as the domestic unemployment rate goes up, this is followed by an increase in blame shifting towards banks, Greece and the Troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.","[{""name"": ""DENISE TRABER"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Lucerne  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""MARTIJN SCHOONVELDE"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Relations (SPIRe) University College Dublin  Ireland""]}, {""name"": ""GIJS SCHUMACHER"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Amsterdam  The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1177/0010414008328637"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.050806.155344"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2011.06.003"", ""10.1086/269431"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01594.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199357505.003.0007"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.02.009"", ""10.21105/joss.00774"", ""10.2307/1955284"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.02.004"", ""10.1057/ap.2014.12"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02073.x"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.26"", ""10.1177/0894439309335485"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755934"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00295.x"", ""10.1017/S1755773914000253"", ""10.2307/2110623"", ""10.1023/A:1022952311518"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.01897.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12121"", ""10.18637/jss.v040.i13"", ""10.1007/s11109-014-9288-y"", ""10.1075/jlp.15019.han"", ""10.1080/17405904.2017.1405051"", ""10.1177/1354068809339535"", ""10.4159/9780674038639"", ""10.1017/S1755773916000126"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.05.006"", ""10.1111/1477-7053.00085"", ""10.1515/9781400836819"", ""10.1111/padm.12235"", ""10.1007/s11109-007-9041-x"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.39.4.341"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000275"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674497764"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1101295"", ""10.2307/1963531"", ""10.1007/s11077-017-9290-4"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.003.0027"", ""10.1017/S0007123400005731"", ""10.2307/1963939"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.40"", ""10.2307/2669312"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01585.x"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1994.tb01956.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000428"", ""10.2307/2111797"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805288"", ""10.1177/2053168016686915"", ""10.2307/2111378"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00049"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.56"", ""10.1017/S0007123406000226"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00093.x"", ""10.1177/0010414010384371"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2013.05.018"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00183.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00413.x"", ""10.1080/10584609.2014.881942"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1378984"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511618857"", ""10.1080/13876988.2015.1005955"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.911483"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00004219"", ""10.1017/psrm.2015.13""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Socioeconomic Status, Inequality, and the Political Status Quo","In this study, we investigate how socioeconomic status is related to people's commitment to liberal democracy. Based on sociological and psychological theories of social conflict and dominance, we argue that those who enjoy a more privileged position in the social hierarchy tend to develop stronger preferences for the existing social and political order. Conversely, people in underprivileged positions tend to be less supportive of that order. Hence, we expect the relationship between socioeconomic status and commitment to liberal democracy to be context-specific: positive in liberal democracies but negative in autocracies. Furthermore, we argue that income inequality amplifies these dynamics, widening the gap between low and high status individuals. We test our hypotheses using the fifth wave of the World Value Surveys.","[{""name"": ""Besir Ceka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pedro C.

On the basis of insights from different academic disciplines, a layered model is developed for the relations between technology, governance, users and societal outcomes. The theoretical model proposes that these layers can result in basic configurations – consistent combinations of the four elements – but also hybrid configurations. We identify three basic configurations: (1) a closed platform controlled by a private sector organisation, (2) an open platform controlled by a government organisation and (3) an open platform run by a civil society organisation. The configurations are illustrated with examples of digital platforms from all over the world. The configurational understanding of digital platforms for the co-creation of public value provides the basis for a systematic analysis of these rapidly growing practices in countries around the world.","[{""name"": ""Albert Meijer"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht University School of Governance, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Wouter Boon"", ""affiliation"": [""Copernicus Institute Utrecht University, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1017/S0007123414000593"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.07.006"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-27786-8_14"", ""10.1057/9780230235816"", ""10.1177/0275074008314203"", ""10.1111/padm.12636"", ""10.1287/isre.2016.0648"", ""10.3233/IP-2003-0032"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1110.1322"", ""10.1111/puar.12238"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2005.02.003"", ""10.1016/S0048-7333(02)00006-9"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2017.01.003"", ""10.2196/jmir.1053"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.006"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbt014"", ""10.1111/j.1944-8287.2008.tb00365.x"", ""10.1147/sj.382.0472"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2006.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.02.012"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2012.11.003"", ""10.1108/17506161211214804"", ""10.7146/jod.6346"", ""10.1080/13662716.2019.1602514"", ""10.4324/9780203643457"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2017.05.002"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11381-9_6"", ""10.1038/nbt.2495"", ""10.1080/14719037.2019.1619807"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2012.06.003"", ""10.1016/S0166-4972(02)00150-5"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02391.x"", ""10.1007/s11266-012-9311-z"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2018.10.004"", ""10.3389/frsc.2019.00003"", ""10.1111/puar.12141"", ""10.1111/puar.12198"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00173"", ""10.1080/14719037.2017.1350461"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807763"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3592.001.0001"", ""10.1080/19331681.2018.1485605"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.07.001"", ""10.1007/s12130-999-1026-0"", ""10.1162/154247603322493212"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucv004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2008.00415.x"", ""10.1177/000312240507000505"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01753.x"", ""10.1177/0095399716680057"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199970773.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190889760.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14697017.2013.805160"", ""10.1177/0162243907311556"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2333.001.0001"", ""10.1287/orsc.14.2.209.14992"", ""10.1080/14719037.2014.930505"", ""10.1038/nbt.1837""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

The Politicization of European External Relations*,"AbstractIn the past few years decision‐making processes and the normative underpinnings of EU external relations have become subject to intense debate in the European institutions, member states and the wider public. Previous research suggests that there is variation in the extent to which individual domains of EU external relations are politicized and contested. This special issue aims to theorize further and investigate empirically this, using the example of European development policy and its relations with other external policies. We introduce two new mechanisms that drive politicization dynamics. We argue that politicization can be diffused horizontally from one policy field to another, which we call horizontal politicization. We also investigate how the politicization of EU external policies in third countries occurs and influences politicization dynamics in the EU, which we call outside‐in politicization. The introduction to the special issue presents our theoretical approach and summarizes the key findings from the special issue.","[{""name"": ""Christine Hackenesch"", ""affiliation"": [""German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik  Bonn""]}, {""name"": ""Julian Bergmann"", ""affiliation"": [""German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik  Bonn""]}, {""name"": ""Jan Orbie"", ""affiliation"": [""Ghent University  Ghent""]}]","[""10.1080/09557571.2019.1588227"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1526204"", ""10.1111/jcms.13143"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310281"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1713193"", ""10.1080/13569775.2014.882570"", ""10.1111/jcms.13137"", ""10.1057/9781137331175_1"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1478878"", ""10.1080/09578810008426751"", ""10.54648/EERR2015035"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i1.3055"", ""10.1080/07036337.2010.546849"", ""10.1017/S1755773918000164"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1081505"", ""10.1080/01436597.2014.893485"", ""10.4337/9781784719364.00024"", ""10.1057/ip.2009.2"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-56882-3_7"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i3.1024"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1081504"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63591-0"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3516070"", ""10.1080/09662839.2019.1624533"", ""10.1080/01436590903557462"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12090"", ""10.1163/15718069-12341250"", ""10.1111/jcms.13139"", ""10.1111/dpr.12190"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1111/jcms.13140"", ""10.1080/07036330802142152"", ""10.4324/9781315104980-12"", ""10.2979/africonfpeacrevi.6.2.03"", ""10.1111/jcms.13142"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i1.2680"", ""10.4324/9780429440236"", ""10.1111/jcms.13144"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1453528"", ""10.1111/jcms.13138"", ""10.1007/s11558-012-9158-5"", ""10.1111/dpr.12417"", ""10.1080/07036337.2018.1533007"", ""10.1111/jcms.13141"", ""10.1080/10758216.2020.1716807"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-06219-4"", ""10.1177/1354066116634175"", ""10.1016/j.qref.2009.10.003"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1240413"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-55235-9"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1150316"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.734782"", ""10.1080/07036330802142079"", ""10.1111/jcms.13136"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1619803"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1146324"", ""10.1017/S1755773912000276"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1081513"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1619188"", ""10.1017/S1752971912000012""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1002/poi3.236,POLICY AND INTERNET,0302 Political Science; 0503 Journalism and Communication,Countering Extremists on Social Media: Challenges for Strategic Communication and Content Moderation,"Extremist exploitation of social media platforms is an important regulatory question for civil society, government, and the private sector. Extremists exploit social media for a range of reasons—from spreading hateful narratives and propaganda to financing, recruitment, and sharing operational information. Policy responses to this question fit under two headings, strategic communication and content moderation. At the center of both of these policy responses is a calculation about how best to limit audience exposure to extremist narratives and maintain the marginality of extremist views, while being conscious of rights to free expression and the appropriateness of restrictions on speech. This special issue on “Countering Extremists on Social Media: Challenges for Strategic Communication and Content Moderation” focuses on one form of strategic communication, countering violent extremism. In this editorial we discuss the background and effectiveness of this approach, and introduce five articles which develop multiple strands of research into responses and solutions to extremist exploitation of social media. We conclude by suggesting an agenda for future research on how multistakeholder initiatives to challenge extremist exploitation of social media are conceived, designed, and implemented, and the challenges these initiatives need to surmount.","[{""name"": ""Bharath Ganesh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Bright"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09546553.2016.1207633"", ""10.1080/18335330.2015.1028772"", ""10.4324/9781315692029"", ""10.1080/03071840701472331"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0267323118760317"", ""10.1002/poi3.204"", ""10.1145/3219819.3219861"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2015.1116277"", ""10.1093/jcmc/zmx002"", ""10.4324/9781315744636-13"", ""10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0072-6"", ""10.1145/3134666"", ""10.1002/poi3.197"", ""10.1080/17467586.2016.1267865"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2018.1513984"", ""10.1177/1750635211434366"", ""10.3917/crii.078.0107"", ""10.1145/2740908.2742760"", ""10.14361/9783839446706-004"", ""10.4324/9780429287145"", ""10.1080/14616696.2018.1494295"", ""10.1080/09546553.2017.1313736"", ""10.1111/1745-9133.12249"", ""10.19165/2017.1.08"", ""10.14763/2019.2.1407"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aau4586"", ""10.1002/poi3.223"", ""10.1080/19434472.2015.1104710"", ""10.1002/poi3.219"", ""10.1080/01639625.2016.1197704"", ""10.4324/9780203829677"", ""10.1080/14616696.2018.1494293"", ""10.1002/poi3.210"", ""10.1177/1527476419879919"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2013.784568"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479833641.001.0001"", ""10.1080/23808985.1991.11678790"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2017.1352280"", ""10.1080/09546553.2019.1662403"", ""10.2307/j.ctvhrcz0v"", ""10.1145/3126686.3126776"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy029"", ""10.1080/19434472.2016.1276612"", ""10.3138/cjccj.2016.0029"", ""10.1177/0002716216672866"", ""10.1111/1745-9133.12267"", ""10.1177/1461444817712516"", ""10.4337/9781785367724.00025"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Communication', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/psj.12309,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Collective Action Problem Characteristics and Partner Uncertainty as Drivers of Social Tie Formation in Collaborative Networks,"The effectiveness of collaboration is often explained by the alignment of social networks with collective‐action problem characteristics, yet previous research on social tie formation has focused almost exclusively on actor and relational attributes. We theorize that collective‐action problem characteristics together with actor and relational attributes explain social tie formation and that the relative effect of these factors varies with uncertainty about collaboration partners. The study tests seven hypotheses associated with these factors by estimating multilevel network models of collaboration and task engagement among managers responding to a major wildfire in Sweden. The combination of actors and tasks in a single model captured key characteristics of the collective action problem (task engagements and task interdependencies), and disentangled the relative effects of these factors from actor and relational attributes. Results suggest that social tie formation can be explained both by actors’ task engagements, and actor attributes associated with leadership, professionalization, and experience. Further, the effect of task engagements decreases in organizational relationships where collaborative uncertainty is high. Since the alignment of social ties with problem characteristics is supposedly positively associated with collaborative effectiveness, this finding suggests that risk‐aversion is a more deep‐rooted driver of tie formation than the pursuit of collective performance.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Nohrstedt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Örjan Bodin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0149206307305561"", ""10.1126/science.286.5439.509"", ""10.1111/psj.12056"", ""10.1111/puar.12532"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00451.x"", ""10.1126/science.aan1114"", ""10.1111/cobi.12306"", ""10.5751/ES-08368-210140"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.10.004"", ""10.1111/psj.12146"", ""10.1177/0275074016668402"", ""10.1111/puar.12432"", ""10.1086/421787"", ""10.5751/ES-03710-150432"", ""10.2307/2392695"", ""10.1146/annurev.energy.30.050504.144511"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.03.024"", ""10.1111/ajps.12011"", ""10.1177/001872678503801001"", ""10.2307/2393756"", ""10.1177/0095399713481601"", ""10.1037/10628-000"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00413.x"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.11.021"", ""10.5465/amr.1997.9711022109"", ""10.1177/0275074014555645"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00380.x"", ""10.4324/9780203643457"", ""10.1177/0021886391271002"", ""10.5751/ES-06880-190423"", ""10.1007/s10113-013-0489-4"", ""10.1111/psj.12103"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415"", ""10.1177/0095399712473983"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvx018"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu021"", ""10.5751/ES-01976-120128"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2012.06.010"", ""10.1109/37.969131"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.34.040507.134743"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00452.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00281.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1604405114"", ""10.1093/jopart/mug017"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199703)18:2<139::AID-JOB791>3.0.CO;2-R"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2013.01.004"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00673.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00866.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3807.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0951692898010004005""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

In this introduction, we develop a behaviourally-informed, integrated conceptual model of the policy process that embeds individual attitudes and behaviour into context at the meso and macro level. We argue that behavioural approaches can be situated within a broader tradition of methodological individualism. Despite focusing on the micro level of policy processes, the contributions in this issue demonstrate that the behavioural study of public policy and administration can go beyond the individual level and give important insights into policy and societal outcomes. Our model enables us to draw more substantial lessons from behavioural research by moving beyond the verification of individual behaviour change. If based on a broad conceptual design and methodological pluralism, behavioural policies bear the potential to better understand, investigate and shape social outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Ewert"", ""affiliation"": [""Fulda University of Applied Sciences, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Kathrin Loer"", ""affiliation"": [""Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Eva Thomann"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Exeter, UK""]}]",[],"['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Administration', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/jogss/ogaa045,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES,0302 Political Science,"Women, Peace, and Security: Mapping the (Re)Production of a Policy Ecosystem","Abstract The Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda is a global peace and security architecture conventionally understood as emerging from a suite of UN Security Council resolutions and accompanying member state action plans over the last twenty years. The agenda serves as a major international gender equality initiative in its own right and as a prominent example of the broadening of security practices in global politics. In this paper, we present the first truly systematic analysis of the agenda, drawing on a novel dataset of 213 WPS policy documents from across the UN system, national government initiatives, and regional and international organizations published between 2000 and 2018. We argue that the degree of variation in the WPS agenda is frequently underestimated in conventional models of norm diffusion and policy transfer, and instead propose an account of the agenda as a dynamic ecosystem shaped by reproduction and contestation. Our empirical mapping runs counter to established narratives about the development of the agenda, producing insights into the pace and location of the growth of WPS; the hierarchy of its key “pillars”; the emergence of new issues; the development of rival versions of the agenda; and the role of domestic institutions in shaping WPS policy. We find support for the claim that the WPS agenda is pluralizing in significant ways and provide illustrations of points of fracture within the agenda at large. Our argument has significant implications for the WPS research agenda and for scholarship on security norms and policy more broadly.","[{""name"": ""Paul Kirby"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Women, Peace and Security, London School of Economics and Political Science""]}, {""name"": ""Laura J Shepherd"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Sydney""]}]","[""10.1017/S0020818315000338"", ""10.1093/sp/jxu003"", ""10.1017/S1537592709090033"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190239534.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14616742.2011.611663"", ""10.1093/jcsl/krw002"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12548"", ""10.1177/0192512116642616"", ""10.1080/23340460.2017.1415723"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12sdx3t"", ""10.1017/S002058931000062X"", ""10.1177/0011392116640459"", ""10.1080/14678802.2015.1071973"", ""10.1177/1354066113503481"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000329"", ""10.4324/9781315665955-6"", ""10.1177/0022343314523028"", ""10.1177/0022002715576748"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199845231.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy041"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00686.x"", ""10.1080/03050629.2013.805130"", ""10.1080/14616742.2011.611661"", ""10.1017/S0020818300028101"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1177/193672441100500101"", ""10.1163/19426720-01701002"", ""10.1080/096922998347561"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12186"", ""10.1080/14616742.2011.611660"", ""10.1177/0022002792036004002"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12sdx3t.15"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12551"", ""10.1080/10246029.2015.1099759"", ""10.1086/368321"", ""10.1111/insp.12005"", ""10.1177/0738894217696228"", ""10.1162/isec.2009.33.3.7"", ""10.1080/1461674032000165941"", ""10.1080/03050629.2013.805131"", ""10.1017/S1537592710004068"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12549"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018920"", ""10.1080/10357718.2014.901296"", ""10.1162/002081897550294"", ""10.1080/23802014.2017.1433964"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000086"", ""10.1162/002081800551163"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12552"", ""10.1080/03050629.2013.805128"", ""10.1017/S0020589317000483"", ""10.1080/03050629.2013.805325"", ""10.1080/13200968.2010.10854439"", ""10.1111/isqu.12032"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogy040"", ""10.1080/13533311003625068"", ""10.1177/0022002714560351"", ""10.1017/S0020818300031696"", ""10.5040/9781350220317"", ""10.1080/14616742.2011.611659"", ""10.1177/0192512116629820"", ""10.1177/2347797017710749"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856x.2007.00289.x"", ""10.1177/1354066119883001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12sdx3t.16"", ""10.1017/S1389135909000142"", ""10.1080/14616742.2017.1413583"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511779930"", ""10.1177/0192512116632372"", ""10.1093/ia/iiz027"", ""10.1163/19426720-01504011"", ""10.1177/0010836714530576"", ""10.3102/0013189X08318050"", ""10.1177/0192512116638763"", ""10.1177/1750635217730588""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Stakeholder diversity in European Union regulatory agency consultations,"AbstractTo design regulatory policies, agencies depend on information from the industries they are tasked to regulate. Therefore, agencies can organise consultations with the aim of obtaining information from different perspectives. This article focuses on stakeholder diversity in agency public consultations. We ask to what extent is information provided by stakeholders other than the regulated sector, such as other business interests, experts or nonbusiness interests? Stakeholder diversity is relevant as it may prevent agencies to become exposed to one-sided information and capture by specialised interests. Are there consultation design factors that foster consultation diversity? Or, is (a lack of) consultation diversity structurally shaped by the context in which an agency operates? Analysing a wide range of public consultations organised by European Union regulatory agencies indicates that most information agencies receive via consultations comes from regulated interests and that the limited participation of nonregulated interests is highly tenacious.","[{""name"": ""Jan Beyers"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sarah Arras"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1465116510369267"", ""10.1080/13501760701243749"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2007.00023.x"", ""10.1007/s11558-014-9212-6"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2010.02147.x"", ""10.1111/jcms.12754"", ""10.1086/466865"", ""10.1080/13501760701243772"", ""10.1177/0032321717702400"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui022"", ""10.1080/07036337.2011.582280"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000750"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.593356"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12165"", ""10.1177/1532673X06296571"", ""10.1111/rego.12098"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00273"", ""10.1111/puar.12080"", ""10.1177/1465116517702004"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198785651.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00375.x"", ""10.2307/1372989"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus028"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12099"", ""10.1111/jcms.12525"", ""10.1080/13501760210138796"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1307438"", ""10.1080/09692290.2013.819811"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui042"", ""10.1080/01402381003794597"", ""10.1080/01402382.2012.665737"", ""10.1080/07036337.2013.865730"", ""10.1515/9781400830732"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.593314"", ""10.1080/713601644"", ""10.2307/3003160"", ""10.2307/2110792"", ""10.1177/009539979702900304"", ""10.2307/3234884"", ""10.1017/S0143814X08000779"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv024"", ""10.1177/0095399712438377"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1255(199611)11:6<619::AID-JAE418>3.0.CO;2-1"", ""10.1111/rego.12150"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu007"", ""10.1017/S1755773914000228"", ""10.1111/gove.12089"", ""10.1515/9781400835119"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.01.001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1337213"", ""10.1111/gove.12119"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01567.x"", ""10.1177/1465116504047312"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.923021"", ""10.1080/07036330701694899"", ""10.1080/17448680701775630"", ""10.1017/S002238161000023X""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Strategy and Management', 'Finance']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

If Western citizens who are open to authoritarian governance share a common set of political preferences, then authoritarian elites can attract mass coalitions that are willing to subvert democracy to achieve shared ideological goals. With this in mind, we explored which ideological groups are most open to authoritarian governance within Western general publics using World Values Survey data from fourteen Western democracies and three recent Latin American Public Opinion Project samples from Canada and the United States. Two key findings emerged. First, cultural conservatism was consistently associated with openness to authoritarian governance. Second, within half of the democracies studied, including all of the English-speaking ones, Western citizens holding a protection-based attitude package—combining cultural conservatism with left economic attitudes—were the most open to authoritarian governance. Within other countries, protection-based and consistently right-wing attitude packages were associated with similarly high levels of openness to authoritarian governance. We discuss implications for radical right populism and the possibility of splitting potentially undemocratic mass coalitions along economic lines.","[{""name"": ""Ariel Malka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yphtach Lelkes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bert N.

10.1093/ia/iiab111,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Two emerging international orders? China and the United States,"Abstract If it continues, deglobalization may lead not to atomization but two overlapping international orders: a liberal one (LIO) led by the United States, and an authoritarian–capitalist one (ACIO) led by China. This equilibrium could emerge because a central purpose of international orders is to preserve the domestic regimes of their Great Power sponsors. The United States and China have markedly different domestic regimes, and so as China continues to grow in power and influence, tension over the content of international order should continue to grow. I borrow from Darwinian evolution the notion of ‘niche construction’: just as organisms alter phenotype selection by manipulating their natural environments, states can alter the ‘selection’ of domestic regimes by shaping their international environments. Modes of international niche construction include foreign regime promotion, interdependence, transnational interaction and multilateral institutions. The liberal democratic niche constructed by the United States and its allies after the Second World War preserved democracy for many decades. Today, China is attempting through various means to build a niche that will eliminate the liberal bias in international institutions and safeguard its own Market-Leninist regime. The resulting ACIO would select for autocracy and hence be partially separate from the LIO, which selects for liberal democracy.","[{""name"": ""John M Owen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Not surprisingly, developing countries have proposed ambitious plans to expand production of these raw materials. However, an observation from the resource curse literature is that strong institutions are required if they are to mitigate the risk of poorly directed, often excessively procyclical, investment, not least because of the complexity, opacity and price volatility of many raw materials utilised by global EV value chains. This paper examines the outlook for EV demand and associated raw material usage paying attention to the drivers and sensitivities required to assess and track future market transformations. These end use shifts are then placed in the context of the broader supply chain adjustments and trends shaping the demand. For resource exporters, adapting to structural change will require fiscal, regulatory, environmental and institution reforms designed to capture shifting patterns of resource wealth in a way which takes appropriate account of comparative advantages in specific value chains and mitigates adverse environmental and social consequences from their extraction and processing.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Jones"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Viet Nguyen‐Tien"", ""affiliation"": [""London School of Economics London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Robert J.

A growing number of rigorous empirical studies provide evidence that new policies can, indeed, stimulate new politics, such as increased political participation among citizens, but greater understanding is needed of the underlying mechanisms and long‐term policy feedback effects. This paper puts forth a dynamic theory of the mechanisms through which policy experiences may influence political participation, focusing particularly on political efficacy. We use five waves of panel data collected over 8 years to investigate the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), controlling for pre‐existing ideology and socio‐economic and demographic factors. We analyze the impact of resource and interpretive effects and disentangle direct and indirect effects. We find that the ACA has elevated Americans’ political efficacy and political participation with large and enduring effects, and we show the pathways through which this has occurred.","[{""name"": ""Lawrence R.

Since then, issues related to race and gender have continued to be an important part of the political agenda. This letter shows that hostile sexism and denial of racism emerged as stronger predictors of the House vote in the 2018 cycle than they had been in 2016. The results show that the increased importance of these factors came largely from the shifting of less sexist and less racist voters from voting Republican in 2016 to voting for Democrats in 2018. Overall, the results suggest that Trump's hostility towards women and minorities is becoming part of the Republican Party's brand, and that this appears to have created an electoral penalty for Republican candidates in 2018.","[{""name"": ""Brian F.

We test whether “sharing” administrative activities between organizations leads to a fall in AI due to economies of scale, as is often supposed, using organizational and financial data from more than 300 English local authorities. We employ multi-wave change score regression analysis to relate changes in AI from 2008 to 2016 to levels of shared services participation, and further test whether reform performance varies by category of local authority, type of administration, or degree of structural complexity. Although we find that some measures of AI fell slightly over this period, this was unrelated to shared service adoption for any category of local authority. Sharing of clerical rather than professional types of administration, and sharing by organizations and within partnerships characterized by lower structural complexity, also failed to improve reform outcomes. Faulty assumptions about the extent of administrative scale diseconomies in English local government partly explain this significant reform underperformance.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Elston"", ""affiliation"": [""Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford""]}, {""name"": ""Ruth Dixon"", ""affiliation"": [""Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford""]}]","[""10.2307/271083"", ""10.2307/2090509"", ""10.1177/0263774X15614179"", ""10.1177/0042098009102127"", ""10.1111/padm.12078"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup045"", ""10.1111/padm.12305"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.02.032"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus059"", ""10.1080/09540962.2018.1407161"", ""10.1002/smj.232"", ""10.2307/2093199"", ""10.1016/0049-089X(72)90055-5"", ""10.1111/padm.12300"", ""10.1080/10967494.2013.817261"", ""10.1080/00273171.2013.831743"", ""10.2307/1911963"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.1970.tb01316.x"", ""10.2307/2391667"", ""10.1177/1094428115619013"", ""10.1086/295578"", ""10.1080/00049182.2011.570232"", ""10.1287/orsc.4.1.30"", ""10.1080/01900690903188792"", ""10.1086/229459"", ""10.1080/09540962.2016.1194081"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1438498"", ""10.1177/009539978802000205"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus022"", ""10.2307/2989879"", ""10.2307/2094136"", ""10.2307/2094346"", ""10.1093/icc/dtq002"", ""10.1086/210179"", ""10.2307/2091570"", ""10.1177/001872677402700504"", ""10.2307/2094044"", ""10.1177/0950017011426309"", ""10.2307/2097958"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.1972.tb00835.x"", ""10.1057/9780230289826_6"", ""10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14714.x"", ""10.1111/1468-0343.00038"", ""10.1108/17410391211265124"", ""10.2307/2094273"", ""10.1108/JHOM-03-2014-0044"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2006.00121.x"", ""10.1086/301004"", ""10.1080/09585192.2012.725070"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01917.x"", ""10.1108/S1877-636120140000013006"", ""10.1108/S1877-636120140000013005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804564"", ""10.1177/0193841X0102500101"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.10.006"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu088"", ""10.2307/2391361"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.2307/2092024"", ""10.1080/09585190701502612"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.92.3.726"", ""10.2307/2391552"", ""10.1080/10967494.2015.1032459"", ""10.1007/978-3-8349-4480-1"", ""10.1108/S1877-636120140000013000"", ""10.1080/01900692.2016.1204617"", ""10.2307/2088193"", ""10.1201/9780203910894"", ""10.2307/2392808"", ""10.1111/j.1937-5956.1992.tb00336.x"", ""10.1023/A:1018901916907""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

With scarce cases, there has been little consideration of terrorism’s consequences for evaluations of sitting women executives. Fusing research on rallies with scholarship on women in politics, we derive a gender-revised framework wherein the public will be less inclined to rally around women when terrorists attack. A critical case is UK Prime Minister Theresa May, a right-leaning incumbent with security experience. Employing a natural experiment, we demonstrate that the public fails to rally after the 2017 Manchester Arena attack. Instead, evaluations of May decrease, with sharp declines among those holding negatives views about women. We further show May’s party loses votes in areas closer to the attack. We then find support for the argument in a multinational test. We conclude that conventional theory on rally events requires revision: women leaders cannot count on rallies following major terrorist attacks.","[{""name"": ""MIRYA R.

While scholarly research on stabilization has generally focused on militarization, its relationship to peacebuilding in the context of UN peacekeeping is underexplored. This article examines that relationship. A survey of UN policy frameworks highlights the simultaneous emergence of stabilization and clear expressions of peacebuilding. The article then draws on fieldwork in Mali and the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate how stabilization is displacing peacebuilding in the practices of UN peacekeeping. The article argues that the politics of stabilization impede local forms of peacebuilding, at odds with the “Sustaining Peace” agenda, and risks jeopardizing the lauded conflict resolution potential of UN peacekeeping.","[{""name"": ""David Curran"", ""affiliation"": [""1 Coventry University Centre for Trust, Peace, and Social Relations UK Coventry""]}, {""name"": ""Charles T.

10.1111/1475-6765.12606,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Stability and change in political trust: Evidence and implications from six panel studies,"AbstractAre political attitudes a stable feature of individuals or a rational response to changing circumstances and contexts? This question has long been a feature of political science and underpins our theories of how political attitudes are formed and what their consequences might be. In this paper, we explore this perennial question with a focus on the case of political trust, a fundamental indicator of democratic legitimacy and a long‐standing topic of debate. Theoretically, we devise a framework that highlights how different theories of political trust assume different levels of stability or volatility and the implications that this has for those theories and their normative consequences. Empirically, we study within‐individual stability of political trust using six panel studies that cover five countries between 1965 and 2020. Our results consistently point to trust being stable in the long term, with potential for short‐term volatility in response to changing political contexts, and for substantial changes between people's formative years and their adulthood. Even over a period of 19 years, most people's responses to trust questions are remarkably similar between surveys and significant life events such as unemployment and going to University do not significantly influence trust. Changes in the political environment, like incumbent government turnover, have larger effects but these appear to return to equilibrium in a few years. The exception to this general finding is individuals who are first surveyed when they are under the age of 18, who appear much more likely to change their trust levels in subsequent waves. Overall, our results complement previous research on attitude stability, indicating that trust is approximately as stable as other attitudes, such as towards immigration and redistribution. These findings have fundamental implications for our understanding of the nature of political trust and attitude formation more broadly.","[{""name"": ""DANIEL DEVINE"", ""affiliation"": [""St. Hilda's College University of Oxford Oxford UK""]}, {""name"": ""VIKTOR ORRI VALGARÐSSON"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Relations University of Southampton Southampton UK""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400874569"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080210"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12046"", ""10.1080/21565503.2021.1884890"", ""10.1177/2378023117750533"", ""10.1177/0032321718761466"", ""10.1023/B:POBE.0000043456.87303.3a"", ""10.1086/317987"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050316-092550"", ""10.1080/15512169.2016.1171153"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edr031"", ""10.2307/1959510"", ""10.1086/267129"", ""10.1080/08913810608443650"", ""10.1111/polp.12091"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199268436.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123400008309"", ""10.1017/S0008423900044309"", ""10.1017/psrm.2013.24"", ""10.1177/1465116517723499"", ""10.1111/pops.12293"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1596733"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12102"", ""10.1515/9780691214429"", ""10.1086/694785"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090719"", ""10.1177/0003122420921538"", ""10.1007/s11109-020-09613-6"", ""10.1111/pops.12728"", ""10.1086/715061"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000599"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000668"", ""10.1177/0192512110378056"", ""10.1093/0198295499.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000603"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01930.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12218"", ""10.2307/1959140"", ""10.1177/0010414001034001002"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00296.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1787/9789264268920-en"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000242"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000149"", ""10.1353/jod.1995.0002"", ""10.1086/267262"", ""10.1037/a0021817"", ""10.1111/pops.12638"", ""10.1007/s11109-009-9101-5"", ""10.1177/0020852310372450"", ""10.1177/0032321715607514"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2018.06.007"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1667654"", ""10.1111/pops.12105"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.4337/9781782545118""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/rego.12222,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Revisiting the governance of privacy: Contemporary policy instruments in global perspective,"AbstractThe repertoire of policy instruments within a particular policy sector varies by jurisdiction; some “tools of government” are associated with particular administrative and regulatory traditions and political cultures. It is less clear how the instruments associated with a particular policy sector may change over time, as economic, social, and technological conditions evolve. In the early 2000s, we surveyed and analyzed the global repertoire of policy instruments deployed to protect personal data. In this article, we explore how those instruments have changed as a result of 15 years of social, economic and technological transformations, during which the issue has assumed a far higher global profile, as one of the central policy questions associated with modern networked communications. We review the contemporary range of transnational, regulatory, self‐regulatory, and technical instruments according to the same framework, and conclude that the types of policy instrument have remained relatively stable, even though they are now deployed on a global scale. While the labels remain the same, however, the conceptual foundations for their legitimation and justification are shifting as greater emphases on accountability, risk, ethics, and the social/political value of privacy have gained purchase. Our analysis demonstrates both continuity and change within the governance of privacy, and displays how we would have tackled the same research project today. As a broader case study of regulation, it highlights the importance of going beyond technical and instrumental labels. Change or stability of policy instruments does not take place in isolation from the wider conceptualizations that shape their meaning, purpose, and effect.","[{""name"": ""Colin J.

Some respondents completed the survey just before Russia's assault on 24 February 2022, and some did so just afterwards, thus delivering a quasi‐experimental design situation, which we exploit. Our results suggest that the ominous news about the Russian attack increased the participants' interest in EU politics, consolidated their attachment to the EU and made them more mindful and appreciative of the benefits of deeper European integration. In effect, the war so close to the EU Eastern border provoked a rally around the supranational EU flag, with convergence of public opinion towards shared European values.","[{""name"": ""Nils D.

10.1017/S0003055421001167,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Punishment and Politicization in the International Human Rights Regime,"Conventional wisdom treats politicization in the international human rights regime as invariant: for any given violation, states condemn adversaries while coddling friends. However, we find that politicization patterns vary markedly across human rights issues. Some norms are more politicized than others, and states are more likely to punish geopolitical partners on certain violations. We offer a novel theory of politicized enforcement wherein states punish human rights violations discriminatively based on their perceived “sensitivity” for the target state. Using data from the UN Universal Periodic Review, an elaborate human rights mechanism, we show that states tend to criticize their adversaries on sensitive issues that undermine the target regime’s power and legitimacy while addressing safer topics with friends. By uncovering a strategic logic of human rights enforcement, this research contributes new theoretical insights on the relationship between norms and power politics in global governance.","[{""name"": ""ROCHELLE TERMAN"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JOSHUA BYUN"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0003055414000070"", ""10.2307/2600444"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139839396"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042114-015137"", ""10.2307/762496"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000623"", ""10.1353/hrq.2004.0010"", ""10.1017/S153759271600414X"", ""10.1177/0022002715595700"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811340"", ""10.1038/nature16981"", ""10.1353/hrq.2017.0055"", ""10.1007/s11558-016-9264-x"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1017/S1752971912000012"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000024"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000488"", ""10.2307/2539078"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000661"", ""10.1177/0010414018784066"", ""10.1111/isqu.12039"", ""10.1086/375708"", ""10.1353/jod.1996.0031"", ""10.7910/DVN/K0XBXX"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00732.x"", ""10.1017/S1537592719000975"", ""10.1017/S0892679418000746"", ""10.2307/1960858"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00694.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818308080247"", ""10.1080/03050629.2016.1223656"", ""10.1162/isec.21.2.5"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00205"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00496.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706934"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.101405.143216"", ""10.1177/0022343308098405"", ""10.1353/jowh.2020.0039"", ""10.2307/20459044"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77cj7"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.00001"", ""10.1162/002081801551414"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2006.00429.x"", ""10.7312/hoop12074"", ""10.1017/S0020818310000202"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027296"", ""10.2979/NWS.2003.15.3.145"", ""10.1086/428442"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.115"", ""10.1162/002081800551163""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We consider how the first-ever LGBT+ Pride in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina influences ordinary citizens’ attitudes and behavior regarding LGBT+ support. Using nationwide and local panel surveys, we find that support for LGBT+ activism increased locally after the Pride but did not diffuse nationwide, signaling how proximity mechanisms reinforce Pride effects. In survey experiments, we show that subjects are responsive to both mobilization and counter-mobilization appeals by local activists. We also find evidence from a behavioral experiment that the Pride had a positive effect on shifting the allocation of financial resources toward local pro-LGBT+ activists and away from opposition groups. Finally, in-depth interviews with local LGBT+ activists underscore the challenges facing LGBT+ activism in socially conservative societies but also point to the substantial possibilities of collective action on behalf of minorities at risk.","[{""name"": ""PHILLIP M.

10.1162/isec_a_00419,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,Opportunistic Repression: Civilian Targeting by the State in Response to COVID-19,"Abstract Across the globe, states have attempted to contain COVID-19 by restricting movement, closing schools and businesses, and banning large gatherings. Such measures have expanded the degree of sanctioned state intervention into civilians' lives. But existing theories of preventive and responsive repression cannot explain why some countries experienced surges in repression after states in Africa initiated COVID-19-related lockdowns. While responsive repression occurs when states quell protests or riots, “opportunistic repression” arises when states use crises to suppress the political opposition. An examination of the relationship between COVID-19 shutdown policies and state violence against civilians in Africa tests this theory of opportunistic repression. Findings reveal a large and statistically significant relationship between shutdowns and repression, which holds after conditioning for the spread and lethality of the disease within-country and over time. A subnational case study of repression in Uganda provides evidence that the increase in repression appears to be concentrated in opposition areas that showed less support for Yoweri Museveni in the 2016 elections. Opportunistic repression provides a better explanation than theories of preventive or responsive repression for why Uganda experienced a surge in repression in 2020 and in what areas. The results have implications for theories of repression, authoritarian survival, the politics of emergency, and security.","[{""name"": ""Donald Grasse"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Melissa Pavlik"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hilary Matfess"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Travis B.

This represents a shift away from climate policy as we know it—as classic environmental policy. Industrial policy and environmental policy differ in their policy goals, policy instruments, and distributional effects, one primarily concerned with economic development, the other with cutting greenhouse gas emissions. This raises questions about policy interactions between industrial and environmental policy in broader climate policy mixes and how these affect global decarbonization. This article identifies complementary and conflictual dynamics between industrial policy and environmental policy in both domestic and international climate politics. It shows how green industrial policy can advance climate goals and cooperation but can also present challenges to deepening climate cooperation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Developing an understanding of policy interactions is central to leveraging the potential of industrial policy to accelerate global decarbonization.","[{""name"": ""Jonas Meckling"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10842-019-00322-3"", ""10.1093/reep/res014"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2012.02.015"", ""10.1257/000282806777212332"", ""10.1111/ropr.12167"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2018.10.064"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104910"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grx001"", ""10.1142/S2010007810000169"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9805.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.09.008"", ""10.1177/0951629813518128"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.047"", ""10.1093/oxrep/graa015"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00312"", ""10.1017/bap.2018.20"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2015.06.014"", ""10.1515/9780804765602"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000762"", ""10.5089/9781513511955.001"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1240669"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.018"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.12.053"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00255"", ""10.1080/08109028.2017.1323746"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.05.005"", ""10.1038/s41558-020-0739-7"", ""10.1017/bap.2018.25"", ""10.1126/science.aab1336"", ""10.1016/j.eneco.2012.08.030"", ""10.1017/bap.2016.5"", ""10.4324/9780367136604"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2018.04.008"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027697"", ""10.1093/oxrep/gru025"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2016.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.022"", ""10.1080/13563467.2015.1079170"", ""10.2202/1469-3569.1350"", ""10.1080/02692171.2011.640312""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

We integrate theories on the political geography of candidate-voter relations with socio-psychological accounts of citizens’ local attachment, arguing that citizens vote for candidates from their own local communities as an expression of their place-based identity. To test our argument, we exploit a unique feature of the German mixed-member electoral system. We identify the causal effect of candidates’ localness by relying on within-electoral-district variation coupled with a geo-matching strategy on the level of municipalities ($$\hbox {N}=11175$$ N = 11175 ). The results show that voters exhibit a strong bias in favor of local candidates even when they are not competitive. More than only expecting particularistic benefits from representatives, citizens appear to vote for candidates from their own local community to express their place-based social identity.","[{""name"": ""Julia Schulte-Cloos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul C.

10.1111/jcms.13462,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,0302 Political Science; 0202 Applied Economics,In Search of Digital Sovereignty and Strategic Autonomy: Normative Power Europe to the Test of Its Geopolitical Ambitions,"This article analyses the recent use of European Union (EU) terminology of digital sovereignty and strategic autonomy, aiming to identify tensions between policy considerations of fundamental rights, free market principles and geopolitical concerns. These tensions are rooted in the disparity between the EU's considerable economic and regulatory power in digital matters and its limited mandate and capabilities in foreign policy. The article also explores the translation of the notions of digital sovereignty and strategic autonomy into EU policy. It identifies three important trends in the geopoliticisation of the EU agenda on digital technologies: (1) the instrumental use of ‘classic’ internal market policies to exert geopolitical influence; (2) the imposition of foreign policy imperatives on national markets; and (3) new ‘hybrid’ digital policies that combine internal market concerns, fundamental rights and geopolitical concerns. Ultimately, digital sovereignty has inherent tensions with the EU's normative power in digital issues and may also result in a strategic cacophony.","[{""name"": ""Dennis Broeders"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Security and Global Affairs (ISGA) Leiden University  The Hague""]}, {""name"": ""Fabio Cristiano"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of History and Art History Utrecht University  Utrecht""]}, {""name"": ""Monica Kaminska"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Security and Global Affairs (ISGA) Leiden University  The Hague""]}]","[""10.1111/jcms.13300"", ""10.1080/09662839.2022.2102895"", ""10.37514/RNT-J.1996.3.6.21"", ""10.1080/09662839.2022.2101887"", ""10.1080/13501760500451733"", ""10.1080/15705850802699961"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190088583.001.0001"", ""10.1080/1057610X.2021.1928887"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3748098"", ""10.1177/1461444819865984"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3532421"", ""10.1002/j.cyo2.20191301.0002"", ""10.1017/9781108780605"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300181357.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09662839.2022.2102896"", ""10.1080/09662830412331308136"", ""10.1007/s13347-020-00423-6"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2011.02194.x"", ""10.1177/2053951720982012"", ""10.1080/13501760500451634"", ""10.1093/jeclap/lpy023"", ""10.1111/1475‐6765.00080"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1trkjd1"", ""10.2307/2539141"", ""10.1515/9781400823260"", ""10.1162/0162288042879940"", ""10.1093/isr/viz022"", ""10.1080/09662839.2022.2031991"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00353"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2009.02042.x"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00405"", ""10.1111/jcms.12932"", ""10.1093/fpa/ory008"", ""10.1080/07341510500037487"", ""10.1080/09662839.2022.2101883"", ""10.1080/23738871.2020.1832550"", ""10.1093/isr/viz044"", ""10.1111/1467‐9248.00096"", ""10.14763/2020.4.1532"", ""10.1093/cybsec/tyab017"", ""10.14763/2021.3.1575"", ""10.1177/0967010603344007"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2007.00717.x"", ""10.9785/cri‐2021‐220402"", ""10.54648/315870"", ""10.1057/9780230305601"", ""10.1093/idpl/ipaa003""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

We conducted an audit study of 6,000 U.S. state legislators to analyze whether women outperform or underperform men on constituency service in light of the extra effort they spend on policy. We find that women are more likely to respond to constituent requests than men, even after accounting for their heightened level of policy activity. Female legislators are the most responsive in conservative districts, where women may see the barriers to their election as especially high. We then demonstrate that our findings are not a function of staff responsiveness, legislator ideology, or responsiveness to female constituents or gender issues. The results provide additional evidence that women perform better than their male counterparts across a range of representational activities.","[{""name"": ""Danielle M.

Why did the Union agree on a large‐scale financial response to the corona pandemic, despite member states' very different immediate reactions to the crisis and their opposing attitudes towards common debt? This article argues for the decisiveness of France and Germany's role within the Union and their tight bilateral political cooperation. The ‘embedded bilateralism’ approach to European integration and EU politics explains how and why France and Germany, starting from different poles, came together and established joint positions, paving the way for an overall European compromise. Focusing on these two countries' particular leadership role advances the theoretical debate about the actors most crucial for driving European integration, especially in times of severe crisis.","[{""name"": ""Ulrich Krotz"", ""affiliation"": [""European University Institute  Florence""]}, {""name"": ""Lucas Schramm"", ""affiliation"": [""European University Institute  Florence""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139858472"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198703617.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.914629"", ""10.1080/07036337.2015.1101957"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316422991.012"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000409"", ""10.1080/07036337.2021.1877690"", ""10.1111/jcms.12803"", ""10.1177/1354066107080129"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199759934.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.12112"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1181872"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1467951"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i1.3645"", ""10.1080/07388940701860318"", ""10.1080/07036337.2014.990137"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.1993.tb00477.x"", ""10.1111/jcms.12804"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2010.02117.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12704-6"", ""10.3917/pe.194.0075"", ""10.1080/01402389908425286"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1619803""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

We describe how these changes alter policy and disrupt civil servants’ influence over agency decisions, potentially shaping their career choices. Using data on careers from over three million federal employees in the United States from 1988 to 2011, we evaluate how administration changes influence turnover in a series of regression analyses. We find substantial stability in the civil service but also some pockets of responsiveness to political factors, particularly among career senior executives in agencies with views divergent from the president’s. A combination of factors, including transitions, policy priorities, and ideological differences, could increase turnover propensity for these employees by nearly one-third in some agencies over an administration’s first term. This has implications for understanding possible mechanisms linking politics and organizational capacity and for understanding how and for whom politics is influential in career decisions.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Bolton"", ""affiliation"": [""Emory University""]}, {""name"": ""John M de Figueiredo"", ""affiliation"": [""Duke University""]}, {""name"": ""David E Lewis"", ""affiliation"": [""Vanderbilt University""]}]","[""10.2307/1959650"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001157"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul003"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00527.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus044"", ""10.1093/jleo/ewv025"", ""10.1561/100.00012085"", ""10.1016/0047-2727(82)90042-1"", ""10.1086/378695"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01751.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq024"", ""10.3998/mpub.15149"", ""10.1177/0275074008317248"", ""10.1177/0160323X11403325"", ""10.1177/0091026016652424"", ""10.1561/100.00018015"", ""10.1177/0951629813518126"", ""10.1177/0734371X11408701"", ""10.1111/gove.12036"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00559.x"", ""10.1093/pan/mpm009"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024363"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000230"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.00133"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy069"", ""10.7249/CB156"", ""10.1111/gove.12023"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00286.x"", ""10.1007/s11115-014-0277-8"", ""10.7312/gold10696"", ""10.1111/puar.12435"", ""10.1177/0149206311424943"", ""10.1111/puar.13108"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024288"", ""10.15763/issn.2374-7781.2010.31.0.91-112"", ""10.2307/145906"", ""10.1177/0734371X9501500406"", ""10.1177/0275074015583712"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024389"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum029"", ""10.2307/977108"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00193"", ""10.1177/027507408901900102"", ""10.1177/0734371X08315771"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum013"", ""10.1177/0734371X9901900402"", ""10.1093/jopart/mug009"", ""10.1177/0275074017706674"", ""10.1037/a0030723"", ""10.2307/976618"", ""10.2307/975472"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0005"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02414.x"", ""10.1177/027507408201600402"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024401"", ""10.1353/book.42322"", ""10.1086/703072"", ""10.1086/694846"", ""10.1111/puar.12505"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00049"", ""10.1177/2041386610382152"", ""10.2307/976492"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum019"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00696.x"", ""10.1177/0095399708320187""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

Results show that stock market sectoral connectedness varies across time. Connectedness is strongest during the 2008 crisis, the double‐digit inflation and stock market crash of 2011, following the national elections of 2014, and the demonetization of 2016. Among sectors, consumers' spending, industry, finance, and basic materials are net transmitters of shocks, while information technology, fast‐moving consumer goods, health care, and telecommunications are net receivers. Findings can help formulate policies that alleviate sectoral imbalances and promote balanced growth. They are also useful for devising optimal portfolio diversification strategies.","[{""name"": ""Ioannis Chatziantoniou"", ""affiliation"": [""Economics and Finance Subject Group University of Portsmouth  Portsmouth UK""]}, {""name"": ""David Gabauer"", ""affiliation"": [""Data Analysis Systems Software Competence Center Hagenberg  Hagenberg Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Hardik A.

10.1093/jopart/muz038,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Do Top Managers' Individual Characteristics Affect Accounting Manipulation in the Public Sector?,"AbstractDrawing on upper echelons theory, the article investigates the potential impact of top managers’ background and demographic characteristics and personality traits on organizational decisions in the public sector. The top-management figure being investigated is the municipal chief financial officer (CFO) and the specific organizational decision under analysis is the extent of revenue misrepresentation during both budget formulation and execution. The empirical setting is provided by the CFOs of Italian municipalities with populations above 15,000 over a 3-year period (2012–14). Financial data are drawn from existing databases. Non-financial data are collected through an online survey. The results show that top managers’ individual characteristics and traits do influence the extent of accounting manipulation. In particular, revenue misrepresentation was found to be smaller in the presence of female managers, managers with degrees in business administration, and managers describing themselves as “conscientious”. These effects on accounting manipulation were moderated by auditors’ and opposition councilors’ oversight, managers’ experience, and the presence of local elections. The article extends upper echelons theory and its applications in several directions: from the private to the public context, from CEOs to CFOs, from managerial decisions in general to accounting choices, and from background and demographic variables to personality traits.","[{""name"": ""Eugenio Anessi-Pessina"", ""affiliation"": [""Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore""]}, {""name"": ""Mariafrancesca Sicilia"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bergamo""]}]","[""10.1080/03003930.2015.1012194"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02590.x"", ""10.1177/1088868306294907"", ""10.1111/faam.12088"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.1991.tb00688.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12969"", ""10.1007/BF00381722"", ""10.1007/s10797-008-9103-y"", ""10.1016/j.jmoneco.2005.04.004"", ""10.1016/0169-2070(89)90035-6"", ""10.1016/0169-2070(89)90036-8"", ""10.1037/a0024004"", ""10.1037/h0042403"", ""10.1080/01900692.2013.798810"", ""10.1177/0275074012446509"", ""10.1207/s15327752jpa6401_2"", ""10.1002/smj.610"", ""10.2308/accr.2002.77.s-1.35"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus035"", ""10.2307/2393314"", ""10.2307/3109951"", ""10.1111/j.1911-3846.2011.01097.x"", ""10.2308/accr.2006.81.4.781"", ""10.1111/j.0275-1100.2004.02403002.x"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.24345254"", ""10.5465/amr.2005.17293355"", ""10.5465/amr.1984.4277628"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.05.003"", ""10.1017/S1930297500000346"", ""10.2308/acch.1999.13.4.365"", ""10.1037/a0036074"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5850.2010.00970.x"", ""10.2478/tekhne-2019-0001"", ""10.5089/9781475502640.006"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup017"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.1994.tb00073.x"", ""10.2307/2491047"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.84.4.602"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui013"", ""10.2308/acch.2003.17.s-1.1"", ""10.3758/s13428-011-0066-z"", ""10.1007/BF00141382"", ""10.1108/17542411011081383"", ""10.1046/j.0275-1100.1999.01158.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00553.x"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(01)00042-3"", ""10.1177/1465116506063706"", ""10.1016/0169-2070(95)00592-9"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.535"", ""10.1080/1366987032000123856"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu019"", ""10.2307/3440854"", ""10.1080/00224545.1995.9713963"", ""10.1002/for.944"", ""10.1257/aer.98.2.475"", ""10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00224-0"", ""10.1081/PAD-120030257"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvx010"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02491.x"", ""10.1111/1540-5850.00766"", ""10.1037/h0035594"", ""10.1111/j.0267-4424.2005.00227.x"", ""10.2307/3110151"", ""10.1111/j.1542-4774.2010.tb00537.x"", ""10.1007/s10663-006-9015-y"", ""10.1081/PAD-120030260"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2004.02.013"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024325"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw027""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Accounting', 'Public Administration', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
10.1111/padm.12703,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Distinguishing the street-level policy entrepreneur,"AbstractPolicy entrepreneurs—individuals who champion a policy and engage in intense advocacy to secure it—are most frequently characterized as political elites or individuals well connected to such elites. However, an emerging literature suggests that street‐level bureaucrats who deliver government services to the public can also prosecute policy entrepreneurship. There has been little investigation of how these actors differ from elite‐level policy entrepreneurs who focus on agenda‐setting and initial policy approval. Evidence from six case vignettes from US state wetland policy suggest that street‐level policy entrepreneurs are distinguished by defensive motivation, greater constancy of effort, recruitment of a less politically powerful network of supporters, and challenges associated with cultivating ties to external resource providers and intra‐governmental allies. Street‐level policy entrepreneurship helps explain policy innovation within bureaucracies and by bureaucrats, offering new insight into the motivation and behaviours of ground‐level officials whose day‐to‐day choices shape policy.","[{""name"": ""Gwen Arnold"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Environmental Science and Policy University of California Davis  USA""]}]","[""10.1080/13501763.2013.781824"", ""10.1007/BF00478431"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00188.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X14000154"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.806577"", ""10.1111/psj.12388"", ""10.1007/s11077-017-9296-y"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a003546"", ""10.1080/13876980902888103"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01454.x"", ""10.1177/1532673X01293001"", ""10.1080/10967494.2016.1235641"", ""10.1177/0170840699205004"", ""10.1177/02750740122064802"", ""10.1108/14691930110400128"", ""10.1108/01437730210449357"", ""10.1017/S0047279416000246"", ""10.2307/2269553"", ""10.1080/13501760600808964"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2011.00886.x"", ""10.2307/3234884"", ""10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb02036.x"", ""10.3102/01623737028004357"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00650.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02131.x"", ""10.2307/3380990"", ""10.1023/A:1016677020228"", ""10.1080/13501769780000081"", ""10.1002/pam.4050050208"", ""10.1080/17516234.2019.1631241"", ""10.1097/01.aids.0000172879.20628.e1"", ""10.2307/20159610"", ""10.3998/mpub.11924"", ""10.4135/9781848608214.n20"", ""10.2307/2111674"", ""10.1080/25741292.2019.1675989"", ""10.2307/2648004"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00329.x"", ""10.2307/2648004"", ""10.1017/S0003055400261510"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2006.00616.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123126"", ""10.1215/03616878-22-3-721"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9515.2007.00588.x"", ""10.1111/psj.12405"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00165.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1992.tb00332.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024289"", ""10.2307/1964135"", ""10.1017/S0898588X03000129"", ""10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb03831.x"", ""10.1177/0899764002312001"", ""10.2307/977380"", ""10.1177/0020852311407364"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2008.00414.x"", ""10.1177/027507409602600405"", ""10.2307/1954434"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.12.020"", ""10.17763/haer.47.2.v870r1v16786270x"", ""10.1177/1532673X9101900207"", ""10.1080/17516234.2019.1663338""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

Besides providing an overview of the state of the art in automatic software verification, the goal of the competition is to establish standards, provide a platform for exchange to developers of such tools, educate PhD students on reproducibility approaches and benchmarking, and provide computing resources to developers that do not have access to compute clusters. The competition consisted of 23 805 verification tasks for C programs and 586 verification tasks for Java programs. The specifications include reachability, memory safety, overflows, and termination. This year, the competition introduced a new competition track on witness validation, where validators for verification witnesses are evaluated with respect to their quality.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_27"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00121"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_25"", ""10.1134/S0361768820080022"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_38"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_43"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-71500-7_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627787"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30826-0_17"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627783"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627791"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627829"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7635975"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-22308-2_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_22"", ""10.1145/2049697.2049700"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_15"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985839"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33826-7_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_41"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48869-1_5"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00619-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27940-9_13"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2010.05812"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_36"", ""10.1145/3519939.3523727"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15"", ""10.1007/s10009-015-0407-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_19"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2303.06477"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_7"", ""10.1007/s10817-019-09535-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49052-6"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00617-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_29"", ""10.1145/3478536"", ""10.1145/3332466.3374529"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41600-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02508-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_31"", ""10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774672"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_37"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_44"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_24"", ""10.1145/1889997.1890000"", ""10.1007/s10515-013-0122-2"", ""10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_34"", ""10.5281/zenodo.6147218"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_29"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409734"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_38"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102257"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_23"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970337"", ""10.15514/ISPRAS-2017-29(4)-13"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7612021"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_36"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_3""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muaa046,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Citizen Reactions to Bureaucratic Encounters: Different Ways of Coping With Public Authorities,"AbstractCommon to most studies on street-level bureaucrats is a fundamental acknowledgment that behaviors of citizens with whom the street-level bureaucrats interact play an important role for their decision-making. However, within literature, there is a lack of generic and systematic attention to the agency of the citizens. This article aims to respond to this criticism and answer the questions: How do citizens cope with public encounters? Do citizen behaviors towards public authorities divide into distinct, meaningful, multidimensional behavior types? Through an explorative theory-based approach, the article opens those questions. Based on self-reported survey-data on behavior, from a representative sample of Danish citizens, we use latent class analysis (LCA) to identify systematic patterns in citizens’ behavior towards public authorities (exemplified by Tax and Home Care Referral authorities). We identify five types of citizen coping behavior in public encounters: “Resisters,” “Activists,” “Accommodators,” “Flighters,” and “Cooperators.” The five types of coping behaviors can be placed in a three-dimensional space measuring degree of activity, degree of preparation, and degree of opposition. We suggest that this insight and conceptual framework of citizen coping behavior can create a starting point for researchers to embark a research agenda on citizens’ coping behavior in citizen-state encounters.","[{""name"": ""Vibeke Lehmann Nielsen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Aarhus""]}, {""name"": ""Helle Ørsted Nielsen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Aarhus""]}, {""name"": ""Mette Bisgaard"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Aarhus""]}]","[""10.2307/1947195"", ""10.1093/jopart/muv036"", ""10.1080/10967494.2017.1329761"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy008"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2012.02101.x"", ""10.1002/9781118619179"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.1995.tb00149.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.1994.tb00130.x"", ""10.1086/604228"", ""10.1177/1473325011413629"", ""10.4135/9781446213551"", ""10.1111/j.1471-1842.2005.00551.x"", ""10.1086/225263"", ""10.2307/2576127"", ""10.1509/jmkr.38.2.269.18845"", ""10.4324/9780429197352"", ""10.1002/9780470977811"", ""10.1177/0038038587021001008"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2007.07.002"", ""10.2307/799656"", ""10.1177/02610183020220040701"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.841980"", ""10.1080/03643101003608976"", ""10.1177/0275074018765822"", ""10.1017/S0047279400006152"", ""10.1921/17466105.11.1.36"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198264750.001.0001"", ""10.1111/puar.12441"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus036"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.997906"", ""10.2307/j.ctv34wmx15"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw070"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy002"", ""10.1515/9781503624191"", ""10.4337/9780857938732.00007"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-5297-8_4"", ""10.1002/9780470316801"", ""10.1017/S0047279497004984"", ""10.2307/2137163"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.114.3.533"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00005006"", ""10.3998/mpub.11924"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12633"", ""10.2307/976601"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu009"", ""10.1080/10439460802008660"", ""10.1111/j.1530-0277.2000.tb02070.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02544.x"", ""10.1057/9780230593169"", ""10.1007/BF00135937"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2005.00136.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.2007.00255.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux025"", ""10.5465/amr.1991.4279002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511550034"", ""10.4337/9780857938732"", ""10.2307/2131904"", ""10.2307/2939044"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024341"", ""10.1177/1473325015606188"", ""10.1111/spc3.12265"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2011.01106.x"", ""10.1177/1473325011409478"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226768786.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1540-5893.3703002"", ""10.1177/0275074015611744"", ""10.1177/002188638402000108"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu056"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1177/1473325016683793"", ""10.1093/jopart/muh013"", ""10.2307/3033646"", ""10.1002/pam.1023""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/psj.12364,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,"Capacity Building toward Resilience: How Communities Recover, Learn, and Change in the Aftermath of Extreme Events","When faced with natural disasters, communities respond in diverse ways, with processes that reflect the extent of damage experienced by the community, their resource availability, and stakeholder needs. Local‐level processes drive decisions about mitigating future flood risks, such as if, how, and where to rebuild, as well as changes in zoning practices and public outreach programs. Because of their potentially recurring nature, floods offer an opportunity for communities to learn from and adapt to these experiences with the goal of increasing resiliency through deliberation, modification of former policies, and adoption of new policies. By following the response to the September 2013 floods in seven Colorado communities, this study investigates if, how, and why communities successfully learn from extreme events and change their local government policies to increase resilience and decrease vulnerability to future floods.

Using quantitative and qualitative data, the paper shows how and why policy banks implement a peculiar means of development finance, i.e., funding projects in developing countries with relatively high-interest rate loans, differing from low-interest rate development-finance credits from industrial countries. The paper argues that China’s official development finance is not only about practicing economic statecraft or facilitating export-led growth; it is also the internationalization of a development-finance model that has facilitated its own development in the past decades. In this model, the state does not play a direct role in allocating fiscal revenue; rather, it plays an indirect role in enhancing creditworthiness of projects and making them financially viable. The “state-supported, market-based” Chinese credits reshape development finance and offer an alternative option for the developing world.","[{""name"": ""Muyang Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/186810261304200105"", ""10.1093/0195139690.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9485.1969.tb00038.x"", ""10.1002/jid.1798"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12138"", ""10.1080/13563467.2019.1613353"", ""10.1111/dech.12470"", ""10.1080/09557571.2012.744642"", ""10.1257/089533003769204344"", ""10.3386/w20685"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-7554-9"", ""10.1017/9781108552738"", ""10.1111/rego.12253"", ""10.1515/9780804765602"", ""10.1080/13563467.2017.1321625"", ""10.1002/jid.3081"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9957.1954.tb00021.x"", ""10.5509/20199215"", ""10.1080/10670564.2018.1557947"", ""10.1017/9781316597354"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.08.011"", ""10.1080/09636419908429402"", ""10.5040/9781350220270"", ""10.2307/1952366"", ""10.4324/9780203555644"", ""10.2307/1928662"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2011.04.014"", ""10.1080/01436590903037366"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-3165-6"", ""10.1515/9780691187181"", ""10.7591/9781501720383"", ""10.1017/9781316779385"", ""10.1002/jid.3120"", ""10.1080/10670564.2019.1580428"", ""10.1142/9133""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

This study examines whether such institutionalization has occurred in the coffee sector, the commodity with the most widespread adoption of certified products and over 30 years’ experience of private governance, and tests hypotheses on facilitating and inhibiting conditions. It finds that while norm generation around responsible supply chain management and the organizational institutionalization of standard‐setting bodies is well advanced, the practice of internalizing social and environmental externalities through the routinized production and purchase of higher priced certified goods continues to be questioned by industry actors. Indeed, conditions that favored normative and organizational institutionalization, such as high levels of industry concentration, product differentiation, and deliberative interaction, are shown to represent barriers to the practice‐oriented institutionalization of market‐driven regulatory governance.","[{""name"": ""Janina Grabs"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science, Westfälische Wilhelms‐Universität Münster Münster Germany""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400830732.44"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300190533.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511627170.009"", ""10.1146/annurev.environ.32.053006.141106"", ""10.1111/rego.12075"", ""10.1007/s12571-015-0446-9"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.10.002"", ""10.1080/03066150903498796"", ""10.1080/01448765.2001.9754920"", ""10.1525/sp.2007.54.3.229"", ""10.1086/518871"", ""10.1111/rego.12051"", ""10.2979/7419.0"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2007.00021.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2012.01090.x"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.01.002"", ""10.1007/s10460-012-9372-z"", ""10.1080/21513732.2017.1316520"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1319-1"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070257"", ""10.1515/9781400838790"", ""10.1111/1468-0491.00199"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9388.2007.00560.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262012751.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0305829810371018"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.10.007"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/aa625e"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2009.01.002"", ""10.1177/1464993413504354"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2011.08.008"", ""10.1111/j.1759-5436.2001.mp32003008.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01519.x"", ""10.1007/s11077-015-9219-8"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.01.005"", ""10.1111/glob.12097"", ""10.3138/9781442684331"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262012751.003.0002"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/044055"", ""10.1016/j.foodpol.2005.05.007"", ""10.1515/9781400848669"", ""10.1017/S2047102516000121"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00535.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1110.1412"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1316-4"", ""10.1504/IJTG.2004.004548"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2005.02.003"", ""10.1002/sd.507"", ""10.1073/pnas.0913714108"", ""10.1177/1354068898004001004"", ""10.1111/joms.12144"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.08.029"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.1996.tb00242.x"", ""10.1515/9781400830732"", ""10.1515/9781400830732.1"", ""10.1016/j.wdp.2017.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.06.007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511761850"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808678"", ""10.1353/jod.1994.0010"", ""10.1353/jod.1996.0034"", ""10.1177/1070496505280062"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2005.00293.x"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00032-3"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00120.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2008.10.001"", ""10.1007/s10460-006-9047-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777.002"", ""10.1080/00938157.2013.844035"", ""10.5465/AMR.2007.26585837"", ""10.1111/joms.12203"", ""10.1111/gove.12267"", ""10.1007/s00267-016-0786-z"", ""10.2307/20048784"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.141706"", ""10.1515/9781400830732.151"", ""10.1177/1070496516640857"", ""10.1111/agec.12132""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Plant Science', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Delineating the Effects of Feminine Trait and Feminine Issue Messages on Evaluations of Female Candidates,"AbstractCurrent scholarship offers conflicting conclusions about whether female candidates have a feminine advantage or a disadvantage. Previous work does not consider whether voters respond similarly to all types of messages that might emphasize feminine stereotypes, such as feminine trait and feminine issue messages. I argue that voters will respond differently to trait-based feminine messages relative to issue-based feminine messages. I test the effects of trait-based and issue-based feminine messages through two survey experiments. The results consistently show that emphasizing feminine traits harms female candidates, whereas emphasizing feminine issues helps female candidates. I use role congruity theory to argue that feminine traits activate feminine stereotypes about women, and feminine issues do not activate these stereotypes. I also show that trait-based and issue-based feminine messages affect Democratic and Republican female candidates in very different ways. These results have implications for the ability of women to win elected office and reverse the pervasive underrepresentation of women in politics.","[{""name"": ""Nichole M.

10.1111/jcms.13440,JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES,0302 Political Science; 0202 Applied Economics,A 'Geopolitical Commission': Supranationalism Meets Global Power Competition,"AbstractThis article examines the origins and operationalisation of the concept of a ‘geopolitical Commission’, which has been promoted by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen since 2019. This concept has been used to guide the stronger co‐ordination of the external aspects of the Commission's work. It is also symptomatic of the growing role of strategic considerations in the Commission's recent initiatives, particularly through the objective of strengthening the EU's ‘open strategic autonomy’. To explain this phenomenon, I combine three different theoretical perspectives: neorealism, neofunctionalism, and geoeconomics. I conclude that the geopolitical Commission should be understood as the result of the interactions between exogenous factors – the intensification of global power competition and the rise of geoeconomic strategies – and endogenous factors, such as the rivalry between the Commission and the European External Action Service and the functional link between the Commission's economic powers and international security issues.","[{""name"": ""Pierre Haroche"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Politics and International Relations Queen Mary University of London  London UK""]}]","[""10.1080/09557571.2019.1588227"", ""10.3998/mpub.10072208"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1526204"", ""10.1080/13501763.2021.1954064"", ""10.1111/jcms.12608"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198703617.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674545960"", ""10.1080/13501760500043860"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190088583.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14650045.2018.1477754"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.646779"", ""10.54648/EERR2021005"", ""10.4324/9781315771151-3"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00351"", ""10.1057/9781137294708"", ""10.1080/09662839.2021.1906229"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1609570"", ""10.1080/07036337.2013.774779"", ""10.1111/jcms.12941"", ""10.1080/13501760903087696"", ""10.1111/jcms.12932"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492044"", ""10.17645/pag.v10i1.4739"", ""10.3917/rfsp.513.0431"", ""10.1111/jcms.12288"", ""10.7591/cornell/9780801449352.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2009.02057.x"", ""10.1163/1871191X-13010011"", ""10.1080/23340460.2020.1834427""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"

Analyses of primary data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore found that disease risk perception is positively related to stereotyping and prejudice against Chinese immigrants. Individuals who used social media for news were more likely to stereotype and express prejudice. However, those who engaged in frequent heterogenous discussions, and had more extensive social networks, were less likely to stereotype and express prejudice. Higher social and political trust was also associated with lower stereotyping and prejudice. Finally, moderation effects of network characteristics on the relationship between risk perception, social trust, and prejudice were observed.","[{""name"": ""Saifuddin Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": [""Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Vivian Hsueh Hua Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Arul Indrasen Chib"", ""affiliation"": [""Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore""]}]","[""10.1177/1532673X08330273"", ""10.1111/pops.12479"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edaa001"", ""10.1177/1748048516656305"", ""10.1080/10584609.2017.1316329"", ""10.1126/science.aaa1160"", ""10.1177/0021886392283003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00826.x"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp011"", ""10.1057/ap.2015.28"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.01831.x"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01601.x"", ""10.2224/sbp.2004.32.1.55"", ""10.1111/jcc4.12129"", ""10.1080/15205436.2016.1161803"", ""10.1177/0093650216644020"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.003"", ""10.2307/1959141"", ""10.1111/jcom.12084"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.102.3.414"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29855-5_9"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.016"", ""10.1177/1461444815616224"", ""10.1177/019791839603000207"", ""10.1177/1368430204046142"", ""10.1177/106591290005300102"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00441.x"", ""10.1111/jcom.12103"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-102512-194818"", ""10.1080/15387216.2014.908313"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2008.00738.x"", ""10.1177/0001699305059943"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00357.x"", ""10.1027/1864-1105/a000050"", ""10.1080/12294659.2017.1316945"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00659.x"", ""10.5395/rde.2013.38.1.52"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.007"", ""10.1093/esr/jci007"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2007.11.001"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12271"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420180102"", ""10.1353/sof.2003.0038"", ""10.1111/bjso.12203"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.puhe.2018.07.002"", ""10.1111/risa.12537"", ""10.1093/esr/18.1.17"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01672.x"", ""10.1080/01292986.2018.1504976"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8309.1996.tb01088.x"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(96)00026-0"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00717.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00928.x"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu089"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2016.05.001"", ""10.1348/014466608X284443"", ""10.1007/s11211-008-0087-7"", ""10.1080/01419870802379312"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.779"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Exploring Implicit Public Leadership Theories,"AbstractWhile scholarship on public leadership has recently gained momentum in public administration, it is unclear how researchers should account for the “public” in public leadership. We shed new light on this issue by introducing the approach of Implicit Leadership Theories (ILTs) to the field of public administration. This socio-cognitive approach suggests that people’s everyday, rather than scholarly, theories about the characteristics of leaders provide important explanations of how they respond to leadership situations. We investigate whether people hold Implicit Public Leadership Theories (IPLTs) and explore how these images of public leaders contrast with generic ILTs. We extract these taxonomies from data gathered in a survey experiment in Germany (N = 1,072). Results show that IPLTs have overlaps with generic ILTs but are unique in terms of rule abidance and innovation-orientation. In contrast, charismatic aspects of leadership only figure in generic ILTs. The structure of ILTs, both generic and public, is surprisingly stable across the subsamples of public and non-public employees. We discuss how the findings may assist public management scholars in the development of explicit theories of public leadership and derive a research agenda based on a socio-cognitive approach.","[{""name"": ""Rick Vogel"", ""affiliation"": [""Universität Hamburg""]}, {""name"": ""Laura Werkmeister"", ""affiliation"": [""Universität Hamburg""]}]","[""10.1002/ejsp.575"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.02117.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muz004"", ""10.1177/0734371X9001100101"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut033"", ""10.1177/0019556119910101"", ""10.1111/padm.12199"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.425"", ""10.1016/0090-2616(90)90070-6"", ""10.1177/0095399707303634"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.72.1.97"", ""10.1080/14719037.2017.1348731"", ""10.1016/S1048-9843(99)00018-1"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.60.6.736"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2007.03.002"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.89.2.293"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2013.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.01.009"", ""10.4324/9781315095097-2"", ""10.4135/9781446247631"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq069"", ""10.1111/1464-0597.00008"", ""10.1080/10967494.2010.503793"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu055"", ""10.4324/9780203781159"", ""10.1177/0095399701334002"", ""10.1007/BF02289447"", ""10.1016/1048-9843(90)90014-9"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12193"", ""10.1111/puar.12380"", ""10.1111/puar.12318"", ""10.1177/0095399707300703"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2014.09.002"", ""10.2307/2529310"", ""10.4324/9781315787145"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-012119-045434"", ""10.1016/0030-5073(84)90043-6"", ""10.4324/9780203423950"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.12.016"", ""10.1080/14719037.2017.1335342"", ""10.1016/S0007-6813(04)00046-1"", ""10.2307/2392813"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2017.12.003"", ""10.1016/1048-9843(94)90005-1"", ""10.1111/puar.12706"", ""10.4337/9781847202932.00015"", ""10.1093/jopart/muj006"", ""10.1111/puar.12534"", ""10.2307/976618"", ""10.4324/9780203771617"", ""10.1093/pa/gsg114"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024276"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.07.003"", ""10.18637/jss.v048.i02"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum035"", ""10.1016/0030-5073(77)90046-0"", ""10.5465/amle.2010.0015"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.01.006"", ""10.1126/science.148.3668.395"", ""10.1086/209528"", ""10.1007/s11135-007-9143-x"", ""10.1111/padm.12224"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2013.11.007"", ""10.22140/pv.192"", ""10.1080/14719037.2015.1045020"", ""10.1177/1742715013476081"", ""10.1108/IJOTB-07-02-2004-B002"", ""10.1111/padm.12017"", ""10.1111/puar.12069"", ""10.1177/0734371X14521458"", ""10.5465/amd.2016.0029"", ""10.1108/EBHRM-08-2015-0034"", ""10.1080/14719037.2014.895031"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup003""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Public Administration', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
10.1111/rego.12440,REGULATION & GOVERNANCE,0301 Law; 0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,What drives compliance with COVID-19 measures over time? Explaining changing impacts with Goal Framing Theory,"AbstractThe COVID‐19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study which factors drive compliance and how the evolving context in society –virus fluctuations and changing government measures – changes the impact of these factors. Extant literature lists many factors that drive compliance – notably enforcement, trust, legitimacy. Most of these studies, however, do not look across time: whether a changing context for citizens changes the impact of factors driving compliance. In this study, we use Lindenberg's Goal Framing Theory to explain the dynamics of these drivers of compliance during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We formulate hypotheses for pro‐socialness, trust in government, observed respect for rules, rule effectiveness, rule appropriateness, fear of COVID‐19 (severity and proximity), opportunities for pleasure and happiness, as well as worsened income position. We test our hypotheses with data collected at three different moments during the beginning of the COVID‐19 crisis in Flanders, Belgium. Findings show that over time the constellations of factors that drive compliance change and, later in the pandemic, more distinct groups of citizens with different motivations to comply are identified. The overall conclusion is that the voluntary basis for compliance becomes more fragile over time, with a more differentiated pattern of drivers of compliance emerging. Public policy and communication need to adapt to these changes over time and address different groups of citizens.","[{""name"": ""Frédérique Six"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Group Politics and Public Governance University of Antwerp GOVTRUST Centre of Excellence Antwerp Belgium"", ""Department of Political Science and Public Administration Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Amsterdam The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Steven de Vadder"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Group Politics and Public Governance University of Antwerp GOVTRUST Centre of Excellence Antwerp Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Monika Glavina"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Social Sciences, Research Group Politics and Public Governance University of Antwerp GOVTRUST Centre of Excellence Antwerp Belgium"", ""Faculty of Law, Research Group Government and Law University of Antwerp GOVTRUST Centre of Excellence Antwerp Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Koen Verhoest"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Group Politics and Public Governance University of Antwerp GOVTRUST Centre of Excellence Antwerp Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Koen Pepermans"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Antwerp Antwerp Belgium""]}]","[""10.1108/JFRA-12-2015-0107"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195070705.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-62853-7_2"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.11.016"", ""10.1348/014466607X244970"", ""10.1177/0022002710372329"", ""10.1108/BFJ-11-2016-0539"", ""10.1080/10439463.1994.9964679"", ""10.4337/9781848449077"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.2007.00250.x"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2006.10.004"", ""10.4135/9781446249413"", ""10.1111/j.1547-5069.2005.00059.x"", ""10.2105/AJPH.94.4.562"", ""10.1111/1745-9125.12138"", ""10.1016/j.glt.2020.06.003"", ""10.1257/jel.47.2.448"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802843"", ""10.1016/j.bandc.2012.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.02.009"", ""10.1177/1478929920948684"", ""10.1080/13669877.2020.1758193"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2012.01160.x"", ""10.1007/s101010100032"", ""10.1038/s41586-020-2405-7"", ""10.1177/0020852315585950"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6478.2009.00462.x"", ""10.1007/s11469-020-00281-5"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.997906"", ""10.31234/osf.io/uzwgf"", ""10.4324/9781315745572-3"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.475"", ""10.3390/ijerph17114148"", ""10.1111/1467-6435.00156"", ""10.1007/0-387-28032-4_2"", ""10.1515/9783110472974-005"", ""10.1017/9781108759458.029"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00499.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0158671"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus057"", ""10.1023/B:LAHU.0000022322.94776.ca"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2009.01043.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113370"", ""10.1787/9789264208117-en"", ""10.1787/9789264278219-en"", ""10.31234/osf.io/rpcy4"", ""10.31234/osf.io/y2cg5"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100452"", ""10.31234/osf.io/364qj"", ""10.1177/070674370404900612"", ""10.1136/bmj.b2651"", ""10.1101/2021.04.07.21255010"", ""10.1016/j.hlpt.2013.09.003"", ""10.4337/9781785365577.00005"", ""10.2105/AJPH.93.11.1887"", ""10.2307/2667052"", ""10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110615-085141"", ""10.1515/9781400828609"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3582626"", ""10.5751/ES-05721-180310"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30063-5"", ""10.1016/j.puhe.2020.03.007"", ""10.31234/osf.io/dz428"", ""10.31234/osf.io/pkm2a""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Thus, if politics feels like debate, people will be motivated to argue for their side. If politics feels like deliberation, they will be motivated to seek consensus through open‐minded processing. Results from three experiments demonstrate: (1) Politics evokes thoughts similar to conflictual contexts and dissimilar from deliberative contexts. (2) Consequently, information labeled “political” primes the motivation to counterargue, leading to opinion polarization. Absent such labeling, no such motivation is evident, explaining why bias is common but not inherent to politics. (3) Despite this capacity for bias, people can be motivated to actively process and accept counterattitudinal information by simply making the value of open‐mindedness salient. This suggests open‐minded discourse is possible even absent motivation to evaluate information accurately. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for political discourse.","[{""name"": ""Eric Groenendyk"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Memphis""]}, {""name"": ""Yanna Krupnikov"", ""affiliation"": [""Stony Brook University""]}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226586748.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055404041425"", ""10.1086/681591"", ""10.1007/s11109-013-9238-0"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00290.x"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090914"", ""10.1080/08913811.2012.711022"", ""10.1086/699912"", ""10.1007/s11109-009-9092-2"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000500"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00601.x"", ""10.2307/3088404"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199969807.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000327"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1564.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12482"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1017/S1930297500005271"", ""10.1111/pops.12036"", ""10.1016/0022-1031(89)90023-1"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199772759.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12164"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511805813.009"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1177/1065912917729037"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.081306.070308"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1007/s11109-012-9213-1"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.737412"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00058"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.00161"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00772.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9075-8"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.1086/680078"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Trajectories of institutional change are typically explained using one of two perspectives on institutional contention. First, the Varieties of Capitalism-approach highlights positive efficiency effects from coordination between companies on skill formation. Second, a historical institutionalist approach focuses on positive political feedback effects from the governance of VET institutions. We propose adding a third dimension of institutional contention related to what role VET should play in fostering greater socio-economic equality. Employing this three-dimensional framework enables a more fine-grained analysis of gradual forms of institutional change and greater appreciation of the ways in which political struggles over the configuration of the three dimensions drive institutional reform. The argument is supported by analyzing the trajectory of institutional change in the Danish VET system in the post-war period.","[{""name"": ""Martin B Carstensen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Organization, Copenhagen Business School, Copenhagen, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Christian Lyhne Ibsen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Human Resources and Labor Relations, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"", ""Employment Relations Research Centre (FAOS), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen K, Denmark""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511730108"", ""10.1177/0958928715588702"", ""10.1177/0958928713511283"", ""10.1353/wp.2003.0009"", ""10.1093/esr/jci008"", ""10.1353/sof.2010.0076"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1zkjzqg.15"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu005"", ""10.1515/9780691216348"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199286652.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414006295927"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02073.x"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu002"", ""10.1093/0199247757.003.0004"", ""10.1093/oxrep/4.3.21"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316273104.008"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ser/mwn020"", ""10.1080/09692290.2010.526469"", ""10.1017/S0043887117000077"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400079"", ""10.1177/0010414007313117"", ""10.1080/13636820.2011.560393"", ""10.1111/j.1465-3435.2009.01414.x"", ""10.1177/2158244015574962"", ""10.1093/esr/jcn026"", ""10.1515/9781400841080"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu014"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174701.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790997"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107282001"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx007""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muz004,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,The Tacit Dimension of Public Sector Attraction in Multi-Incentive Settings,"Abstract The public sector provides a broad range of incentives to apply for jobs, but these incentives have rarely been studied in concert. The present study disentangles how job candidates form intentions to apply for a public sector job in multi-incentive settings and how this process depends on public service motivation (PSM). Using a speeded categorization task in an experimental vignette methodology with 340 current job seekers in the United Kingdom, we focus on perceptions that potential applicants have, or do not have, of a range of employment attributes (i.e., extrinsic, intrinsic, and prosocial) when they screen job advertisements. Results of multilevel analyses suggest that perceptions of intrinsic and extrinsic attributes are similarly strong predictors of the intent to apply for public sector jobs, whereas perceptions of prosocial employment attributes do not yield such an overall effect. However, PSM moderates the relationship between perceptions of prosocial attributes and application intentions, but only among nonstudents. Theoretical implications for the alignment of PSM with extrinsic rewards are discussed. Findings are also important for human resource managers in the public sector who want to adjust their recruitment strategies to specific target groups.","[{""name"": ""Julia Asseburg"", ""affiliation"": [""Universität Hamburg""]}, {""name"": ""Judith Hattke"", ""affiliation"": [""Helmut Schmidt University""]}, {""name"": ""David Hensel"", ""affiliation"": [""Helmut Schmidt University""]}, {""name"": ""Fabian Homberg"", ""affiliation"": [""LUISS Guido Carli""]}, {""name"": ""Rick Vogel"", ""affiliation"": [""Universität Hamburg""]}]","[""10.1177/1094428114547952"", ""10.1177/0734371X18778334"", ""10.1108/IJPSM-08-2017-0217"", ""10.1111/padm.12403"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-6729"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2015.10.011"", ""10.1002/hrm.21571"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143757"", ""10.1177/0091026016676093"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195388275.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0002716217696041"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2011.08.004"", ""10.1080/15309576.2018.1431135"", ""10.1080/14719037.2014.895032"", ""10.1177/0275074016653469"", ""10.1111/puar.12796"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq085"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.1.180"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024363"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt008"", ""10.1108/00483481211200042"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.1111/puar.12183"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1013"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6435.2010.00468.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq073"", ""10.1111/1467-9442.00045"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.93.1.48"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.972484"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw056"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.94.3.319"", ""10.1111/puar.12423"", ""10.1108/IJM-05-2016-0120"", ""10.1017/9781316676912"", ""10.1080/01900692.2012.757621"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.5.837"", ""10.3917/gmp.051.0007"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus027"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus039"", ""10.1007/s10869-013-9311-z"", ""10.1177/0734371X13511974"", ""10.1111/0033-3352.00193"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2003.tb00144.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux032"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.996627"", ""10.1108/IJM-12-2014-0268"", ""10.1177/0275074012461297"", ""10.1287/orsc.11.5.538.15204"", ""10.1080/10967494.2013.825484"", ""10.1080/23276665.2014.892272"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02196.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12430"", ""10.2307/976618"", ""10.1108/IJM-12-2014-0248"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2006.12.008"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2389.2006.00330.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12505"", ""10.1177/0734371X11408703"", ""10.5465/amr.1990.4308158"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.1991.tb02402.x"", ""10.1080/01900692.2018.1485044"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0198094"", ""10.1177/0734371X12453053"", ""10.1108/IJM-12-2014-0249"", ""10.1037/a0015167"", ""10.1177/0899764008314808"", ""10.1177/0149206309352246"", ""10.1177/0020852314563899"", ""10.1080/10967494.2015.1047544"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1541830"", ""10.1080/10967491003752012"", ""10.1080/10967494.2015.1088493""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muab021,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,The Professional Agency Narrative-Conceptualizing the Role of Professional Knowledge in Frontline Work,"Abstract The street-level bureaucracy literature teaches us that frontline workers draw on both policy logics and social, cultural, and personal logics in their work. This has been conceptualized as the state agency narrative and citizen agency narrative, and it is both well documented and well theorized. However, the literature on street-level bureaucracy and frontline work is remarkably silent on how to understand the role of professional knowledge in frontline work. In this article, we seek to fill this gap by theorizing and empirically demonstrating how frontline work is characterized by what we call a professional agency narrative centering on problem solving and the use of knowledge on “what works.” We do so through in-depth qualitative analyses of data from two empirical studies on frontline work in schools. The first is an interview study consisting of 42 semi-structured interviews with Danish preschool and school teachers on the topic of prevention of social and health risks. The second study is an ethnographic study consisting of more than 500 h of observation, two focus groups with teachers and seven semi-structured interviews with teachers on the topic of health risk prevention in Danish schools. Based on the analysis of this rich qualitative data, we develop the concept of the professional agency narrative and discuss how this concept can contribute to the broader literatures on street-level work and the management of street-level work.","[{""name"": ""Mathilde Cecchini"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University""]}, {""name"": ""Gitte Sommer Harrits"", ""affiliation"": [""VIA University College""]}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226189666.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226206868.001.0001"", ""10.1086/231294"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226114040.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bcq074"", ""10.4324/9781315602325"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t89bw0.8"", ""10.7577/pp.1522"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.841980"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy080"", ""10.3102/0013189X017002013"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum030"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024272"", ""10.1177/0095399717700224"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2006.00616.x"", ""10.9783/9780812209846"", ""10.1111/padm.12374"", ""10.1177/0095399718761651"", ""10.1177/0095399712451895"", ""10.1086/229967"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226180458.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu056"", ""10.1177/0275074016682313"", ""10.4159/9780674981423""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

It analyzes data from the American National Election Study to demonstrate that white women are the only group of female voters who support Republican Party candidates for president. They have done so by a majority in all but 2 of the last 18 elections. The relevance of race for partisan choice among women voters is estimated with data collected in 2008, 2012, and 2016, and the significance of being white is identified after accounting for political party identification and other predictors.","[{""name"": ""Jane Junn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Natalie Masuoka"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1537592707070065"", ""10.1017/S1743923X14000567"", ""10.2307/2110733"", ""10.1080/21565503.2017.1304224"", ""10.1080/07393148.2017.1378296"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139031165"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235476.003.0022"", ""10.1017/rep.2017.34"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316492673"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199352432.001.0001"", ""10.1017/rep.2017.35"", ""10.1177/1065912916675738"", ""10.1093/0198293488.003.0009"", ""10.2307/2111526"", ""10.1353/book5076"", ""10.2307/2131388"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226057330.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12270"", ""10.1017/rep.2017.39"", ""10.4324/9780203744437"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00098"", ""10.1525/9780520938496"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226353159.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001315"", ""10.1017/S1743923X11000341"", ""10.1017/S0007123497000240""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1093/ips/olab005,INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,"The Everyday Life of Security: Capturing Space, Practice, and Affect","AbstractSecurity shapes everyday life, but despite a growing literature on everyday security there is no consensus on the meaning of the “everyday.” At the same time, the research methods that dominate the field are designed to study elites and high politics. This paper does two things. First, it brings together and synthesizes the existing literature on everyday security to argue that we should think about the everyday life of security as constituted across three dimensions: space, practice, and affect. Thus, the paper adds conceptual clarity, demonstrating that the everyday life of security is multifaceted and exists in mundane spaces, routine practices, and affective/lived experiences. Second, it works through the methodological implications of a three-dimensional understanding of everyday security. In order to capture all three dimensions and the ways in which they interact, we need to explore different methods. The paper offers one such method, exploring the everyday life of security in contemporary China through a participatory photography project with six ordinary citizens in Beijing. The central contribution of the paper is capturing—conceptually and methodologically—all three dimensions, in order to develop our understanding of the everyday life of security.","[{""name"": ""Jonna Nyman"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Sheffield, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/ips.12067"", ""10.1068/d21312"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.04.028"", ""10.1177/1354066113512702"", ""10.1093/ips/olx024"", ""10.1177/0010836718807501"", ""10.1111/area.12368"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00655.x"", ""10.1177/0967010610382687"", ""10.4324/9780203758328"", ""10.1080/0966369X.2015.1090406"", ""10.1177/0967010617744977"", ""10.1177/2347797013518403"", ""10.1177/03043754020270S105"", ""10.4324/9781315856506-1"", ""10.4324/9781315387581-11"", ""10.1017/eis.2019.14"", ""10.1177/0967010605057015"", ""10.1080/19392206.2013.853579"", ""10.1177/0305829815578767"", ""10.1177/0967010619889471"", ""10.1525/aa.1957.59.5.02a00100"", ""10.1177/0967010614533243"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2011.00145_3.x"", ""10.1093/bjc/azv121"", ""10.1177/0010836716653159"", ""10.1080/17539153.2016.1237011"", ""10.1093/ips/olv006"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816675890.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0305829810374793"", ""10.4324/9781315712970"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2011.00145_2.x"", ""10.1177/0967010618762595"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.04.009"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2011.00145_6.x"", ""10.1177/0010836718815520"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139150897"", ""10.1093/ips/olx020"", ""10.2307/j.ctvkjb2b1"", ""10.1080/14725860220137345"", ""10.1080/0966369x.2016.1164123"", ""10.1080/13533311003589165"", ""10.1177/0967010611418713"", ""10.1093/ips/olx018"", ""10.1093/isr/viy017"", ""10.1177/0047117812460880"", ""10.1177/0967010611430435"", ""10.1068/d9910"", ""10.1177/0967010618762271"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2018.12.001"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4762.2012.01115.x"", ""10.1080/21647259.2016.1277009"", ""10.1177/0967010614550899"", ""10.1177/03058298020310031201"", ""10.1017/S0260210516000140"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198820444.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780429398186-16"", ""10.9783/9780812205688"", ""10.1080/09557571.2013.837429"", ""10.1080/03098260601082230"", ""10.1177/0967010612463490"", ""10.1080/0950238042000201455"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199273959.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0263395716653423"", ""10.1080/21624887.2017.1320882"", ""10.4324/9780203100943"", ""10.1080/23337486.2015.1011439"", ""10.1177/0967010619834111"", ""10.4324/9781315387581-10"", ""10.5040/9781350221123"", ""10.1177/0967010615604101"", ""10.1080/08949468.2013.735187"", ""10.4324/9781315387581"", ""10.1080/10670564.2015.1075717""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In this article, we describe the economic characteristics that scholars have recently studied and the common threads that have emerged in modern work on this topic. This growing literature is largely united by a shared concern about the unequal economic makeup of institutions: Recent studies generally agree that politicians tend to be vastly better off than citizens on every economic measure and that politicians from different economic backgrounds tend to think and behave differently in office. However, the literature is far from a consensus regarding why politicians are so economically advantaged. Going forward, there are numerous opportunities for future work to address this gap; to extend the literature to new countries, institutions, and time periods; and to better understand how economic backgrounds intersect with race, gender, and other social characteristics.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Carnes"", ""affiliation"": [""Sanford School of Public Policy, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA;""]}, {""name"": ""Noam Lupu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA;""]}]","[""10.1146/annurev.polisci.5.112801.080943"", ""10.1177/1532673X20943559"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139506762"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12482"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2018.10.005"", ""10.1177/0010414017720702"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000642"", ""10.1111/lsq.12286"", ""10.1177/1065912919829583"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2016.09.010"", ""10.1017/S153759272000208X"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000970"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2011.02448.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198297932.001.0001"", ""10.1111/lsq.12265"", ""10.1080/21565503.2020.1854792"", ""10.1017/S0043887116000290"", ""10.1515/9781400866939"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12048"", ""10.1111/j.1939-9162.2011.00033.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226087283.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S000305541600054X"", ""10.1111/ajps.12112"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000551"", ""10.1086/683027"", ""10.1017/9781009267694.012"", ""10.1561/113.00000035"", ""10.1080/07907184.2015.1021796"", ""10.1093/qje/qjx016"", ""10.1093/pa/gss085"", ""10.2307/1953255"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1801804"", ""10.1080/00344893.2019.1581077"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.401"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198755753.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00147.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12502"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2018.09.004"", ""10.1080/00344893.2012.653238"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7s1jn"", ""10.1177/1532673X12472363"", ""10.1111/lsq.12253"", ""10.1177/106591297102400307"", ""10.1177/1065912915572902"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051418-051214"", ""10.1111/spsr.12166"", ""10.1177/0032321720938992"", ""10.1177/1532440019885378"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1995.tb00630.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000272"", ""10.1017/gov.2020.27"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.26"", ""10.2307/2096428"", ""10.1111/pops.12697"", ""10.1017/S1468109919000112"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2007.11.006"", ""10.1080/21565503.2019.1636833"", ""10.1177/1532440018784980"", ""10.2307/2110380"", ""10.1086/715067"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050718-032801"", ""10.1177/0019793915610559"", ""10.1017/gov.2016.7"", ""10.1093/ser/mwac040"", ""10.1086/714930"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12440"", ""10.1177/1532440019826065"", ""10.1177/1065912920983917"", ""10.1080/09644008.2021.1874935"", ""10.2307/3709108"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.1093/ej/ueac035"", ""10.1017/lap.2018.54"", ""10.1177/01925121211040025"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006657"", ""10.1177/0010414018784065"", ""10.1080/13572334.2020.1809806"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.102066"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102413"", ""10.2307/2946692"", ""10.1111/spsr.12163"", ""10.1086/267456"", ""10.1007/s11109-020-09651-0"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2014.08.006"", ""10.1093/ser/mwz018"", ""10.1177/001041406900100402"", ""10.1080/02722011.2020.1771527"", ""10.1177/23780231211009992"", ""10.1177/001979391306600207"", ""10.1086/709297"", ""10.3386/w26156"", ""10.2307/421340"", ""10.1080/09584935.2020.1765984"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.102093"", ""10.1080/01436597.2021.1882297"", ""10.1080/0023656X.2012.679398"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12511""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muz024,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Socioeconomic Representation: Expanding the Theory of Representative Bureaucracy,"AbstractTo date, representative bureaucracy scholarship has primarily focused on the potential for increased racial/ethnic and gender representation in the public-sector workforce to improve outcomes for minority and female clients. However, the potential for socioeconomic representation to benefit those from a lower socioeconomic background has not been thoroughly explored. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study—Kindergarten Cohort 2011 and a student fixed-effects approach, I begin to fill this gap in the literature by investigating whether socioeconomic representation—above and beyond and intersecting with racial and ethnic representation—affects teachers' perceptions of their relationships with students. Heterogeneity by an organizational context likely to affect the saliency of SES is also explored. Overall results show no evidence that SES match between teachers and students influences teachers' rating of relationship quality with students. For low-SES black students, racial representation persists as an important factor in better teacher–student relationships, even controlling for socioeconomic representation. However, for low-SES white students in contexts where SES is likely to be particularly salient, socioeconomic representation has a significant positive effect on teacher–student relationship quality. Results exploring the interaction of racial and socioeconomic representation are also presented. Finally, theoretical and practical implications, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Katie Vinopal"", ""affiliation"": [""John Glenn College of Public Affairs, The Ohio State University""]}]","[""10.1177/00485902037003005"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.841981"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut001"", ""10.3200/JOER.101.4.243-246"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy038"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.01985.x"", ""10.1016/S0022-4405(96)00029-5"", ""10.1111/j.1939-0025.1982.tb01456.x"", ""10.1177/0734371X17697118"", ""10.1017/S0047279415000227"", ""10.1177/0091026013484570"", ""10.1177/000312240907400502"", ""10.1162/003465304323023750"", ""10.1257/000282805774670446"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2008.09.002"", ""10.1257/aer.104.8.2567"", ""10.1177/0275074016660614"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus030"", ""10.1080/10409289.2016.1102019"", ""10.3102/0013189X15580102"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.02040.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12952"", ""10.1080/1350293X.2012.704759"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2007.05.002"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9507.2006.00358.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000321"", ""10.1177/0095399712459724"", ""10.1525/9780520949904"", ""10.2307/2673185"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup030"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.79.3.280"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.58.5.364"", ""10.1207/s15566935eed1701_7"", ""10.3998/mpub.11924"", ""10.1086/426800"", ""10.2307/1959084"", ""10.2307/2647552"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvy004"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a003511"", ""10.2307/1963371"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00653.x"", ""10.2307/974854"", ""10.1177/027507409202200301"", ""10.1016/j.ehb.2009.04.004"", ""10.1037/a0039836"", ""10.1177/0095399703254947"", ""10.1162/EDFP_a_00136"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2007.04.002"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy018"", ""10.1037/10314-000"", ""10.1177/0095399707303129"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu006"", ""10.1111/puar.12401"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy023"", ""10.17763/haer.70.3.1k0624l6102u2725"", ""10.1177/0275074011400404"", ""10.1177/0095399709349695"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00620.x"", ""10.17105/SPR-2017-0035.V46-3"", ""10.1521/scpq.16.2.125.18698"", ""10.1300/J134v03n03_04"", ""10.1177/027507409702700103"", ""10.1177/0275074011420997"", ""10.1111/1540-6210.00333"", ""10.1093/jopart/mun006"", ""10.1002/cd.23219925703"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2017.08.004"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux036"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226874937.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00905.x"", ""10.1177/0095399708326332""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Public Administration', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1111/twec.13110,WORLD ECONOMY,0302 Political Science; 0201 Theoretical Economics; 0202 Applied Economics; 1202 Business Administration,Sending money home: Transaction cost and remittances to developing countries,"AbstractReducing the cost of remitting is one of the targets within the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 10). A key factor that causes migrants to use informal channels when sending money back home is the high cost of transferring funds through formal channels. This study examines whether and to what extent the reduction in the cost of sending remittances increases the flow of remittances to developing countries, and whether larger amounts are remitted when the cost per transaction decreases (the so‐called scale effect). It uses bilateral data on remittance flows and exploits a novel dataset covering transaction costs for 30 sending and 75 receiving countries for the period 2011–2017. A gravity model of remittance flows is estimated using panel data and instrumental variable techniques to address endogeneity issues. We find that transaction cost is a significant predictor of the volume of formal remittances. A 1% decrease in the cost of remitting USD 200 leads to about a 1.6% increase in remittances. This association is robust to the different models and techniques employed. The findings suggest that policies designed to increase formal remittances need to focus on decreasing the cost of remitting through formal channels.","[{""name"": ""Junaid Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": [""Pakistan Institute of Development Economics Islamabad Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Mazhar Mughal"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Finance Pau Business School Pau France""]}, {""name"": ""Inmaculada Martínez‐Zarzoso"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Economics Georg‐August University of Göttingen Göttingen Germany"", ""Department of Economics University Jaume I Castellón Spain""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jinteco.2009.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2007.11.007"", ""10.1111/1467-8268.12224"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.02.004"", ""10.1111/twec.12681"", ""10.1177/1536867X0300300101"", ""10.1177/1536867X0800700402"", ""10.1093/wber/lhr017"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2008.02135.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.2007.01022.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8586.2011.00398.x"", ""10.1016/j.jimonfin.2017.10.002"", ""10.1086/209979"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grn022"", ""10.1086/261470"", ""10.1016/S0304-3878(97)00056-4"", ""10.3917/ecoi.121.0081"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(99)00067-4"", ""10.1111/imig.12061"", ""10.1007/BF00173621"", ""10.1111/ecno.12146"", ""10.1007/s11079-010-9184-y"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2007.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2008.10.005"", ""10.1080/09603100410001673630"", ""10.1016/S0304-3878(98)00122-9"", ""10.1086/450731"", ""10.1016/j.econmod.2016.09.011"", ""10.2307/2118406"", ""10.1353/jda.2016.0008"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2007.06.019"", ""10.1086/261341"", ""10.2202/1935-1690.1568"", ""10.1111/twec.12519"", ""10.1007/s00148-009-0251-x"", ""10.1080/00343404.2015.1133904"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-8475-6"", ""10.1080/13504851003614146"", ""10.1080/10242694.2014.921359"", ""10.2307/1913646"", ""10.1093/jae/ejl035"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2004.05.002"", ""10.1016/S1574-0714(06)02017-3"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-7072-8"", ""10.54155/jbs.26.1.73-98"", ""10.1080/00220388.2012.663904"", ""10.1093/jae/ejq039"", ""10.1086/451670"", ""10.1080/09638190500525779"", ""10.1257/jep.25.3.129""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

As a result, it is not clear how often ruling parties are actually strong and capable of carrying out important functions. This article demonstrates that strong ruling parties are much rarer than is typically assumed. Using a global sample of dictatorships from 1946–2008, the author shows that most ruling parties are unable to survive the death or departure of the founding leader. This is true even of many ruling parties that have been coded as leading single-party regimes. While strong parties may be key to durable authoritarianism, relatively few parties are truly strong.","[{""name"": ""Anne Meng"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13510340600579359"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000115"", ""10.1177/0022343308100719"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0043"", ""10.1017/S0022050700009451"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976469"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.091106.121756"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2011.04.002"", ""10.1093/wber/lhm019"", ""10.2307/2010462"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510090"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176040"", ""10.3998/mpub.11910"", ""10.1525/9780520313071"", ""10.1177/0022002715591215"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000250"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511781353"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760891"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000021"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511509803"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.115"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802348"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00315.x"", ""10.2307/4150161"", ""10.1177/0010414007305817"", ""10.1177/0010414016655538"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139052276.016"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510274"", ""10.1177/1354068802008001001"", ""10.1017/S1537592714000851"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.031908.220529"", ""10.1017/9781316761649"", ""10.2307/1956432"", ""10.1017/9781316536148"", ""10.1177/0010414007313124"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000029"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001952"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000149"", ""10.1177/0022343310397436"", ""10.1177/1354068898004001004"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000534""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In fact, legislators are more likely to support the preferences of protesters than non-protesters. Legislators are also more likely to support the preferences of racial and ethnic minority, low-income and grassroots protesting groups than they are to represent better-resourced protesters. This argument emerges from a formal theory and is empirically tested using legislative roll-call vote data from the 102nd through the 104th US Congresses and data on civil rights, minority issues and civil liberties issue area protests reported in theNew York Times. This counterintuitive result enhances understanding of inequalities in representation. It demonstrates that under certain conditions, political representation favors disadvantaged populations.","[{""name"": ""LaGina Gause"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1953909"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00360.x"", ""10.1111/j.1939-9162.2011.00033.x"", ""10.1515/9780691221472"", ""10.1017/S0003055403000868"", ""10.2307/1914093"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000571"", ""10.1515/9780691225661"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00448.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226308692.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001204"", ""10.1086/210399"", ""10.2307/2095417"", ""10.1177/1065912911427450"", ""10.2307/2129644"", ""10.2307/2669343"", ""10.1017/S153759271200360X"", ""10.1515/9780691221397"", ""10.3998/mpub.14985"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00605.x"", ""10.7910/DVN/GSWXOL"", ""10.2307/2939043"", ""10.1177/1532673X10388140"", ""10.1177/1065912909338465"", ""10.1177/0003122417690325"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791123"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262015103.001.0001"", ""10.2307/3088914"", ""10.1515/9781400834679"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1pnc1k7"", ""10.2307/2110458"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00515.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-005-3242-y"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000539"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226039466.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12384"", ""10.1515/9781400848621"", ""10.1017/S1537592710001210"", ""10.1177/0003122410395370""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

To assess the results of this emerging body of research, we conduct the first meta-analysis of repeated-wave panel data studies on the relationship between digital media use and political participation. The findings, based on 38 survey-based, repeated-wave panel studies (279 coefficients) bring new evidence to bear on two questions central to this literature. First, the findings provide new insight into the classic mobilization versus reinforcement debate: contrary to common assumption, the findings support a reinforcement effect, whereby those who are already politically active are motivated to use digital media. Second, the results indicate that the relationship between digital media use and political participation is durable, as studies with a longer time lag were more likely to yield positive and significant effects. Taken together, this evidence in support of a durable reinforcement effect implies the potential for digital media use to contribute to increased inequality in political participation over time. In the concluding discussion, we outline directions for further theoretical inquiry and empirical research that leverage the value of repeated-wave panel studies to make causal inferences.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Oser"", ""affiliation"": [""Politics and Government Department at Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Shelley Boulianne"", ""affiliation"": [""MacEwan University, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada""]}]","[""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.03.005"", ""10.1080/01292986.2018.1499121"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.01333.x"", ""10.1177/1077699017706928"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2015.1022568"", ""10.1086/376947"", ""10.1080/19331681.2012.701109"", ""10.1177/1461444815624181"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy062"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609343"", ""10.1177/1065912912436695"", ""10.1017/S1537592710001210"", ""10.1177/1461444815616221"", ""10.1080/15213269.2014.897236"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.12.006"", ""10.1177/1354068807085891"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00364.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

In this review article, the authors welcome this development while offering a framework for evaluating collective progress, a series of related critiques, and a set of suggestions for future research. The article details how the books under review represent an important step toward consensus on the importance of reputation in world politics, elucidating scope conditions for when reputational inferences are likely to be most salient. The authors argue that despite the significant accomplishments of recent studies, the scholarly record remains thin on the psychology of the perceiver and is instead focused on situational factors at the expense of dispositional variables and is rather myopically oriented toward reputation for resolve to the exclusion of other important types. Despite its contributions, the new literature still falls short of a full explanation for how actors draw inferences about reputation.

We are interested in the appeal of political storytelling. In applying an approach of layered interpretation, we study images and slogans to consider the more complex underlying narratives in their political and cultural context. Our exploratory case studies draw on material from right-wing populist parties, namely election campaign posters from Germany and the UK as material for the analysis. We find that narratives operate with a ‘fantasmatic logic’, which adds fantasy to politics, to depoliticise and camouflage their radical intent and gain approval by making consent desirable. We identify two exemplary narratives (honest men under threat; proud mothers) that entrench traditional gender roles in accordance with patriarchy and nationalism. Theoretically, our approach contributes to debates in IR on cultural underpinnings in international politics and the construction of collective identities through shared/divided narratives. Visual narrative analysis provides a promising methodological tool for analysing visual representations in their productive relationship with text. This perspective foregrounds the power of political storytelling through fantasmatic appeal and fosters a better understanding of the global rise of populism.","[{""name"": ""Katja Freistein"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Gadinger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0305829813516527"", ""10.1080/19460171.2015.1131618"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2006.11.005"", ""10.1515/9783110349689"", ""10.4324/9781315731360"", ""10.4135/9781446270073"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1567461"", ""10.1093/ips/olw021"", ""10.1093/ips/olx008"", ""10.1177/1354066111433896"", ""10.1177/1354066117711743"", ""10.4324/9781315856506"", ""10.1177/1368431006063345"", ""10.1017/S0260210508007821"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00826.x"", ""10.1177/1470412908091934"", ""10.1017/S0260210513000375"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1302491"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316218969"", ""10.1177/1354066110388593"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1177/0192512106064474"", ""10.1177/1354066117743561"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.315"", ""10.1007/BF00992905"", ""10.1093/ips/olw017"", ""10.1017/S0260210514000199"", ""10.1017/S0260210509990192"", ""10.1177/03058298010300031001"", ""10.4324/9780203934753"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jird.1800105"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226245904.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199324460.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-32498-2"", ""10.1177/0305829815583084"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-73350-0"", ""10.1080/10361146.2013.840769"", ""10.1075/bct.93.01wod"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1093/ips/olx025"", ""10.1207/s15327868ms0201_5"", ""10.1086/448619"", ""10.4135/9781849209502"", ""10.1093/ips/olx029""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/psj.12406,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Policy Innovation Adoption Across the Diffusion Life Course(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave,"This study develops and tests a theory of the diffusion life course using a dataset of 566 policies adopted between 1960 and 2016. Previous small‐N studies found differences between leaders and laggards, but broader innovation theory points to five stages of adoption: innovation, early adoption, early majority, late majority, and laggard. This study demonstrates that predictors of policy adoption change throughout the diffusion life course. Neighbor adoptions matter early in the life course but are supplanted by the consistent effect of ideological learning across all stages. The results confirm that less professionalized states tend to adopt later. Finally, state wealth and population size are increasingly important as policies spread. These results have implications for our understanding of when and why states adopt policy innovations. They also illustrate the substantial opportunity for political science and public policy researchers to draw from broader theories.","[{""name"": ""Daniel J.

Yet, despite their pivotal position within the party, we know only little about their preferences for potential candidates and how their own backgrounds shape these preferences. This paper presents results from a conjoint experiment carried out with party delegates chosen to select the candidates for five German parties in the run-up to three state elections. Theoretical expectations derived from the principle-agent framework on delegates’ preferences in candidates are evaluated. Analyses show that delegates prefer attributes indicative of quality and socio-demographic similarity in candidates. Additionally, I show that these preferences for candidates differ between inexperienced and experienced delegates, the latter showing a stronger preference for valence attributes in candidates. These findings contribute to our understanding of the role of personal attributes of selectors for candidate selection and hold crucial implications for the composition of legislatures and long-term effects on public policy.","[{""name"": ""Jochen Rehmert"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/lsq.12259"", ""10.1257/aer.20160080"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198297932.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123400003136"", ""10.3162/036298007X201994"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000309"", ""10.1017/psrm.2016.35"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000551"", ""10.1177/1065912909349631"", ""10.1177/1354068808093391"", ""10.2307/2110764"", ""10.1086/704698"", ""10.1177/0010414013489379"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.24"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2015.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.11.002"", ""10.1111/ajps.12138"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1073/pnas.1416587112"", ""10.1177/0265407518790411"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199572540.001.0001"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.26"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.30"", ""10.1093/019829784X.003.0002"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1973.tb01423.x"", ""10.1300/J014v19n02_03"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9464-6"", ""10.1525/9780520340503"", ""10.1177/1354068808093405"", ""10.1177/0010414019897700"", ""10.1177/0192512113507732"", ""10.1177/1532673X14555177"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00133.x"", ""10.1177/1354068814549347"", ""10.1177/0003122414531776"", ""10.1080/00344893.2014.951222"", ""10.1177/1354068816663040""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Safety Research', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1017/S0007123419000395,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,"Negativity Bias: The Impact of Framing of Immigration on Welfare State Support in Germany, Sweden and the UK","AbstractHow does the framing of immigration influence support for the welfare state? Drawing on research from psychology, specifically the notion of negativity bias and the sequencing of negative and positive information, this article argues that negative immigration frames undermine welfare support, while positive frames have little or no effect. Individuals take less notice of positive frames, and the effect of such frames is further undermined by the previous exposure to negative frames, which tend to stick longer in people's minds. The findings, based on survey experiments on over 9,000 individuals in Germany, Sweden and the UK, show that negative framing of immigration has a strong and pervasive effect on support for welfare. The article also finds some evidence that this effect is further amplified for people who hold anti-immigrant and anti-welfare attitudes or feel economically insecure. The effect of positive framing is considerably weaker and does not strengthen welfare support in any of the three countries.","[{""name"": ""Sabina Avdagic"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lee Savage"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3386/w24733"", ""10.1093/esr/jcp017"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00413.x"", ""10.1086/665800"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000092"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2"", ""10.1177/0958928712440198"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1344040"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.75.4.887"", ""10.1057/cep.2008.3"", ""10.1177/0003122416633140"", ""10.1515/9780691188386-007"", ""10.1017/S0007123407000257"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12158"", ""10.1111/ajps.12138"", ""10.1023/A:1024834831093"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070142"", ""10.2307/2669333"", ""10.1017/S000712341700031X"", ""10.1037/xge0000311"", ""10.1177/1536867X1701700313"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054"", ""10.1177/0958928709104737"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000603"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(86)90048-8"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00276.x"", ""10.2307/2952075"", ""10.1093/0199267669.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0003122413513022"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420220502"", ""10.1037/a0032310"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000155"", ""10.1177/1465116515607371"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2006.10.018"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000395"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.03.001"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.5.4.323"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12194"", ""10.1111/ajps.12012"", ""10.2307/2669279"", ""10.1007/s11205-008-9342-4"", ""10.1177/0267323116680132"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00622.x"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070554"", ""10.1017/rep.2016.25"", ""10.1177/1465116517734064"", ""10.2307/1914185""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This is especially the case for wicked problems like nonpoint source water pollution where there are compelling questions regarding how best to design policies, allocate funds, and build administrative capacity to meet water quality standards. We present an agent-based model (ABM) of water governance for the Lake Champlain Basin to simulate the impacts of alternative collaborative governance arrangements on the development of suites of water quality projects. The ABM is connected or coupled with land use and phosphorus load accumulation models that are informed by existing hydrologic models, project datasets, and state-set load reduction targets. We find that regionally arranged collaborative governance in water quality project planning and implementation can lead to better water quality outcomes, thereby affirming one of the central premises of collaborative governance regime theory. We also find that externally mandated collaboration, as opposed to voluntary, self-initiated collaboration, can lead to better water quality outcomes, adding to our understanding of which type of collaborative governance arrangement is best suited to the specific contexts of this case. Further, without adequate administrative capacity in the form of human resources located in central network actors to manage project funds, “administrative bottlenecks” may form and money can go unspent. This research demonstrates the efficacy of using simulations of alternative institutional design for theory testing and tuning, and policy prototyping.","[{""name"": ""Patrick Bitterman"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Nebraska–Lincoln"", ""University of Vermont""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher J Koliba"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vermont""]}]","[""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux030"", ""10.1002/hyp.5611"", ""10.5751/ES-09205-220206"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.05.009"", ""10.1111/puar.12532"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-65993-0_2"", ""10.1111/psj.12146"", ""10.1002/ncr.69"", ""10.5751/ES-03404-150335"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.12.004"", ""10.1111/puar.12432"", ""10.3389/fvets.2019.00196"", ""10.1006/jema.1999.0272"", ""10.1068/b38001"", ""10.1007/s00267-014-0334-7"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.03.005"", ""10.1579/0044-7447-31.5.437"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.02.004"", ""10.13031/2013.23637"", ""10.1093/publius/pji032"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2005.07.009"", ""10.1126/science.1116681"", ""10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.08.019"", ""10.1111/psj.12224"", ""10.1177/0095399705276111"", ""10.1007/s10533-017-0327-8"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.04.018"", ""10.1177/0002764299042010004"", ""10.1007/s10997-012-9234-5"", ""10.1177/0894439307299650"", ""10.1007/s11269-016-1276-z"", ""10.4324/9781315268620"", ""10.7564/14-CGN12"", ""10.4324/9781315544939-11"", ""10.1023/B:OLIC.0000048532.94150.07"", ""10.4324/9781936331185"", ""10.1525/aa.1993.95.1.02a00050"", ""10.1068/b32088"", ""10.5751/ES-06880-190423"", ""10.1177/0037549705058073"", ""10.1111/tgis.12012"", ""10.18564/jasss.3002"", ""10.1080/00343400601120213"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5885.2009.00667.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226595221.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807763"", ""10.5751/ES-02037-120205"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2010.08.006"", ""10.1111/1467-8306.9302004"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut039"", ""10.1177/0095399706297212"", ""10.1177/0275074009359024"", ""10.7564/15-CGN25"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.08.008"", ""10.5751/ES-02069-120204"", ""10.1002/pam.21836"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux009"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy053"", ""10.1016/j.envsoft.2008.07.005"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01791.x"", ""10.5751/ES-05497-180232"", ""10.18564/jasss.3991"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/11/11/114026"", ""10.1007/s00146-013-0527-2""]","['Environmental Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

We provide an update to the socialization literature by showing that adolescents today are just as polarized as adults. We compare our findings to a landmark 1980 socialization study and show that distrust in the opposing party has risen sharply among adolescents. We go on to show that the onset of polarization in childhood is predicted by parental influence; adolescents who share their parents’ identity and whose parents are more polarized are apt to voice polarized views.,"[{""name"": ""MATTHEW TYLER"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SHANTO IYENGAR"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7910/DVN/T2VX6K"", ""10.1515/9781400854264"", ""10.1017/9781316161579.005"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191"", ""10.2307/1952644"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090719"", ""10.2307/1953332"", ""10.2307/2110723"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.44.2.233"", ""10.1111/j.1741-5705.2002.tb00001.x"", ""10.2307/1959943"", ""10.24433/Co.4103928.V1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00798.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1177/0003122415606101"", ""10.2307/2952258"", ""10.1111/mono.12410"", ""10.1126/science.aaa1160"", ""10.1093/poq/nfaa007"", ""10.1086/698929"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz003"", ""10.1111/ajps.12535"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195137422.003.0002"", ""10.7910/DVN/TMJWIA""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000194,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Launching Revolution: Social Media and the Egyptian Uprising's First Movers,"AbstractDrawing on evidence from the 2011 Egyptian uprising, this article demonstrates how the use of two social media platforms – Facebook and Twitter – contributed to a discrete mobilizational outcome: the staging of a successful first protest in a revolutionary cascade, referred to here as ‘first-mover mobilization’. Specifically, it argues that these two platforms facilitated the staging of a large, nationwide and seemingly leaderless protest on 25 January 2011, which signaled to hesitant but sympathetic Egyptians that a revolution might be in the making. It draws on qualitative and quantitative evidence, including interviews, social media data and surveys, to analyze three mechanisms that linked these platforms to the success of the January 25 protest: (1) protester recruitment, (2) protest planning and coordination, and (3) live updating about protest logistics. The article not only contributes to debates about the role of the Internet in the Arab Spring and other recent waves of mobilization, but also demonstrates how scholarship on the Internet in politics might move toward making more discrete, empirically grounded causal claims.","[{""name"": ""Killian Clarke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Korhan Kocak"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01629.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173834"", ""10.7312/lync15884-003"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9020.2008.00145.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123415000733"", ""10.1017/9781316882702"", ""10.17813/maiq.17.4.905210228n564037"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.737439"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199394982.001.0001"", ""10.1086/226707"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812125"", ""10.1177/0010414010376911"", ""10.1080/13691180600630773"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-030810-110815"", ""10.5040/9780755607839"", ""10.1177/0010414009331724"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663901.003"", ""10.17813/maiq.15.4.w03123213lh37042"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262015103.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2346.2012.01057.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000194"", ""10.5129/001041514812522770"", ""10.17813/maiq.16.4.m728m673p7340l23"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2012.670661"", ""10.5129/001041517820934267"", ""10.1257/jep.26.2.167"", ""10.1080/13629395.2012.694044"", ""10.1017/S1537592714003120"", ""10.1017/S1537592711000910"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000294"", ""10.1017/S1537592712002873"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000014"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12080"", ""10.2307/2117751"", ""10.3998/mpub.2556282"", ""10.4324/9780203644225"", ""10.5210/fm.v18i5.4366"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199936953.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.21"", ""10.18637/jss.v040.i13"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139858472"", ""10.1086/683187"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199735952.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8551.001.0001"", ""10.5129/001041515816075132""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communication']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

I argue that the GVC perspective too quickly dismisses the relevance of industrial policy in the East Asian development experience, particularly those in South Korea and Taiwan between roughly 1960 and 1990. By drawing on the industrialisation experiences of these two countries, my framework for industrial policy suggests that the GVC perspective's ideas for industrial policy would be strengthened by more clearly acknowledging the continued importance of three observations by the developmentalist perspective: (a) the need for governments in developing countries to bargain with foreign investors for the purpose of domestic industrialisation; (b) policy design should not only focus on increasing exports, but also focus on replacing some imports with domestic production; and (c) linking up to the value chains of transnational corporations based in high‐income countries can bring about some benefits, but ultimately, successful industrialisation necessitates a degree of competing with transnational corporations. State‐owned enterprises have historically played an important role in this respect.","[{""name"": ""Jostein Hauge"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Manufacturing University of Cambridge Cambridge UK""]}]","[""10.1257/aer.91.5.1369"", ""10.1007/s10842-011-0107-4"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283.005"", ""10.1093/0195139690.001.0001"", ""10.7312/kanb19476-011"", ""10.4337/9781781950562.00014"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1625803"", ""10.1080/02255189.1997.9669705"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-25833-8"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-6406"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.cje.a035227"", ""10.1177/0032329299027003002"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7466.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400862030.3"", ""10.1016/S0022-1996(98)00075-0"", ""10.1080/09692290.2012.756414"", ""10.4337/9781788113779.00022"", ""10.1080/01436597.2019.1629816"", ""10.4337/9781788976152.00007"", ""10.1080/09692290210150842"", ""10.4337/9781788113779.00044"", ""10.1515/9780804765602"", ""10.1057/ejdr.2015.29"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198706205.003.0005"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(94)90004-3"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19195-6_3"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139208772"", ""10.4337/9781788113779.00041"", ""10.1080/09692290.2013.809782"", ""10.1057/9780230597440"", ""10.1111/j.1976-5118.1997.tb00003.x"", ""10.1787/9789264189560-en"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198739890.001.0001"", ""10.4337/9781788113779"", ""10.1515/9781400862030.267"", ""10.4337/9781788113779.00033"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-0157-0"", ""10.1080/13563460500494784"", ""10.1515/9780691187181"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9701.1991.tb00850.x"", ""10.1080/09692290310001601902"", ""10.7591/9781501720383""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12335,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,In pursuit of happiness: Life satisfaction drives political support,"AbstractIt is argued in this article that citizens in democracies use their subjective well‐being (SWB) as an evaluative criterion when deciding how willing they are to support and comply with government dictates (political system support). When life is satisfactory, government authorities are rewarded with support, when it is not, citizens punish authorities by withholding their support. To make sense of the relationship, it is suggested that citizens act as if they have signed a happiness contract with ‘those in power’. In support of this argument, comparative survey data shows that SWB predicts attitudes on political system support across country contexts and under strong control conditions. Establishing that the relationship is causal, panel data documents that attitudes on political system support can be undermined following the termination of a close personal relationship, and that the causal effect is mediated via changes in SWB. Finally, as predicted, the happiness‐support relationship is weaker among individuals who are high on spirituality/religiousness and attribute blame for external events to both worldly and non‐worldly powers.","[{""name"": ""PETER ESAIASSON"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Gothenburg  Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""STEFAN DAHLBERG"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Gothenburg  Sweden"", ""Department of Comparative Politics University of Bergen  Norway""]}, {""name"": ""ANDREJ KOKKONEN"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Gothenburg  Sweden""]}]","[""10.2307/271083"", ""10.4135/9781412993869"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12046"", ""10.1086/292379"", ""10.1086/688178"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199357505.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10519-015-9713-y"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0753-5_44"", ""10.1017/S1468109916000165"", ""10.1111/ecca.12007"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.32"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.830468"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199268436.001.0001"", ""10.1080/1461669032000072256"", ""10.1177/1474885118778621"", ""10.4135/9781412983594"", ""10.1177/1088868309350299"", ""10.3386/w20794"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-032211-212920"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000306"", ""10.3386/w20686"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-100608-104510"", ""10.1007/s10902-011-9247-9"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6435.2006.00319.x"", ""10.1037/a0020761"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.01.004"", ""10.1097/PSY.0000000000000024"", ""10.1093/0198295685.003.0002"", ""10.1177/0192512110375938"", ""10.1007/s10943-014-9983-3"", ""10.1057/9781403980274"", ""10.1111/pops.12164"", ""10.1002/bdm.515"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.475"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.11.013"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12080"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01930.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12271"", ""10.1007/s11136-013-0512-8"", ""10.1017/S1537592704000623"", ""10.1177/1470594X14541522"", ""10.1515/9789048513369-008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1057/ap.2010.3"", ""10.1007/s11205-010-9719-z"", ""10.1177/1077727X8501300403"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716334.003.0010"", ""10.2307/2393868"", ""10.1080/13504851.2012.762709"", ""10.1177/0002764209338795"", ""10.1007/BF01384942"", ""10.1093/sf/sos122"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107477971"", ""10.1515/9781400828609"", ""10.4337/9781782545118.00028"", ""10.1177/0032321715607514"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12115"", ""10.1007/BF01078732"", ""10.1007/s11205-008-9323-7"", ""10.2307/1964021"", ""10.1037/pspp0000065"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-411478-4.00007-2"", ""10.1002/j.2161-007X.2000.tb00182.x"", ""10.1007/s11205-016-1318-1"", ""10.1093/poq/nfn054"", ""10.4337/9781782545118""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/padm.12807,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,How local governments prioritize multiple conflicting goals: Beyond the sole-goal perspective,"AbstractUnderstanding how public organizations prioritize goals is crucial in studying goal‐setting in the public sector. However, the extant literature has mostly adopted a sole‐goal perspective and neglected the influences of the interplay among multiple goals. This article extends the literature by going beyond the sole‐goal perspective and adopting a multigoal perspective to further explore the complexities in public organizations' goal prioritization when facing multiple conflicting goals. Drawing on the theoretical perspectives of performance information use and interorganizational interactions, the main arguments of this study are twofold. First, an organization's prioritization of a particular goal will be positively associated with the performance gap in its conflicting goal. Second, organizations tend to adopt a differentiation strategy in the prioritization of multiple conflicting goals. Empirical findings based on the investigation of Chinese city‐level governments' prioritization of environmental goals when confronting conflict between environmental protection and economic development goals support our arguments.","[{""name"": ""Shaowei Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Administration Hunan University  Changsha China""]}, {""name"": ""Kai Jia"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Affairs and Administration University of Electronic Science and Technology of China  Chengdu China""]}]","[""10.1093/jopart/muz036"", ""10.1080/10967494.2020.1797964"", ""10.1080/10967494.2020.1815917"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy001"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui030"", ""10.2307/2095101"", ""10.1017/S0305741015000806"", ""10.1111/padm.12155"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615139"", ""10.5465/amj.2008.32625975"", ""10.1111/padm.12379"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy017"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy048"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.05.114"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2019.101365"", ""10.1086/261010"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2004.06.009"", ""10.1111/padm.12225"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu054"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq059"", ""10.2307/1913646"", ""10.1111/padm.12050"", ""10.1111/padm.12124"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq017"", ""10.1017/S0305741004000050"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106888"", ""10.1017/S0305741016001521"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1550129"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00261.x"", ""10.1002/jae.770"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2021.102440"", ""10.1257/jel.49.4.1076"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141002"", ""10.1111/puar.13184"", ""10.1111/gove.12429"", ""10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2013.09.003"", ""10.1080/15309576.2019.1568886""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Wind turbines and the electoral success of the greens and the populist radical right,"AbstractThe increased salience of environmental concerns, first and foremost global warming, is one of the key developments of contemporary Western European politics. Still, the effects of global warming issues on electoral outcomes, party competition and polarization remain poorly understood. Our article shows how the construction of wind turbines fuels conflict between its key proponents and opponents, Green and populist radical right parties. Contention over the issue contributes to the electoral success of both sides and therefore reinforces the new central divide between them. Drawing on a novel dataset, we investigate the impact of the construction of wind turbines on Alternative für Deutschland and Green party electoral success in Germany. We employ a two‐way fixed effects model, where the construction of wind turbines functions as the independent variable. We show that the construction of wind turbines boosts the electoral support of both their biggest supporters and their biggest opponents. Our results have important implications for understanding contemporary political conflict in Western Europe such as the electoral rise of the Greens and the populist radical right, the importance of issue salience and the polarization of party systems.","[{""name"": ""CYRILL OTTENI"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Technical University Dresden  Germany""]}, {""name"": ""MANÈS WEISSKIRCHER"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology and Human Geography University of Oslo  Norway"", ""Center for Research on Extremism (C‐REX) University of Oslo  Norway""]}]","[""10.1017/S0007123418000029"", ""10.1177/1078087411423644"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.814956"", ""10.1177/106591290105400406"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00530.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511976254"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00369.x"", ""10.1017/9781009006866"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.01.001"", ""10.1080/09644010500175833"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1995.tb00635.x"", ""10.1080/01402381003654387"", ""10.1111/spsr.12180"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1598062"", ""10.1177/1354068806068599"", ""10.1080/09644016.2013.755391"", ""10.1111/padm.12046"", ""10.2307/2991738"", ""10.1177/0010414008315860"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12620"", ""10.1080/01402381003654569"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12017"", ""10.1080/13876988.2012.698582"", ""10.1177/1354068817693473"", ""10.1002/wcc.604"", ""10.4324/9781351104043"", ""10.3167/nc.2015.100204"", ""10.1080/17524032.2018.1470546"", ""10.1002/epa2.1022"", ""10.1177/1354068817728211"", ""10.1177/0002764212463361"", ""10.4324/9781351104043-9"", ""10.17645/pag.v9i4.4530"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1080/09644016.2019.1708186"", ""10.1080/09644016.2021.1978200"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1995.tb00537.x"", ""10.1002/9781119168577.ch18"", ""10.1017/9781108652780"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00303.x"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.05.050"", ""10.1515/9781400861439"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2010.00852.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9116-y"", ""10.7591/9781501745959"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1111/risa.13530"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1458411"", ""10.14361/9783839438152-003"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12259"", ""10.1080/09644016.2015.1063301"", ""10.1080/09644016.2019.1709252"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.36"", ""10.1016/j.jup.2016.02.006"", ""10.1017/gov.2021.14"", ""10.1080/09644010802065815"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12032"", ""10.1080/09644001003793222"", ""10.1111/ajps.12220"", ""10.1016/S0301-4215(04)00017-5"", ""10.4324/9781315585932"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12859"", ""10.1080/09644016.2016.1166602""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1093/isr/viaa018,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,FORUM: RETHINKING NEOCLASSICAL REALISM AT THEORY'S END,"AbstractThis forum presents a snapshot of the current state of neoclassical realist theorizing. Its contributors are self-identified neoclassical realists who delineate their version of neoclassical realism (NCR), its scope, object of analysis, and theoretical contribution. From the standpoint of NCR, they contribute to and reflect on the “end of IR theory” debate. NCR has come under criticism for its supposed lack of theoretical structure and alleged disregard for paradigmatic boundaries. This raises questions as to the nature of this (theoretical) beast. Is NCR a midrange, progressive research program? Can it formulate a grand theory informed by metatheoretical assumptions? Is it a reformulation of neorealism or classical realism or an eclectic mix of different paradigms? The forum contributors argue that NCR, in different variants, holds considerable promise to investigate foreign policy, grand strategy and international politics. They interrogate the interaction of international and domestic politics and consider normative implications as well as the sources and cases of NCR beyond the West. In so doing, they speak to theorizing and the utility of the theoretical enterprise in IR more generally.","[{""name"": ""Gustav Meibauer"", ""affiliation"": [""London School of Economics and Political Science""]}, {""name"": ""Linde Desmaele"", ""affiliation"": [""Vrije Universiteit Brussel""]}, {""name"": ""Tudor Onea"", ""affiliation"": [""Bilkent University""]}, {""name"": ""Nicholas Kitchen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Surrey""]}, {""name"": ""Michiel Foulon"", ""affiliation"": [""ETH Zurich""]}, {""name"": ""Alexander Reichwein"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Giessen""]}, {""name"": ""Jennifer Sterling-Folker"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Connecticut""]}]","[""10.1111/isqu.12171"", ""10.1093/isr/viv016"", ""10.1093/irap/lcm012"", ""10.1093/irap/lcr007"", ""10.1111/1521-9488.00263"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2009.00091.x"", ""10.1080/09662839.2015.1084290"", ""10.1177/1354066113495484"", ""10.1177/1354066117739096"", ""10.1086/699246"", ""10.7591/9780801470288"", ""10.1162/002081897550429"", ""10.1177/1354066113494321"", ""10.7312/buza93756"", ""10.2307/2952174"", ""10.1080/02589346.2012.683942"", ""10.1515/9781400827220"", ""10.1177/1354066113495485"", ""10.1080/09636419608429299"", ""10.1162/016228800560426"", ""10.1162/isec_c_00332"", ""10.4324/9781315561462"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190845162.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01436597.2018.1552078"", ""10.1177/1354066105050136"", ""10.1080/01402390108565554"", ""10.1017/S002081830003201X"", ""10.1177/0263395716665333"", ""10.1093/isr/viy005"", ""10.1177/1354066113494327"", ""10.1080/21599165.2019.1581066"", ""10.1080/09512748.2016.1201130"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139096829"", ""10.1093/isr/viv022"", ""10.4324/9781317351887"", ""10.1177/1354066113495482"", ""10.1017/S0260210500112847"", ""10.1080/13629380701844698"", ""10.1177/1354066110373949"", ""10.1017/S0043887114000318"", ""10.1017/S0260210509990532"", ""10.1016/j.euras.2011.10.004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00661.x"", ""10.1177/1354066113494330"", ""10.2307/3791437"", ""10.1162/016228899560130"", ""10.3998/mpub.17825"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811869"", ""10.2307/3183521"", ""10.1177/1354066113494320"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000214"", ""10.1162/002081897550447"", ""10.2307/1951286"", ""10.2307/2626652"", ""10.1111/j.1747-7093.1997.tb00031.x"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00296"", ""10.1177/0047117811430674"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2011.01021.x"", ""10.1080/09636410600829554"", ""10.1057/ip.2013.5"", ""10.1111/0149-0508.00178"", ""10.1080/09636410802098917"", ""10.1177/1354066113495479"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199899234.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0043887100007814"", ""10.1177/0305829811404270"", ""10.1093/isr/viy011"", ""10.1177/2057891118787930"", ""10.1177/0305829813518363"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5627.003.0012"", ""10.1162/0162288042879913"", ""10.1093/cjip/poy003"", ""10.1177/0305829811412325"", ""10.4324/9780203842126"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-01359-0"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1360073"", ""10.1177/0047117815588117"", ""10.1111/1467-856X.00042"", ""10.1353/apr.2013.0014"", ""10.1177/002200275700100401"", ""10.1093/fpa/orw062"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00031"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00150"", ""10.1111/1521-9488.t01-1-00253"", ""10.1177/1354066113494322"", ""10.1080/09636410601028370"", ""10.1093/isr/viy023"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139136808"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2009.00907.x"", ""10.1177/1354066113494323"", ""10.4324/9781315756233"", ""10.4324/9780203885451"", ""10.1080/09636419608429298"", ""10.2307/2952173"", ""10.1162/016228800560372"", ""10.1017/S0020818304040202"", ""10.7591/9781501738081"", ""10.1080/09636419508429271"", ""10.1093/irap/lcs001"", ""10.2307/2539162"", ""10.1177/1354066115580137"", ""10.1007/s11366-017-9464-0""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Technological development can disrupt the authority‐allocation process by fostering uncertainty about which actors are responsible for making policy. This article examines the role that changing technology has played in the development of cybersecurity policy in the United States. New technologies have increased the type and scope of assets vulnerable to cyberthreats, and with them the number of governing units who can claim jurisdiction over cybersecurity‐related issues. Uncertainty about the nature of the problem has led the U.S. Congress to rely heavily on bureaucratic witnesses and focus on how existing regulations can be brought to bear. Emerging technologies create regulatory challenges for governance not only through unforeseen consequences but through uncertainty over who can regulate. Fragmented authority can produce piecemeal responses and a reliance on existing frameworks that benefit regulated industries.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Lewallen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science and International Studies University of Tampa  Tampa Florida USA""]}]","[""10.1111/0022-3816.00015"", ""10.1111/rego.12313"", ""10.1111/j.1573-7861.2007.00012.x"", ""10.2307/2082885"", ""10.2307/257746"", ""10.2307/2669292"", ""10.1007/BF00242147"", ""10.1080/23738871.2018.1514417"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000130"", ""10.2307/2111102"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00499.x"", ""10.1287/orsc.2.1.88"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00363.x"", ""10.2307/2010261"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00294.x"", ""10.2307/2944881"", ""10.1017/err.2019.22"", ""10.1007/BF00138910"", ""10.2307/973247"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17244-6"", ""10.1111/rego.12090"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2010.00441.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.33.1.107"", ""10.1111/psj.12024"", ""10.1093/jopart/mun015"", ""10.1177/106591290005300401"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00219.x"", ""10.1111/ropr.12325"", ""10.2307/2111618"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-16447-2_1"", ""10.1016/j.cose.2013.04.004"", ""10.1017/S0007123400001101"", ""10.1017/S1867299X00006012"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107447752"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00296.x"", ""10.1016/j.cogsys.2016.11.002"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00292.x""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Following a qualitative content analysis of key speeches by the young activist, this paper challenges this view, and argues that her message is far from being a case of populism. On the contrary, it abides by a substantially different set of ideas that can be defined as technocratic ecocentrism. In particular, it is argued that rather than people‐centrism, anti‐elitism and vox populi, Greta Thunberg’s message is grounded on three different core ideas: ecocentrism, technocracy, and on the exaltation of the vox scientifica. However, whereas Thunberg’s technocratic ecocentrism is at odds with the foundations of the populist set of ideas, it shares a similar emphasis on monism, moralisation, a Manichean vision of the world, a critique of key features of the metapolitical status quo, and a tendency to personalisation.","[{""name"": ""Mattia Zulianello"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diego Ceccobelli"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000223,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,"Do Women Make More Credible Threats? Gender Stereotypes, Audience Costs, and Crisis Bargaining","AbstractAs more women attain executive office, it is important to understand how gender dynamics affect international politics. Toward this end, we present the first evidence that gender stereotypes affect leaders’ abilities to generate audience costs. Using survey experiments, we show that female leaders have political incentives to combat gender stereotypes that women are weak by acting “tough” during international military crises. Most prominently, we find evidence that female leaders, and male leaders facing female opponents, pay greater inconsistency costs for backing down from threats than male leaders do against fellow men. These findings point to particular advantages and disadvantages women have in international crises. Namely, female leaders are better able to tie hands—an efficient mechanism for establishing credibility in crises. However, this bargaining advantage means female leaders will also have a harder time backing down from threats. Our findings have critical implications for debates over the effects of greater gender equality in executive offices worldwide.","[{""name"": ""Joshua A.

In this introductory article we present the main conceptualizations of the contributions to the special issue that define our understanding of collective identities and core state powers. We discuss the multi‐level nature of collective identities and we discuss theoretical expectations over the link between collective identities and core state powers. Finally, we briefly present each of the contributions to the issue and discuss how they relate to the broad research goals, the special issue and to each other.","[{""name"": ""Theresa Kuhn"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam  Amsterdam""]}, {""name"": ""Francesco Nicoli"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Gent  Gent""]}]","[""10.2307/2010513"", ""10.1177/1354066199005001001"", ""10.1093/0199286434.001.0001"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-53759-1.00002-9"", ""10.5771/9783845247878_63"", ""10.1111/jcms.12982"", ""10.1111/jcms.12980"", ""10.1177/0010414003257609"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050289"", ""10.1057/9780230339521"", ""10.1057/9781137316967_12"", ""10.1111/jcms.12981"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12261"", ""10.1111/jcms.12979"", ""10.1093/esr/jcy031"", ""10.1093/0199284660.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jcms.12975"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01939.x"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1055782"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042214-044157"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139245920"", ""10.1111/jcms.12976"", ""10.1515/9780804768047-008"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000409"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.2307/421501"", ""10.1111/jcms.12983"", ""10.1080/00220270802467475"", ""10.1080/146166900412037"", ""10.1162/0162288041588278"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199688913.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1622588"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1370005"", ""10.1080/01402389908425284"", ""10.1111/jcms.12984"", ""10.1080/713601585"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716235.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jcms.12784"", ""10.1111/jcms.12978"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1298591"", ""10.1111/jcms.12977"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1080286"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027697"", ""10.1057/9781137316028"", ""10.1080/13501760500044033"", ""10.1177/136843102760513848"", ""10.1017/S0020818300017549"", ""10.2307/2620461"", ""10.1177/136843102760513965"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-94174-5_2"", ""10.1515/9780804766036"", ""10.2307/796898"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.1995.tb00030.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

While a number of theorists have criticized celebrity involvement in politics, none so far have examined this issue using the tools of social epistemology, the study of the effects of social interactions, practices, and institutions on knowledge and belief acquisition. We will draw on these resources to investigate the issue of celebrity involvement in politics, specifically as this involvement relates to democratic theory and its implications for democratic practice. We will argue that an important and underexplored form of power, which we will callepistemic power,can explain one important way in which celebrity involvement in politics is problematic. This is because unchecked uses and unwarranted allocations of epistemic power, which celebrities tend to enjoy, threaten the legitimacy of existing democracies and raise important questions regarding core commitments of deliberative, epistemic, and plebiscitary models of democratic theory. We will finish by suggesting directions that democratic theorists could pursue when attempting to address some of these problems.","[{""name"": ""Alfred Archer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amanda Cawston"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benjamin Matheson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Machteld Geuskens"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1207/S15327825MCS0601_5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195136593.003.0004"", ""10.1177/1470594X07081303"", ""10.1111/j.1088-4963.2007.00098.x"", ""10.1177/1367877906064028"", ""10.1080/03007766.2013.798546"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2324.003.0013"", ""10.1177/1461444813487955"", ""10.1177/0096340214563676"", ""10.1515/9780691187013"", ""10.4324/9780203116340"", ""10.1080/02691728.2013.782585"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856X.2004.00149.x"", ""10.1007/s11077-017-9286-0"", ""10.1080/00332747.1956.11023049"", ""10.1007/s11747-016-0503-8"", ""10.1111/papa.12037"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1086/267990"", ""10.1007/s11229-012-0119-6"", ""10.1017/apa.2019.9"", ""10.1093/mind/fzx042"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.1996.tb00045.x"", ""10.1093/monist/onv022"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2950.003.0005"", ""10.1542/peds.2010-1722P"", ""10.1080/13698230.2015.1033856"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1zc2x91"", ""10.1177/1081180X05279278"", ""10.1093/jleo/ewr031"", ""10.1017/9781108159906"", ""10.1080/02691728.2010.534568"", ""10.1108/03090561011020516"", ""10.1080/02691728.2018.1440022""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Experimental Evidence from Afghanistan,"Governments, militaries, and aid organizations all rely on economic interventions to shape civilian attitudes toward combatants during wartime. We have, however, little individual-level evidence that these “hearts and minds” programs actually influence combatant support. We address this problem by conducting a factorial randomized control trial of two common interventions—vocational training and cash transfers—on combatant support among 2,597 at-risk youth in Kandahar, Afghanistan. We find that training only improved economic livelihoods modestly and had little effect on combatant support. Cash failed to lift incomes, producing a boom-and-bust dynamic in which pro-government sentiment initially spiked and then quickly reversed itself, leaving a residue of increased Taliban support. Conditional on training, cash failed to improve beneficiaries’ livelihoods but did increase support for the Afghan government for at least eight months after the intervention. These findings suggest that aid affects attitudes by providing information about government resolve and competence rather than by improving economic livelihoods.","[{""name"": ""JASON LYALL"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""YANG-YANG ZHOU"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""KOSUKE IMAI"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ajps.12026"", ""10.1177/2053168017735200"", ""10.1525/9780520341623"", ""10.1257/aer.104.6.1630"", ""10.1093/wbro/lkx001"", ""10.1086/681590"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000403"", ""10.1017/S0020818319000262"", ""10.1002/9781119013563"", ""10.3386/t0277"", ""10.7591/9781501703836"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12211"", ""10.1086/694235"", ""10.1111/ajps.12285"", ""10.1257/aer.104.6.1833"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00542.x"", ""10.1093/oep/gpf064"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr031"", ""10.1080/01621459.2015.1050028"", ""10.1111/ajps.12086"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00604.x"", ""10.1177/0022002710393920"", ""10.1086/661983"", ""10.1111/j.1467-985X.2007.00527.x"", ""10.1017/XPS.2014.31"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000236"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.020"", ""10.3386/w21434"", ""10.1177/0022002712448908"", ""10.1086/686026"", ""10.1086/259394"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2702219"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000415"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000208"", ""10.1080/01621459.1996.10476902"", ""10.32614/CRAN.package.rr"", ""10.1177/0022343316675909"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.013"", ""10.1257/aer.20150503"", ""10.1017/S0003055415000520"", ""10.18637/jss.v045.i02"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2015.08.005"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000356""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Development', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Safety Research']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

How fairness perceptions mediate the effect of revenue recycling on public support for carbon taxes in the United States, Canada and Germany(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras Clave","AbstractCarbon taxes are frequently advocated as a means of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet their political feasibility remains a challenge. To enhance their political appeal, carbon tax proponents have proposed revenue recycling as a means of alleviating public concern with this instrument's visible costs. Analyzing data from identical survey‐experiments administered in the United States, Canada, and Germany, we examine the extent to which returning revenues to the public has the potential to broaden the political acceptability of carbon taxes across ideological and national contexts. While public opinion is sensitive to the cost attributes of carbon taxes, we find that in some cases, opposition to carbon taxes can be offset by a reduction in income taxes. However, these effects tend to be modest in size, limited to some ideological groups, and varied across countries. Moreover, we demonstrate that fairness perceptions are a crucial mechanism linking revenue recycling to carbon tax support in all countries examined.","[{""name"": ""Sverker C.

As such, they are ideal tools to erode democratic institutions while maintaining the illusion of constitutional legitimacy. Therefore, states of emergency should be associated with a heightened risk of autocratization – a decline in a regime's democratic attributes. Despite this theoretical link and the contemporary relevance of both autocratization and states of emergency, no prior study has empirically tested this relationship. This article tests this relationship using data on sixty democracies for 1974 to 2016. We find that democracies are 75 percent more likely to erode under a state of emergency. This evidence strongly suggests that states of emergency circumvent democratic processes in ways that might promote democratic decline.","[{""name"": ""Anna Lührmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bryan Rooney"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Our design is the first to isolate to what extent substantive legal demands, instrumental military imperatives, and specific moral principles are reflected in respondents' preferences. Although all logics have some resonance, we find that respondents' preferences are remarkably consistent with several core demands of international law even though respondents are not told that the legality of the use of force is at stake. Only the imperative to minimize U.S. military casualties overwhelms both legal and moral demands.","[{""name"": ""Janina Dill"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford""]}, {""name"": ""Livia I.

10.1111/ssqu.12977,SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,Who Trusts the WHO? Heuristics and Americans' Trust in the World Health Organization During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"ObjectiveWhy do some Americans trust the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID‐19 pandemic, but others do not? To date, there has been no examination of trust in the WHO. Yet the global nature of the pandemic necessitates expanding our scholarship to international health organizations. We test the effects of partisanship, ideology, the cooperative internationalist foreign policy orientation, and nationalism on trust in the WHO and subsequently examine how this trust relates to preventive health behavior.MethodsMultivariate analysis of original survey data from a representative sample of Americans.ResultsDemocrats, liberals, and those with a strong cooperative internationalist foreign policy orientation are more likely to trust the WHO's competence and integrity in responding to the COVID‐19 pandemic while Republicans, conservatives, and nationalists are less likely. Even though trust in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has the largest impact on preventive health behaviors, trust in the competence of the WHO is also an important factor. These results remain robust after controlling for other covariates.ConclusionPandemic politics in the United States is polarized along party and ideological lines. However, our results show that a fuller understanding Americans’ political trust and health behaviors during COVID‐19 requires taking the international dimensions of the pandemic seriously.","[{""name"": ""A.

The author articulates a theoretical model of the policy process where policymaking and policy implementation are separate, but interdependent processes, and generates three hypotheses related to policymaking, policy implementation, and the interdependence of those processes. Then, the author tests hypotheses with state‐level implementation of federal environmental policy over a 20 year period. Using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), the author makes joint estimations of policymaking and policy implementation as separate, correlated processes. Findings indicate how politics affects policymaking and policy implementation is conditional on existing policies and problems, and that these two processes are not independent from each other. Conclusions connect this MSF to the broader literature and how it may address current criticisms.","[{""name"": ""Luke Fowler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0275074013504128"", ""10.1080/14719037.2012.725757"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00372.x"", ""10.4324/9780429494284-3"", ""10.2307/2082979"", ""10.1093/pan/6.1.1"", ""10.1177/153244001001000201"", ""10.1177/1532440012464877"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2004.00068.x"", ""10.1332/030557315X14477577990650"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui030"", ""10.1002/pam.20547"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu015"", ""10.1111/psj.12235"", ""10.1177/0160323X16656918"", ""10.1111/gove.12382"", ""10.1111/puar.13089"", ""10.4324/9780429494284-2"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2011.00494.x"", ""10.1177/0952076718775791"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00450.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12064"", ""10.1093/pan/10.1.49"", ""10.1111/puar.12318"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2003.10.003"", ""10.2307/2111095"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2012.00570.x"", ""10.1093/publius/pjw004"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui036"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00291.x"", ""10.2307/1963264"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00034.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muj006"", ""10.1111/psj.12040"", ""10.1177/153244000700700405"", ""10.1093/publius/pjm007"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199838486.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00293.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00358.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X1600009X"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00298.x"", ""10.1111/1540-6210.00333"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq047"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2004.00075.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2002.tb02160.x"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.841978"", ""10.2307/1963851"", ""10.1093/publius/pji029"", ""10.1111/psj.12129"", ""10.1080/01621459.1962.10480664""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

First, to make explicit the theories of change currently operative within transitional justice and, second, to critically engage with both these theories, and dominant theories in international development. As such, it seeks to replace a focus on results, attribution, and linearity with a privileging of process, contribution and complexity. Developing theories of change for transitional justice is challenging, as it is characterised by diverse interventions, complex and contested contexts, and the need to balance principles and pragmatism. Normative, linear and mechanism-based claims remain dominant, while the evidence base for transitional justice is still weak. This article looks at insights from adjacent fields, some of the challenges facing the development of theories of change within transitional justice, and evidence from impact studies and evaluations. In a final section we propose an alternative, drawing on complexity theory and actor-oriented approaches, which suggest an important set of terms – systems, interaction, contingency, context, encounter, emergence, incrementalism – to inform what we term evaluation as understanding.","[{""name"": ""Paul Gready"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Robins"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12590,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,Transformation of the political space: A citizens' perspective,"AbstractA large and growing body of research draws attention to the rising salience of socio‐cultural and identitarian issues and, potentially, the emergence of a new political cleavage that divides voters on those issues. However, the micro‐foundations of this transformation are less well understood. Here we take a voter‐perspective to evaluate how party competition has been restructured in the eyes of the voter. We leverage measures of citizens’ self‐reported probabilities to vote for alternative political parties in the European Election Study voter surveys between 1999 and 2019 in order to map electoral affinity and opposition among party families. We estimate to what extent spatial location on the economic left–right dimension and the GAL‐TAN dimension explain the patterns that emerge, and how this has changed over time. Our results provide evidence of a substantial shift in voter assessment from party competition structured along the economic left–right dimension to competition structured along the GAL‐TAN dimension. We also find great separation of TAN parties from other parties, with the deepest antipathy between the TAN parties and greens.","[{""name"": ""RUTH DASSONNEVILLE"", ""affiliation"": [""Département de science politique Université de Montréal  Canada"", ""Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies European University Institute  Italy""]}, {""name"": ""LIESBET HOOGHE"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  USA"", ""Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies European University Institute  Italy""]}, {""name"": ""GARY MARKS"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  USA"", ""Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies European University Institute  Italy""]}]","[""10.1017/S0043887121000046"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2020.1853903"", ""10.1111/ajps.12759"", ""10.1177/1465116512436995"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2007.11.008"", ""10.1080/01402381003654387"", ""10.1177/0010414021997504"", ""10.1080/01402382.2012.713744"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198830986.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199599356.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.003.0028"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000379"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1339730"", ""10.1177/1354068819829207"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198280323.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108914123"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12319"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102332"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245.009"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000125"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310279"", ""10.1177/2053168018822395"", ""10.1177/1465116520988915"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102420"", ""10.2307/2010362"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00644.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12474"", ""10.1017/S0007123421000740"", ""10.4324/9780429331688-2"", ""10.1177/01925121211020592"", ""10.1177/1354068817741287"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12259"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2018.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.102092"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1701536"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12351"", ""10.1017/S0043887114000227"", ""10.1093/sp/jxac003"", ""10.1080/01402381003654544"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.13"", ""10.1017/S1755773913000246"", ""10.1177/1354068806071260"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.06.012"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2020.102199"", ""10.1057/s41269-016-0028-7""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.17645/pag.v8i1.2686,POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE,0302 Political Science,Towards Explaining Varying Degrees of Politicization of EU Trade Agreement Negotiations,"Over the last decade, European Union (EU) trade agreement negotiations in the form of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada have been strongly contested. By contrast, many other EU trade negotiations have sailed on with far less politicization, or barely any at all. In this contribution, we assess a series of plausible explanation for these very varying degrees of politicization across EU trade agreement negotiations—conceived of as the combination of polarization of opinions, salience given to them in public debate, and the expansion of the number of societal actors involved therein. Through a review of existing explanations, we show how each of these explanations faces a set of challenges. In the third section, we argue it is useful to conceive of these existing explanations as structural background conditions enabling agency on the part of interest group and civil society organizations. We therefore close by sketching how literature on the relationship between interest group mobilization and public opinion could inform further comparative research on trade policy negotiations, and on politicization of EU policy making in general.","[{""name"": ""Dirk De Bièvre"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Arlo Poletti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/107769900007700308"", ""10.1017/S002081831700011X"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1371711"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.646779"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12109"", ""10.1080/03932729.2018.1499849"", ""10.1177/0010414005277578"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1254274"", ""10.1177/1465116517715525"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1254273"", ""10.1080/07036337.2010.546849"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1081505"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678056"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2007.00750.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856x.2007.00316.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12298"", ""10.1007/s11558-013-9179-8"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1619802"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.900893"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198785651.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1085073"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-13366-5"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2011.02243.x"", ""10.1080/13501763.2018.1489418"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i1.2588"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-93583-3"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01522.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12145"", ""10.1017/S1755773919000031"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i1.2651"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1240407"", ""10.1080/09644008.2017.1332181"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000247"", ""10.1080/09692290.2018.1431956"", ""10.1177/1465116517740638"", ""10.1111/ajps.12314"", ""10.1515/9780691221472"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1372430"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1231130"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090158"", ""10.1017/S0043887113000191"", ""10.1017/S000305541000050X"", ""10.1515/9780691223698"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678058"", ""10.17645/pag.v8i1.2616"", ""10.1080/09692290.2017.1307245"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1372432"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.897208"", ""10.1080/01402382.2012.682351"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78864-7"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12036"", ""10.1177/0010414017695334"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1371710"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2006.00627.x"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1642232"", ""10.1080/13563467.2011.602187"", ""10.1080/09557571.2018.1461805"", ""10.1177/1465116518755953"", ""10.1080/07036337.2017.1371709"", ""10.1007/s10272-010-0321-z"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1046902"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1150316"", ""10.2307/j.ctv5cg80h"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1678055"", ""10.1080/13501760600837104"", ""10.1017/S1755773912000276"", ""10.1017/S1752971912000012""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

To maximize the mobilization potential, protest organizers organize more protest events when Covid‐19 mortality rates are low, the stringency of containment policies is high, and in districts in which the vote share of mainstream parties is traditionally low.MethodUsing a negative binomial model, we analyze the number of protest events in a sample of 401 German districts over the period from March to May 2020.ResultsWe find robust positive predicted effects of the stringency of containment policies and negative predicted effects for the mortality rate and the strengths of mainstream parties.ConclusionWe interpret these findings as evidence of the strategic behavior of protest organizers that target protest participation and mobilization to keep the movement alive and potentially grow it.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Plümper"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Socioeconomics Vienna University of Economics and Business  Vienna Austria""]}, {""name"": ""Eric Neumayer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Geography &amp; Environment London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Katharina Gabriela Pfaff"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Socioeconomics Vienna University of Economics and Business  Vienna Austria""]}]","[""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105294"", ""10.1073/pnas.2004911117"", ""10.1017/XPS.2020.28"", ""10.1017/S0007123419000681"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00602.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973420"", ""10.35188/UNU-WIDER/2021/995-2"", ""10.22330/he/35/037-048"", ""10.2307/2669316"", ""10.1080/14742837.2020.1843014"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3787921"", ""10.1080/14754835.2020.1830046"", ""10.31235/osf.io/zyp3f"", ""10.1017/9781108233590"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3844989"", ""10.1177/0022343310378914"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12425""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Modeling and Simulation']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)]]"

However, we still need a better understanding about to what extent such regulations contribute to enhance “foreign corporate accountability (FCA).” This article introduces a special issue that theorizes and empirically investigates foreign accountability dynamics. We do so by advancing an analytical framework that conceptualizes FCA and identify important contextual conditions that help to explain accountability dynamics. Applying this framework, we show that the drafting, implementation, and enforcement of such regulations are highly political processes, wherein competing ideas embedded within unequal actor constellations and institutional environments shape the possibilities to achieve more transformative change. By theorizing and empirically investigating FCA dynamics, we contribute to advance debates about the sustainability governance of global supply chains.","[{""name"": ""Maria‐Therese Gustafsson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science Stockholm University  Stockholm Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Almut Schilling‐Vacaflor"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Social Sciences, Osnabrück University  Osnabrück Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Lenschow"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Social Sciences, Osnabrück University  Osnabrück Germany""]}]","[""10.1177/0002716217694593"", ""10.1017/S0020818304582024"", ""10.1080/17524032.2019.1665567"", ""10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.74"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2016.1150777"", ""10.1111/rego.12051"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053540"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.611"", ""10.1111/rego.12540"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00351"", ""10.1080/01402382.2010.486119"", ""10.1111/rego.12249"", ""10.1017/S0020589320000305"", ""10.1017/bhj.2021.42"", ""10.1111/rego.12395"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00112"", ""10.1162/1526380054794916"", ""10.1016/j.resourpol.2022.103241"", ""10.1080/09692290.2019.1679220"", ""10.1162/002081898550789"", ""10.1080/09614520701469955"", ""10.1017/9780521699617"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051476"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262027410.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-60756-6"", ""10.1002/eet.1904"", ""10.1111/rego.12498"", ""10.1093/0199247757.003.0001"", ""10.1007/s10784-019-09439-6"", ""10.1177/0162243918768024"", ""10.1111/rego.12240"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01609.x"", ""10.1017/bhj.2021.43"", ""10.1080/09644016.2022.2044219"", ""10.1177/1354066110380963"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12398"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx047"", ""10.1111/j.1471-0374.2009.00263.x"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106439"", ""10.1007/BF02687587"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2019.1661231"", ""10.1111/rego.12539"", ""10.1177/0007650319898195"", ""10.1111/rego.12268"", ""10.1162/glep.2008.8.3.122"", ""10.5751/ES-11844-250421"", ""10.1177/1354066111407690"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11709.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12610.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09644016.2020.1793618"", ""10.1016/j.exis.2016.07.003"", ""10.2307/2586011"", ""10.1111/rego.12518"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ac358d"", ""10.1017/9781108781015"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511598777"", ""10.1017/9781316797990"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00563.x"", ""10.1111/rego.12154"", ""10.1007/s12142-020-00607-9"", ""10.3390/su13179666"", ""10.1111/rego12402"", ""10.1007/978-3-322-89589-9_2"", ""10.1111/rego.12527"", ""10.1080/13642987.2020.1799196"", ""10.1111/1467-9558.00174"", ""10.1177/0275074014533142"", ""10.1111/rego.12501"", ""10.1111/rego.12350""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Yet intersectionality is thought to be a challenging theory to apply, and represents a puzzle to policymakers and practitioners navigating policy area and equality strand silos. Based on the first empirical study internationally to explore how both practitioners and policymakers themselves understand how to operationalise ‘intersectionality’, this article establishes different ways in which the theory of intersectionality is applied in practice. ‘Intersectionality’ is understood and used in five contradicting ways in UK equality organising and policy, an integral insight because some of these advance intersectional justice while others serve to further entrench inequalities. This typology is proposed as a heuristic to analyse the ways in which intersectionality may be institutionalised in other countries and sectors, and their outcomes, discursive and material.","[{""name"": ""Ashlee Christoffersen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Edinburgh, UK""]}]","[""10.2979/MER.2006.7.1.104"", ""10.1017/S1743923X10000358"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2020.305766"", ""10.1086/669608"", ""10.1080/17496535.2018.1541230"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98473-5_33"", ""10.1093/cdj/bsz025"", ""10.1086/669575"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1108/S0163-786X20140000037001"", ""10.1177/1065912910379227"", ""10.1332/030557319X15526370368821"", ""10.1177/1065912910376385"", ""10.1057/s41293-018-00102-3"", ""10.1080/21565503.2012.760314"", ""10.1177/1350506805054267"", ""10.1057/9781137031068_1"", ""10.1177/0263395716649009"", ""10.1177/0891243214542430"", ""10.1086/669609"", ""10.1086/426800"", ""10.1332/030557309X445690"", ""10.1017/S1742058X13000210"", ""10.1080/14616740903237459"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98473-5_34"", ""10.1086/669572"", ""10.1093/sp/jxs015"", ""10.1177/1350506806065752""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1093/polsoc/puac006,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,The alegality of blockchain technology,"AbstractSimilar to the early days of the Internet, today, the effectiveness and applicability of legal regulations are being challenged by the advent of blockchain technology. Yet, unlike the Internet, which has evolved into an increasingly centralized system that was largely brought within the reach of the law, blockchain technology still resists regulation and is thus described by some as being “alegal”, i.e., situated beyond the boundaries of existing legal orders and, therefore, challenging them. This article investigates whether blockchain technology can indeed be qualified as alegal and the extent to which such technology can be brought back within the boundaries of a legal order by means of targeted policies. First, the article explores the features of blockchain-based systems, which make them hard to regulate, mainly due to their approach to disintermediation. Second, drawing from the notion of alegality in legal philosophy, the article analyzes how blockchain technology enables acts that transgress the temporal, spatial, material, and subjective boundaries of the law, thereby introducing the notion of “alegality by design”—as the design of a technological artifact can provide affordances for alegality. Third, the article discusses how the law could respond to the alegality of blockchain technology through innovative policies encouraging the use of regulatory sandboxes to test for the “functional equivalence” and “regulatory equivalence” of the practices and processes implemented by blockchain initiatives.","[{""name"": ""Primavera De Filippi"", ""affiliation"": [""Chargée de recherche , CERSA | CNRS, Paris, France"", ""Faculty Associate, Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society , Harvard University, Cambridge MA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Morshed Mannan"", ""affiliation"": [""Max Weber Fellow, Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies , European University Institute, Florence, Italy"", ""ICDE Research Affiliate , The New School, NY, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Wessel Reijers"", ""affiliation"": [""Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Vienna , Vienna, Austria"", ""Visiting Fellow, Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies , European University Institute, Florence, Italy"", ""Visiting Scholar , Technion, Haifa, Israel""]}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.2709713"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816674268.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802812"", ""10.1257/jep.29.2.213"", ""10.1017/err.2019.41"", ""10.14763/2014.2.286"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101284"", ""10.2307/3053321"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3338270"", ""10.1177/0964663918791009"", ""10.5771/9781786600547"", ""10.2307/1229390"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2998033"", ""10.1093/ajj/27.1.64"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-812282-2.00007-3"", ""10.1177/0191453706066979"", ""10.1007/s11158-008-9051-5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199601684.003.0006"", ""10.2979/indjglolegstu.20.2.697"", ""10.1017/9781316819203"", ""10.1007/s40804-018-0123-5"", ""10.4018/JCIT.2019010102"", ""10.1007/s11245-018-9626-5"", ""10.1080/23299460.2020.1806524"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199794515.003.0011"", ""10.1017/S0922156520000606"", ""10.1080/20414005.2016.1214022"", ""10.1002/jsc.2150"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198842187.003.0004"", ""10.1086/689839""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

We replicated a key question of this study, where respondents were asked if they would support saturation bombing an Iranian city to end a war. We also introduced some variations into the experiment to directly measure any potential influence of international norms and laws. Overall, our quantitative and qualitative findings are more optimistic than those of Sagan and Valentino's study: Americans do strongly believe it is wrong to target civilians. And in a real-life scenario such as this, a majority would likely oppose such a bombing. These findings suggest, however, that much depends on how survey questions are structured in measuring those preferences and whether legal or ethical considerations are part of any national conversation about war policy.","[{""name"": ""Charli Carpenter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander H.

In this paper, we argue that closure is in fact a selective mechanism: governments attempt to reorganize civic space through a dual process of selective in‐ and exclusion of civil society organizations. Civil society organizations identified as critical of or even anti‐government face obstruction and restraints, whereas simultaneously the space and state support for organizations identified as pro‐government is expanded. Governments instrumentalize certain civil society organizations to their own benefit: they are sponsored and used to influence the realm of civil society in ways that directly legitimize state power and maintain an appearance of democracy. We illustrate our claims by discussing the reorganization of civic space in some countries of Central and Eastern Europe through the case of women’s rights activism.","[{""name"": ""Conny Roggeband"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Amsterdam""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Krizsán"", ""affiliation"": [""Central European University""]}]","[""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195398571.003.0017"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0026"", ""10.1093/isq/sqaa019"", ""10.1086/701152"", ""10.1086/696691"", ""10.17645/pag.v6i3.1414"", ""10.1080/17448689.2013.818767"", ""10.1086/230869"", ""10.1080/13569775.2017.1343219"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99675-2_6-1"", ""10.1332/251510818X15311219732356"", ""10.1353/jod.2015.0071"", ""10.1525/sod.2015.1.1.173""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'History', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The leaders of rising powers such as China, India, Turkey, and Russia have stressed their civilizational identity in framing their domestic and foreign policy platforms. An emphasis on civilizational identity is also evident in U.S. president Donald Trump's domestic and foreign policy. Some analysts argue that the twenty-first century might belong to the civilization state, just as the past few centuries were dominated by the nation-state. But is the rise of civilization state inevitable? Will it further undermine the liberal international order and fuel a clash of civilizations, as predicted by the late Samuel Huntington?

10.1093/isr/viab028,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,The Misogyny of Authoritarians in Contemporary Democracies,"AbstractContemporary democracy in multiple countries has been under assault from what has been variously called right-wing populism, authoritarian populism, cultural majoritarianism, new nativism, new nationalism, quasi-fascism, and neo-fascism. While the authoritarian behaviors of several electorally legitimated leaders in these countries have been in focus, their misogyny is seen as merely an incidental part of their personality. This article highlights the centrality of misogyny in legitimating the political goals and regimes of a set of leaders in contemporary democracies—Trump, Modi, Bolsonaro, Duterte, and Erdogan (all but Trump are still in power)—in countries from across Global North/South, non-West/West, with mixed populations and different majority religions. The argument proceeds as follows. First, I clarify the conceptualization of misogyny and explain why it matters. Second, I demonstrate the substantive misogyny of political leaders who are/have been heads of hegemonic right-wing political projects in five contemporary democracies (Trumpism, Modification, Bolsonarismo, Dutertismo, and Erdoganism). Third, I put forward three systematic ways in which misogyny works as an effective political strategy for these projects, by enabling a certain politics of identity to demonize opponents as feminine/inferior/anti-national, scavenging upon progressive ideas (rather than rejecting them) and distorting them, and sustaining and defending a militarized masculinist approach to policy and delegitimizing challenges to it. This article, thus, contributes to the literature on how masculinity, misogyny, and gender norms more broadly intersect with political legitimacy, by arguing for understanding the analytic centrality of misogyny to the exercise of political power in multiple global projects.","[{""name"": ""Nitasha Kaul"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Westminster, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-856x.2007.00282.x"", ""10.1057/9780230339545"", ""10.1080/18902138.2014.908627"", ""10.1080/13530190802525130"", ""10.1080/19448953.2017.1328887"", ""10.1111/1467-8322.12563"", ""10.1080/14680777.2018.1447395"", ""10.1017/S026021051900024X"", ""10.1080/00224545.1963.9919467"", ""10.1080/00263200802285187"", ""10.1177/1350506816679003"", ""10.1080/00263200802021616"", ""10.1515/9781400863235.227"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2020.1731280"", ""10.1007/s11205-014-0758-8"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t89279"", ""10.1177/0959-353506060821"", ""10.1177/0146167297231005"", ""10.1007/s11186-019-09363-3"", ""10.9783/9780812200324"", ""10.1177/0306422019895720"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-72917-6_10"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2006.00139.x"", ""10.4135/9781473916029"", ""10.1086/rd.18.41917226"", ""10.1111/wusa.12318"", ""10.1057/s41305-018-0123-x"", ""10.18278/inpp.2.1.2"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2956405"", ""10.1215/15525864-3422611"", ""10.1126/science.aba9497"", ""10.1016/j.rhm.2016.11.002"", ""10.3998/mpub.10034322"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9798400656026"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-56611-5"", ""10.4324/9780429424861-5"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12167"", ""10.4000/ejas.12129"", ""10.2224/sbp.1976.4.1.57"", ""10.1002/polq.12737"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199324347.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199751457.013.0020"", ""10.1111/1471-0374.00043"", ""10.1177/0959353515605544"", ""10.1080/01436597.2018.1447371""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Nevertheless, vaccination rates have slowed nationwide and substantial segments of the population report an unwillingness to get vaccinated. We conducted an online survey experiment to investigate whether endorsement messages from various types of leaders can encourage the unvaccinated population to receive the vaccine. We surveyed 709 unvaccinated registered voters in South Dakota in April 2021 and presented them with identical messages endorsing vaccination from a political, religious, or medical leader. Our results show that messaging from a religious leader had a positive and statistically significant effect on interest in getting vaccinated, whereas messages from a political or medical leader had no statistically significant effect. These results strongly suggest that religious leaders are more effective messengers than other potential messengers and that public health officials would be well served to coordinate their efforts with leaders in faith communities.","[{""name"": ""Filip Viskupič"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David L.

10.1017/spq.2021.17,STATE POLITICS & POLICY QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,The Correlates of State Policy and the Structure of State Panel Data,"AbstractThe American states offer a wealth of variation across time and space to understand the sources, dynamics, and consequences of public policy. As laboratories of socioeconomic and political differences, they enable both wide-scale assessments of change and studies of specific policy choices. To leverage this potential, we constructed and integrated a database of thousands of state-year variables for designing and executing social research: the Correlates of State Policy Project (CSPP). The database offers one-stop shopping for accurate and reliable data, allows researchers to assess the generalizability of the relationships they uncover, enables assessment of causal inferences, and connects state politics researchers to larger research communities. We demonstrate CSPP’s use and breadth, as well as its limitations. Through an applied empirical approach familiar to the state politics literature, we show that researchers should remain attentive to regional variation in key variables and potential lack of within-state variation in independent and dependent variables of interest.

Contemporary clickbait headlines tend to use emotional partisan appeals, raising concerns about their impact on consumers of online news. This article reports the results of a pair of experiments with different sets of subject pools: one conducted using Facebook ads that explicitly target people with a high preference for clickbait, the other using a sample recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. We estimate subjects’ individual-level preference for clickbait, and randomly assign sets of subjects to read either clickbait or traditional headlines. Findings show that older people and non-Democrats have a higher “preference for clickbait,” but reading clickbait headlines does not drive affective polarization, information retention, or trust in media.","[{""name"": ""Kevin Munger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mario Luca"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Nagler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joshua Tucker"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/106591290605900201"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2015.11.001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226047447.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00410.x"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2014.11.010"", ""10.1126/science.1185231"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.10"", ""10.1126/science.aau2706"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aau4586"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-073034"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7spr6"", ""10.1017/XPS.2017.1"", ""10.1086/688223"", ""10.1080/10584609.2012.737435"", ""10.1093/poq/nfw001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12330"", ""10.1111/ajps.12357"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.19"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691165110.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139878425"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.794"", ""10.3386/w24781"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755509.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2012.06.003""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12651,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Strength in Numbers: How Women's Groups Close India's Political Gender Gap,"AbstractIn India, there persists a striking gender gap in political participation. Women's political participation is important both on normative grounds of inclusion and because when women participate, politics changes. I develop a theoretical model of women's political behavior, arguing that women's lack of political participation is the result of the structure of women's political networks in patriarchal societies. I then evaluate the effect of expanding women's networks by leveraging a natural experiment that created as‐if random variation in access to women‐only credit groups. Participation in these groups had a significant and substantial impact on women's political participation—women's attendance at public meetings doubled. I provide suggestive evidence of three mechanisms underlying this effect: (1) larger networks, (2) increased capacity for collective action within networks, and (3) development of civic skills. These findings contribute to our understanding of how networks affect political behavior and underlie gendered inequalities in political participation.","[{""name"": ""Soledad Artiz Prillaman"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University""]}]","[""10.1080/135457097338799"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-082912-110220"", ""10.2307/2082425"", ""10.4073/csr.2015.19"", ""10.1086/708645"", ""10.1086/711176"", ""10.4159/9780674029088"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00539.x"", ""10.1177/002071520204300310"", ""10.1177/0010414014548104"", ""10.1017/S0043887100012879"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00372.x"", ""10.3982/ECTA8121"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000458"", ""10.1002/pam.21790"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000226"", ""10.1515/9781400852697"", ""10.1111/rssa.12056"", ""10.7312/kris12570"", ""10.1017/9781108185899"", ""10.1177/106591290305600407"", ""10.1086/708955"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-8120"", ""10.1177/000312240907400402"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-7411"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226922836.001.0001""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Yet, a specific kind of endogeneity – spatial interdependence – is regularly ignored. We show that ignoring spatial interdependence in the outcome results in asymptotically biased estimates even when instruments are randomly assigned. The extent of this bias increases when the instrument is also spatially clustered, as is the case for many widely used instruments: rainfall, natural disasters, economic shocks, and regionally- or globally-weighted averages. Because the biases due to spatial interdependence and predictor endogeneity can offset, addressing only one can increase the bias relative to ordinary least squares. We demonstrate the extent of these biases both analytically and via Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we discuss a general estimation strategy – S-2SLS – that accounts for both outcome interdependence and predictor endogeneity, thereby recovering consistent estimates of predictor effects.","[{""name"": ""Timm Betz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Scott J.

To stop this flow of information, some governments restrict CSOs, for example by limiting their access to funding. Do such restrictions reduce international naming and shaming campaigns that rely on information from domestic CSOs? This article argues that on the one hand, restrictions may reduce CSOs’ ability and motives to monitor local abuses. On the other hand, these organizations may mobilize against restrictions and find new ways of delivering information on human rights violations to international publics. Using a cross-national dataset and in-depth evidence from Egypt, the study finds that low numbers of restrictions trigger shaming by international non-governmental organizations. Yet once governments impose multiple types of restrictions, it becomes harder for CSOs to adapt, resulting in fewer international shaming campaigns.","[{""name"": ""Hannah Smidt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominic Perera"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Neil J.

10.1017/pan.2021.19,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,0302 Political Science,Reducing Model Misspecification and Bias in the Estimation of Interactions,"AbstractAnalyzing variation in treatment effects across subsets of the population is an important way for social scientists to evaluate theoretical arguments. A common strategy in assessing such treatment effect heterogeneity is to include a multiplicative interaction term between the treatment and a hypothesized effect modifier in a regression model. Unfortunately, this approach can result in biased inferences due to unmodeled interactions between the effect modifier and other covariates, and including these interactions can lead to unstable estimates due to overfitting. In this paper, we explore the usefulness of machine learning algorithms for stabilizing these estimates and show how many off-the-shelf adaptive methods lead to two forms of bias: direct and indirect regularization bias. To overcome these issues, we use a post-double selection approach that utilizes several lasso estimators to select the interactions to include in the final model. We extend this approach to estimate uncertainty for both interaction and marginal effects. Simulation evidence shows that this approach has better performance than competing methods, even when the number of covariates is large. We show in two empirical examples that the choice of method leads to dramatically different conclusions about effect heterogeneity.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Blackwell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael P.

10.1146/annurev-polisci-052521-094617,ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Political Inequality in Rich Democracies,"In this review, we focus on political inequality in rich democracies. In the two main sections, we look at participation and representation, respectively. The former discusses whether rising income inequality and the weakening of trade unions have led to higher levels of inequality in participation. The latter looks at substantive and descriptive representation and asks how they might be linked. Research highlights that people with fewer individual resources participate much less than those with more resources, and collective organizations lose their ability to counter these trends. In terms of representation, the pattern is very similar. Not only are the opinions of decision-makers more congruent with those of the better off but policy choices also reflect their preferences more clearly. As the social distance between rulers and ruled increases, representative democracy gets more biased in favor of higher-status social groups.","[{""name"": ""Lea Elsässer"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science, Department of Social Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany;,""]}, {""name"": ""Armin Schäfer"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Science, Department of Social Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany;,""]}]","[""10.1017/S1537592719004626"", ""10.1017/S0022381608090130"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-023225"", ""10.1086/341329"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12482"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790471.003.0001"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.929341"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856x.2008.00336.x"", ""10.1177/0032329211420082"", ""10.1111/lsq.12286"", ""10.1177/0192512113498830"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804960"", ""10.1017/S0007123421000041"", ""10.1080/21565503.2020.1854792"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12791"", ""10.2307/2082425"", ""10.1002/polq.12577"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mcz"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000437"", ""10.1111/j.1939-9162.2011.00033.x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12112"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051921-102946"", ""10.1093/jeea/jvab047"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198733607.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0263395716674370"", ""10.1177/0010414020912282"", ""10.1017/S0043887119000224"", ""10.1017/S0003055422000867"", ""10.1017/S1537592721002188"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1801804"", ""10.1080/01402382.2022.2031443"", ""10.1017/S1537592715002315"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-020614-094706"", ""10.1177/1532673X11416920"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2011.06.001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2008.00589.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2009.11.002"", ""10.1080/00344893.2012.653238"", ""10.1093/poq/nfi058"", ""10.1017/S1049096509090441"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7s1jn"", ""10.1111/ecpo.12103"", ""10.1177/0958928714556970"", ""10.1017/S0007123400002209"", ""10.1177/0010414000033009001"", ""10.1177/1065912915572902"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.02.001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316163245.010"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12463"", ""10.1111/kykl.12003"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000272"", ""10.1017/gov.2020.27"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1487405"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx027"", ""10.1017/S000305542100109X"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.11.009"", ""10.1093/sf/sos187"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12314"", ""10.1111/ajps.12280"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00541.x"", ""10.1177/0032321720923257"", ""10.1017/S1537592703000045"", ""10.2307/2952255"", ""10.1111/j.1467-856x.2007.00246.x"", ""10.1093/ser/mwac040"", ""10.1086/714930"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09548-7"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102282"", ""10.1111/1468-2478.00225"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659935"", ""10.2307/2647821"", ""10.1017/S0003055422000739"", ""10.2307/1952717"", ""10.1057/9780230504592"", ""10.1177/0010414018784065"", ""10.1017/S000305542100037X"", ""10.1080/17457289.2012.747530"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102413"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12012"", ""10.1525/9780520340503"", ""10.1177/13540688211011924"", ""10.1177/0032321720906581"", ""10.1111/bjir.12045"", ""10.1177/0010414009358672"", ""10.2307/2669299"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674726215"", ""10.1080/13572334.2013.812363"", ""10.1017/S1755773919000043"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1638141"", ""10.1017/S1755773919000201"", ""10.1093/ser/mwz018"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12489"", ""10.1017/S1755773918000036"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12405"", ""10.1080/01402382.2021.1928830"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.12.006"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00298.x"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9106-0"", ""10.1017/S1049096508080505"", ""10.1111/polp.12067"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.06.006"", ""10.1007/s11109-020-09621-6"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12456"", ""10.1017/S1537592703000458"", ""10.1017/psrm.2016.32"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.123839"", ""10.1177/0003122411414817"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001666"", ""10.1515/9781400822782""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

It demonstrates that the multiple streams model provides a valuable conceptual tool for explaining how and why policies are, and are not, enacted. However, it finds that while problem streams and policy streams are useful heuristic devices, in practice they may overlap and be mutually constitutive. The case of MUP also highlights the potential for policy spillover between jurisdictions and different policy contexts, showing both limits to, and the complex nature of, these processes. It shows the need for high level political commitment in order to implement controversial policies, even when they are backed by strong supporting evidence. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of civil society actors not just in bringing policy issues onto the agenda, but in supporting governments in adopting measures to address them.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Hawkins"", ""affiliation"": [""London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Jim McCambridge"", ""affiliation"": [""University of York, UK""]}]",[],"['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/ropr.12383,REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Policy Adoption and Policy Intensity: Emergence of Climate Adaptation Planning in US States(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras Clave,"AbstractThe United States is experiencing growing impacts of climate change but currently receives a limited policy response from its national leadership. Within this policy void, many state governments are stepping up and taking action on adaptation planning. Yet we know little about why some states adopt State Adaptation Plans (SAPs), while others do not. This article investigates factors that predict the emergence of SAPs, both in terms of policy adoption and policy intensity (goal ambitiousness). Applying the diffusion of innovation theory, I consider the relative influence of internal state characteristics, regional pressures, and test for conditional effects between government ideologies and severity of the problem. The results show interesting differences between predictors that influence policy adoption and ambitiousness. States are more motivated to adopt a policy when faced with greater climate vulnerability, have more liberal citizenry, and where governments have crossed policy hurdles by previously passing mitigation plans. The intensity of policies and goal setting, moreover, is more likely to be driven by interest group politics and diffuse through policy learning or sharing information among neighboring states in Environmental Protection Agency regions. These findings support an emerging scholarship that uses more complex dependent variables in policy analysis. These variables have the potential to differentiate symbolic from substantive policies and capture finer information about predictors of importance.","[{""name"": ""Saatvika Rai"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Toledo""]}]","[""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.02.006"", ""10.1080/01944360008976081"", ""10.2307/1963526"", ""10.1215/9780822389507-010"", ""10.1017/S0143814X15000045"", ""10.1111/1468-2508.t01-2-00003"", ""10.1177/153244001001000201"", ""10.2307/2991759"", ""10.1007/s11027-012-9423-1"", ""10.1177/153244000900900205"", ""10.1186/1476-072X-7-64"", ""10.1111/ropr.12189"", ""10.1177/1532440019842175"", ""10.1017/S0143814X18000375"", ""10.1007/s10584-012-0403-y"", ""10.1007/s10584-013-1018-7"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2007.02.028"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00471.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X15000379"", ""10.1177/1532673X04273416"", ""10.1177/1532673X9202000408"", ""10.1007/s11625-007-0032-y"", ""10.2307/2131581"", ""10.2307/1956539"", ""10.1177/1532673X04263801"", ""10.1080/01944363.2014.949590"", ""10.1080/09644010802055576"", ""10.1017/S1537592714000784"", ""10.3998/mpub.206839"", ""10.1111/ropr.12308"", ""10.1111/ropr.12173"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00510.x"", ""10.1068/c09185"", ""10.1177/153244000500500405"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2008.00360.x"", ""10.1080/09644016.2014.923639"", ""10.1007/s11027-011-9301-2"", ""10.2307/2648004"", ""10.2307/2111646"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00284.x"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2005.11.014"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.020"", ""10.1007/s11027-010-9270-x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00314.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1994.tb02178.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00265.x"", ""10.1177/1078087410392348"", ""10.1080/01944363.2015.1074526"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00218.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02610.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2008.00571.x"", ""10.1080/09640560903399772"", ""10.1080/135017697344064"", ""10.2307/1954434"", ""10.1177/1078087412469348"", ""10.1080/01944360802377973"", ""10.1038/nclimate3012"", ""10.1080/09644016.2016.1244968"", ""10.1068/c2g"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2010.12.004""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The divergent links from national attachment, pride, and chauvinism to social and political trust","AbstractIs it true that national identity increases trust, as liberal nationalists assume? Recent research has studied this side of the ‘national identity argument’ by focusing on conceptions of the content of national identity (often civic or ethnic) and their links to social, rather than political, trust. This paper argues that if we take social identity theory seriously, however, we need to complement this picture by asking how varying the strength – rather than the content – of a person’s sense of their national identity affects both their social and political trust. We break down the different dimensions of national identity, hypothesizing and empirically verifying that there are divergent links from national attachment, national pride, and national chauvinism to social and political trust. We do so with data from the US (General Social Survey) and the Netherlands (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences ), thus expanding current knowledge of national identity and trust to a highly relevant yet neglected European case.","[{""name"": ""Gina Gustavsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ludvig Stendahl"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/gov.2016.18"", ""10.1146/annurev.ps.36.020185.001251"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(01)00084-6"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2016.1197772"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00395.x"", ""10.1017/S1755773910000330"", ""10.1111/pops.12294"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198795452.003.0006"", ""10.1017/S1755773916000266"", ""10.1177/1468796819843542"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.75"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198842545.003.0004"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00237.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02312.x"", ""10.1177/0020715218805793"", ""10.1002/ejsp.256"", ""10.1002/ejsp.298"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.2007.00244.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198842545.003.0003"", ""10.1002/ejsp.852"", ""10.1093/ijpor/eds007"", ""10.1515/9781400820849"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.1044"", ""10.1177/0010414016628269"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060606.135412"", ""10.1080/15705854.2010.524403"", ""10.1017/ssh.2016.5"", ""10.1002/1099-0992(200011/12)30:6<745::AID-EJSP24>3.0.CO;2-O"", ""10.1177/0146167217704196"", ""10.1017/S0008423910000089"", ""10.1093/0199284660.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2019.1656886"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00609"", ""10.1017/S0043887112000032"", ""10.2307/1959140"", ""10.4159/9780674984776"", ""10.1080/00224540209603936"", ""10.1177/0010414012453033"", ""10.1017/S1755773911000051"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-7988-9_36"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1177/0010414002035005003"", ""10.1080/13510347.2016.1248416"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750717"", ""10.1111/0022-4537.00126"", ""10.1348/014466605X52245"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00885.x"", ""10.1017/S1755773913000088"", ""10.1177/0003122411420817"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1080/1369183X.2013.815428"", ""10.1111/nana.12505"", ""10.1086/693987""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/gove.12479,GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Modes of regulatory governance: A political economy perspective,"AbstractThis article introduces the special issue by presenting a framework for the study of regulatory politics using the analytical tools and approaches of comparative political economy. Having traced the evolution of studies on regulation, it argues that scholars should pay more attention to the systemic features affecting regulation and to the relationship between regulatory policies and their outcomes. The article presents the foundations of an analytical framework based on the “regulatory policy process,” a comprehensive approach that links inputs, outputs, and outcomes. The review of the contributions to this special issue shows that regulatory regimes can be better understood by placing them within the broader political economy of a state or region. A renewed focus on regulatory outcomes can help foresee what one should expect from the impact of a certain regulatory regime on a political‐economic system.","[{""name"": ""Mattia Guidi"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Siena""]}, {""name"": ""Igor Guardiancich"", ""affiliation"": [""Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies""]}, {""name"": ""David Levi‐Faur"", ""affiliation"": [""Hebrew University of Jerusalem""]}]","[""10.1177/0002716216688272"", ""10.4324/9780203097571"", ""10.1017/9781139088381"", ""10.1016/0304-3932(83)90051-X"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2006.00324.x"", ""10.1111/gove.12089"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2008.00034.x"", ""10.1007/s10734-012-9584-6"", ""10.7591/9780801465666"", ""10.1111/gove.12408"", ""10.2307/2111064"", ""10.4337/9781845428006"", ""10.1111/gove.12413"", ""10.1086/466643"", ""10.1017/S0007123405000281"", ""10.1007/BF00242147"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810404"", ""10.1080/1350176022000046409"", ""10.1002/j.1662-6370.2005.tb00374.x"", ""10.4337/9781848441361"", ""10.1111/rego.12080"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58814-2"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1310278"", ""10.1017/S0007123409000672"", ""10.1093/0199247757.003.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206483.001.0001"", ""10.1111/rego.12189"", ""10.1177/0010414011407466"", ""10.1111/rego.12094"", ""10.1111/gove.12442"", ""10.1086/260580"", ""10.1111/0022-1082.00115"", ""10.1086/250042"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2006.00322.x"", ""10.4337/9780857936110.00010"", ""10.1177/095207670201700204"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2007.00023.x"", ""10.1080/01402389408425031"", ""10.4324/9780203439197"", ""10.1177/1465116501002001005"", ""10.1111/rego.12254"", ""10.1111/gove.12473"", ""10.1080/09692290.2015.1104375"", ""10.1111/rego.12181"", ""10.1017/S0043887109990098"", ""10.1086/466865"", ""10.1111/rego.12039"", ""10.2307/1885679"", ""10.1111/gove.12411"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx029"", ""10.4337/9781788113755"", ""10.1177/0951692891003003001"", ""10.1111/rego.12174"", ""10.2307/3003160"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206483.003.0005"", ""10.1515/9781400831456"", ""10.1017/S0143814X14000245"", ""10.1111/gove.12437"", ""10.4324/9780429494284"", ""10.1086/261181"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511628283.006"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.790273""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Critical events like coronavirus disease are potentially powerful destabilizers that can trigger discontinuity in policy trajectories and thus are an opportunity for accentuating path shifts. In this paper, we argue that three dynamic pathways of change are possible and must be considered when analysing post-COVID policymaking: normalization, adaptation, and acceleration. These different pathways need to be explored in order to understand the mid- and long-term policy effects of the pandemic. This introduction contextualizes the articles in this special issue, situating them broadly within two broad categories: (a) assessment of how the coronavirus disease pandemic should be understood as a crisis event, and its role in relationship to mechanisms of policy change; and (b) mapping the future contours of the pandemic’s impact on substantive policy areas, including education, health care, public finance, social protection, population ageing, the future of work, and violence against women.","[{""name"": ""Giliberto Capano"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political and Social Sciences , University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Howlett"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, Simon Fraser University , Burnaby, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Darryl S L Jarvis"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Public Policy, Hamad Bin Khalifa University , Doha, Qatar""]}, {""name"": ""M Ramesh"", ""affiliation"": [""Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy , National University of Singapore, Singapore""]}]","[""10.2307/2234208"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-76672-0"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139087230"", ""10.1002/rhc3.12193"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72680-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63254-4_2"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.8484"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1783790"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1787628"", ""10.1007/s11077-016-9273-x"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.441"", ""10.1080/1350176032000085388"", ""10.1080/14662040500054198"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00455.x"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.11.031"", ""10.2307/422246"", ""10.1017/S0008423906060203"", ""10.1057/9781137434043"", ""10.5553/Bk/092733872021030003002"", ""10.1057/9781137314154_2"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1998.tb01913.x"", ""10.1111/j.0033-3298.2005.00462.x"", ""10.1023/A:1010357309367"", ""10.2307/973677"", ""10.1086/643151"", ""10.1023/A:1007113830879"", ""10.1080/25741292.2020.1824379"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12893"", ""10.1080/13501763.2021.1942518"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1787627"", ""10.1016/j.puhe.2020.05.006"", ""10.1503/cmaj.200834"", ""10.1017/S0898588X00001012"", ""10.1177/0010414096029002001"", ""10.2307/2586011"", ""10.1007/BF00136406"", ""10.1177/0149206320929088"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1132752"", ""10.1177/0010414012463902"", ""10.1080/10361146.2017.1409335"", ""10.1007/s11077-020-09381-4"", ""10.1017/S0143814X09001007"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2015.09.001""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiz228,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,Is Australia's Indo-Pacific strategy an illusion?,"Abstract Australia has been among the most prominent advocates of the increasingly popular Indo-Pacific concept. This article argues that Canberra's enthusiasm for the concept stems from its appeal to the two dominant traditions of Australian foreign policy—a ‘dependent ally’ tradition and a ‘middle power’ approach. While these two traditions are typically seen as being in tension, the Indo-Pacific concept provides a rare point of convergence between them. The article begins by outlining the appeal of the Indo-Pacific concept to each of these traditions. Using a case-study of recent Australian policy toward the South China Sea disputes, however, the article then demonstrates that Australia has in practice implemented its stated Indo-Pacific strategy far less consistently than its very vocal support would appear to suggest. This disjuncture is attributed to the growing influence of a third, generally understudied, ‘pragmatic’ Australian foreign policy tradition. Because Australia has been such a prominent champion of the Indo-Pacific concept, the article concludes that this divergence between the rhetoric and the reality of Australia's Indo-Pacific strategy threatens to have a negative impact on the concept's broader international appeal and sustainability, particularly among Australia's south-east Asian neighbours.","[{""name"": ""Brendan Taylor"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Demography', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"
10.1111/ajps.12758,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,"How Patronage Delivers: Political Appointments, Bureaucratic Accountability, and Service Delivery in Brazil","AbstractThe political appointment of bureaucrats is typically seen as jeopardizing development by selecting worse types into the bureaucracy or by depressing bureaucratic effort. I argue that political appointments also affect outcomes through a third, less studied channel, namely, by changing how bureaucrats work. Patronage provides connections between bureaucrats and politicians, and thereby grants access to material and nonmaterial resources, enhances monitoring, facilitates the application of sanctions and rewards, aligns priorities and incentives, and increases mutual trust. Political appointments can thus enhance bureaucrats’ accountability and effectiveness, not just for rent‐seeking purposes but also, in certain conditions, for public service delivery. I test this theory using data on Brazilian municipal governments, leveraging two quasi‐experiments, two original surveys of bureaucrats and politicians, and in‐depth interviews. The findings highlight the countervailing effects of connections on bureaucratic governance in the developing world.","[{""name"": ""Guillermo Toral"", ""affiliation"": [""IE University""]}]","[""10.1257/aer.20171867"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.06.014"", ""10.1086/699209"", ""10.1111/ajps.12023"", ""10.1257/pol.5.4.29"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.235"", ""10.1086/694101"", ""10.1002/job.1866"", ""10.1111/ecoj.12267"", ""10.1086/715064"", ""10.1111/ajps.12495"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000433"", ""10.1093/ectj/utz022"", ""10.1162/rest_a_00760"", ""10.1257/aer.20181491"", ""10.1017/9781316822869"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000477"", ""10.1515/9781400821723"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy051"", ""10.1086/228311"", ""10.1257/app.20150076"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065185"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000502"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1257/aer.20190830"", ""10.1111/ajps.12394"", ""10.1257/aer.20180277"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000575"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199599370.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.569"", ""10.1111/j.1467-937X.2009.00536.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-042009-121225"", ""10.2307/1288305"", ""10.1017/9781316998014"", ""10.2307/1953254"", ""10.1017/9781009082525"", ""10.4324/9780203799857"", ""10.1177/000271623718900106"", ""10.1017/S0003055422000181"", ""10.2307/1955076"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511800115"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000351"", ""10.1086/258501"", ""10.1257/aer.20171339""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S1537592721001043,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,How Non-Majoritarian Institutions Make Silent Majorities Vocal: A Political Explanation of Authoritarian Populism,"Why did we witness such a strong growth of anti-liberal forces twenty-five years after the triumph of liberalism? The answer is twofold. First, authoritarian populism has not sneaked into a given political space but is co-constitutive of a new cleavage in most modern societies. Authoritarian populists speak to the issues of this cleavage. Second, the rise of this new cleavage and authoritarian populists cannot be reduced to one of the two well-known explanations, namely the economic insecurity perspective and cultural backlash perspective. This current paper develops a political explanation that integrates struggles over policies with a focus on endogenous dynamics of political institutions in and beyond democracies. In this account, it is the historical compromise between labor and capital that has triggered a dynamic in which the rise of so-called non-majoritarian institutions (NMIs)—such as central banks, constitutional courts, and international organizations (IOs)—have locked in liberal policies in most consolidated democracies. This explanation brings together the party cartelization thesis with the observation that NMIs are a major target of contemporary populism. The explanatory model is probed by translating it into descriptive propositions and by showing step by step how the sequence unfolded in electoral democracies.","[{""name"": ""Michael Zürn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0049124112437709"", ""10.1177/004839319702700402"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2008.07.007"", ""10.1177/1465116517723499"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.1965.tb00362.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198766988.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615955"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000234"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198841395.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001595"", ""10.1017/S0020818321000163"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.887879"", ""10.1017/9781108652698"", ""10.1080/00344893.2012.653238"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780192802811.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000314"", ""10.1017/S0020818320000636"", ""10.1017/9781108671019"", ""10.1017/S0020818300028459"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000298"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198819974.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674984776"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139169219"", ""10.1007/s12286-016-0298-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812255"", ""10.2307/1342286"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090018"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1225785"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139152365"", ""10.1177/001041407701000105"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.1007/s11127-019-00713-4"", ""10.4159/9780674969797"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755835"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199228317.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000538"", ""10.17813/maiq.4.2.d7593370607l6756"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1017/S0003055402000278"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1619188"", ""10.1017/S1537592717000111"", ""10.1017/S0007123400000181"", ""10.1177/0094306116671947"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1242046"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051890"", ""10.1177/1354068812462931"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511973383"", ""10.1177/1369148120947356"", ""10.4159/9780674919808"", ""10.1177/0048393103262552"", ""10.1111/rego.12189"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00331.x"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1002/poi3.197,POLICY AND INTERNET,0302 Political Science; 0503 Journalism and Communication,"Expressing and Challenging Racist Discourse on Facebook: How Social Media Weaken the ""Spiral of Silence"" Theory","This article examines the discursive practices of Facebook users who use the platform to express racist views. We analyzed 51,991 public comments posted to 119 news stories about race, racism, or ethnicity on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Facebook page. We examined whether users who hold racist viewpoints (the vocal minority) are less likely to express views that go against the majority view for fear of social isolation. According to the “spiral of silence” theory, the vocal minority would presumably fear this isolation effect. However, our analysis shows that on Facebook, a predominantly nonanonymous and moderated platform, the vocal minority are comfortable expressing unpopular views, questioning the explanatory power of this popular theory in the online context. Based on automated analysis of 8,636 comments, we found 64 percent mentioned race or ethnicity, and 18 percent exhibited some form of othering. A manual coding of 1,161 comments showed that 18 percent exhibited some form of othering, and 25 percent countered the racist discourse. In sum, while Facebook provides space to express racist discourse, users also turn to this platform to counter the hateful narratives.","[{""name"": ""Irfan Chaudhry"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anatoliy Gruzd"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01419870120049806"", ""10.1111/0022-4537.00126"", ""10.5210/fm.v20i2.5450"", ""10.1177/1461444817707759"", ""10.1080/01419870.2016.1171370"", ""10.1177/1461444815606779"", ""10.1177/0894439313504261"", ""10.1089/cyber.2014.0443"", ""10.1177/0093650215616456"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3158771"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.10.008"", ""10.1080/17512786.2014.899758"", ""10.1177/107769909106800114"", ""10.1080/01292986.2014.885536"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1293130"", ""10.1177/0093650210362685"", ""10.1093/ijpor/15.4.454"", ""10.1177/107769900107800102"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1974.tb00367.x"", ""10.1080/23808985.1991.11678790"", ""10.1177/0002764215588816"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10288.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.11.011"", ""10.1145/2464464.2464475"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2014.940365"", ""10.1080/17512786.2013.813194"", ""10.1093/ijpor/eds022"", ""10.2307/j.ctv17vf66d"", ""10.1177/1461444817712516"", ""10.5210/fm.v19i12.5570"", ""10.1093/bjc/azv059"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01533.x"", ""10.1177/1461444815625942""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Communication', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

This paper utilises an integrated decomposition and econometric framework to reveal the influence mechanism and convergence evolution of carbon emission intensity (CEI) across 29 OECD countries in the period 1992–2018. The country‐level low‐carbon transition efforts are then investigated. The results imply that: (1) The reduction in CEI is primarily attributed to the changes in economic development and energy intensity. The carbon emission coefficient effect also negatively influences CEI. The impact of energy consumption per capita, however, is negligible. (2) According to econometric analysis, energy intensity, energy mix, carbon emissions per capita and energy use per capita have positive impacts on CEI. Specially, GDP per capita shows an inverted U‐shaped curve relationship with CEI. (3) There is evidence of convergence in CEI across developed countries. Energy intensity plays a crucial role in accelerating the CEI convergence process, implying a half‐life of 3 years. (4) Fifteen European countries have made strong low‐carbon transition efforts among all countries. Denmark has made the largest efforts, South Korea the least. This study provides important implications for low‐carbon economy transition.","[{""name"": ""Bolin Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Economics and Management Wuhan University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Debin Fang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Economics and Management Wuhan University  Wuhan China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Wuhan University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew N.

Why do some bureaucrats engage in voice and guerrilla sabotage to thwart policies against the public interest under “unprincipled principals,” yet others do not? Despite its centrality in contemporary governance, this conundrum has not seen quantitative research. We address this gap with survey evidence from 1,700 Brazilian public servants during the Temer Presidency, widely perceived to lack democratic legitimacy and integrity. We focus on one key explanator: public service motivation (PSM). We argue that bureaucrats with greater PSM are more likely to engage in voice and sabotage of “unprincipled policies,” and exit to avoid implementing “unprincipled policies.” Structural equation models support these hypotheses. Public service-motivated bureaucracies are thus short-run stalwarts against “unprincipled” political principals. Over time, they look to depart, however, leaving “unprincipled” principals a freer hand to pursue policies against the public interest.","[{""name"": ""Christian Schuster"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Kim Sass Mikkelsen"", ""affiliation"": [""Roskilde University, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Izabela Correa"", ""affiliation"": [""Insper—Institute of Education and Research, Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Jan-Hinrik Meyer-Sahling"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Nottingham, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02621.x"", ""10.3998/mpub.15149"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024390"", ""10.1177/0275074008317248"", ""10.1177/0275074015626299"", ""10.1177/0734371X11408701"", ""10.1177/0091026015603206"", ""10.1287/orsc.1080.0405"", ""10.1002/job.543"", ""10.1111/puar.12480"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu020"", ""10.1080/10967490903547225"", ""10.1111/puar.12216"", ""10.1111/puar.13118"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2818659"", ""10.1111/puar.13008"", ""10.1177/0275074017699470"", ""10.1177/0095399707300703"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq048"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus027"", ""10.1177/0275074014535241"", ""10.1093/0199266999.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.2.326"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus057"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy071"", ""10.1037/a0020744"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur024"", ""10.1177/0734371X08319153"", ""10.1787/9789264082229-en"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.02104.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy058"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02199.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024303"", ""10.1017/9781108915236"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199234035.001.0001"", ""10.1111/puar.12505"", ""10.18637/jss.v048.i02"", ""10.1111/padm.12158"", ""10.1177/0149206313475816"", ""10.1080/14719030701726697"", ""10.1111/padm.12248""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0043887121000046,WORLD POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Economic Risk within the Household and Voting for the Radical Right,"ABSTRACTThis article investigates how unemployment risk within households affects voting for the radical right. The authors contribute to recent advances in the literature that have highlighted the role of economic threat for understanding the support of radical-right parties. In contrast to existing work, the authors do not treat voters as atomistic individuals; they instead investigate households as a crucial site of preference formation. Combining largescale labor market data with comparative survey data, they confirm the expectations of their theoretical framework by demonstrating that the effect of occupational unemployment risk on radical-right support is strongly conditioned by household-risk constellations. Voting for the radical right is a function not only of a voter’s own risk, but also of his or her partner’s risk. The article provides additional evidence on the extent to which these effects are gendered and on the mechanisms that link household risk and party choice. The results imply that much of the existing literature on individual risk exposure potentially underestimates its effect on political behavior due to the neglect of multiplier effects within households.","[{""name"": ""Tarik Abou-Chadi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Kurer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0010414017720707"", ""10.1177/0010414017720705"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grj022"", ""10.1057/9780230504592"", ""10.1177/0958928709358789"", ""10.1257/jep.10.4.139"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2017.09.014"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071811-145434"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1093/sp/jxs005"", ""10.1111/ajps.12358"", ""10.1111/j.1741-3737.2006.00234.x"", ""10.1086/686972"", ""10.4159/9780674020665"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-110713"", ""10.1111/jomf.12619"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12318"", ""10.1057/s42214-018-0001-4"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00166.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.299"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1177/000169939203500404"", ""10.1177/0003122418773775"", ""10.2307/2657461"", ""10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00032-6"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.64"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.887879"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.48"", ""10.1177/0010414006294168"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu026"", ""10.1177/0010414008330595"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(02)00047-1"", ""10.1111/ajps.12406"", ""10.1177/0010414098031004004"", ""10.2307/1914185"", ""10.1080/01402382.2017.1334138"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316257777"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400079"", ""10.1093/epolic/eiy017"", ""10.1257/jep.33.4.152"", ""10.2307/2937956"", ""10.1086/693908"", ""10.2307/800135"", ""10.7910/DVN/IVKRZY"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12319"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2014.01.006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615955"", ""10.1086/260265"", ""10.1017/S0043887121000046"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.20"", ""10.1177/0010414020912283"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00094.x"", ""10.1086/229786"", ""10.1177/0038038584018004003"", ""10.1017/S0003055400400067"", ""10.1111/ajps.12270"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Dominant party leaders are constrained in their ability to frequently reshuffle ministers by the need to maintain credible power-sharing commitments with party elites. These constraints also produce distinct temporal patterns of instability where large reshuffles occur following elections. Conversely, personalist leaders face fewer power-sharing constraints and engage in more extensive cabinet reshuffles at more arbitrary intervals. Military leaders face complex constraints that depend on whether officers or civilians occupy cabinet posts and the extent to which leaders are dependent upon civilian ministers for regime performance and popular support. Empirical analyses using data on the cabinets of ninety-four authoritarian leaders from thirty-seven African countries between 1976 and 2010 support the theoretical expectations for dominant party and personalist leaders, but are inconclusive for military leaders.","[{""name"": ""Alex M.

Evidence from Randomized Survey Experiments,"Why have decades of high and rising inequality in the United States not increased public support for redistribution? An established theory in political science holds that Americans’ distrust of government decreases their support for redistribution, but empirical support draws primarily on regression analyses of national surveys. I discuss the untestable assumptions required for identification with regression modeling and propose an alternative design that uses randomized experiments about political corruption to identify the effect of trust in government on support for redistribution under weaker assumptions. I apply this to three survey experiments and estimate the effects that large, experimentally induced increases in political trust have on support for redistribution. Contrary to theoretical predictions, estimated effects are substantively negligible, statistically indistinguishable from zero, and comparable to estimates from two placebo experiments. I discuss implications for theory building about causes of support for redistribution in an era of rising inequality and eroding confidence in government.","[{""name"": ""KYLE PEYTON"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/686690"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000478"", ""10.1093/qje/qjx043"", ""10.1080/17457289.2018.1465061"", ""10.1086/696991"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000850"", ""10.2307/1959140"", ""10.1257/aer.20130360"", ""10.1086/694785"", ""10.1097/01.ede.0000222409.00878.37"", ""10.1561/100.00017094"", ""10.1561/100.00016112"", ""10.1093/wber/lhr018"", ""10.1017/S0007123400004518"", ""10.1086/678766"", ""10.1023/B:POBE.0000043456.87303.3a"", ""10.1214/18-AOS1709"", ""10.1353/eca.2016.0000"", ""10.1177/2053168017714185"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080210"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2005.00148.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00477.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000327"", ""10.1080/10361146.2014.979759"", ""10.1093/pan/mpl013"", ""10.1177/1948550617697177"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(01)00186-4"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226293660.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12185"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00007"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.2307/2586304"", ""10.2307/3088375"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.2307/1959141"", ""10.1111/ajps.12102"", ""10.4337/9781782545118.00023"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613722"", ""10.1017/S0022381608080468"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.475"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1080/07388940500339183""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Testing a Theory of Partisan Alignment in Africa,"Judicial power is central to democratic consolidation and the rule of law. Public support is critical for establishing and protecting it. Conventional wisdom holds that this support is rooted in apolitical factors and not dependent on who is in political power. By contrast, we argue that support may be driven by instrumental partisan motivations and therefore linked to partisan alignment with the executive. We test the argument with survey evidence from 34 African countries. To provide causal evidence, we conduct difference-in-differences analyses leveraging Ghana’s three presidential transitions since 2000. Across Africa, support for judicial power is high, while trust in courts is lower. However, presidential co-partisans arelesssupportive of horizontal judicial power over the president andmoresupportive of vertical power over the people. The article demonstrates the importance of partisan alignment with the executive in shaping support for judicial power, with implications for judicial behavior and legitimacy.","[{""name"": ""BRANDON L.

10.17645/pag.v8i3.2915,POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE,0302 Political Science,Disentangling How Populism and Radical Host Ideologies Shape Citizens' Conceptions of Democratic Decision-Making,"In this article, we aim to disentangle the extent to which citizens’ conceptions of democratic decision-making are shaped by populist attitudes or rather by radical left and right host ideologies. Following recent work by Landwehr and Steiner (2017), we distinguish four modes of decision-making embedded in different conceptions of democracy: trusteeship democracy, anti-pluralism, deliberative proceduralism, and majoritarianism. Drawing on data from Austria and Germany, we show that populism and radical host ideologies tap into different dimensions of democracy. While populism is primarily directed against representative forms of democratic decision-making, preferences for deliberative procedures and majority decisions appear entirely shaped by radical left and right host ideologies. Populism thus views decision-making based on the general will of the people as the only legitimate democratic procedure, whereas radical left and right host ideologies aim at involving the relevant group(s) of citizens. Further analyses of the interactions between populist attitudes and radical host ideologies confirm that the effects of populism remain robust and thus independent of the specific manifestations of radical host ideologies. These findings help to disentangle the causes of democratic discontent and to develop possible responses through democratic reforms that specifically and separately aim to mitigate populism and radical host ideologies.","[{""name"": ""Reinhard Heinisch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carsten Wegscheider"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00657.x"", ""10.1177/0010414013512600"", ""10.1177/1354068808097890"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.29"", ""10.1080/01402380903065256"", ""10.1177/0894439317697949"", ""10.1177/1065912907304108"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1177/1065912919833176"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199268436.001.0001"", ""10.1111/pops.12022"", ""10.1111/spsr.12218"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12191"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0020"", ""10.1177/0032321716672224"", ""10.4324/9781315196923"", ""10.1080/01402380312331280608"", ""10.1080/00344893.2019.1635196"", ""10.1177/1465116518770812"", ""10.1017/S0003055401000107"", ""10.1007/s12286-016-0302-0"", ""10.17645/pag.v5i4.919"", ""10.5771/9783845271491-329"", ""10.1080/01402382.2014.887879"", ""10.1177/0032321717715398"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.818354"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00015"", ""10.1353/sais.2007.0013"", ""10.1177/1369148117701753"", ""10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110052"", ""10.1177/1354068819868908"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1017/S0003055410000298"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198837886.001.0001"", ""10.1353/jod.0.0154"", ""10.1017/gov.2013.30"", ""10.1017/S1755773917000145"", ""10.1177/1354068815596514"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12038"", ""10.1017/S1755773919000262"", ""10.1017/S1755773911000282"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131752"", ""10.1177/1354068896002003001"", ""10.1007/s41358-017-0104-1"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.11.003"", ""10.1080/13569310701822289"", ""10.1080/13569317.2014.909266"", ""10.1007/s11615-018-0083-y"", ""10.1177/0032321715607511"", ""10.1080/1356931042000263528"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.00080"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070753"", ""10.1057/9781137414113"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12021"", ""10.1017/S0003055419000807""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1093/ips/olz018,INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0303 Sociology,"Decentering the Self, Seeing Like the Other: Toward a Postcolonial Approach to Ontological Security","AbstractThis article advances a critical outlook on dominant interpretations of ontological security in international relations. It suggests that the preoccupation with state- and identity-centric analyses diminishes the value of the Other to an archetype of ontological insecurity and a source of ontological insecurity for the Self. It argues that seeing ontological security from the postcolonial perspective expands the self-referential understanding of ontological security to a Self-Other relation of mutual coexistence. To do so, the article proposes a framework that loosely intersects Giddens’ work on late modernity with postcolonial notions of interstitiality and hybridity. Postcolonial ontological security foregrounds the emergence of a “third hybrid Other” from an ontologically insecure status through three interrelated conditions of reflexivity, resourcefulness, and resistance. It aims to shed light on creative, nondestructive ways of confronting ontological insecurity and to encourage a view of the postcolonial Other as a learning source for the Self. These arguments are illustrated with the case of Okinawan “Otherness” vis-à-vis the US and Japanese selves, with particular attention to antimilitary base movements.","[{""name"": ""Carmina Yu Untalan"", ""affiliation"": [""Osaka University""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1521-9488.2004.00448.x"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1378084"", ""10.1017/S0260210506007054"", ""10.1177/03058298070350031501"", ""10.1080/09557570903433639"", ""10.1111/fpa.12028"", ""10.1177/0010836716653161"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1391670"", ""10.1111/pops.12334"", ""10.1080/13523260.2012.693776"", ""10.2307/2600810"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0104-2"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000219"", ""10.1017/S0260210518000347"", ""10.1515/9781474468312"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0108-y"", ""10.1177/0010836715610594"", ""10.1177/1354066113518356"", ""10.1177/1354066198004002004"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1378081"", ""10.1093/ips/olx018"", ""10.4324/9780203112250"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00396.x"", ""10.1177/0304375412452050"", ""10.1177/0010836716653162"", ""10.1080/09662831003758107"", ""10.1068/d13808"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000222"", ""10.1177/1354066106067346"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.458"", ""10.1111/ips.12103"", ""10.1057/jird.2013.22"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816665051.003.0009"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1378062"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816665051.001.0001"", ""10.1057/s41268-017-0089-x"", ""10.4324/9780203018200"", ""10.1215/9780822373612"", ""10.1177/0305829817741255"", ""10.1353/nlh.2012.0009"", ""10.1177/0304375413512098"", ""10.1177/0047117809359040"", ""10.1177/0010836716653158""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000211,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Continuity or Change? (In)direct Rule in British and French Colonial Africa,"AbstractCurrent political order in Africa is often linked to legacies of colonialism, in particular to legacies of indirect colonial rule. However, evidence about the application of indirect rule is scarce. In this paper I argue that empire-level characteristics interacted with precolonial institutions in shaping the indirectness of local rule. First, British governments ruled more indirectly than French administrations, which followed a comparatively centralized administrative blueprint, came with a transformative republican ideology, and had more administrative resources. Empirically, I find that French colonization led to the demise of the lines of succession of seven out of ten precolonial polities, twice as many as under British rule. Second, precolonial centralization was a crucial prerequisite for indirect rule. Local administrative data from eight British colonies show that British colonizers employed less administrative effort and devolved more power to native authorities where centralized institutions existed. Such a pattern did not exist in French colonies. Together, these findings improve our understanding of the long-term effects of precolonial institutions and draw attention to the interaction of characteristics of dominant and subordinate units in shaping local governance arrangements.","[{""name"": ""Carl Müller-Crepon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0020818319000134"", ""10.1111/ajps.12236"", ""10.1257/aer.101.7.3221"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.07.028"", ""10.2307/1159747"", ""10.3386/w20092"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000567"", ""10.1017/S0043887111000104"", ""10.1177/001041402237944"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00218"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139084161"", ""10.2307/422366"", ""10.1017/psrm.2014.37"", ""10.1017/S0010417500001304"", ""10.1177/0022343316640595"", ""10.2307/634762"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097197"", ""10.1017/S0022278X00025131"", ""10.1086/499510"", ""10.1017/S0022050714000576"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000126"", ""10.1002/jid.1510"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1903565"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2679594"", ""10.5129/001041514810943036"", ""10.1086/694540"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615597"", ""10.1086/385556"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316422335"", ""10.1017/S0026749X00009033"", ""10.1086/674988"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00023"", ""10.1177/1354066105050137"", ""10.1046/j.1466-822x.2002.00294.x"", ""10.1177/0002716214546989"", ""10.1093/jae/ejq030"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00540"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00550.x"", ""10.1007/s10887-007-9017-z"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226470702.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400830800"", ""10.1086/690305"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1bvnfk9"", ""10.3982/ECTA9613"", ""10.1017/S0043887119000030"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.05.017"", ""10.1111/ajps.12023""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s11558-021-09428-y,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS,0302 Political Science; 0201 Theoretical Economics,Clubs of autocrats: Regional organizations and authoritarian survival,"AbstractWhile scholars have argued that membership in Regional Organizations (ROs) can increase the likelihood of democratization, we see many autocratic regimes surviving in power albeit being members of several ROs. This article argues that this is the case because these regimes are often members in “Clubs of Autocrats” that supply material and ideational resources to strengthen domestic survival politics and shield members from external interference during moments of political turmoil. The argument is supported by survival analysis testing the effect of membership in autocratic ROs on regime survival between 1946 to 2010. It finds that membership in ROs composed of more autocratic member states does in fact raise the likelihood of regime survival by protecting incumbents against democratic challenges such as civil unrest or political dissent. However, autocratic RO membership does not help to prevent regime breakdown due to autocratic challenges like military coups, potentially because these types of threats are less likely to diffuse to other member states. The article thereby adds to our understanding of the limits of democratization and potential reverse effects of international cooperation, and contributes to the literature addressing interdependences of international and domestic politics in autocratic regimes.","[{""name"": ""Maria J.

10.1093/jopart/muz013,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Can Government Public Communications Elicit UndueTrust? Exploring the Interaction between Symbols and Substantive Information in Communications,"AbstractEffective public communications have been proposed as a remedy for citizens’ distrust in government. Recent studies pointed to the emotional effect of symbolic elements, entangled in government public communications (e.g., logos, images, and celebrities). Still, they did not examine the interaction between these symbols and the substantive information in communications about bureaucracies’ performance and policies. Exploring this interaction is important for understanding the theoretical mechanisms underlying the effect of symbolic communication on citizens’ trust. Also, it is essential to assess symbols’ potency to unduly compensate for unfavorable or logically unpersuasive information, and enable public organizations to escape justified public criticism. Building on the social psychology Elaboration Likelihood Model, I theorize that symbols may increase citizens’ trust by conducing citizens to pay less attention to logically unpersuasive information, and thus offsetting its negative effect. I test this indirect mechanism via a large survey experiment, focusing on the Israeli Environment Protection Ministry. The experimental results support the research hypotheses and suggest that the effect of symbolic elements is stronger when communications include logically unpersuasive information. I discuss the implications of these findings for democratic responsiveness and accountability.","[{""name"": ""Saar Alon-Barkat"", ""affiliation"": [""Leiden University""]}]","[""10.1093/jopart/mux013"", ""10.1111/puar.12406"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173"", ""10.1177/0146167290162013"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00284.x"", ""10.1111/gove.12161"", ""10.5040/9781472544629.ch-001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.752"", ""10.1111/padm.12520"", ""10.1111/puar.12685"", ""10.4324/9780203145159"", ""10.1080/1350176022000046409"", ""10.1111/puar.12047"", ""10.1177/0020852315585950"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus048"", ""10.1111/puar.12378"", ""10.1111/puar.12563"", ""10.1093/jopart/muy064"", ""10.1111/puar.12441"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus037"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.1037/a0020761"", ""10.1111/padm.12066"", ""10.1017/9781316676912.013"", ""10.1177/0275074015580390"", ""10.1093/jopart/muw049"", ""10.1111/puar.12501"", ""10.1108/EJM-12-2011-0776"", ""10.1016/S0363-8111(99)00031-4"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.475"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.1.27"", ""10.1111/gove.12194"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.996627"", ""10.1080/03637750701196896"", ""10.2307/j.ctv322v3xg"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux023"", ""10.1177/002224378602300102"", ""10.1007/978-1-4612-4964-1"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.34.5.874"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2016.04.006"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1473473"", ""10.5040/9781472544629"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60329-9"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux044"", ""10.1108/13563280510596925"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq092"", ""10.1093/jopart/muj018"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.1.5"", ""10.1521/soco.1987.5.1.76"", ""10.1080/15213260701837073""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Communication']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1093/publius/pjab017,PUBLIUS-THE JOURNAL OF FEDERALISM,0302 Political Science,"COVID-19 and Territorial Policy Dynamics in Western Europe: Comparing France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom","Abstract This article seeks to assess and explain territorial policy dynamics in five European countries—Italy, Spain, Germany, France and the United Kingdom—from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic up to early 2021. The crisis has clearly highlighted well-known differences between centralized and decentralized systems. Yet focusing on this dichotomy is not sufficient. It is suggested that, while the distribution of authority between central and regional governments matters, policy dynamics—that is, how different territorial levels interact in policy-making processes—are even more important in driving multi-level responses to the emergency. Whether these dynamics are hierarchical (France), competitive (Italy and Spain), cooperative (Germany) or mixed (the United Kingdom) depends on how pre-crisis institutional, sectoral and political “causal forces” moderate the impact of an exogenous shock.","[{""name"": ""Davide Vampa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.011"", ""10.1177/0969776417693884"", ""10.1080/09644008.2018.1538362"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1783790"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1787628"", ""10.1017/S0043887100020852"", ""10.1057/9781137291875"", ""10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.09.003"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12865"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1591043"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198800576.001.0001"", ""10.1177/2041905820958824"", ""10.1080/21622671.2019.1582902"", ""10.1177/0269094216686296"", ""10.1002/epa2.1104"", ""10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.08.013"", ""10.4324/9780203852170"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691562.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01402389108424830"", ""10.1177/0020852320979359"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12862"", ""10.1080/01402382.2020.1761689"", ""10.1002/epa2.1099"", ""10.1002/pa.1465"", ""10.1080/13597566.2015.1074073"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-39007-9"", ""10.1080/13597566.2020.1722946"", ""10.1093/publius/pjaa003"", ""10.1093/clp/cuy009""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/psj.12404,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Boundary Spanning Through Engagement of Policy Actors in Multiple Issues(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave,"Prominent current policy problems such as climate change, migration, or the financial crisis embrace a multitude of issues that are tackled within single‐ or multiple‐policy subsystems. However, interdependencies among actors that arise due to their multi‐issue engagement are often discounted when studying policy processes, including learning dynamics and alliance or trust formation among actors engaged in multiple issues. Various issues compete for actors’ attention, and actors need to choose an appropriate set of issues to deal with given their scarce resources. In this, why do actors engage in multiple issues? We present an innovative inductive approach that identifies policy issues related to Swiss water politics and actors involved therein. We use a two‐mode exponential random graph model to estimate actors’ multi‐issue activity. Results show that 39% of actors engage in more than one water‐related issue and that cross‐subsystem and homophily clustering and clustered issue popularity drive this issue engagement.","[{""name"": ""Laurence Brandenberger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karin Ingold"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Manuel Fischer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isabelle Schläpfer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philip Leifeld"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.socnet.2013.03.002"", ""10.1111/psj.12301"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1126/science.286.5439.509"", ""10.2307/2131866"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00106"", ""10.1111/puar.12532"", ""10.1016/S0378-8733(96)00301-2"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut080"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2000.tb02045.x"", ""10.1086/466560"", ""10.1093/pan/mpq037"", ""10.1111/ajps.12263"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760716"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur011"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2012.05.004"", ""10.1086/683061"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.11.012"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199744671.013.0019"", ""10.2166/9781780401461"", ""10.4324/9781849775151"", ""10.2307/3234884"", ""10.1111/psj.12224"", ""10.1017/S0143814X09001056"", ""10.1111/j.1754-7121.1997.tb01516.x"", ""10.1017/S0008423900014918"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2006.08.005"", ""10.18637/jss.v052.i02"", ""10.18637/jss.v024.i03"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.01.013"", ""10.1111/psj.12173"", ""10.2307/974990"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00461.x"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2014.11.005"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00294.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7sq9s"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174497"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790676"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2007.04.006"", ""10.1111/psj.12007"", ""10.1186/s40649-014-0007-y"", ""10.18637/jss.v083.i06"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00580.x"", ""10.1111/psj.12028"", ""10.1111/puar.12622"", ""10.5751/ES-06880-190423"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2012.00457.x"", ""10.1080/08941920.2018.1484973"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000217"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2010.00401.x"", ""10.1080/14494035.2017.1331879"", ""10.1111/psj.12209"", ""10.1093/jopart/mun038"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2011.07.001"", ""10.2307/2585925"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.07.004"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus021"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2006.08.002"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00319.x"", ""10.1057/9781137508607"", ""10.1080/01402382.2013.799312"", ""10.1002/2015WR017049"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00287.x"", ""10.1332/030557318X15230061739399"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2005.00101.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.01.009"", ""10.1080/10584600600808927""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1093/cjip/poaa007,CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science,Bipolar Rivalry in the Early Digital Age,"Abstract The year 2019 saw the curtain rise on a US–China bipolar rivalry quite different from the Cold War US–Soviet bipolarity. The fundamental difference between the current bipolar rivalry and that during the Cold War is that ideology is no longer the main engine driving international competition, but rather the new digital dimension of strategic competition that is emerging between the United States and China. Technological advancement over the past 15 years has led world history’s entry into the early digital age. The development of digital technology has created new ways of protecting national security, of accumulating national wealth, and of obtaining international support. Cybersecurity is becoming the core of national security and the share of digital economy in major powers’ gross domestic product dramatically increases. For the leading powers, strategic competition in cyberspace in this early digital age outstrips to a crucial extent that within physical geographic boundaries. This article observes that Cold War mentality and digital mentality will have mixed impact on foreign policy-making in the digital age, and that interactions between the nations whose foreign policy is simultaneously influenced by both mentalities will shape the emerging international order into one of uneasy peace, where there is no direct war and few proxy wars. It will rather be a scenario reflecting the dark side of globalization and downside of global governance, evident in the violation of agreements, double dealing, cyber-attacks, and technology decoupling between states. Although further digital advancement will indeed change international politics in ever more aspects, US–China bipolar configuration will nevertheless remain in place for at least for two decades, or perhaps longer.","[{""name"": ""Yan Xuetong"", ""affiliation"": [""Distinguished Professor of Tsinghua University and Foreign Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1007/s11366-020-09717-0,JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Blues: Powering BRI Research Back on Track to Avoid Choppy Seas,"AbstractThis piece examines and critiques the massive literature on China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It details how research currently seems stuck on the road to nowhere. In addition, it identifies a number of the potholes that collective research endeavors are hitting such as that they are poorly synchronized. It also stresses that lines of analysis are proliferating rather than optimizing, with studies broadening in thematic coverage, rather than becoming deeper. It points out that BRI participants are regularly related to the role of a bit player in many analyses and research often is disconnected from other literatures. Among other things, this article recommends analysts focus on the Maritime Silk Road Initiative (MSRI) or Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) in specific regions or countries. It also argues for a research core that focuses on the implementation issue (i.e., the issue of MSRI and SREB project implementation), project effects (i.e., the economic and political costs and benefits of projects), and the translation issue (i.e., the domestic and foreign policy effects of projects) and does work that goes beyond the usual suspects. On a related note, research need to identify, more precisely, participants and projects, undertake causal analysis, and take into account countervailing factors. Furthermore, studies need to make more extensive use of the Chinese foreign policy literature. Moreover, works examining subjects like soft power need to improve variable conceptualization and operationalization and deliver more nuanced analyses. Finally, studies, especially by area specialists, should take the area, not the China, perspective.","[{""name"": ""Jean-Marc F.

10.1017/S0007123417000618,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,"Beclouding Party Position as an Electoral Strategy: Voter Polarization, Issue Priority and Position Blurring","Why do political parties present vague positions? We suggest that voter polarization provides them incentives to present either clear or vague positions, and the choice between these two is determined by the priority of an issue for the parties. We find that facing voter polarization, Western European political parties present clearer positions on an issue when it is a prime issue for them, but blur their positions when it is a secondary issue. Then, position blurring gives different implications to party systems with different degrees of issue dimensionality (such as American vs Western European party systems). The results also imply that political parties will respond to ongoing voter polarization on economic and immigration issues differently in the clarity of their position.","[{""name"": ""Kyung Joon Han"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199599356.001.0001"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs023"", ""10.2307/1952828"", ""10.1111/ajps.12165"", ""10.1177/0888325410387635"", ""10.1017/S1755773911000282"", ""10.2307/1956436"", ""10.1017/S0003055401003045"", ""10.1177/1354068816642802"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2009.01897.x"", ""10.1023/A:1010374114305"", ""10.1515/9780691218250"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2004.10.009"", ""10.1177/0010414013516067"", ""10.2307/1957799"", ""10.2307/2110815"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.022"", ""10.1017/S1537592712001624"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051580"", ""10.2307/2111269"", ""10.1177/0010414008328637"", ""10.1017/S0007123404000201"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000155"", ""10.1177/0010414085018003001"", ""10.2307/1963531"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.2307/2132187"", ""10.2307/1954456"", ""10.1177/1465116509353457"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1985.tb00109.x"", ""10.7910/DVN/VCTLTE"", ""10.1177/1465116511435822"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.02.001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00489.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090194"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000379"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614453"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818691"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.07.009"", ""10.1177/0951692800012002003"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00243.x"", ""10.1177/1532673X06294318"", ""10.1111/spsr.12121"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1039381"", ""10.1093/0199273219.003.0007"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.189"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051646"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090066"", ""10.1016/S0261-3794(02)00061-6"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2008.00211.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00235.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12017"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2008.06.002"", ""10.1111/ajps.12115"", ""10.1002/j.1538-165X.2005.tb00544.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00004219"", ""10.2307/1955648"", ""10.1080/10705519709540064"", ""10.1177/1354068811436047"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000192""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1111/pops.12679,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Attitudinal and Emotional Consequences of Islamist Terrorism. Evidence from the Berlin Attack,"Studies about Islamist‐inspired terror attacks in the Western world have identified a recently declining impact on public opinion. What explains this development? I argue that the wider audience of terrorist attacks has become desensitized. Cognitive desensitization occurs when citizens increasingly expect an attack, reducing the likelihood of attitudinal change. Emotional desensitization occurs when audiences lose sensitivity to attacks, tempering emotional arousal. To assess the implications of desensitization, I analyze a survey conducted around the Berlin Christmas market attack in 2016 and account for baseline information of the surveyed individuals, an approach not used before due to data limitations. I find that attitudes like trust in government, national identification, and views of Islam remain unchanged. Sadness and anger are heightened in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The wider German audience may thus have expected an attack but still be emotionally sensitive to it in the short term. These findings are relevant as political leaders have justified important policy changes in fields like migration and even war making with reference to supposed shifts in public opinion after attacks.","[{""name"": ""Enzo Nussio"", ""affiliation"": [""ETH Zurich""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2008.00015.x"", ""10.1111/j.1529-1006.2003.pspi_1433.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1800302115"", ""10.1177/1536867X0900900402"", ""10.1111/ajps.12494"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edm012"", ""10.1177/0001699307086818"", ""10.1086/684679"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1729227"", ""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2011.06.005"", ""10.1080/01402382.2018.1429752"", ""10.1111/pops.12005"", ""10.1177/1536867X1401400413"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.003"", ""10.1177/0146167217752118"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00294"", ""10.1080/13602004.2012.727291"", ""10.5334/irsp.59"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00508.x"", ""10.1080/13504851.2016.1254335"", ""10.1080/09546553.2015.1008628"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.001"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00054.x"", ""10.1111/pops.12025"", ""10.1007/s11127-018-0612-7"", ""10.1111/1468-5906.t01-1-00176"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00512.x"", ""10.1007/s11127-011-9895-7"", ""10.1016/j.adolescence.2003.10.005"", ""10.1056/NEJMsa013404"", ""10.1023/A:1024762819880"", ""10.1177/0146167213490803"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000144"", ""10.1017/S1049096503001665"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00514.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123414000374"", ""10.1080/10781910701270970"", ""10.1037/a0024894"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00295"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316154670"", ""10.1111/jasp.12243"", ""10.1057/9780230101593_7"", ""10.1016/0191-8869(93)90076-F"", ""10.1023/B:CCFP.0000006294.88201.68"", ""10.1177/0011128717738230"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12342"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.1086/669605"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.01433"", ""10.1177/1081180X06297120"", ""10.1080/09546553.2018.1425207"", ""10.1111/pops.12576"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226520568.001.0001"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00115"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2011.07.004"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00450.x"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.27"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2019.102047"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2008.09.001"", ""10.5038/1944-0472.2.4.1"", ""10.1037/10478-000"", ""10.1002/ejsp.700"", ""10.1007/s11127-007-9182-9"", ""10.1080/026999396380240"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.106.029785"", ""10.1136/bmj.38583.728484.3A"", ""10.1017/S000305540300090X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1986.tb00241.x"", ""10.1177/0093650215619214"", ""10.1111/kykl.12122"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-120001"", ""10.1177/0956797615615584"", ""10.1111/pops.12439"", ""10.1111/pops.12513"", ""10.1177/1465116517698048"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-8066-1"", ""10.1016/j.soscij.2010.06.001""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.17645/pag.v9i1.3615,POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE,0302 Political Science,"Assessing African Energy Transitions: Renewable Energy Policies, Energy Justice, and SDG 7","Renewable energy has made significant inroads in addressing growing energy demands on the African continent. However, progress towards SDG 7 is still limited and difficult to trace. Furthermore, the results-oriented rationale of the SDGs means that both policy change and the dimension of environmental justice are not covered properly. We argue that the energy justice concept may provide a powerful tool to offset looming trade-offs and enhance the co-benefits of SDG 7 within broader transition endeavours. In doing so, we assess African energy transition processes based on a comparative mapping of African renewable energy policies in 34 countries. We investigate the scope of policy frameworks in order to analyse their contribution to greater energy justice along different justice dimensions. We then identify four transition scenarios, which reflect the challenges of integrating the justice dimension into renewable energy policies. In comparing these scenarios, we argue that SDG 7 tracking needs to consider the justice dimension to arrive at a more holistic implementation that is in line with socio-ecological justice and takes account of people’s energy needs.","[{""name"": ""Franziska Müller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Manuel Neumann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carsten Elsner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simone Claar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.06.017"", ""10.5771/9783845299884"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2018.02.019"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.057"", ""10.1080/02646811.2017.1377951"", ""10.20446/JEP-2414-3197-36-4-110"", ""10.1215/9780822381815"", ""10.31235/osf.io/wab8m"", ""10.1016/S0048-7333(02)00062-8"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3487056"", ""10.1057/palgrave.eps.2210034"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490934"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.018"", ""10.5751/ES-02316-130121"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2015.10.004"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55631-8_12"", ""10.1057/s41599-019-0335-5"", ""10.1016/j.esd.2020.01.010"", ""10.1017/S0003975615000193"", ""10.1080/13511610.2017.1279538"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2020.101551"", ""10.1111/geoj.12008"", ""10.1007/s11625-018-0604-z"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2016.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.106385"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjnrv7n"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2015.12.020"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2020.101639"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2005.00101.x"", ""10.4324/9781315753782""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Pollution', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

These algorithms use unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning on massive databases to detect objects, such as faces, and to process texts, such as speech, to model predictions for commercial and political purposes. Such governance by algorithms—or “algorithmic governance”—has received critical scrutiny from a vast interdisciplinary scholarship that points to algorithmic harms related to mass surveillance, information pollution, behavioral herding, bias, and discrimination. Big Tech’s algorithmic governance implicates core IR research in two ways: (1) it creates new private authorities as corporations control critical bottlenecks of knowledge, connection, and desire; and (2) it mediates the scope of state–corporate relations as states become dependent on Big Tech, Big Tech circumvents state overreach, and states curtail Big Tech.

While existing scholarly assessments highlight centralinstitutionalfeatures of the Paris shift, they tend to overlook itssymbolic and discursivedimensions. Our analysis shows that the Paris architecture combines two core elements: an iterative pledge and review process to stimulate global climate action, and a ‘performative’ narrative aimed at aligning actors’ expectations on the prospect of a low-carbon future. We therefore suggest calling it anincantatorysystem of governance. We then examine the origins of the new approach and find that the rise of ‘soft law’ approaches and communicative techniques in global climate governance are both indicative of a broader process: the entry of management culture in international organisations. Against this backdrop, we examine the prospects, limitations and caveats of the new approach and discuss its wider implications for global politics.","[{""name"": ""Stefan C.

10.1093/isr/viaa062,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Who Publishes Where? Exploring the Geographic Diversity of Global IR Journals,"Abstract To what extent is International Relations (IR) a globalized discipline? We investigate the geographic diversity of authorship in seventeen IR journals from Africa, East Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and the United Kingdom. Biographical records were collected for the authors of 2,362 articles published between 2011 and 2015. To interpret the data, we discuss how publishing patterns are driven by author incentives (supply) in tandem with editorial preferences and strategies (demand). Our main findings are twofold. First, global IR is fragmented and provincial. All journals frequently publish works by authors located in their own region—but the size of these local clusters varies. Geographic diversity is highest in what we identify as the “goldilocks zone” of international publishing: English-language journals that are globally visible but not so competitive that North American authors crowd out other contributions. Second, IR is being globalized through researcher mobility. Many scholars have moved to pursue their doctoral education and then publish as expats, returnees, or part of the diaspora. They are joined by academic tourists publishing in regions to which they have no obvious ties. IR journals thus feature more diverse backgrounds than it may seem at first sight, but many of these authors were educated in North America, the United Kingdom, and Europe.","[{""name"": ""Mathis Lohaus"", ""affiliation"": [""Freie Universität Berlin""]}, {""name"": ""Wiebke Wemheuer-Vogelaar"", ""affiliation"": [""Freie Universität Berlin""]}]","[""10.1093/isr/viv016"", ""10.1093/irap/lcm012"", ""10.1093/irap/lcx006"", ""10.1111/j.1749-5687.2007.00009.x"", ""10.5771/0946-7165-2013-2-141"", ""10.5771/0946-7165-2019-2-3"", ""10.1093/isr/viv019"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2017.08.002"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogz026"", ""10.1093/jogss/ogz031"", ""10.1057/jird.2011.30"", ""10.1017/S0003975616000047"", ""10.1177/1354066112449879"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226241531.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139096829"", ""10.4324/9780203644096"", ""10.1093/isp/ekz006"", ""10.1177/030437540102600403"", ""10.1111/insp.12061"", ""10.1177/1354066115586206"", ""10.1017/S153759271600308X"", ""10.1093/isr/viz016"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1416824"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000209"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57410-7"", ""10.1093/isr/viy011"", ""10.1080/09692290.2016.1276949"", ""10.1177/1354066113494323"", ""10.4324/9780203885451"", ""10.1177/0047117814528347"", ""10.1177/0011392113512839"", ""10.2307/2618476"", ""10.1162/002081898550725"", ""10.15195/v6.a7"", ""10.1093/isr/viv032"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57410-7_1"", ""10.1080/09644008.2016.1253683"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy050"", ""10.1177/2053168015585192""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiab231,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,"Whither the Indo-Pacific? Middle power strategies from Australia, South Korea and Indonesia","Abstract Against the backdrop of US–China superpower rivalry in the Indo-Pacific, this article assesses the visions and strategies of the region's middle powers, which remain under-examined at present. First, it briefly traces the boundaries of this research by reviewing the contested nature of the Indo-Pacific concept and the definitional complexities of middle power theory. Second, it provides a novel comparative framework to analyse Australia, South Korea and Indonesia as the region's major middle powers, exploring their goals and strategies. The framework consists of: 1) middle power categorization; 2) interconnectedness with the two superpowers; 3) vision for the Indo-Pacific; 4) resulting regional posture; and 5) capacity to implement the country's goals. Third, it assesses the ensuing implications of this analysis for the region's strategic landscape. It finds that Canberra is now firmly aligned with Washington in balancing against China, as epitomized by the Quad and AUKUS; Seoul is cautiously increasing cooperation with the US, though potentially only to protract its strategic ambiguity; and Jakarta is pursuing strategic autonomy for itself and ASEAN, with the ambitious but precarious goal of creating a ‘third way’ for the Indo-Pacific. Consequently, middle powers seem unlikely to provide an alternative platform for the region's direction in the near future, due to a number of internal divisions. By shedding light on such understudied aspects, this article addresses a gap in the scholarly literature and provides a novel contribution to the understanding of both the diverse roles of middle powers and the Indo-Pacific's evolving strategic landscape.","[{""name"": ""Gabriele Abbondanza"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Voluntary Associations and Dynamic Agenda Representation in the United States,"AbstractThe aim of the article is to examine how the population size of voluntary associations affects the process through which the public's issue priorities are translated into policy priorities. We conduct a time series analysis of political attention in executive and legislative agendas at the U.S. federal level in the period 1971–2001, covering all issues addressed by the U.S. government. We show that the number of voluntary associations in a policy area has a positive conditioning effect on the link between public priorities and attention for the president's State of the Union Address. However, our results do not find a positive effect for voluntary associations at later stages of the policy cycle, which experience a higher degree of institutional friction. The findings underline the importance of distinguishing between different stages of policymaking when considering the impact of voluntary associations on dynamic agenda responsiveness.","[{""name"": ""Shaun Bevan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anne Rasmussen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/sof.2007.0059"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226039466.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00389.x"", ""10.1177/1065912912456096"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.08.003"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12023"", ""10.1017/S0007123498000313"", ""10.1177/106591290305600103"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-68930-2_4"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139628723"", ""10.1086/226742"", ""10.1353/sof.2003.0004"", ""10.1177/1065912907301766"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui022"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7s1jn"", ""10.1017/S1537592714001595"", ""10.1177/106591290405700306"", ""10.1215/03616878-2006-029"", ""10.1177/0010414006297169"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00078"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00404.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mug028"", ""10.1111/j.0190-292X.2004.00050.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00405.x"", ""10.1017/S002238160809018X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00537.x"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2005.06.004"", ""10.2307/3088914"", ""10.1086/267990"", ""10.1086/233762"", ""10.1177/153244000900900303"", ""10.1017/S0007123405000165"", ""10.1353/sof.0.0236"", ""10.2307/1956018"", ""10.1080/01621459.1999.10474156"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12036"", ""10.2307/2146467"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199542628.003.0022"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804753005.003.0010"", ""10.1093/poq/nfr053"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195335354.003.0015"", ""10.1086/499908"", ""10.1177/000312240406900401"", ""10.2307/1958924"", ""10.2307/2111666"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.01.009""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1162/isec_a_00375,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,"What Allies Want: Reconsidering Loyalty, Reliability, and Alliance Interdependence","Leaders believe that if their state abandons one ally during a crisis, then their state's other allies will expect similar disloyalty in the future. Thus, a single instance of disloyalty can damage, or even destroy, alliances with other states. Because of this belief in interdependence—that developments in one alliance will also affect other alliances—the desire to demonstrate loyalty has exercised a tremendous influence on U.S. policy. But is indiscriminate loyalty what allies want? The First Taiwan Strait Crisis (1954–55) case study suggests that allies do not desire U.S. loyalty in all situations. Instead, they want the United States to be a reliable ally, posing no risk of abandonment or entrapment. In the First Taiwan Strait Crisis, several allies worried that U.S. loyalty to the Republic of China increased the risk of unwanted conflict, and as the crisis persisted, these allies sought to restrain the United States and thus reduce the likelihood of war. Although U.S. leaders were reluctant to coerce the Republic of China into backing down during this territorial dispute with the People's Republic of China, other U.S. allies actively encouraged such disloyalty. These findings have significance for theories of alliance politics and international reputation, as well as contemporary alliance management.","[{""name"": ""Iain D.

We also offer extensive empirical evidence for assumptions with observable implications. We cover partisan symmetry, the most commonly accepted fairness standard, and other perspectives. Throughout, we follow a fundamental principle of statistical inference too often ignored in this literature—defining the quantity of interest separately so its measures can be proven wrong, evaluated, and improved. This enables us to prove which of the many newly proposed fairness measures are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of the theoretical quantity they seek to estimate at all. Because real-world redistricting and gerrymandering involve complicated politics with numerous participants and conflicting goals, measures biased for partisan fairness sometimes still provide useful descriptions of other aspects of electoral systems.","[{""name"": ""JONATHAN N.

Industry-level evidence from the OECD,"Abstract We investigate whether the downward trend in the wage share is driven by technological change or a decline in labour’s bargaining power. We present an econometric analysis using industry-level data for 14 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for the 1970–2014 period and test whether the determinants of the wage share differ between manufacturing and service industries, between workers of different skill groups and across countries with different bargaining regimes. Our findings suggest that the wage share declined due to a fall in labour’s bargaining power driven by offshoring to developing countries and changes in labour market institutions such as union density, social government expenditure and minimum wages. In contrast, the effect of technological change is not robust. While we find evidence for a negative effect on medium-skilled workers, our results cast doubt on the hypothesis of skill-biased technological change.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Guschanski"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Economy, Governance, Finance and Accountability, University of Greenwich , Greenwich, London, SE10 9LS, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Özlem Onaran"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Political Economy, Governance, Finance and Accountability, University of Greenwich , Greenwich, London, SE10 9LS, UK""]}]","[""10.1162/154247603322256756"", ""10.2307/2297968"", ""10.1080/01603477.2001.11490302"", ""10.1111/sjoe.12228"", ""10.1257/aer.103.5.1553"", ""10.1257/aer.p20171102"", ""10.1016/S0263-2373(00)00094-3"", ""10.1007/s40821-014-0004-y"", ""10.1093/restud/rdv039"", ""10.1016/j.jmacro.2007.10.010"", ""10.1016/S0261-5606(00)00048-6"", ""10.1111/roiw.12054"", ""10.4337/9781783477296"", ""10.1007/s10290-011-0112-z"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(03)00092-7"", ""10.1093/cje/bel037"", ""10.1111/j.1468-232X.1969.tb00482.x"", ""10.1093/qje/qjt032"", ""10.3390/econometrics5010014"", ""10.1177/0003122410382640"", ""10.1086/669499"", ""10.5089/9781451856354.001"", ""10.1080/02692170802700435"", ""10.1080/08853908.2011.554789"", ""10.1080/09538259.2012.664335"", ""10.1080/01621459.1999.10474156"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00542.x"", ""10.1111/dech.12462"", ""10.1093/oxrep/6.4.36"", ""10.1111/bjir.12165"", ""10.1111/roie.12178"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.02.005""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1017/S1537592720001267,PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS,0302 Political Science,The White Working Class and the 2016 Election,"Academics and political pundits alike attribute rising support for right-wing political options across advanced democracies to the working classes. In the United States, authors claim that the white working class offered unprecedented and crucial support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. But what is the evidence for this claim? We examine all of the available academic survey data gathered around the election, along with a number of surveys from prior elections. We test four common claims about the white working class in 2016: (1) that most Trump voters were white working-class Americans; (2) that most white working-class voters supported Trump; (3) that unusually large numbers of white working-class voters switched from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016; and (4) that white working-class voters were pivotal to Trump’s victory in several swing states. We find that three of the four are not supported by the available data, and the other lacks crucial context that casts doubt on the idea that Trump uniquely appealed to working-class Americans. White working-class Americans have been supporting Republican presidential candidates at higher rates in recent elections, but that process long predates 2016, and narratives that center on Trump’s alleged appeal obscure this important long-term trend.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Carnes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Noam Lupu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/2378023117736486"", ""10.3167/gps.2018.360402"", ""10.1177/2378023118808619"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511819322"", ""10.2307/2096428"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mmb"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1225785"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226922164.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0896920517740615"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a029802"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400832118"", ""10.1086/428815"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000551"", ""10.1023/A:1022031432535"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.00042"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12328"", ""10.1086/297704"", ""10.1515/for-2017-0002"", ""10.1057/s41253-017-0038-5"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.08.010"", ""10.1177/0032329219861215"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz011"", ""10.2307/2111533"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226087283.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0160449X17726605"", ""10.15195/v5.a10"", ""10.1177/2378023118788217"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12285"", ""10.2307/2089536"", ""10.1515/for-2017-0003"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12315"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edt031"", ""10.1177/0010414017720705"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3131087"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003365"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12317"", ""10.1561/100.00000010"", ""10.1002/polq.12737"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt020"", ""10.15195/v4.a27"", ""10.1111/ajps.12112""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

However, this research is held back by the fact that no global coup dataset captures theoretically salient information on the identity of coup-makers, their goals, and the relationship between the coup leaders and the ruling regime. We introduce the Colpus dataset, new global data on coup types and characteristics in the post–World War II era. These data introduce a typology of coups, measurement strategy, and coding procedures to differentiate between whether coups seek to preserve existing ruling coalitions (leader reshuffling coups) or significantly alter ruling coalitions (regime change coups). We show trends in coup types across time and space. Finally, we demonstrate that poverty—an established determinant of coups—only predicts regime change coups. Colpus data will be of use to scholars of political instability and conflict, regime change, leadership accountability, the political economy of democracy and dictatorship, and related topics.","[{""name"": ""John J Chin"", ""affiliation"": [""Carnegie Mellon University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""David B Carter"", ""affiliation"": [""Washington University in St. Louis, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Joseph G Wright"", ""affiliation"": [""Pennsylvania State University, USA""]}]","[""10.1017/S0043887115000118"", ""10.1080/00263208208700496"", ""10.1177/0010414012463905"", ""10.1017/S0043887109990219"", ""10.1332/251569119X15537797528769"", ""10.1177/0022343319839449"", ""10.1177/0010414019879953"", ""10.1515/9781685854324"", ""10.1007/s11127-016-0365-0"", ""10.1017/S1537592714000851"", ""10.1017/9781316336182"", ""10.1177/0022343308100719"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00426.x"", ""10.1177/0010414013488561"", ""10.2307/2010462"", ""10.1177/0022343315625760"", ""10.1177/0022002716649232"", ""10.1177/0022343310397436"", ""10.1017/9781316809877"", ""10.1353/book.31450"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176040""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

By exploring how right‐ and left‐wing populisms conceptualize the ‘local’, as well as how localist sentiments can heighten or diminish the appeal of right and left populist politics, we establish a general framework to guide future inquiry into local manifestations of populist politics.","[{""name"": ""Mark Chou"", ""affiliation"": [""Australian Catholic University""]}, {""name"": ""Benjamin Moffitt"", ""affiliation"": [""Australian Catholic University""]}, {""name"": ""Rachel Busbridge"", ""affiliation"": [""Australian Catholic University""]}]","[""10.1111/spsr.12275"", ""10.1080/13597566.2018.1512977"", ""10.1080/23248823.2020.1871186"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2013.00201.x"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-20-3-301"", ""10.1177/0010414021997158"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.12031"", ""10.1111/1468-4446.12325"", ""10.1111/joac.12311"", ""10.1111/soru.12281"", ""10.1093/publius/pjw030"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2020.102238"", ""10.1080/13510347.2020.1755265"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2013.03.003"", ""10.1080/03003930.2016.1228530"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1111/josp.12328"", ""10.1177/0032321719847576"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00576.x"", ""10.1017/gov.2020.16"", ""10.1017/9781108354943"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2011.00493.x"", ""10.4324/9781315160733"", ""10.1017/9781108377218"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2011.08.004"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsx028"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1602816"", ""10.1057/s41295-018-0142-1"", ""10.1177/1065912918781035"", ""10.1017/S0022216X98005033"", ""10.1016/j.polgeo.2018.12.007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2010.00252.x"", ""10.1177/01914537211009953"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487606"", ""10.1111/soru.12291"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9256.2006.00259.x"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804796132.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0094582X10384208"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1017/gov.2012.11"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780190234874.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-923X.2009.01993.x"", ""10.1080/00344893.2019.1643771"", ""10.1007/978-981-32-9709-8"", ""10.1177/1065912915592183"", ""10.1111/1468‐2427.12898"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsx024"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12314"", ""10.1080/02723638.2018.1448135"", ""10.1007/s10767-018-9310-1"", ""10.26522/ssj.v11i2.1394"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-21579-8"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00740.x"", ""10.1080/01442872.2015.1073243"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.04.006"", ""10.4135/9781446270073"", ""10.2307/422164"", ""10.1515/9780773586109"", ""10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110126""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

I first review the advancements made by the most commonly used survey experiment design in IPE, namely the Globalization-as-Treatment design, in which scholars randomly assign information about different features of globalization and solicit respondents’ attitudes toward protectionism. Then I discuss three issues with this design in addressing key puzzles in the emergence of globalization backlash: ( a) using a coarse informational treatment that stacks the deck against the economic self-interest hypothesis; ( b) overattributing globalization as a source of hardship; and ( c) neglecting heterogeneous room-to-maneuver beliefs across and within countries. The article suggests alternative designs and strategies to study these questions. Evidence from survey experiments suggests that much of the globalization backlash we witness today is deeply rooted in domestic politics.","[{""name"": ""Megumi Naoi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0521, USA;""]}]","[""10.1017/S0003055401003057"", ""10.1111/ajps.12503"", ""10.1162/003355301556419"", ""10.1257/aer.102.7.3140"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000076"", ""10.1257/aer.103.6.2121"", ""10.3386/w22637"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000549"", ""10.1111/ajps.12203"", ""10.1111/ajps.12079"", ""10.1093/epolic/eix012"", ""10.1016/S1573-4463(99)03009-6"", ""10.1037/a0018933"", ""10.1561/100.00014074"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139599993"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000552"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000685"", ""10.1177/0956797614527113"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226349251.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2013.12.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511755934"", ""10.5964/jspp.v4i2.168"", ""10.1162/003355399556151"", ""10.1111/isqu.12081"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000273"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00424.x"", ""10.1080/03050629.2014.899219"", ""10.2307/2669331"", ""10.1177/106591290305600303"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090183"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190651824.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060140"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990372"", ""10.1016/j.jinteco.2014.12.010"", ""10.1111/ajps.12138"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0343.2007.00300.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.00529.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818306060255"", ""10.1257/aer.104.6.1597"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000194"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000275"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000654"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy055"", ""10.1111/ajps.12362"", ""10.1080/10670564.2017.1363024"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00589.x"", ""10.1177/1368430216677304"", ""10.1111/ajps.12012"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090158"", ""10.1017/S0043887113000191"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00747.x"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000603"", ""10.1111/1468-0262.00467"", ""10.1111/ajps.12357"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000837"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000327"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139583435"", ""10.1017/S0020818311000221"", ""10.1177/0010414015574879"", ""10.1111/aepr.12035"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000339"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00526"", ""10.1017/S0020818316000394"", ""10.1017/S0022381612000680"", ""10.1080/03050629.2015.954697"", ""10.1017/S0020818300018993"", ""10.3386/w25705"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615726"", ""10.1073/pnas.1708960115""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/psquar/qqad038,POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Rethinking Political Polarization,"Abstract The comparative study of political polarization has been central to current debates on the global crisis of democracy. It has been built on uncertain conceptual foundations, though. Established uses of the concept lack a distinctive semantic core as multiple meanings compete against each other. On the basis of a broad reading of the comparative literature, I seek to circumscribe the use and reconstruct the core of political polarization as an instance of extraordinary democratic conflict. In a first step, I delineate the basic parameters of debate by distinguishing between cluster-analytic and conflict-analytic approaches and by specifying the generic type of political conflict that characterizes the polarization of democratic polities. In a second step, I argue for political intolerance as the defining trait of both ideological and social polarization. In a final step, I introduce a third, democratic dimension into the debate: the breakdown of basic democratic trust that leads actors to view their adversaries as “enemies of democracy.” Such perceptions spell the end of democratic consolidation. When played among “democratic enemies,” democracy stops being “the only game in town.”","[{""name"": ""Andreas Schedler"", ""affiliation"": [""Central European University, Democracy Institute, Budapest, Hungary""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0260210521000425,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,Relational Indigenous systems: Aboriginal Australian political ordering and reconfiguring IR,"AbstractOntological parochialism persists in International Relations (IR) scholarship among gestures towards relational ontological reinvention. Meanwhile, the inter-polity relations of many Indigenous peoples pre-date contemporary IR and tend to be substantively relational. This situation invites rethinking of IR's understandings of political order and inter-polity relations. We take up this task by laying out necessary methodological innovations to engage with Aboriginal Australia and then showing how conventional and much recent heterodox IR seek to create forms of ‘escape’ from lived political relations by asserting the powerful yet problematic social science mechanism of observer's distance. This demonstrates a need to take Aboriginal Australia as a system on its own terms to speak back to IR. We next explain how Aboriginal Australian people produce political order on the Australian continent through a ‘relational-ecological’ disposition that contrasts with IR's predominant ‘survivalist’ disposition. The accompanying capacity to manage survivalism through relationalism provides an avenue for engaging with and recasting some of mainstream IR's survivalist assumptions, including by considering an Aboriginal approach to multipolarity, without attempting ‘pure escape’ through alternative ontologies. We thus argue that while it is necessary to critique and recast dominant IR, doing so requires putting dominant IR and Indigenous understandings into relational exchange.","[{""name"": ""Morgan Brigg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mary Graham"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Weber"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/ae.1986.13.3.02a00020"", ""10.1002/j.1834-4461.1965.tb00275.x"", ""10.1038/nature21416"", ""10.1177/03058298020310010401"", ""10.7227/JHA.010"", ""10.1177/0305829811401459"", ""10.1162/0162288042879913"", ""10.1017/S002081830002823X"", ""10.1017/S0260210504006084"", ""10.1080/09557570903433639"", ""10.1177/0047117817691349"", ""10.1002/j.1834-4461.1939.tb00247.x"", ""10.1080/14616742.2018.1527183"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000200"", ""10.1093/ips/olw020"", ""10.1017/S0260210512000290"", ""10.1177/0305829817702446"", ""10.1017/S0260210517000262""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/isr/viac008,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"QCA in International Relations: A Review of Strengths, Pitfalls, and Empirical Applications","Abstract Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is a rapidly emerging method in the field of International Relations (IR). This raises questions about the strengths and pitfalls of QCA in IR research, established good practices, how IR performs against those standards, and which areas require further attention. After a general introduction to the method, we address these questions based on a review of all empirical QCA studies published in IR journals between 1987 and 2020. Results show that QCA has been employed on a wide range of issue areas and is most common in the study of peace and conflict, global environmental politics, foreign policy, and compliance with international regulations. The utilization of QCA offers IR scholars four distinct advantages: the identification of complex causal patterns, the distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions, a middle ground between quantitative and qualitative approaches, and the reinforcement of the strengths of other methods. We find that albeit a few exceptions, IR researchers conduct high-quality QCA research when compared against established standards. However, the field should urgently pay more attention to three issues: the potential of using QCA in combination with other methods, increasing the robustness of QCA results, and strengthening research transparency in QCA applications. Throughout the article, we formulate strategies for improved QCA research in IR.","[{""name"": ""Tobias Ide"", ""affiliation"": [""Murdoch University, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Patrick A Mello"", ""affiliation"": [""Technical University of Munich, Germany""]}]","[""10.1080/07388940500339167"", ""10.1007/s12116-012-9125-4"", ""10.1177/2233865914546502"", ""10.1177/0022343314534458"", ""10.1177/0049124117701487"", ""10.1177/0049124115613780"", ""10.4135/9781452226569.n1"", ""10.1080/14754835.2015.1103160"", ""10.1177/2347797018824948"", ""10.1177/0022343315585847"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2486.2011.01045.x"", ""10.1093/isr/viaa017"", ""10.1017/S0260210519000056"", ""10.1177/1558689818770061"", ""10.4135/9781452226569.n7"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2015.08.001"", ""10.1177/1354066113495485"", ""10.1080/09636412.2016.1134016"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691149707.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13523260.2019.1659575"", ""10.1017/S0020818315000090"", ""10.1080/09557571.2017.1313197"", ""10.1177/0022002715626248"", ""10.1007/s11135-021-01209-4"", ""10.1017/jea.2016.2"", ""10.1177/0022343317750216"", ""10.1007/s13280-018-1092-1"", ""10.1177/0022343320910777"", ""10.1080/07036337.2015.1055738"", ""10.1080/09546553.2018.1442330"", ""10.4135/9781506390239"", ""10.1177/0022343317747337"", ""10.1017/gov.2018.17"", ""10.1177/0010414008325433"", ""10.4256/mio.2010.0037"", ""10.1017/S1755773912000318"", ""10.1057/jird.2012.11"", ""10.1017/eis.2019.10"", ""10.1177/1094428116665465"", ""10.1080/09636412.2014.970846"", ""10.1017/eis.2021.36"", ""10.1126/science.aab2374"", ""10.1017/9781009006781"", ""10.1057/s41304-017-0142-7"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226702797.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13629395.2011.613676"", ""10.1177/1065912912468269"", ""10.1177/1525822X19896258"", ""10.1111/j.1743-8594.2007.00063.x"", ""10.1177/2059799119862110"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139004244"", ""10.1177/0049124111404818"", ""10.1017/S026021051100012X"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1444"", ""10.1177/0049124117729700"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00433"", ""10.1177/0022343310396267"", ""10.1177/0049124112442142"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.10.010"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00560"", ""10.1080/07036337.2018.1544250""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0003055422000296,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,0302 Political Science,Power Sharing and Authoritarian Stability: How Rebel Regimes Solve the Guardianship Dilemma,"Regimes founded in rebellion are, typically, extremely durable. We propose that this stability is founded upon peaceful power sharing between the rebel regime leader and military elites. Amid long and intense fighting, rebel leaders must delegate control to top military commanders because doing so helps them to win battles. After seizing power, power-sharing deals between former combatants are highly credible due to their history of interactions, which mitigates the guardianship dilemma. Elsewhere, a persistent internal security dilemma often undermines power-sharing deals. Using originally collected data on African regimes from 1960 to 2017, we establish that rebel regimes break down seldomly compared with other authoritarian regimes and they experience fewer coups. Regarding the mechanism, rebel regimes more frequently share power with military elites by appointing a Minister of Defense. These Ministers are typically high-ranking members of the rebellion, which reflects the regime’s replacement of the state military with their own.","[{""name"": ""ANNE MENG"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JACK PAINE"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0043887120000106"", ""10.1177/0010414009332126"", ""10.1017/S0022278X0300435X"", ""10.1017/9781316336182"", ""10.1525/9780520313071"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0043"", ""10.1515/9781400831999"", ""10.1080/09636412.2017.1336388"", ""10.1017/S0022381613000029"", ""10.1017/9781108855969"", ""10.1177/0738894212449093"", ""10.7910/DVN/8LQZW9"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510090"", ""10.1017/9781108877497"", ""10.3982/ECTA11237"", ""10.1086/701635"", ""10.1111/ajps.12547"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139149426"", ""10.1162/isec_a_00427"", ""10.1017/S0043887111000049"", ""10.1177/00219096211007658"", ""10.1177/0022002719876000"", ""10.1017/9781108500319"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000629"", ""10.1017/S0020818314000307"", ""10.1177/0022343303040003004"", ""10.1017/S0003055422000089"", ""10.1080/10246029.2017.1297581"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176040"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808654"", ""10.1177/000312240907400208"", ""10.1017/CHOL9780521224093.017"", ""10.1177/00104140211047402"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316711323"", ""10.1017/9781108919555"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316489031"", ""10.1177/0010414016688004"", ""10.1353/book.31450""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

If programmatic appeals are not credible, institutional reforms that move politics from an elite- to a mass-focused and more competitive environment increase patronage efforts. This leads to an overall surge and notable spike in discretionary state hiring in election years. The study tests this prediction in the context of Indonesia’s decentralized education sector. The authors exploit the exogenous phasing in and timing of elections in Indonesian districts for causal identification. They find evidence of election-related increases in the number of contract teachers on local payrolls and increases in civil service teacher certifications, which dramatically increases salaries. These effects are particularly pronounced for districts in which the former authoritarian ruling party is in competition with new entrants.","[{""name"": ""Jan H Pierskalla"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Audrey Sacks"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2008.09.003"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107324909"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051683"", ""10.1177/003232927700700402"", ""10.1177/0010414015574881"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-7913"", ""10.1111/sjoe.12010"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00537.x"", ""10.5129/001041516817037754"", ""10.1177/0010414017710268"", ""10.3386/w19440"", ""10.1017/S0043887115000453"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2011.00887.x"", ""10.1177/0010414012453450"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00282.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511528163"", ""10.1017/S0022381613001254"", ""10.1177/0010414007313118"", ""10.1111/ajps.12058"", ""10.1007/s12116-017-9238-x"", ""10.1093/qje/qjx040"", ""10.1017/S0007123403000085"", ""10.1177/186810341002900404"", ""10.1093/jleo/ewm054"", ""10.5040/9781474209731"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00099.x"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-6653"", ""10.1017/S0003055408080106"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511978661"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000256"", ""10.1525/9780520918665"", ""10.5040/9798400660986"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-080911-131426"", ""10.1177/0010414005284216"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00220.x"", ""10.5509/2013863539"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.03.004"", ""10.1353/wp.2005.0007"", ""10.1093/qje/qjs034"", ""10.1177/0951629812453217"", ""10.5129/001041516818254437"", ""10.1111/ajps.12322"", ""10.1355/9789812308429"", ""10.1017/S0043887110000080"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2015.07.002"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.031908.220508"", ""10.1111/j.1548-2456.2007.tb00392.x"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.11.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511585869"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000616"", ""10.1177/0010414017695332"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00578.x"", ""10.1177/0010414015574883"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-6782"", ""10.1086/686690"", ""10.1080/14672715.2014.960706"", ""10.1353/wp.2001.0015"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.5.112801.080924"", ""10.1355/9789812308429-010"", ""10.5129/001041514813623155"", ""10.1093/jopart/mug006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511618819"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2005.00127.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8381.2005.00214.x"", ""10.1561/100.00013040"", ""10.1177/0010414015594627"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000491"", ""10.1515/9780804767316"", ""10.1086/694547"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139628983"", ""10.1355/CS28-2B""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1162/glep_a_00674,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS,0302 Political Science; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,Pathways to an International Agreement to Leave Fossil Fuels in the Ground,"Abstract To achieve the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal, fossil fuel production needs to undergo a managed decline. While some frontrunner countries have already begun to adopt policies and measures restricting fossil fuel supply, an outstanding question is how international cooperation in support of a managed decline of fossil fuel production could take shape. This article explores two possible pathways—one following a club model and the other more akin to a multilateral environmental agreement. Specifically, the article discusses the participants in an international agreement; the forum through which cooperation will take place; the modalities, principles, and procedures underpinning the agreement; and the incentives to induce cooperation. The article concludes that the most likely scenario at this juncture is the emergence of club arrangements covering particular fossil fuel sources and groups of actors that, over time, give rise to growing calls for a more coordinated and multilateral response.","[{""name"": ""Harro van Asselt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Newell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10584-015-1505-0"", ""10.1126/science.aax5011"", ""10.1002/0470024747"", ""10.1162/glep.2009.9.4.14"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2019.101304"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706033"", ""10.1016/j.esg.2020.100046"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00562"", ""10.1080/08941920.2020.1772924"", ""10.4159/9780674029453"", ""10.1093/oxrep/gru024"", ""10.1007/s10784-013-9227-0"", ""10.1162/glep.2008.8.4.9"", ""10.1093/law/9780198849155.003.0056"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00107"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262050920.001.0001"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0337-0"", ""10.1080/14693062.2021.1967717"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-44946-8"", ""10.1080/14693062.2020.1725409"", ""10.1007/s10584-017-2134-6"", ""10.1038/s41558-018-0172-3"", ""10.1007/s10584-018-2162-x"", ""10.1162/glep_a_00654"", ""10.1007/s10584-015-1481-4"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000788"", ""10.1787/c8328405-en"", ""10.1038/s41558-019-0509-6"", ""10.1007/s10584-018-2209-z"", ""10.1038/nclimate2937"", ""10.1007/s10584-018-2266-3"", ""10.1177/0308518X18816702"", ""10.24135/pjr.v23i1.311"", ""10.1080/14693062.2020.1763900"", ""10.1080/096922998347426"", ""10.1080/14693062.2019.1636759"", ""10.1257/aer.15000001"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2020.112029"", ""10.1080/14693062.2017.1394255"", ""10.1080/14693062.2018.1494535"", ""10.1080/14693062.2020.1804315"", ""10.1016/j.esg.2020.100061"", ""10.1017/S0043887100009382"", ""10.1038/s41558-022-01356-y"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8734.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2020.06.020"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/abc197"", ""10.1126/science.abo4637"", ""10.1057/s41599-020-0474-8"", ""10.1016/j.esg.2021.100118"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67855-9_4"", ""10.1162/glep.2006.6.3.90"", ""10.1080/00130095.2018.1474078"", ""10.1038/s41586-021-03821-8""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Energy']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'General Energy']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.6919), ('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.6893)]]"

As the two major US political parties ideologically polarized at the elite level, the public gradually perceived this polarization and better sorted themselves into the parties that matched their policy preferences. Stable pre-existing policy differences between men and women caused this sorting to generate the modern US partisan gender gap. Because education is positively associated with awareness of elite party polarization, the partisan gender gap developed earlier and is consistently larger among those with college degrees. The study finds support for this argument from decades of American National Election Studies data and a new large dataset of decades of pooled individual-level Gallup survey responses.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Q.

10.1017/S0007123417000345,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Nuanced Accountability: Voter Responses to Service Delivery in Southern Africa,"Various theories of democratic governance posit that citizens should vote for incumbent politicians when they provide good service, and vote for the opposition when service delivery is poor. But does electoral accountability work as theorized, especially in developing country contexts? Studying Southern African democracies, where infrastructural investment in basic services has expanded widely but not universally, we contribute a new empirical answer to this question. Analyzing the relationship between service provision and voting, we find a surprising negative relationship: improvements in service provision predict decreases in support for dominant party incumbents. Though stronger in areas where opposition parties control local government, the negative relationship persists even in those areas where local government is run by the nationally dominant party. Survey data provide suggestive evidence that citizen concerns about corruption and ratcheting preferences for service delivery may be driving citizen attitudes and behaviors. Voters may thus be responsive to service delivery, but perhaps in ways that are more nuanced than extant theories previously recognized.","[{""name"": ""Daniel de Kadt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Evan S.

10.1111/ropr.12441,REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Leveraging digital technologies to boost productivity in the informal sector in Sub-Saharan Africa(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave,"AbstractIn many developed countries, automation has stoked fears of job losses by less‐skilled workers. In Sub‐Saharan Africa, by contrast, the adoption of low‐skill‐biased digital technologies complementary to informal workers offers the potential of a poverty‐reducing trajectory by enabling productivity and creating more job opportunities. While informality is pervasive in Sub‐Saharan African economies, building pathways to full formalization in the region has had limited success to date. Instead of focusing on formalization as an imperative policy goal, more realistic short to medium term policies should leverage low‐skill‐biased digital technologies to upgrade the skills of workers and enhance the productivity of firms in the informal sector. Moreover, more productive informal firms will likely seek to formalize if they perceive a positive tradeoff with the gains of being formal, arising from a conducive business environment mixing proper regulations, opportunities, and incentives. This paper summarizes what we know on digital technologies in Sub‐Saharan Africa, and highlights their role as catalysts for productivity enhancement, job creation, entrepreneurship, access to credit, and financial inclusion in the informal sector. It also documents key challenges faced by governments in harnessing the benefits and risks of digitization for the informal sector and suggests a blueprint to help policymakers in Sub‐Saharan Africa address them.","[{""name"": ""Pierre Nguimkeu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Economics Georgia State University Atlanta GA USA""]}, {""name"": ""Cedric Okou"", ""affiliation"": [""EFI‐Prospects Group The World Bank Washington DC USA""]}]","[""10.1162/003355398555838"", ""10.4324/9781315158013-14"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-8455"", ""10.1257/jep.29.3.3"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.11.004"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-9537-0"", ""10.1080/00220388.2017.1342817"", ""10.1093/wbro/lku002"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-7183"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-1134-0"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.026"", ""10.1257/app.5.2.122"", ""10.1108/info-05-2013-0025"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-7669"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2924669"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.04.006"", ""10.1162/003355302753399436"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-6184"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.03.009"", ""10.1596/30456"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-76641-4_9"", ""10.1596/31654"", ""10.1111/rode.12321"", ""10.4018/jictrda.2012010101"", ""10.1257/jep.28.3.109"", ""10.1353/arw.2011.0029"", ""10.1016/S0167-2231(96)00021-8"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.041"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2013.12.001"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-7092-6"", ""10.1257/jel.38.1.77"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2009.07.001"", ""10.1257/aer.20141745"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95121-5_2388-1"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-1328-3"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-1398-6"", ""10.1596/31895"", ""10.1596/31565""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"
10.17645/pag.v8i1.2513,POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE,0302 Political Science,It All Happens at Once: Understanding Electoral Behaviour in Second-Order Elections,"The second-order election (SOE) model as originally formulated by Reif and Schmitt (1980) suggests that, relative to the preceding first-order election result, turnout is lower in SOEs, government and big parties lose, and small and ideologically extreme parties win. These regularities are not static but dynamic and related to the first-order electoral cycle. These predictions of the SOE model have often been tested using aggregate data. The fact that they are based on individual-level hypotheses has received less attention. The main aim of this article is to restate the micro-level hypotheses for the SOE model and run a rigorous test for the 2004 and 2014 European elections. Using data from the European Election Studies voter surveys, our analysis reveals signs of sincere, but also strategic abstentions in European Parliament elections. Both strategic and sincere motivations are also leading to SOE defection. It all happens at once.","[{""name"": ""Hermann Schmitt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alberto Sanz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniela Braun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eftichia Teperoglou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/320036"", ""10.1093/0198293089.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1354068818805248"", ""10.1080/07036337.2014.885751"", ""10.1177/0010414004272693"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174954"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.022"", ""10.1177/0010414017710259"", ""10.1023/A:1012529023870"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511616884"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.019"", ""10.1080/1360874042000271861"", ""10.1017/S000712340600007X"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198791539.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00546.x"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.017"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.05.006"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02057.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000422"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.020"", ""10.1017/S0007123408000409"", ""10.1111/jcms.12133"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.015"", ""10.2307/1960537"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00308"", ""10.1016/0261-3794(84)90005-2"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1980.tb00737.x"", ""10.1177/0010414003255105"", ""10.1080/01402380500085962"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1991.tb01176.x"", ""10.1080/13608746.2015.1078271"", ""10.17645/pag.v4i1.464"", ""10.1086/268264"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199258307.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1271600"", ""10.1080/13608746.2010.501974"", ""10.24124/c677/20151207"", ""10.1086/268527"", ""10.3998/mpub.13603"", ""10.1016/0261-3794(96)00009-1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.1982.tb00438.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9477.00042"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00535.x"", ""10.1080/07036330903145880""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/padm.12691,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Intersectionality and equity: Dynamic bureaucratic representation in higher education,"AbstractRepresentative bureaucracy scholarship has yet to address two interrelated phenomena: intersectionality and changes in relative disadvantage over time. This manuscript addresses these gaps by assessing representation effects at the intersection of race/ethnicity and sex and in previously, but no longer, disadvantaged client groups. It also argues that if bureaucratic representation is viewed as a quest for equity, then representation will decline as disadvantaged client groups approach equity in policy outcomes. Using panel data for US higher education, this study highlights the importance of intersectional representation in bureaucratic organizations. In three of the four race/ethnic/sex combinations, students perform better in the presence of faculty who match them intersectionally (in the fourth case, race but not sex matters). The empirical results also find that as a formerly disadvantaged client group (women) becomes successful within an organization, the active representation relationship declines. These implications inform future representative bureaucracy scholarship examining intersectional groups.","[{""name"": ""Daniel L.

Although observers worry that political contestation over nominations undermines support for qualified nominees and threatens the Court's legitimacy, there is little empirical evidence to support these claims. The authors argue that political contestation over judicial nominations provides cues that shape the public's impressions about nominees and the Court and polarizes public opinion across partisan lines. Data from a conjoint experiment administered in the first days of the Trump presidency support this argument. Political rhetoric attributed to President Trump and Senate Democrats substantially polarized partisans’ views of nominees and evaluations of the Court's legitimacy, with Republicans (Democrats) expressing significantly more (less) favorable attitudes. Additional analyses suggest that contestation generates divergent partisan responses by affecting views about the nominee's impartiality. These findings challenge existing perspectives that depict attitudes toward the judiciary as resistant to partisan considerations and have important implications for the Court's legitimacy in a polarized era.","[{""name"": ""Jon C.

State-by-state variations to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate the political dynamics of “kaleidoscopic federalism,” under which there is no single prevailing principle of federalism. In the COVID-19 pandemic, features of kaleidoscopic federalism combined with shortcomings in the public health system under the Trump administration, leading to fragmented responses to the pandemic among the states. Federalism alone does not explain the shortcomings of the United States’ response to the pandemic. Rather, the fragmented response was driven by state partisanship, which shaped state public health interventions and resulted in differences in public health outcomes. This has sobering implications for American federalism because state-level partisan differences yield different and unequal responses to the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Thomas A Birkland"", ""affiliation"": [""North Carolina State University""]}, {""name"": ""Kristin Taylor"", ""affiliation"": [""Wayne State University""]}, {""name"": ""Deserai A Crow"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Colorado Denver""]}, {""name"": ""Rob DeLeo"", ""affiliation"": [""Bentley University""]}]","[""10.1080/00167428.2021.1884982"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2.4.7"", ""10.1111/spol.12656"", ""10.4324/9781351182164-2"", ""10.1177/0275074020941698"", ""10.1093/publius/pjn020"", ""10.1093/publius/pjt022"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00631.x"", ""10.1093/publius/pjw011"", ""10.2202/1944-4079.1002"", ""10.1332/030557317X14974484611316"", ""10.1177/0275074020941696"", ""10.1080/01442870902863869"", ""10.1525/9780520910416"", ""10.1177/1532673X20961024"", ""10.1093/publius/pjz014"", ""10.2307/1956539"", ""10.1002/wmh3.372"", ""10.1111/puar.12065"", ""10.2307/1290080"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226728827.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.007"", ""10.1111/puar.13243"", ""10.1177/0002716290509001013"", ""10.1177/0160323X17749013"", ""10.1111/psq.12702"", ""10.1101/2020.10.08.20209619"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2007.114496"", ""10.1056/NEJMe2029812"", ""10.1111/psq.12698"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-02497-w"", ""10.1017/S0003055400258644"", ""10.1007/s11077-020-09381-4"", ""10.1177/1087724X20969165""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/polsoc/puac015,POLICY AND SOCIETY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,Global public policy in a quantified world: Sustainable Development Goals as epistemic infrastructures,"Abstract Despite the multiplicity of actors, crises, and fields of action, global public policy has known one constant, that is, the ubiquity of indicators in the production of governing knowledge. This article theoretically engages with the phenomenon of hyper-quantification of global governance in the context of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), debated and introduced in 2015. Increasingly metrics—such as indicators and quantified data to monitor targets and goals—are no longer just tools of governance but rather are emblematic of the new types of political cultures, enabling an interplay of material, techno-political, and organizational structures within which (statistical) knowledge is produced, disseminated, and translated into global public policy. The paper unpacks this complexity by proposing a new theoretical approach to quantification as an “epistemic infrastructure,” which emerges across three levels: materialities (such as data and indicators), interlinkages (such as networks and communities), and paradigms (such as new ways of doing policy work). Using the lens of the “epistemic infrastructure” on the SDGs, this article and the others in this special issue analyze the ways that quantified knowledge practices—in widely varying policy arenas, scales, and geographic regions—are at the heart of the production of its global public policy.","[{""name"": ""Marlee Tichenor"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Anthropology, Durham University , Durham, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Sally E Merry"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Anthropology, New York University , New York, NY, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Sotiria Grek"", ""affiliation"": [""Social Policy, University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Justyna Bandola-Gill"", ""affiliation"": [""Social Policy, University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh, UK""]}]","[""10.1215/9780822373599"", ""10.1111/amet.12129"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puac013"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.876180"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puac017"", ""10.1177/0961463X95004001003"", ""10.1177/1354066117719320"", ""10.1111/ips.12073"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-07408-2"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31089-8"", ""10.1007/s11077-006-9025-4"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00007777"", ""10.1080/13876988.2015.1023052"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.313"", ""10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105908"", ""10.1332/030557312X655873"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00207"", ""10.4324/9781315414232"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puac024"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12602"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12604"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12604"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puac020"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001442"", ""10.2307/422246"", ""10.1186/s12992-019-0510-x"", ""10.4324/9780203413845"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000457"", ""10.1111/ajps.12119"", ""10.1017/S1752971920000457"", ""10.1177/0306312709359963"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-092412-155522"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.4324/9780429466984"", ""10.1080/03085147.2011.637330"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226261317.001.0001"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816677306.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198296034.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2015.10.005"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.1017/S0020818304582036"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puac016"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316091265"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12597"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12593"", ""10.1177/00027649921955326"", ""10.1287/isre.7.1.111"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x"", ""10.1017/9781108661690"", ""10.1111/padm.12207"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puac023"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102629"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691170770.001.0001"", ""10.1080/19452829.2019.1666810"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puac026"", ""10.1080/1600910X.2015.1049190"", ""10.1093/polsoc/puac009""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

However, men and women perceive and value the characteristics of urban green spaces differently, as both have different sensitivities and expectations. The present study aims to identify gender differences in the perceptions of urban green spaces characteristics.MethodsGender differences in the perceptions of eleven urban green spaces characteristics were assessed, including lighting, safety, cleanliness, walking routes, bike lanes, shaded areas, recreational areas, off‐leash dog areas, children's playgrounds, drinking fountains, and pleasant views.ResultsOur results showed that women attribute a higher value to all the characteristics of the urban green spaces analyzed, being the most appreciated the presence of off‐leash dog areas, lighting, children's playgrounds, pleasant views, drinking fountains, safety and recreational areas. In addition, older and more educated people, unemployed women, and single men consider green spaces to be highly important.ConclusionThe results of this study provide evidence for the adequate planning, design and development of urban green spaces that meet the needs of all users.","[{""name"": ""Olta Braçe"", ""affiliation"": [""Health and Territory Research Universidad de Sevilla  Seville Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Marco Garrido‐Cumbrera"", ""affiliation"": [""Health and Territory Research Universidad de Sevilla  Seville Spain""]}, {""name"": ""José Correa‐Fernández"", ""affiliation"": [""Health and Territory Research Universidad de Sevilla  Seville Spain""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ufug.2014.03.007"", ""10.3390/ijerph17197014"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2008.12.004"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2005.072447"", ""10.1016/J.UFUG.2015.01.003"", ""10.1111/1540‐6237.00088"", ""10.1007/s11205‐017‐1801‐3"", ""10.1080/01426397.2020.1808966"", ""10.1016/j.jth.2018.06.006"", ""10.1080/00222216.2005.11950054"", ""10.1016/J.CITIES.2012.06.017"", ""10.6018/eglobal.17.1.292331"", ""10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2006.02.015"", ""10.1136/JECH.2005.043562"", ""10.1080/01426399708706514"", ""10.1016/J.UFUG.2017.02.005"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐9663.2011.00679.x"", ""10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2011.09.011"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐9663.1997.tb01601.x"", ""10.1016/S0277‐9536(98)00114‐2"", ""10.1080/01490400590912088"", ""10.1093/forestry/cpi042"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2016.06.008"", ""10.2307/420517"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.04.015"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.028"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2010.10.024"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.09.024"", ""10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2006.03.003"", ""10.1080/014904099273110""]","['Environmental Science', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Plant Science', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1017/S0020818321000084,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Fair Share? Equality and Equity in American Attitudes Toward Trade,"AbstractAmerican politicians repeatedly and strenuously invoke concerns about fairness when pitching their trade policies to their constituents, unsurprisingly since fairness is one of the most fundamental and universal moral concepts. Yet studies to date on public opinion about trade have not been designed in such a way that they test whether fairness is important, nor whether the mass public applies fairness standards impartially. Drawing on findings in social psychology and behavioral economics, we develop and find evidence for an “asymmetric fairness” argument. In a national survey of Americans, we find strong evidence that fairness, conceived in terms of equality, is crucial for understanding support for potential trade deals and support for renegotiating existing ones. Americans view as most fair and most preferable outcomes in which concessions and benefits are equal across countries, especially when those equal benefits match productivity. However, we find that Americans have an egoistically biased sense of fairness, responding particularly negatively to any outcome that leaves the United States relatively worse off—a sense of injustice that does not extend to the same degree to relative gains for Americans.","[{""name"": ""Ryan Brutger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brian Rathbun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/isq/sqv025"", ""10.1017/S0020818317000327"", ""10.1017/S0020818318000188"", ""10.1017/S002081830003424X"", ""10.1162/003355399556151"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090158"", ""10.1006/obhd.1995.1068"", ""10.1111/0020-8833.00188"", ""10.1257/aer.89.1.215"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00624.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00589.x"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aao5348"", ""10.1111/ajps.12081"", ""10.1257/jep.11.1.109"", ""10.1017/S0007123417000205"", ""10.1126/science.7466396"", ""10.1017/S0043887115000180"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.3.426"", ""10.1017/S0020818300027715"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.2307/1963947"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1975.tb01000.x"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00027"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2478.2012.00747.x"", ""10.18637/jss.v059.i05"", ""10.1111/ajps.12201"", ""10.1006/game.1995.1027"", ""10.3200/SOCP.148.2.223-246"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190651824.001.0001"", ""10.1093/poq/nfaa006"", ""10.1017/S0020818300004458""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000120,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,Explaining Foreign Support for China's Global Economic Leadership,"AbstractWe analyze the factors that increase the likelihood that other nations will follow China's global economic leadership. While our theoretical framework incorporates the conventional argument that China pulls in followers with economic benefits, we focus on grievances with the current global order that have the effect of pushing countries toward the rising new leader. We find that grievances about global financial instability are particularly important push factors. Our results show that countries that have experienced more financial crises, more variable capital account policies, more volatile portfolio capital outflows, and more social unrest during IMF programs are more likely to support China's global leadership than leaders of nations that have been less exposed to these problems. We find no evidence that grievances about global governance, or grievances about discriminatory US trade policies, are related to foreign support for China's global economic leadership. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the interpretation that leaders want to reform and preserve the WTO and the IMF, which have worked reasonably well for them under US leadership. At the same time, they have incentives to follow China's economic leadership on global capital flows, emphasizing long-term infrastructure and development finance over short-term flows which, under the current order, have imposed large costs on many economies.","[{""name"": ""J.

10.1093/isq/sqaa030,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY,0302 Political Science,Emotional Labor and the Power of International Bureaucrats,"AbstractThis article advances a theory on the power of international bureaucrats and bureaucracies in world politics. It argues that bureaucrats become powerful when they stage emotionally calibrated performances as “servants” before state principals and carve out space for action through “whispering,” “propagating,” cultivating patrons, and building coalitions in the backstage of official interaction. These “servant” performances involve what sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls “emotional labor”—the management of feelings in work performances. I develop a theory of emotional labor that suggests why international bureaucrats manage emotions as they perform as servants and why some bureaucrats with prized sociological profiles are empowered on the back of “confident” servant performances. In contrast to principal–agent, constructivist, and psychological accounts, this is a micro-sociological explanation for bureaucratic power. I evaluate this theory with an ethnography of the Secretariat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)—a “least likely” case for bureaucratic power under prevailing theorizations. I also demonstrate how the ASEAN case is a sharper instance of a more general phenomenon. This article advances the study of emotions and emotional labor, the role of social class in shaping competent practice, and the debate on the power of bureaucrats and international organizations in international relations.","[{""name"": ""Deepak Nair"", ""affiliation"": [""National University of Singapore (NUS)""]}]","[""10.3224/eris.v3i3.27340"", ""10.1017/S175297191000031X"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107280366"", ""10.1515/9780804776301"", ""10.1017/S0020818305050010"", ""10.1177/0305829817739636"", ""10.1080/13501763.2016.1162833"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511862373.006"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262012744.001.0001"", ""10.1093/isp/eky011"", ""10.1177/1468796803003004005"", ""10.1017/S002081830003157X"", ""10.1177/1354066117741676"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491368"", ""10.1177/1354066110363502"", ""10.1017/S1752971914000232"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000349"", ""10.1017/S1752971913000225"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.870023"", ""10.1142/6978"", ""10.1111/ajps.12038"", ""10.1093/isr/vix033"", ""10.1037/a0016357"", ""10.1177/0963721411414654"", ""10.1177/000271629956100106"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00657.x"", ""10.1080/09692290.2011.603665"", ""10.1057/jird.2011.26"", ""10.1017/S0020818309990221"", ""10.1007/s10784-016-9319-8"", ""10.1177/1354066118822117"", ""10.1093/ips/olz024"", ""10.1093/isr/viab001"", ""10.1177/1354066108097557"", ""10.1177/000271629956100109"", ""10.1162/002081897550311"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316534564"", ""10.2307/2009942"", ""10.1177/1354066116634442"", ""10.1007/s11558-013-9168-y"", ""10.1177/089124193022003004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511819612"", ""10.1515/9780804764360"", ""10.1177/0022002711431423"", ""10.4324/9780203383131"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-115944"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00706.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Public Administration', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Evidence from survey experiments on budgetary priorities,"AbstractEver since the Great Recession, public debt has become politicised. Some research suggests that citizens are fiscally conservative, while other research shows that they punish governments for implementing fiscal consolidation. This begs the question of whether and how much citizens care about debt. We argue that debt is not a priority for citizens because reducing it involves spending and tax trade‐offs. Using a split‐sample experiment and a conjoint experiment in four European countries, we show that fiscal consolidation at the cost of spending cuts or taxes hikes is less popular than commonly assumed. Revenue‐based consolidation is especially unpopular, but expenditure‐based consolidation is also contested. Moreover, the public has clear fiscal policy priorities: People do not favour lower debt and taxes, but they support higher progressive taxes to pay for more government spending. The article furthers our understanding of public opinion on fiscal policies and the likely political consequences of austerity.","[{""name"": ""BJÖRN BREMER"", ""affiliation"": [""Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies  Germany""]}, {""name"": ""RETO BÜRGISSER"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Zurich  Zurich Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1017/S0143814X18000326"", ""10.2307/2534672"", ""10.1086/704781"", ""10.1080/13501763.2020.1749715"", ""10.1177/14651165211004772"", ""10.1177/0032329216638053"", ""10.1086/687324"", ""10.1017/S0003055420001136"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3588941"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu007"", ""10.1111/ajps.12643"", ""10.1111/ajps.12346"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.48"", ""10.1017/S0007123421000119"", ""10.1515/9781400883363"", ""10.1111/ajps.12349"", ""10.1257/aer.109.4.1197"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000472"", ""10.1017/psrm.2021.78"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12375"", ""10.1257/aer.98.5.2203"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226075952.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1298658"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202"", ""10.1086/NTJ41863164"", ""10.1177/0010414016633227"", ""10.1177/0010414099032004003"", ""10.1257/aer.20181164"", ""10.1017/S0022050720000601"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2010.01922.x"", ""10.1177/0010414012463904"", ""10.2307/2110954"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr025"", ""10.1093/pan/mpt024"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1111/ajps.12470"", ""10.2307/2585478"", ""10.1177/0010414018797943"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12463"", ""10.1007/s10368-015-0323-1"", ""10.1016/0047-2727(83)90043-9"", ""10.1080/00401706.1970.10488634"", ""10.1017/pan.2018.2"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12171"", ""10.1017/S0007123420000320"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921766"", ""10.2307/2111407"", ""10.1017/S1755773921000035"", ""10.1111/jmcb.12687"", ""10.1017/pan.2019.30"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000603"", ""10.1086/261013"", ""10.2307/1884400"", ""10.2307/2296528"", ""10.2307/2118475"", ""10.1353/wp.1996.0004"", ""10.1017/S0003055407070049"", ""10.3386/w27699"", ""10.1111/kykl.12013"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.esr.a018219"", ""10.1080/01402382.2016.1271600"", ""10.1086/268929""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Political Science and International Relations']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"
10.1111/1475-6765.12379,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,"Different worlds of contention? Protest in Northwestern, Southern and Eastern Europe","AbstractDespite the voluminous literature on the ‘normalisation of protest’, the protest arena is seen as a bastion of left‐wing mobilisation. While citizens on the left readily turn to the streets, citizens on the right only settle for it as a ‘second best option’. However, most studies are based on aggregated cross‐national comparisons or only include Northwestern Europe. We contend the aggregate‐level perspective hides different dynamics of protest across Europe. Based on individual‐level data from the European Social Survey (2002–2016), we investigate the relationship between ideology and protest as a key component of the normalisation of protest. Using hierarchical logistic regression models, we show that while protest is becoming more common, citizens with different ideological views are not equal in their protest participation across the three European regions. Instead of a general left predominance, we find that in Eastern European countries, right‐wing citizens are more likely to protest than those on the left. In Northwestern and Southern European countries, we find the reverse relationship, left‐wing citizens are more likely to protest than their right‐wing counterparts. Lessons drawn from the protest experience in Northwestern Europe characterised by historical mobilisation by the New Left are of limited use for explaining the ideological composition of protest in the Southern and Eastern European countries. We identify historical and contemporary regime access as the mechanism underlying regional patterns: citizens with ideological views that were historically in opposition are more likely to protest. In terms of contemporary regime access, we find that partisanship enhances the effect of ideology, while ideological distance from the government has a different effect in the three regions. As protest gains in importance as a form of participation, the paper contributes to our understanding of regional divergence in the extent to which citizens with varying ideological views use this tool.","[{""name"": ""ENDRE BORBÁTH"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Sociology Freie Universität Berlin  Berlin Germany"", ""Center for Civil Society Research WZB Berlin Social Science Center  Berlin Germany""]}, {""name"": ""THERESA GESSLER"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Zurich  Zurich Switzerland"", ""Department of Political and Social Sciences European University Institute  Florence Italy""]}]","[""10.1093/0199276382.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0007123406000056"", ""10.1177/1354068812462931"", ""10.1080/13510340601024298"", ""10.1177/0022022118798505"", ""10.1017/S000712340999038X"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00718.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190860936.001.0001"", ""10.1017/psrm.2013.24"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3009623"", ""10.1017/9781108652780"", ""10.1080/14616696.2018.1494299"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816686513.003.0016"", ""10.2307/2010362"", ""10.1080/09668136.2014.905386"", ""10.1177/0010414019830717"", ""10.1017/9781108891660"", ""10.1515/9781400887828"", ""10.1057/jibs.2013.42"", ""10.1353/sof.2006.0034"", ""10.17813/maiq.10.3.730350353753l022"", ""10.1080/21599165.2015.1128900"", ""10.1017/S0003055409990220"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1068525"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00582"", ""10.1177/0010414009332136"", ""10.1017/S0007123411000421"", ""10.1177/0888325418756990""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The article maintains that cosmopraxis – as a complex pluriversal, multidimensional set of experiences – not only illustrates how relations relate without fixing their meaning, but also provides us with relevant insights to contribute to think of a pluriversal and more plural IR.","[{""name"": ""Amaya Querejazu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1463499612454119"", ""10.1093/isr/viv031"", ""10.1093/ips/oly005"", ""10.1177/0305829817693692"", ""10.1111/1467-9655.12062"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1378062"", ""10.1080/09502380903424208"", ""10.1093/isr/vix013"", ""10.1080/09557571.2019.1641470"", ""10.1017/S175297191000031X"", ""10.1007/s41111-018-0096-0"", ""10.1177/1474474013486067"", ""10.1177/0305829817702446"", ""10.18854/kpsr.2017.51.6.007"", ""10.1111/j.1548-1360.2010.01061.x""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Meanwhile, although Constrained Horn Clauses ($$\mathrm {CHCs}$$ CHCs ) empower a wide range of verification techniques and tools, they lack the ability to express hyperproperties beyond k-safety such as generalized non-interference and co-termination.This paper describes a novel and fully automated constraint-based approach to relational verification. We first introduce a new class of predicate Constraint Satisfaction Problems called $$\mathrm {pfwCSP}$$ pfwCSP where constraints are represented as clauses modulo first-order theories over predicate variables of three kinds: ordinary, well-founded, or functional. This generalization over $$\mathrm {CHCs}$$ CHCs permits arbitrary (i.e., possibly non-Horn) clauses, well-foundedness constraints, functionality constraints, and is capable of expressing these relational verification problems. Our approach enables us to express and automatically verify problem instances that require non-trivial (i.e., non-sequential and non-lock-step) self-composition by automatically inferring appropriate schedulers (or alignment) that dictate when and which program copies move. To solve problems in this new language, we present a constraint solving method for $$\mathrm {pfwCSP}$$ pfwCSP based on stratified CounterExample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) of ordinary, well-founded, and functional predicates.We have implemented the proposed framework and obtained promising results on diverse relational verification problems that are beyond the scope of the previous verification frameworks.","[{""name"": ""Hiroshi Unno"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tachio Terauchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eric Koskinen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0956796819000145"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_8"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062378"", ""10.1145/2678015.2682546"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009889"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21437-0_17"", ""10.1145/964001.964003"", ""10.1109/CSF.2007.30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_61"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23534-9_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_20"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314596"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.1109/CSF.2008.7"", ""10.1145/3371070"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32004-3_20"", ""10.1145/3324783"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_5"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837664"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737976"", ""10.1145/2254064.2254112"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38574-2_20"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8603013"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_38"", ""10.1007/11691372_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993525"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_2"", ""10.2168/LMCS-11(1:16)2015"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/11863908_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61470-6_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_17"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908099"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37036-6_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_9"", ""10.1145/1168857.1168907"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908092"", ""10.1145/1706299.1706315"", ""10.1007/11547662_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46669-8_25"", ""10.1145/1599410.1599445"", ""10.1145/1134744.1134750"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-68237-0_5"", ""10.1145/3192366.3192416"", ""10.1145/2784731.2784766""]","['Chemistry', 'Computer Science']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Organic Chemistry']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0703 化学', 0.7525), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7384)]]"
10.1017/S0007123418000522,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,Conceptions of National Identity and Ambivalence towards Immigration,"National identities are often conceived of as factors that lend structure and stability to citizens’ political opinions on issues such as immigration. While citizens who define national membership in ethno-cultural terms are less likely to support immigration, those with a civic conception are more likely to do so. The authors propose that defining national identity along both ethno-cultural and civic lines may give rise to conflicting considerations, leading people to experience ambivalence, implying that national identities may serve less as a stabilizing force than suggested by previous research. Findings from heterogeneous choice models and a unique survey experiment show that German citizens with mixed conceptions of national identity had more variable and more malleable opinions than individuals with ideal-type conceptions during the 2015/2016 European refugee crisis. The findings point to an identity-based source of ambivalence and extend current understandings of how people form attitudes towards immigration.","[{""name"": ""Emmy Lindstam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthias Mader"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Harald Schoen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11109-012-9199-8"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051580"", ""10.1111/1469-8219.00081"", ""10.1177/0010414002035005003"", ""10.2307/2131685"", ""10.4232/1.13047"", ""10.1080/01419870500352363"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-19869-9"", ""10.1017/S0007123406000354"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00450.x"", ""10.1057/9781403979094_2"", ""10.1111/ajps.12138"", ""10.1515/9780691188386-007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750717"", ""10.1515/9780691220192"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198792130.003.0003"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2007.00562.x"", ""10.1177/1536867X1101000402"", ""10.1080/09644008.2017.1366988"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00498.x"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.82.2.157"", ""10.1093/esr/jcq066"", ""10.1023/A:1015413506599"", ""10.1080/10705510903008204"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00716.x"", ""10.4159/9780674028944"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2007.00590.x"", ""10.1177/019791839502900404"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2004.01.002"", ""10.2307/2111669"", ""10.1515/9781400828081"", ""10.2307/1963942"", ""10.1515/9780691188386-006"", ""10.1080/13501763.2013.800796"", ""10.2307/2111583"", ""10.1177/019027250907200104"", ""10.1177/1465116502003004001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00841.x"", ""10.1177/000312240907400404"", ""10.1177/144078301128756193"", ""10.1057/ap.2011.10"", ""10.1093/jaarel/lfx005"", ""10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032813-153700"", ""10.1177/0306396805052517"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00187.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2006.07.002"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139028967"", ""10.1353/btf.2001.0011"", ""10.1111/amet.12259"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00885.x"", ""10.1177/1465116505057816"", ""10.1080/09644008.2013.832757"", ""10.1057/9780230290495"", ""10.1017/S0007123407000257"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199747542.001.0001"", ""10.15203/ozp.1587.vol46iss1"", ""10.1017/9781316584408"", ""10.1017/S000305540400098X"", ""10.2307/2669332"", ""10.1007/s11577-016-0370-9"", ""10.1177/0003122416663683"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2010.00446.x"", ""10.1177/106591298804100202"", ""10.1353/sof.2003.0038"", ""10.1080/01419870120112049""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

A growing body of scholarship considers how the ownership of such assets by individuals and households is reshaping patterns of class and inequality and accordingly requires the reconceptualisation of the latter phenomena. The significance of company-owned assets and corporate rents for class, inequality and their conceptualisation has not been considered, however. This article offers an exploratory investigation along these lines, highlighting the importance of employees’ working relationship to company-owned, rent-generating assets for their class position. The article further reflects on how developments in this regard might be approached from the perspective of Marx’s writing on value, labour and class, and the challenges that those developments potentially pose to Marxian concepts.","[{""name"": ""Brett Christophers"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social and Economic Geography, Uppsala University Uppsala Sweden""]}]","[""10.1257/aer.103.3.153"", ""10.1086/705396"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12238"", ""10.14318/hau5.1.027"", ""10.1057/jgm.2010.14"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.1978.tb00749.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.1984.tb00608.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t89fd6"", ""10.1086/210463""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Finance', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/isr/viz023,INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW,0302 Political Science,"China's ""Politics of Harmony"" and the Quest for Soft Power in International Politics","AbstractThis article engages with China's “politics of harmony” to investigate the dangers and possibilities of soft power as a concept and practice. Chinese sources claim that China will be able to exercise soft power due to its tradition of thinking about harmony. Indeed, the concept of harmony looms large in Chinese soft power campaigns, which differentiate China's own harmonious soft power from the allegedly disharmonious hard power of other great powers—in particular Western powers and Japan. Yet, similarly dichotomizing harmony discourses have been employed precisely in the West and Japan. In all three cases, such harmony discourses set a rhetorical trap, forcing audiences to empathize and identify with the “harmonious” self or risk being violently “harmonized.” There is no doubt that the soft power of harmony is coercive. More importantly, the present article argues that it has legitimized and enabled oppressive, homogenizing, and bellicose expansionism and rule in the West and Japan. A similarly structured exercise of soft power may enable violence in and beyond China, too. Ultimately, however, we argue that China's own tradition of thinking about harmony may help us to theorize how soft power might be exercised in less antagonistic and violent ways.","[{""name"": ""Linus Hagström"", ""affiliation"": [""Swedish Defence University""]}, {""name"": ""Astrid H M Nordin"", ""affiliation"": [""Lancaster University""]}]","[""10.2307/3351482"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-031821"", ""10.1177/1354066112445290"", ""10.1353/apr.2014.0019"", ""10.2307/1399898"", ""10.1111/1467-9256.12088"", ""10.59962/9780774824385"", ""10.1080/10670560903444207"", ""10.2307/2600810"", ""10.3402/egp.v1i1.1815"", ""10.2307/2539204"", ""10.1080/2158379X.2011.557886"", ""10.1080/23340460.2015.990798"", ""10.1017/S0260210515000157"", ""10.1353/jjs.2019.0002"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674284869.c2"", ""10.1093/cjip/poq005"", ""10.1093/irap/lcp023"", ""10.1057/9780230609921"", ""10.1093/cjip/pop001"", ""10.1057/palgrave.cpt.9300137"", ""10.1515/9780691213149"", ""10.1080/2158379X.2011.556869"", ""10.1080/09636410701547881"", ""10.1080/01495933.2010.520986"", ""10.1007/s12140-007-9028-6"", ""10.2307/j.ctt5hjrmh"", ""10.1057/9780230118447_3"", ""10.1007/s11712-008-9043-3"", ""10.1093/cjip/pon011"", ""10.1080/10670564.2013.843944"", ""10.1080/17460269709445789"", ""10.1353/apr.2012.0022"", ""10.4324/9781315671406"", ""10.1093/irap/lci103"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139858472.013"", ""10.1080/10670564.2015.1030949"", ""10.1093/isr/viv031"", ""10.1017/9781316869505"", ""10.1353/cul.2003.0040"", ""10.1215/00182168-67.2.271"", ""10.1177/1750635213516696"", ""10.1080/2158379X.2011.556346"", ""10.1080/21624887.2015.1103019"", ""10.1017/S1468109914000309"", ""10.1007/BF00992905"", ""10.3998/mpub.3918076"", ""10.1017/S0022463400010742"", ""10.1353/jod.2016.0007"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0041"", ""10.1177/03058298960250020601"", ""10.1177/0010836716648725"", ""10.1080/10670564.2015.1030913""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Expected to attain public sector goals and government ambitions in an effective fashion, it can be undertaken many different ways. The current literature on policy design features an ongoing debate between adherents of traditional approaches to the subject in the policy sciences and those importing into policymaking the insights of design practices in other fields such as industrial engineering and product development: ‘design-thinking’. Issues examined in more traditional approaches to policy design are very wide-ranging and address a wide variety of formulation modalities and their strengths and weaknesses. Efforts to promote ‘design-thinking’ in the public policy realm, on the other hand, focus on policy innovation and rarely deal with issues such as the barriers to implementation, political feasibility or the constraints under which decision-making takes place. This article discusses these differences and argues adherents of design-thinking need to expand their reach and consider not only the circumstances facilitating the generation of novel ideas but also the lessons of more traditional approaches concerning the political and other challenges faced in policy formulation and implementation.","[{""name"": ""Michael Howlett"", ""affiliation"": [""Simon Fraser University, Canada""]}]","[""10.1007/s11077-005-0156-9"", ""10.1007/s11115-006-0001-4"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02290.x"", ""10.2307/1882231"", ""10.1080/15710880802117113"", ""10.1111/1467-8500.12310"", ""10.2307/3323721"", ""10.1017/S0143814X98000117"", ""10.2307/1340395"", ""10.1002/pad.1789"", ""10.1111/1467-9299.00298"", ""10.1111/gove.12342"", ""10.1111/j.1747-1346.2012.00372.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1988.tb00583.x"", ""10.1016/j.eiar.2016.07.006"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2011.07.006"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2013.11.001"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00036.x"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2011.02.005"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00003287"", ""10.1111/ajps.12058"", ""10.1016/S0194-6595(05)80003-6"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.1994.tb00132.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9930.00065"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02223.x"", ""10.1111/j.1754-7121.2000.tb01152.x"", ""10.1016/S1449-4035(04)70030-2"", ""10.1007/s11077-014-9199-0"", ""10.1080/17516234.2017.1412284"", ""10.1177/0095399712459725"", ""10.17645/pag.v2i2.149"", ""10.4337/9781784719326"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1993.tb00505.x"", ""10.17645/pag.v1i2.95"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.2006.00189.x"", ""10.4159/9780674039278"", ""10.1007/s11077-009-9099-x"", ""10.1080/15710882.2017.1355003"", ""10.1017/S0143814X98000014"", ""10.1177/0270467608325375"", ""10.1017/S0007123400006244"", ""10.1080/15710880701875613"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00761.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1988.tb00892.x"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00007960"", ""10.1016/0149-7189(90)90061-Z"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1975.tb00780.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2009.01803.x"", ""10.4135/9781848608214.n18"", ""10.1111/j.0023-9216.2004.03801002.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-08228-2"", ""10.1007/s11077-018-9315-7"", ""10.2307/974646"", ""10.3138/9781442685529-008"", ""10.1111/1467-8500.12211"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2013.09.004"", ""10.1017/9781108555081"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2016.04.004"", ""10.1111/psj.12281"", ""10.1016/0142-694X(88)90047-6"", ""10.1080/13501763.2010.486991"", ""10.1080/0144287012000277480"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803963.007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790997"", ""10.1177/0952076717709522"", ""10.1023/A:1011251801044"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1986.tb00360.x"", ""10.1111/j.1541-1338.1992.tb00479.x"", ""10.1086/466935"", ""10.1017/S0143814X00004347"", ""10.1017/S0008423900055141"", ""10.4324/9781315624754"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6688(199923)18:4<558::AID-PAM2>3.0.CO;2-U""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Alternative forms of organizing have developed to overcome the deficiencies of contemporary capitalism. They have become prevalent in numerous institutional contexts through types of organizations such as social enterprises, cooperatives and platform-based sharing economy organizations. Our objective is to ignite research on alternative organizing. We build on two important institutional perspectives, Neo-institutionalism and Comparative Capitalism, to investigate how these organizations diverge from the archetypal corporation. In addition, we develop a framework to guide institutional analysis of the origins, enabling conditions and consequences of alternative organizing in contemporary markets and society. We conclude by laying out pathways for future research.","[{""name"": ""Johanna Mair"", ""affiliation"": [""Hertie School of Governance, Friedrichstraβe 180, Berlin 10117, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Nikolas Rathert"", ""affiliation"": [""Hertie School of Governance, Friedrichstraβe 180, Berlin 10117, Germany""]}]","[""10.5465/amr.2003.10196772"", ""10.1002/cb.1389"", ""10.1002/cb.333"", ""10.1177/0003122418803376"", ""10.1093/ser/mwt018"", ""10.1017/S1744137415000211"", ""10.5465/amj.2013.0903"", ""10.1080/10967494.2014.935231"", ""10.2307/799797"", ""10.5465/amj.2012.0194"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2010.01076.x"", ""10.1177/1476127005058996"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2019.01.005"", ""10.1086/318962"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv008"", ""10.1177/0170840600215003"", ""10.1287/orsc.1090.0521"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199286652.001.0001"", ""10.2307/256409"", ""10.2307/2667016"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2010.01.013"", ""10.5465/amp.2009.43479262"", ""10.1177/0032329213483110"", ""10.5465/amp.2015.0067"", ""10.1016/S0191-3085(00)22006-6"", ""10.2307/2095931"", ""10.1093/ser/mwl021"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2010.07.002"", ""10.1108/17506201011029528"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00370.x"", ""10.2307/2095101"", ""10.1007/s11186-007-9026-0"", ""10.2189/asqu.2010.55.1.114"", ""10.5465/amj.2011.0345"", ""10.1177/0003122418767438"", ""10.2307/4131489"", ""10.1016/S0742-3322(00)17003-2"", ""10.5465/amr.2012.0045"", ""10.1177/0018726717726861"", ""10.1177/017084068800900301"", ""10.2307/256645"", ""10.5465/amr.1996.9704071862"", ""10.1287/orsc.1090.0453"", ""10.5465/19416520.2011.590299"", ""10.1086/667721"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2014.09.002"", ""10.1007/s11266-016-9777-1"", ""10.2307/3096810"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199247757.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ser/mwn020"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199557738.001.0001"", ""10.1086/228951"", ""10.1016/j.infoandorg.2018.02.004"", ""10.1086/231132"", ""10.1287/orsc.12.4.414.10639"", ""10.1093/SER/mwi014"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx027"", ""10.1086/422928"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu031"", ""10.1086/603535"", ""10.1111/spol.12063"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X(2009)0000026002"", ""10.1080/03085140903190300"", ""10.5465/amj.2007.24634436"", ""10.1038/s41562-018-0352-1"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2008.04.006"", ""10.5465/amj.2012.0305"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.05.023"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1414-3"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.0627"", ""10.5465/amj.2015.0725"", ""10.5465/amj.2007.26279172"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.11.027"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139088299"", ""10.1177/0170840615580011"", ""10.2307/256809"", ""10.1086/226550"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00839.x"", ""10.5465/amr.2014.0183"", ""10.1177/0019793916639554"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691148670.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00678095"", ""10.2307/41165267"", ""10.1002/sej.1129"", ""10.5465/amr.2011.0436"", ""10.5465/amj.2016.0054"", ""10.1093/past/108.1.133"", ""10.1525/cmr.2015.57.3.36"", ""10.1016/S0733-558X(02)19002-1"", ""10.1093/ser/mwl006"", ""10.1177/000312240807300406"", ""10.1177/1536504214567860"", ""10.5465/amp.2007.27895339"", ""10.1177/0170840615580005"", ""10.1111/j.1370-4788.2005.00276.x"", ""10.1057/jibs.2014.38"", ""10.1177/0149206316633268"", ""10.1093/ser/mwq028"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.06.003"", ""10.1093/ser/mwy005"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-070110-122959"", ""10.2307/2392383"", ""10.1002/sej.1171"", ""10.5465/amr.2009.40632826"", ""10.2307/2393295"", ""10.2307/2667086"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X(2009)0000026005"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198293965.001.0001"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400285"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2014.12.001"", ""10.5465/amj.2015.0476"", ""10.1086/210178""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1017/S0020818320000041,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION,0302 Political Science,African Solutions to African Challenges: The Role of Legitimacy in Mediating Civil Wars in Africa,"AbstractThe current scholarly literature on the international mediation of civil wars draws predominantly on a rationalist-materialist perspective. This perspective suggests that the ticket to mediation success is the material manipulation of the bargaining environment by third parties with a high degree of economic and military resources. I argue that legitimacy also determines outcomes of mediation because if a mediator has legitimacy, it can continue to look for a mutually satisfactory outcome and try to pull the conflict parties toward compliance. I show that legitimacy matters by systematically comparing the effectiveness of African and non-African third parties. African third parties are typically considered ineffective because of a low degree of economic and military capacity. However, they effectively mediate civil wars in Africa because of a high degree of legitimacy, which is a result of a strong conviction within the African society of states that African mediation is the most desirable type in conflicts there. Drawing on data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program supplemented with unique data, which together cover all mediation efforts in Africa between 1960 and 2017, I find quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of African third parties. Compared to non-African ones, African third parties are far more likely to conclude negotiated settlements that are more likely to be durable. African third parties are especially effective if the conflict parties are highly committed to the African solutions norm. Theoretically, this study deviates from much of the literature that puts forward solely rationalist-materialist explanations of mediation success. By bringing legitimacy to the forefront, this article supplements the current mediation literature that emphasizes material sources of power and ignores social structures.","[{""name"": ""Allard Duursma"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/002081899550913"", ""10.1177/002200275800200106"", ""10.1017/S0020818309090080"", ""10.1108/IJCMA-02-2012-0020"", ""10.1177/0022343313512223"", ""10.1177/0022343313491587"", ""10.1163/138234007X223294"", ""10.1017/S0020818300013308"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674594388"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00339.x"", ""10.1177/0022343307075121"", ""10.1207/s15327957pspr0104_4"", ""10.4324/9780203884959"", ""10.1177/0022343318819123"", ""10.2307/2991857"", ""10.2307/2171753"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000090"", ""10.1515/9781400876549"", ""10.2307/2618930"", ""10.1017/S0003055409090236"", ""10.1515/9781400824465"", ""10.1198/07350010152472571"", ""10.1080/03050620903084547"", ""10.1111/j.1571-9979.1991.tb00599.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511549823"", ""10.1177/0022343311406157"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195061789.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1540-5907.00042"", ""10.1177/0022002713478565"", ""10.2307/2010277"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139858472.005"", ""10.1162/002081898550699"", ""10.1177/0022002796040004002"", ""10.1093/afraf/adq058"", ""10.1353/wp.2006.0027"", ""10.1177/0022002702046001004"", ""10.1177/0022002715611231"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511993428"", ""10.1177/0022002704264137"", ""10.1093/afraf/adm001"", ""10.5040/9781350223134""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1177/1532673X20972103,AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH,0302 Political Science,You've Lost That Loving Feeling: How Gender Shapes Affective Polarization,"We examine variation in levels of affective polarization for men and women. Using the 1980 to 2016 American National Election Studies, we find that women are more affectively polarized than men. The effect of sex partially works indirectly through political identities and issue positions. Moreover, sex acts as a moderator, with political identities and issues positions have different effects on men’s and women’s level of affective polarization. Three factors create women’s higher levels of affective polarization: women are more likely to be partisans, strength in abortion attitudes, and partisanship has a more substantial influence on women’s attitudes compared to men’s attitudes. Breaking the analysis apart into three time periods: (1) gender gap emergence 1980 to 1988, (2) elite polarization 1990 to 1998, and (3) hyper-partisanship 2000 to 2016 reinforces that partisan strength is central to understanding affective polarization. Additionally, during the 1990s when elite polarization is intensifying the strength of issue attitudes and ideology.","[{""name"": ""Heather Louise Ondercin"", ""affiliation"": [""Appalachian State University, Boone, NC, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Mary Kate Lizotte"", ""affiliation"": [""Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA""]}]","[""10.1177/1065912916675738"", ""10.1086/705817"", ""10.1037/h0036215"", ""10.1007/s11109-017-9391-y"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9468-2"", ""10.1080/21565503.2014.992793"", ""10.1017/S1743923X19000485"", ""10.1177/1065912916684031"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09539-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139094009"", ""10.3945/ajcn.117.152546"", ""10.1017/S000712341700059X"", ""10.1111/hcre.12028"", ""10.1017/S0007123418000285"", ""10.1177/1536867X1201100407"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790621.005"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000604"", ""10.1007/s12147-999-0013-9"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000414"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1111/ajps.12152"", ""10.1017/S1537592720004697"", ""10.1111/ajps.12366"", ""10.1093/poq/nfy014"", ""10.1023/A:1021824624892"", ""10.2307/2991838"", ""10.2307/3088434"", ""10.1017/psrm.2019.18"", ""10.1080/1554477X.2015.985151"", ""10.1016/j.soscij.2014.12.003"", ""10.1111/asap.12144"", ""10.1177/1478929917699416"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1086/297809"", ""10.1086/297871"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9061-1"", ""10.1177/1065912917716336"", ""10.1515/for-2018-0040"", ""10.1017/S1743923X19000254"", ""10.2307/3088412"", ""10.1111/pops.12040"", ""10.2307/2095824"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000153"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790652"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.73.4.733"", ""10.1177/1532673X17703132"", ""10.1515/9781400831241""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Within international relations (IR), such a canon emerged in the mid-twentieth century and is almost entirely male. Why are women thinkers absent from IR’s canon? We show that it is not due to a lack of international thought, or that this thought fell outside established IR theories. Rather it is due to the gendered and racialized selection and reception of work that is deemed to be canonical. In contrast, we show what can be gained by reclaiming women’s international thought through analyses of three intellectuals whose work was authoritative and influential in its own time or today. Our findings question several of the basic premises underpinning IR’s existing canon and suggest the need for a new research agenda on women international thinkers as part of a fundamental rethinking of the history and scope of the discipline.","[{""name"": ""KIMBERLY HUTCHINGS"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""PATRICIA OWENS"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/afa.0.0019"", ""10.1017/S0003055417000508"", ""10.1111/hypa.12438"", ""10.4324/9780203865903"", ""10.5040/9780755620609"", ""10.7312/tyso18396"", ""10.1086/491677"", ""10.4324/9781315858579"", ""10.1177/1354066110363501"", ""10.4324/9781315857299"", ""10.1093/monist/onu004"", ""10.1353/sgo.1968.0001"", ""10.1353/sgo.1975.0002"", ""10.1177/0305829811412432"", ""10.5040/9798400656446"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-58432-8_7"", ""10.2307/3025783"", ""10.1016/j.jhg.2014.05.029"", ""10.1177/0305829817694246"", ""10.1111/isqu.12060"", ""10.1111/j.0033-0124.1974.00008.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818313000209"", ""10.1057/9781403973757"", ""10.2307/199620"", ""10.5622/illinois/9780252042317.001.0001"", ""10.1080/07075332.2014.941904"", ""10.2307/199219"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy027"", ""10.1057/9781137516459"", ""10.1017/S1752971918000192"", ""10.1111/0018-2656.00120"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199299362.001.0001"", ""10.1353/afa.0.0027"", ""10.1017/S026021051700050X"", ""10.1017/S153778141400005X"", ""10.1353/jowh.2010.0060"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-3497-9"", ""10.4324/9781315772394"", ""10.1016/j.orbis.2015.02.005"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198278559.001.0001"", ""10.7312/sedg90478"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491429"", ""10.1515/9781400853649"", ""10.4324/9780203761472"", ""10.4324/9780203881842"", ""10.1111/hypa.12441"", ""10.1353/afa.0.0008"", ""10.1093/0199273677.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14616742.2011.534660"", ""10.1057/9780230623972"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511576089"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-22107-3"", ""10.1017/9781108859684"", ""10.1080/09612020601022246"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808784"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316084496"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139096829"", ""10.1111/ajph.12376""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

How can the public sector respond to this challenge? This article argues, first, that to continue to provide relevant solutions, public governance must be robust in the sense of adapting and innovating policies, programs, and services in ways that facilitate the achievement of basic public ambitions, functions, and values in the face of challenges, stressors, and threats. Second, to build robust governance, public managers must engage in bricolage and become bricoleurs in order to flexibly combine elements from competing and co‐existent public governance paradigms. Doing so necessitates the construction of institutions conducive to bricolage, that is, institutions that are characterized by a high degree of flexibility that allows for experimentation; institutions that foster inclusive deliberation, knowledge sharing and joint learning; and institutions that balance centralization with distributed agency.","[{""name"": ""Martin B.

10.1162/isec_a_00431,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY,0302 Political Science,Why Drones Have Not Revolutionized War: The Enduring Hider-Finder Competition in Air Warfare,"Abstract According to the accepted wisdom in security studies, unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones, have revolutionizing effects on war and world politics. Drones allegedly tilt the military balance in favor of the offense, reduce existing asymmetries in military power between major and minor actors, and eliminate close combat from modern battlefields. A new theory about the hider-finder competition between air penetration and air defense shows that drones are vulnerable to air defenses and electronic warfare systems, and that they require support from other force structure assets to be effective. This competition imposes high costs on those who fail to master the set of tactics, techniques, procedures, technologies, and capabilities necessary to limit exposure to enemy fire and to detect enemy targets. Three conflicts that featured extensive employment of drones—the Western Libya military campaign of the second Libyan civil war (2019–2020), the Syrian civil war (2011–2021), and the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (2020)—probe the mechanisms of the theory. Drones do not by themselves produce the revolutionary effects that many have attributed to them.","[{""name"": ""Antonio Calcara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Gilli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mauro Gilli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raffaele Marchetti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ivan Zaccagnini"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jopart/muab051,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,0302 Political Science; 1204 Public Administration,When Tensions Become Opportunities: Managing Accountability Demands in Collaborative Governance,"Abstract Accountability in collaborative governance comprises a tangled web of vertical and horizontal accountability relationships. Although different accountability mechanisms are apparently complementary, they also clash with each other, producing serious accountability tensions. This study explores how actors in collaborative governance experience and manage conflicting accountability demands in the context of a Korean interorganizational network. Using qualitative data based on in-depth interviews with 32 personnel across 10 organizations and document analysis, the study identifies different types of accountability tensions and actors’ strategic responses to them. The analysis reveals that accountability tensions vary across the sources of the demand, and they are more likely to emerge when there are gaps in procedural and institutional arrangements or differences in collaborators’ commitment levels. Findings suggest that accountability tensions inherent to collaborative networks, when harnessed and actively managed, may be viewed as opportunities for advancing the whole network’s mission and improving network accountability. Based on these findings, the study proposes a novel framework for accountability tensions in collaborative governance with propositions about the mechanisms through which accountability tensions emerge and are managed. The study provides insights into the complexities of maintaining accountability in cross-sector, multi-actor networks.","[{""name"": ""Seulki Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Singapore Management University""]}]","[""10.1081/PAD-120024403"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum032"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024307"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00482.x"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.05.002"", ""10.1177/0275074005282581"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2007.00378.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2008.00716.x"", ""10.1111/puar.12432"", ""10.1080/14719037.2019.1571275"", ""10.1177/0275074017744659"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2010.01099.x"", ""10.1086/225469"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2007.00650.x"", ""10.1177/1476127013481016"", ""10.1080/12294659.2009.10805136"", ""10.1093/jopart/mux015"", ""10.4324/9781315268620"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02332.x"", ""10.4324/9780203643457"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvab031"", ""10.1093/jopart/mun016"", ""10.3998/mpub.11924"", ""10.1080/14719030701763161"", ""10.1177/0275074012445780"", ""10.1177/0095399710362723"", ""10.1111/padm.12161"", ""10.1093/ppmgov/gvx019"", ""10.1080/15309576.2017.1400993"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2010.01083.x"", ""10.2307/258559"", ""10.1093/jopart/mum015"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut039"", ""10.2307/975901"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02547.x"", ""10.1093/jopart/mut027"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024289"", ""10.1080/14719037.2011.637407"", ""10.1093/jopart/muq050"", ""10.2307/2393788"", ""10.1080/10967490600899549"", ""10.1111/puar.12683"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur065"", ""10.1080/14719037.2012.743579"", ""10.1080/14719037.2019.1599056"", ""10.1111/puar.12886""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S0007123420000563,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,When Does Accommodation Work? Electoral Effects of Mainstream Left Position Taking on Immigration,"AbstractIn many countries, right-wing populist parties have gained electoral support by attracting voters from mainstream left parties. This has prompted public and scholarly debate about whether mainstream left parties can regain political power by taking a more restrictive position on immigration, a so-called accommodation strategy. However, selection bias confounds observational estimates of the effectiveness of this strategy. This letter reports the results of a survey experiment conducted among Danish voters during a unique political situation in which the mainstream left party's position on immigration is ambiguous, enabling experimental manipulation of voters' perceptions of the party's position. The authors show that, consistent with spatial models of politics, accommodation attracts anti-immigration voters and repels pro-immigration voters. Because repelled voters defect to other left parties, while attracted voters come from right parties, accommodation increases overall support for parties that support a mainstream left government. The results demonstrate that in some contexts, accommodation can improve the political prospects of the mainstream left.","[{""name"": ""Frederik Hjorth"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Vinæs Larsen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/2047-8852.12007"", ""10.1177/0032321716650224"", ""10.1017/XPS.2015.4"", ""10.2307/2111461"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2012.03.001"", ""10.1086/704436"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051701"", ""10.1080/10584609.2015.1052892"", ""10.1080/13501763.2019.1701532"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511510113"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000795"", ""10.1080/10584601003709381"", ""10.1017/S0003055420000234"", ""10.7910/DVN/QXBZOZ"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2005.06.012"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-58202-3"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00783.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This article opens up the black box of the agencies and zooms in on their CEO's and their perceptions of hierarchical accountability. The article focuses on felt accountability, denoting the manager's (a) expectation to have to explain substantive decisions to a parent department perceived to be (b) legitimate and (c) to have the expertise to evaluate those decisions. We explore felt accountability of agency‐CEO's and its institutional antecedents with a survey in seven countries combining insights from public administration and psychology. Our bottom‐up perspective reveals close connections between de facto control practices rather than formal institutional characteristics and felt accountability of CEO's of agencies. We contend that felt accountability is a crucial cog aligning accountability holders' expectations and behaviors by CEO's.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Schillemans"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht University  The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Sjors Overman"", ""affiliation"": [""Utrecht University  The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Paul Fawcett"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Melbourne  Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Matthew Flinders"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Sheffield  UK""]}, {""name"": ""Magnus Fredriksson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Gothenburg  Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Per Laegreid"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bergen  Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Martino Maggetti"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Lausanne  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Yannis Papadopoulos"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Lausanne  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Kristin Rubecksen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bergen  Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Lise Hellebø Rykkja"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bergen  Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Heidi Houlberg Salomonsen"", ""affiliation"": [""Aarhus University  Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Amanda Smullen"", ""affiliation"": [""Australian National University  Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Matt Wood"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Sheffield  UK""]}]","[""10.30636/jbpa.22.66"", ""10.1111/puar.12994"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2006.00313.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2006.00600.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199641253.013.0012"", ""10.1177/027507409602600101"", ""10.2307/825973"", ""10.1111/gove.12161"", ""10.4337/9781781956229"", ""10.1007/s10182-010-0141-2"", ""10.1080/09540962.2016.1162588"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu020"", ""10.1111/j.0081-1750.2003.t01-1-00125.x"", ""10.1177/0020852314564311"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2007.04.005"", ""10.1002/job.2052"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2016.09.007"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui011"", ""10.1177/109442819800100106"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.09.003"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(90)90011-W"", ""10.1111/padm.12058"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00434.x"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.255"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.111.3.490"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55269-3_33"", ""10.1177/009539978001200307"", ""10.1007/BF02438902"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00695.x"", ""10.1057/9781403943835"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.01935.x"", ""10.1080/01402382.2012.753704"", ""10.1080/14719037.2015.1103891"", ""10.1080/14719037.2020.1751254"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00093"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui045"", ""10.4324/9780203507148"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9930.2003.00147.x"", ""10.2307/975901"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02547.x"", ""10.1080/14719037.2015.1112423"", ""10.5553/Bk/092733872018027004005"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu024"", ""10.1080/09540962.2019.1660099"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4711.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jopart/mup040"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.00513"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.2307/3033716"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60287-7"", ""10.1093/jopart/mul012"", ""10.1057/9780230359512_2"", ""10.1080/14719037.2010.539111"", ""10.1002/pad.316"", ""10.1057/9780230359512"", ""10.18637/jss.v016.i09""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Public Administration', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/pops.12600,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,0302 Political Science; 0402 Psychology,Tracing the Gender Gap in Political Interest Over the Life Span: A Panel Analysis,"Despite recent advances in gender equality in political representation and the availability of resources, this article shows that there is a persistent gender gap in declared political interest over the life cycle. Using evidence from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), we track the gender gap through the life span of citizens. At age 15, there is already a substantial gender gap of 20 percentage points in the probability of respondents reporting being politically interested, pointing to gendered socialization processes as the key explanation for such differences. In the following 10 years, as people develop into adults and unravel their political orientations, the extent of the gender gap continues to grow by about 10 additional percentage points. Following these formative years, attitudes crystallize and so does the gender gap, remaining at the same size (around 30 percentage points of difference between women and men) over the life course. These findings suggest that the development of gender roles during early childhood is a crucial phase in the source of the gender gap, deserving further attention from scholars.","[{""name"": ""Marta Fraile"", ""affiliation"": [""Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP)""]}, {""name"": ""Irene Sánchez‐Vítores"", ""affiliation"": [""European University Institute""]}]","[""10.1177/0002764216689122"", ""10.1093/sf/sou103"", ""10.1126/science.aah6524"", ""10.1353/sof.2005.0005"", ""10.4159/9780674029088"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-7988-9_25"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.676"", ""10.1080/17457280701858623"", ""10.1007/s11199-013-0308-x"", ""10.1177/1065912913475874"", ""10.1177/0192513X14522245"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9059-8"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.796"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199751457.013.0013"", ""10.1017/S1743923X1700023X"", ""10.1080/01402382.2019.1577069"", ""10.1177/1065912914554040"", ""10.1007/s11109-012-9212-2"", ""10.1017/S0003055414000227"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12200"", ""10.1007/s11199-006-9156-2"", ""10.1057/9781137341310"", ""10.1017/S1743923X08000469"", ""10.2307/448396"", ""10.1037/a0017820"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608607.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511778797"", ""10.1017/S1743923X09000130"", ""10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00064-2"", ""10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-091908-164338"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609343"", ""10.1057/ap.2012.23"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00787.x"", ""10.4135/9781452275482"", ""10.1017/S1743923X15000628"", ""10.1017/S0022381610000149"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199755776.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717119.001.0001"", ""10.1093/sp/jxy038"", ""10.1353/sof.2005.0126"", ""10.1017/S1537592709992684"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00798.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2004.00162.x"", ""10.2307/2998592"", ""10.1093/esr/jcq046"", ""10.1177/0891243287001002002"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9142-9""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1017/S0260210522000080,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES,0302 Political Science,"The politics of (non-)knowledge at Europe's borders: Errors, fakes, and subjectivity","AbstractFrom statistical calculations to psychological knowledge, from profiling to scenario planning, and from biometric data to predictive algorithms, International Relations scholars have shed light on the multiple forms of knowledge deployed in the governing of populations and their political effects. Recent scholarship in critical border and security studies has drawn attention to ‘the other side of knowledge’ and has developed a vibrant conversation with the emergent interdisciplinary field of ignorance studies. This article proposes to advance these conversations on governing through non-knowledge by nuancing the analysis of power/(non-)knowledge/subjectivity relations. Firstly, we expand the analysis of non-knowledge by attending to the problematisation of errors and fakes in controversies at Europe's borders. Errors have emerged in relation to border actors’ practices and technologies, while migrant practices, documentation, and narratives are deemed to be potentially ‘fake’, ‘fraudulent’, or ‘false’. Secondly, we explore how different subjectivities are produced through regimes of error/truth and fake/authenticity. We argue that there are important epistemic differences between ‘fake’ and ‘error’, that they are entangled with different techniques of power and produce highly differentiated subjectivities. Finally, we attend to how these subjectivities are enacted within racialised hierarchies and ask whether non-knowledge can be mobilised to challenge these hierarchies.","[{""name"": ""Claudia Aradau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sarah Perret"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1468-5965.00263"", ""10.1215/10642684-8311814"", ""10.1080/03085147.2011.637330"", ""10.7146/qs.v5i2.104421"", ""10.1080/10345329.2011.12035906"", ""10.1111/ips.12073"", ""10.1177/0967010618783640"", ""10.1111/soc4.12600"", ""10.1163/25903276-bja10004"", ""10.1080/1354571X.2018.1501996"", ""10.1080/1362102042000257005"", ""10.1093/ips/oly010"", ""10.1177/0263775817716674"", ""10.1093/ips/olz030"", ""10.1177/0022343305050693"", ""10.1080/14650045.2020.1830764"", ""10.1017/S0260210511000386"", ""10.1093/ips/oly020"", ""10.1177/1354066117738854""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The literature analysing the correlates of government spending by policy area has mostly ignored these trade-offs inherent to policymaking, failing to address one of the most politically interesting and important dimensions of fiscal policy. Borrowing from the statistical literature on compositional data, we present more appropriate and efficient methods that explicitly incorporate the budget constraint into models of spending by budget category. We apply these methods to eight categories of spending from the American states over the years 1984–2009 to reveal winners and losers in the scramble for government spending. Our findings show that partisan governments finance their distinct priorities by raiding spending items that the opposition prefers, while different political institutions, economic conditions and state demographics impose different trade-offs across the budget.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Adolph"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Breunig"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Koski"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01621459.1962.10480664"", ""10.1017/S1537592715001218"", ""10.2307/2111530"", ""10.1177/153244000800800203"", ""10.1111/ajps.12204"", ""10.1177/106591290605900212"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.7.012003.104913"", ""10.1177/1532440015586315"", ""10.1097/PHH.0b013e31829ff709"", ""10.1017/S0022381611001149"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139135542"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5850.2011.00978.x"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00093.x"", ""10.1007/s11127-005-7524-z"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0343.2006.00171.x"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-4109-0"", ""10.1017/S0003055405051701"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2005.02.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107477650"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02160.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12121"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.05.009"", ""10.1177/1532440012453591"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.614158"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5850.2013.12007.x"", ""10.2307/2082709"", ""10.1111/0022-3816.00045"", ""10.2307/2083072"", ""10.2307/2111394"", ""10.1086/260997"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1993.tb01470.x"", ""10.1177/1354068800006001004"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139506762"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511730108"", ""10.1177/106591290305600403"", ""10.2307/3088385"", ""10.4324/9781315699189"", ""10.1177/1532440012438890"", ""10.1177/0958928709104736"", ""10.2307/1954537"", ""10.2307/2131244"", ""10.17310/ntj.2001.1.03"", ""10.2307/1958637"", ""10.1086/262065"", ""10.1016/S0304-4076(03)00092-7"", ""10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102209-152933"", ""10.1215/03616878-27-4-639""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)]]"
10.1093/ia/iiac023,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,0302 Political Science,The futility of the pandemic treaty: caught between globalism and statism,"Abstract In November 2021, the World Health Assembly (WHA) is hosting a special session to discuss the proposed plans for a pandemic treaty. Despite the fact that there are scant details concerning the treaty, the proposal has gained considerable support in both the academic community, and at the international level. While we agree that in the wake of the numerous governance failures during COVID-19, we need to develop appropriate global solutions to be able to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from future global health crises—and that such mechanisms should be rooted in global equity—we disagree, however, that this pandemic treaty, currently, is the most appropriate way in which to achieve this. Indeed, notions of global community, solidarity, fairness are far removed from the reality that we have seen unfolding in the actions of states responding to the pandemic. This is the crux of the tension with the proposed treaty: the balance between the ideal cosmopolitan worldview held by those in power in global health, and the practice of national security decision-making witnessed in the last 18 months. Indeed, we do not believe that a pandemic treaty will deliver what is being extolled by its proponents, and it will not solve the multiple problems of global cooperation in global health that supporters believe it will.","[{""name"": ""Clare Wenham"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Eccleston-Turner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maike Voss"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['General Health Professions', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1017/S0007123418000443,BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,0302 Political Science,The Future is a Moving Target: Predicting Political Instability,"AbstractPrevious research by Goldstone et al. (2010) generated a highly accurate predictive model of state-level political instability. Notably, this model identifies political institutions – and partial democracy with factionalism, specifically – as the most compelling factors explaining when and where instability events are likely to occur. This article reassesses the model’s explanatory power and makes three related points: (1) the model’s predictive power varies substantially over time; (2) its predictive power peaked in the period used for out-of-sample validation (1995–2004) in the original study and (3) the model performs relatively poorly in the more recent period. The authors find that this decline is not simply due to the Arab Uprisings, instability events that occurred in autocracies. Similar issues are found with attempts to predict nonviolent uprisings (Chenoweth and Ulfelder 2017) and armed conflict onset and continuation (Hegre et al. 2013). These results inform two conclusions: (1) the drivers of instability are not constant over time and (2) care must be exercised in interpreting prediction exercises as evidence in favor or dispositive of theoretical mechanisms.","[{""name"": ""Drew Bowlsby"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erica Chenoweth"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cullen Hendrix"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonathan D.

10.1007/s11615-020-00233-7,POLITISCHE VIERTELJAHRESSCHRIFT,0302 Political Science,The Dangers of Fiscal Decentralization and Public Service Delivery: a Review of Arguments,"AbstractThe prevailing belief is that local governments, which are closer to their citizens, can deliver public goods much more efficiently than a central government can. Yet skeptics argue that fiscal decentralization can be dangerous. The underlying motivation of this article is to review the basic rationale behind decentralizing public services from the perspective of three main controversies emerging from the literature on decentralization: (in)efficient, (un)equal, and (un)accountable service provision at the local level. For illustrative purposes, this review focuses on two complex and socially important sectors, health and education. The overall conclusion is that the dangers of decentralization are highly relevant to local public service provision, although there is evidence supporting both the decentralization-enthusiastic and the decentralization-skeptical views. When decentralizing public services, reformers should know the specificities of the public service, the local context, and the effects of the design of fiscal relations like the backs of their hands. If things go wrong, recentralization should be an option.","[{""name"": ""Helge Arends"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10101-013-0131-4"", ""10.1007/s10797-005-1500-x"", ""10.1177/1091142111424276"", ""10.1111/pirs.12305"", ""10.1093/publius/pjw042"", ""10.1111/spsr.12242"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2006.11.006"", ""10.1257/aer.90.2.135"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2003.01.001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01049.x"", ""10.1016/S0304-3878(00)00133-4"", ""10.1080/17487870.2015.1100084"", ""10.2307/2946699"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(99)00109-6"", ""10.1017/S0003055416000320"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511626883"", ""10.1093/heapol/czh052"", ""10.1002/j.1662-6370.2008.tb00109.x"", ""10.1108/14777260810893944"", ""10.1257/0002828054201314"", ""10.1080/0042098032000155696"", ""10.1016/0014-2921(92)90122-D"", ""10.1093/wbro/lkw001"", ""10.1086/605604"", ""10.1007/s00038-016-0872-2"", ""10.1007/0-387-29122-9"", ""10.1111/1468-0009.12327"", ""10.1068/a39195"", ""10.1017/S0026749X16000378"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2008.09.001"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00020-X"", ""10.1016/j.econmod.2016.12.010"", ""10.1023/A:1016563902580"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2012.08.002"", ""10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00077-8"", ""10.1257/jep.9.4.217"", ""10.1257/jep.11.4.43"", ""10.1068/c1081r"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2016.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.06.041"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.03.017"", ""10.1257/jel.41.4.1095"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-29233-5"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.04.024"", ""10.1016/j.econlet.2011.02.019"", ""10.1111/pirs.12061"", ""10.1068/a41296"", ""10.1068/a44267"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.003"", ""10.1007/s12116-015-9203-5"", ""10.1596/0-8213-4350-5"", ""10.1007/s10797-016-9416-1"", ""10.1080/01900692.2010.514467"", ""10.1111/joes.12182"", ""10.1080/00036846.2017.1340572"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2017.04.003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7679.2010.00504.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.10.016"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2005.07.011"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2009.11.002"", ""10.1093/publius/pju035"", ""10.2307/133460"", ""10.1257/jel.37.3.1120"", ""10.1007/s10797-005-1619-9"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807763"", ""10.1017/S0003055400125973"", ""10.1002/hpm.2506"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.1995.tb00223.x"", ""10.1016/0738-0593(93)90033-V"", ""10.1093/wbro/10.2.201"", ""10.1257/jep.11.4.83"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.02.005"", ""10.1017/S0020818303574021"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbp049"", ""10.1080/00343400500128390"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7660.1989.tb00340.x"", ""10.1016/S1573-4420(87)80006-X"", ""10.1093/oxrep/3.2.24"", ""10.1093/eurpub/ckn013"", ""10.2307/1925895"", ""10.2307/1925849"", ""10.1007/s42010-019-00059-2"", ""10.1016/S0305-750X(03)00098-6"", ""10.2307/2118402"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5890.2005.00014.x"", ""10.1080/00420989420080741"", ""10.1086/257839"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.081205.095418"", ""10.1017/9781108678384.006"", ""10.1007/BF02393147"", ""10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00073.x"", ""10.1086/260997"", ""10.1596/24757""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Accounting', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"

For this reason, the ECB’s decisions suffer from democratic authorization gaps; it makes choices with far-reaching consequences for which there is no clear basis in the mandate. In this context, courts can either opt to accept choices made by the ECB, as the ECJ has mostly done, or, as the Bundesverfassungsgericht decided to do, itself weigh in on monetary policy. Neither approach, we argue, can improve the tenuous democratic legitimacy of the ECB in the absence of proper democratic guidance. There are, however, ample ways the Member States and the EU’s political institutions can provide the ECB with guidance on how to deal with its new choices.","[{""name"": ""Nik de Boer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jens Van ’t Klooster"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Finance']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1093/jogss/ogaa024,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SECURITY STUDIES,0302 Political Science,Still Taboo? Citizens' Attitudes toward the Use of Nuclear Weapons,"AbstractHow robust is the “nuclear taboo”—the belief that it is wrong to use nuclear weapons—and can it be strengthened? In a series of experimental surveys, we investigate two mechanisms theorized to support the nuclear nonuse norm. First, we examine the moral foundation of the norm by testing whether respondents who receive descriptions of the aftermath of a nuclear blast will be less supportive of nuclear weapons use. Second, we assess the mechanism of self-interest by raising a sense of nuclear risk, and test whether varying the likelihood of nuclear retaliation affects support for a strike. We find that vivid information about the consequences of a nuclear strike, either in moral or self-interested terms, reduces support for nuclear use. These findings indicate that each of the two mechanisms may support the nuclear nonuse tradition, but that the strength of each mechanism is affected by exposure to vivid information.","[{""name"": ""Lisa Langdon Koch"", ""affiliation"": [""Claremont McKenna College""]}, {""name"": ""Matthew Wells"", ""affiliation"": [""Wabash College""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400832187"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226043463.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0003055411000219"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452.002"", ""10.1162/JCWS_a_00219"", ""10.1515/9781400830091"", ""10.1017/S0003055401002222"", ""10.2307/2600916"", ""10.2307/1914185"", ""10.2307/2600865"", ""10.1111/ajps.12201"", ""10.1017/S0022381614000073"", ""10.1080/026999300402763"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.81.1.146"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.127.2.267"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7709.2012.01042.x"", ""10.1017/9781316588307"", ""10.1515/9780804771009"", ""10.1017/S0003055412000597"", ""10.1353/book.3257"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511606861.005"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00284"", ""10.1093/isq/sqy033"", ""10.1162/002081899550959"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511491726"", ""10.1017/S0020818307070282"", ""10.1017/S0003055413000488"", ""10.1162/ISEC_a_00128""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

One rationale for consultations is that these improve procedural legitimacy and lead to greater acceptance of regulatory outcomes by citizens and the regulated industry. While this presumption of a positive relation between stakeholder consultations and the legitimacy of agencies is widespread, research analyzing this relationship remains scarce. Using a survey experiment, we examine the effect of open and closed consultations on the acceptance of procedures and regulatory outcomes in the field of environmental politics. The results demonstrate that consultation arrangements positively affect the acceptance of decision‐making procedures, especially when regulators grant access to different types of stakeholders. However, although the consultation arrangement itself does not directly affect acceptance of the regulatory outcome, procedural legitimacy matters, as it increases decision acceptance among individuals who are negatively disposed toward government regulation.","[{""name"": ""Jan Beyers"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Antwerp  Antwerp Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Sarah Arras"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Political Science University of Antwerp  Antwerp Belgium""]}]","[""10.1007/s11558-014-9212-6"", ""10.1111/jcms.12991"", ""10.1080/13501763.2017.1307438"", ""10.1177/0032321716667956"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.06.001"", ""10.1017/S0143814X19000126"", ""10.1111/gove.12089"", ""10.1080/10967494.2015.1024904"", ""10.1080/07036330701694899"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01567.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12165"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2009.00480.x"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12099"", ""10.1080/13501763.2014.923021"", ""10.1017/S0260210514000230"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511921452"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198785651.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0010414014565890"", ""10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01091.x"", ""10.1111/jcms.12525"", ""10.1017/S1755773910000238"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2011.02052.x"", ""10.1017/S0007123416000508"", ""10.1177/0010414015626445"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9477.2011.00268.x"", ""10.1017/S1755773913000131"", ""10.1111/puar.12194"", ""10.1111/gove.12021"", ""10.1080/13501763.2015.1076875"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12112"", ""10.1177/009539979702900304"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui022"", ""10.1037/lhb0000330"", ""10.17645/pag.v3i1.130"", ""10.1177/0020852311429667"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus048"", ""10.1111/puar.12047"", ""10.1111/rego.12278"", ""10.1177/001041402236310"", ""10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110316-113734"", ""10.1080/713601644"", ""10.1177/0002716204272371"", ""10.1080/01402389908425284"", ""10.2307/2110792"", ""10.1017/S002238161000023X"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5991.2009.01043.x"", ""10.1093/ser/mwv024"", ""10.1080/13572334.2015.1042292"", ""10.1177/0275074017734642"", ""10.2307/3003113"", ""10.1080/01402382.2015.1116199"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5965.2010.02147.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674596.003.0003"", ""10.1017/S0007123412000750"", ""10.1017/S1755773914000228"", ""10.1177/1465116513489777"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12036"", ""10.1080/13501763.2011.593356"", ""10.1007/BF00136406"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198295457.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2012.00962.x"", ""10.2307/3003160"", ""10.1111/1475-6765.12293"", ""10.2307/3053998"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190038"", ""10.1093/poq/nfn030"", ""10.1177/1465116517702004"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00347.x"", ""10.1177/0095399709339013"", ""10.1093/jopart/mus028"", ""10.1080/01402381003794597"", ""10.1093/jopart/mui042"", ""10.1093/jopart/muu007"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2508.2006.00375.x"", ""10.1017/S0020818300001673"", ""10.1111/rego.12098""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"
