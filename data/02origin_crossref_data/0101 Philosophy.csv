10.1017/epi.2018.32,EPISTEME-A JOURNAL OF INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,ECHO CHAMBERS AND EPISTEMIC BUBBLES,"ABSTRACTDiscussion of the phenomena of post-truth and fake news often implicates the closed epistemic networks of social media. The recent conversation has, however, blurred two distinct social epistemic phenomena. Anepistemic bubbleis a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been left out, perhaps accidentally. Anecho chamberis a social epistemic structure from which other relevant voices have been actively excluded and discredited. Members of epistemic bubbles lack exposure to relevant information and arguments. Members of echo chambers, on the other hand, have been brought to systematically distrust all outside sources. In epistemic bubbles, other voices are not heard; in echo chambers, other voices are actively undermined. It is crucial to keep these phenomena distinct. First, echo chambers can explain the post-truth phenomena in a way that epistemic bubbles cannot. Second, each type of structure requires a distinct intervention. Mere exposure to evidence can shatter an epistemic bubble, but may actually reinforce an echo chamber. Finally, echo chambers are much harder to escape. Once in their grip, an agent may act with epistemic virtue, but social context will pervert those actions. Escape from an echo chamber may require a radical rebooting of one's belief system.","[{""name"": ""C.

10.1186/s12910-021-00687-3,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Privacy and artificial intelligence: challenges for protecting health information in a new era,"Abstract Background Advances in healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) are occurring rapidly and there is a growing discussion about managing its development. Many AI technologies end up owned and controlled by private entities. The nature of the implementation of AI could mean such corporations, clinics and public bodies will have a greater than typical role in obtaining, utilizing and protecting patient health information. This raises privacy issues relating to implementation and data security. Main body The first set of concerns includes access, use and control of patient data in private hands. Some recent public–private partnerships for implementing AI have resulted in poor protection of privacy. As such, there have been calls for greater systemic oversight of big data health research. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to maintain privacy and patient agency. Private custodians of data can be impacted by competing goals and should be structurally encouraged to ensure data protection and to deter alternative use thereof. Another set of concerns relates to the external risk of privacy breaches through AI-driven methods. The ability to deidentify or anonymize patient health data may be compromised or even nullified in light of new algorithms that have successfully reidentified such data. This could increase the risk to patient data under private custodianship. Conclusions We are currently in a familiar situation in which regulation and oversight risk falling behind the technologies they govern. Regulation should emphasize patient agency and consent, and should encourage increasingly sophisticated methods of data anonymization and protection.","[{""name"": ""Blake Murdoch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/svn-2017-000101"", ""10.1016/j.jacc.2018.03.521"", ""10.1016/j.radonc.2018.05.030"", ""10.1111/eci.12901"", ""10.1002/rcs.1968"", ""10.1097/SLA.0000000000002693"", ""10.17863/CAM.25624"", ""10.1145/212094.212114"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1714229"", ""10.1145/3233547.3233667"", ""10.1007/s12553-017-0179-1"", ""10.1136/bmj.j2439"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0307-0"", ""10.1016/j.carj.2019.03.001"", ""10.1177/1073110518766026"", ""10.1016/S1361-3723(20)30059-2"", ""10.1126/science.1229566"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.6040"", ""10.1126/science.aau4832"", ""10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00143"", ""10.1109/JBHI.2020.2980262"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocy142""]",['Medicine'],"['Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Physiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"
10.1007/s11948-019-00165-5,SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,"From What to How: An Initial Review of Publicly Available AI Ethics Tools, Methods and Research to Translate Principles into Practices","AbstractThe debate about the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence dates from the 1960s (Samuel in Science, 132(3429):741–742, 1960. 10.1126/science.132.3429.741; Wiener in Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine, MIT Press, New York, 1961). However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles—the ‘what’ of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)—rather than on practices, the ‘how.’ Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community’s ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology, the initial findings, and provides a summary of future research needs.","[{""name"": ""Jessica Morley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luciano Floridi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Libby Kinsey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anat Elhalal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3173574.3174156"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2018.2884923"", ""10.1080/09528130050111428"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-67280-9_9"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9495-z"", ""10.1177/1461444816676645"", ""10.1515/pjbr-2018-0024"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-58469-0_30"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9447-7"", ""10.1111/phil.12025"", ""10.1007/s00146-018-0848-2"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0263-5"", ""10.1109/MSP.2018.2701147"", ""10.1145/3173574.3173951"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04226-4"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0080"", ""10.1007/s11948-017-9901-7"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0304-8"", ""10.1007/s12394-010-0053-z"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2019.04.007"", ""10.1007/s11948-010-9233-3"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3388669"", ""10.1038/538311a"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0337-z"", ""10.1007/s10515-014-0168-9"", ""10.1080/21670811.2014.976411"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aao5580"", ""10.1007/s12130-010-9118-4"", ""10.1109/MSP.2018.2701152"", ""10.1098/rsta.2016.0112"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9733-2"", ""10.1007/s11023-017-9438-1"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0081"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0055-y"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198833635.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00354-x"", ""10.1162/99608f92.8cd550d1"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1098/rsta.2016.0360"", ""10.1609/aimag.v38i3.2741"", ""10.12775/setf.2018.015"", ""10.1145/3236009"", ""10.1177/0191453714545340"", ""10.1007/s11948-014-9565-5"", ""10.1126/science.aax0162"", ""10.1109/DISA.2018.8490530"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9467-3"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1477967"", ""10.1093/qje/qjx032"", ""10.1016/j.coisb.2017.07.001"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0084"", ""10.1007/s10676-019-09503-4"", ""10.1145/3097983.3098066"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0279-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-22906-5_17"", ""10.1108/JICES-08-2013-0030"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2010.11.003"", ""10.2307/25750707"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287596"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.1057/ejis.2013.18"", ""10.1108/DPRG-11-2018-0068"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9452-x"", ""10.1007/s10676-019-09502-5"", ""10.1126/science.132.3429.741"", ""10.1109/MSP.2018.2701164"", ""10.1126/science.aat5991"", ""10.1007/s10676-006-9128-9"", ""10.1007/s10676-009-9187-9"", ""10.1093/idpl/ipx005"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17287-9_4""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

10.1136/medethics-2019-105586,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology; 0503 Journalism and Communication; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,On the ethics of algorithmic decision-making in healthcare,"In recent years, a plethora of high-profile scientific publications has been reporting about machine learning algorithms outperforming clinicians in medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-making in healthcare.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Grote"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philipp Berens"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/s41591-018-0316-z"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0300-7"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.17216"", ""10.1038/nature21056"", ""10.1177/2167702617691560"", ""10.1057/9781137315601"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0320-3"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0107-6"", ""10.1215/00318108-2006-035"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.4159/9780674977860"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.98.4.506"", ""10.1093/mind/fzq070"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276011.003.0011"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198826903.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1539-6053.2008.00033.x"", ""10.1111/jep.12374"", ""10.1016/j.dsp.2017.10.011"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-105118"", ""10.4324/9781351028264-25"", ""10.1111/japp.12360"", ""10.1007/s11948-012-9413-4"", ""10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1"", ""10.1111/phc3.12506"", ""10.1093/phe/php033"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9652-2"", ""10.1002/hast.973"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198747048.003.0011"", ""10.1086/288768"", ""10.2307/3561321"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhu037"", ""10.2307/3090183""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

On the epistemological and ethical basis of trust in medical AI,"The use of black box algorithms in medicine has raised scholarly concerns due to their opaqueness and lack of trustworthiness. Concerns about potential bias, accountability and responsibility, patient autonomy and compromised trust transpire with black box algorithms. These worries connect epistemic concerns with normative issues. In this paper, we outline that black box algorithms are less problematic for epistemic reasons than many scholars seem to believe. By outlining that more transparency in algorithms is not always necessary, and by explaining that computational processes are indeed methodologically opaque to humans, we argue that the reliability of algorithms provides reasons for trusting the outcomes of medical artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, we explain how computational reliabilism, which does not require transparency and supports the reliability of algorithms, justifies the belief that results of medical AI are to be trusted. We also argue that several ethical concerns remain with black box algorithms, even when the results are trustworthy. Having justified knowledge from reliable indicators is, therefore, necessary but not sufficient for normatively justifying physicians to act. This means that deliberation about the results of reliable algorithms is required to find out what is a desirable action. Thus understood, we argue that such challenges should not dismiss the use of black box algorithms altogether but should inform the way in which these algorithms are designed and implemented. When physicians are trained to acquire the necessary skills and expertise, and collaborate with medical informatics and data scientists, black box algorithms can contribute to improving medical care.","[{""name"": ""Juan Manuel Durán"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karin Rolanda Jongsma"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/s41746-017-0012-2"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0300-7"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0316-z"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.17163"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674736061"", ""10.1007/s11229-008-9435-2"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1606181"", ""10.1038/s41746-017-0012-2"", ""10.1126/science.aal4321"", ""10.1038/nature21056"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1477967"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3921-3"", ""10.1177/1461444816676645"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.15779/Z38BG31"", ""10.1126/science.aal4230"", ""10.1038/s41746-019-0194-x"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105586"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0048-x"", ""10.1093/0195158709.003.0002"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9487-0"", ""10.1145/3236009"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9481-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90882-3"", ""10.1007/s11023-007-9061-7"", ""10.5840/monist19998215"", ""10.1145/2090236.2090255"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511760396"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199933662.001.0001"", ""10.1155/2019/8072928"", ""10.1200/JOP.18.00417"", ""10.1007/s10728-008-0108-6"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-105118"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09537-4"", ""10.1007/s11948-011-9254-6"", ""10.1001/jama.2015.18421"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31925-1"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870052"", ""10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1"", ""10.1017/S0963180118000130"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0330-6"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1002689"", ""10.1007/s00146-020-00960-w"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105935"", ""10.1177/0093854808326545""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Safety Research']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Evidence from Italy","AbstractWhile a growing number of firms are being evaluated on environment, social and governance (ESG) criteria by sustainability rating agencies (SRAs), comparatively little is known about companies’ responses. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with companies operating in Italy, the present paper seeks to narrow this gap in current understanding by examining how firms react to ESG ratings, and the factors influencing their response. Unique to the literature, we show that firms may react very differently to being rated, with our analysis yielding a fourfold typology of corporate responses. The typology captures conformity and resistance to ratings across two dimensions of firm behaviour. We furthermore show that corporate responses depend on managers’ beliefs regarding the material benefits of adjusting to and scoring well on ESG ratings and their alignment with corporate strategy. In doing so, we challenge the idea that organisational ratings homogenise organisations and draw attention to the agency underlying corporate responses. Our findings also contribute to debates about the impact of ESG ratings, calling into question claims about their positive influence on companies’ sustainability performance. We conclude by discussing the wider empirical, theoretical and ethical implications of our paper.","[{""name"": ""Ester Clementino"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Richard Perkins"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10551-007-9600-4"", ""10.1002/csr.1410"", ""10.1177/0007650319873654"", ""10.2469/faj.v74.n3.2"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3213-8"", ""10.1177/0170840618765028"", ""10.1002/bse.1919"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2008.10.004"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00246"", ""10.1002/csr.1336"", ""10.1093/hebz/9780198797753.001.0001"", ""10.4135/9781849200387.n3"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1177/0007650315570701"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275684"", ""10.1111/jacf.12296"", ""10.1002/smj.840"", ""10.1002/smj.2407"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1252-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2160-5"", ""10.1080/24694452.2017.1293502"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-110615-090105"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2004.04.002"", ""10.1093/hebz/9780198810070.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0539018406069584"", ""10.1002/csr.1452"", ""10.1002/bse.1968"", ""10.1002/bse.1865"", ""10.1177/0018726704044954"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-13566-3_24"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2432-0"", ""10.2307/2095101"", ""10.5465/amr.1995.9503271992"", ""10.1525/cmr.2012.54.2.25"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04164-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2981-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04177-w"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3212685"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9237-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1622-5"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2017.02.001"", ""10.2307/2393938"", ""10.1086/517897"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.313"", ""10.5465/amj.2011.0744"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3695-z"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-4502-8_6"", ""10.5465/amle.2002.7373729"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3688-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0686-8"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.07.005"", ""10.1002/bse.1979"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1844-6"", ""10.1057/9781137023032_2"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04200-0"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2010.11.001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2012.00349.x"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2009.02.006"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4014-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0814-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04190-z"", ""10.1111/ejed.12060"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2051-9"", ""10.1287/orsc.1050.0144"", ""10.1086/226550"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2014.03.004"", ""10.5465/amr.1997.9711022105"", ""10.5465/19416520.2015.1011522"", ""10.5465/amr.1991.4279002"", ""10.1002/bse.1761"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2011.11.033"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1630-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1419-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9235-x"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2017.11.003"", ""10.1002/bse.1934"", ""10.1002/smj.4250150904"", ""10.1177/0149206317741962"", ""10.1002/csr.1299"", ""10.1177/000312240907400104"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0250-6"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2011.11.005"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1701-7"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.05.022"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2323-4"", ""10.1177/0003122414559043"", ""10.1086/681534"", ""10.1002/bse.2049"", ""10.1177/0007650315575291"", ""10.1177/0170840612443628"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.180"", ""10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331"", ""10.1007/s11266-012-9290-0"", ""10.1108/MD-01-2017-0018"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2960-2"", ""10.1177/0735275112457914"", ""10.2307/258135"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2610-8""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1007/s10551-021-04850-z,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,"Shareholder Engagement on Environmental, Social, and Governance Performance","AbstractWe study behind-the-scenes investor activism promoting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) improvements by means of a proprietary dataset of a large international, socially responsible activist fund. We examine the activist’s target selection, forms of engagement, impact on ESG performance, drivers of success, and effects on the targets’ operations and value creation. Target firms are typically large and visible, perform well, and have high liquidity (stock turnover) and low ESG performance. Engagement induces ESG rating adjustments: firms with poor ex ante ESG ratings experience a ratings increase after complying with the activist’s demands, whereas firms with high ex ante ESG ratings experience a ratings decrease following the revelation of their ESG problems. Activism that is focused on environmental and social issues is more likely to succeed if targets are ESG-sensitive (i.e., they have a strong ex ante ESG profile). Successful engagements boost targets’ sales. Risk-adjusted excess stock returns (with four-factor adjustment and relative to a matched sample of non-engaged firms) of successful engagements outperform those of unsuccessful engagements by 2.7%. Results are especially strong for firms with low ex ante ESG scores. Specifically, targeted firms in the lowest ex ante ESG quartile outperform matched peers by 7.5% in the year after the end of the engagement. Our results thus suggest that the activism regarding corporate social responsibility generally improves ESG practices and corporate sales and is profitable to the activist. Taken together, we provide direct evidence that ethical investing and strong financial performance, both from the activist’s and the targeted firm’s perspective, can go hand-in-hand together.","[{""name"": ""Tamas Barko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martijn Cremers"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luc Renneboog"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1287/mnsc.2018.3043"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2410-6"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2007.05.008"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhn099"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhx048"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhn054"", ""10.1257/aer.96.5.1652"", ""10.1086/648293"", ""10.1017/S0022109000004142"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2017.12.026"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.08.008"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01373.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-036X.2012.00643.x"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhp057"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000004598.89426.d8"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.10.002"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhv044"", ""10.1093/rof/rfz008"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2981-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2610-8"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.08.013"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.03.021"", ""10.5465/amp.2012.0046"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2011.02.007"", ""10.1016/S0929-1199(03)00020-8"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2015.12.003"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2014.2038"", ""10.1093/rof/rfr040"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0260-4"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6622.2007.00125.x"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2008.05.005"", ""10.3386/w21215"", ""10.3386/w18476"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01432.x"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhr016"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.09.008"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4074-0"", ""10.1057/s41299-016-0008-x"", ""10.1023/A:1006082125886"", ""10.1093/oxrep/graa010"", ""10.1111/jofi.12505"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9807-z"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2005.07.002"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9621-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3392-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1237-2"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2007.12.039"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2008.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.jfi.2010.12.003"", ""10.1007/s11573-013-0667-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9037-1"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1120.1630"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1514-0"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1996.tb05208.x"", ""10.1214/09-STS313""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Accounting', 'Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

Therefore, we investigate this relationship in the revelatory case of initial public offerings (IPOs), which represent the first sale of common stock to the wider public. IPOs are characterised by strong information asymmetry between firm insiders and society, while at the same time suffering from uncertainty in firm legitimacy, culminating in amplified financial risks for both issuers and investors in aftermarket trading. Using data from the United States, we demonstrate that (1) voluntary ESG disclosure reduces idiosyncratic volatility and downside tail risk and (2) higher ESG ratings have lower associated firm-specific volatility and downside tail risk during the first year of trading in the aftermarket. We provide theoretical arguments for the relationships observed, suggesting that companies striving for ESG performance and communicating their efforts signal their compliance with sustainability-related norms, thus acquiring and upholding a societal license to operate. ESG performance and disclosure help companies build their reputation capital with investors after going public. We also report that ESG disclosure is a more consistent proxy for ex-ante uncertainty as an indicator of aftermarket risk, thereby replacing some of the more conventional measures, such as firm age, offered in the existing literature.","[{""name"": ""Beat Reber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Agnes Gold"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stefan Gold"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/09513570410567791"", ""10.1111/1467-9965.00068"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-2004-8"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2019.07.006"", ""10.1017/S0022109009990159"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1982.tb03591.x"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(86)90055-3"", ""10.1086/467359"", ""10.1111/1540-6288.00051"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-04-2012-00998"", ""10.1016/j.jempfin.2013.04.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3017-x"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhp041"", ""10.2308/accr.2006.81.5.983"", ""10.1046/j.1540-6261.2003.00607.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6803.1992.tb00117.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1990.tb02426.x"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2011.11.007"", ""10.1111/j.1755-053X.2012.01201.x"", ""10.1023/A:1017953517947"", ""10.1017/S0022109000003057"", ""10.1111/jbfa.12060"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1682-6"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2015.02.020"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04164-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04177-w"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00627.x"", ""10.1046/j.1475-679X.2003.00124.x"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6622.2011.00357.x"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(93)90023-5"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(96)00896-3"", ""10.1017/S0022109010000487"", ""10.1016/j.bar.2016.08.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9331-y"", ""10.1080/20430795.2015.1118917"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1607-9"", ""10.1007/s10479-019-03323-x"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-06-2015-2088"", ""10.1111/jscm.12006"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2009.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2015.12.002"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5957.2010.02182.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04451-2"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2010.12.005"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3261-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3874-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1741-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2850-7"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2015.04.007"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4065-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04663-6"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(99)00027-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9659-y"", ""10.1002/bse.1863"", ""10.2307/2326770"", ""10.2307/1924119"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(02)00144-7"", ""10.1023/A:1024128730308"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1991.tb03770.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3328-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4057-1"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhm040"", ""10.2307/1910098"", ""10.1111/j.0306-686X.2004.00553.x"", ""10.1023/A:1017516826427"", ""10.1177/000765030104000402"", ""10.1111/1540-6261.00587"", ""10.2308/accr.2004.79.4.1119"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3229-0"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhg055"", ""10.1086/296260"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(87)90005-5"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1991.tb03743.x"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(86)90054-1"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1988.tb04591.x"", ""10.1177/0149206320902528"", ""10.1080/20430795.2019.1625012"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2011.02.003"", ""10.3390/su13031392"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3596-1"", ""10.1080/00014788.2018.1470141"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2684-3"", ""10.1086/377033"", ""10.1108/JFC-10-2014-0044""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Accounting', 'Strategy and Management', 'Finance']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)]]"
10.1007/s11948-020-00228-y,SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,"In AI We Trust: Ethics, Artificial Intelligence, and Reliability","AbstractOne of the main difficulties in assessing artificial intelligence (AI) is the tendency for people to anthropomorphise it. This becomes particularly problematic when we attach human moral activities to AI. For example, the European Commission’s High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) have adopted the position that we should establish a relationship of trust with AI and should cultivate trustworthy AI (HLEG AI Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI, 2019, p. 35). Trust is one of the most important and defining activities in human relationships, so proposing that AI should be trusted, is a very serious claim. This paper will show that AI cannot be something that has the capacity to be trusted according to the most prevalent definitions of trust because it does not possess emotive states or can be held responsible for their actions—requirements of the affective and normative accounts of trust. While AI meets all of the requirements of the rational account of trust, it will be shown that this is not actually a type of trust at all, but is instead, a form of reliance. Ultimately, even complex machines such as AI should not be viewed as trustworthy as this undermines the value of interpersonal trust, anthropomorphises AI, and diverts responsibility from those developing and using them.","[{""name"": ""Mark Ryan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/MTS.2018.2876107"", ""10.1109/MTS.2019.2915154"", ""10.1086/292745"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9448-6"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9249-z"", ""10.1007/s00146-009-0208-3"", ""10.1007/s10676-011-9279-1"", ""10.1111/j.2153-960X.2012.00546.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8975.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-0009.00223"", ""10.1007/s10676-008-9167-5"", ""10.1080/00048409412345881"", ""10.2307/2216409"", ""10.29297/orbit.v2i2.112"", ""10.1007/s10676-006-9111-5"", ""10.1086/233694"", ""10.29297/orbit.v2i2.106"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004"", ""10.29297/orbit.v2i1.102"", ""10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1"", ""10.1080/00048400801886413"", ""10.1007/s12130-010-9124-6"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511606250"", ""10.29297/orbit.v2i1.101"", ""10.29297/orbit.v2i2.109"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00130-2"", ""10.1007/s10806-019-09812-0"", ""10.29297/orbit.v2i2.110"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2012.01438.x"", ""10.1177/0306312717741687"", ""10.1007/s11023-010-9201-3"", ""10.4018/jthi.2009040102"", ""10.1007/s13347-014-0165-8"", ""10.1023/B:ETIN.0000006947.66879.13"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511618024"", ""10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2019.08.010""]","['Neuroscience', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the ability of AI systems to make automated and self-learned decisions, a call for transparency of how such systems reach decisions has echoed within academic and policy circles. The term transparency, however, relates to multiple concepts, fulfills many functions, and holds different promises that struggle to be realized in concrete applications. Indeed, the complexity of transparency for ADM shows tension between transparency as a normative ideal and its translation to practical application. To address this tension, we first conduct a review of transparency, analyzing its challenges and limitations concerning automated decision-making practices. We then look at the lessons learned from the development of Privacy by Design, as a basis for developing the Transparency by Design principles. Finally, we propose a set of nine principles to cover relevant contextual, technical, informational, and stakeholder-sensitive considerations. Transparency by Design is a model that helps organizations design transparent AI systems, by integrating these principles in a step-by-step manner and as an ex-ante value, not as an afterthought.","[{""name"": ""Heike Felzmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eduard Fosch-Villaronga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christoph Lutz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aurelia Tamò-Larrieux"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3173574.3174156"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870052"", ""10.1177/1461444816676645"", ""10.1007/s00146-019-00931-w"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.06.001"", ""10.2307/3250921"", ""10.1177/1354856517736978"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2007.00378.x"", ""10.1007/s10676-013-9321-6"", ""10.1177/0003122417725865"", ""10.1093/socpro/spaa004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511845239.004"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2019.105367"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04226-4"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.17351/ests2020.277"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00146-8"", ""10.1145/3278721.3278765"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0293-z"", ""10.1007/978-1-4302-6356-2"", ""10.1145/2844110"", ""10.1145/3278721.3278745"", ""10.1177/2053951716665128"", ""10.1109/MSP.2018.2701152"", ""10.5465/amr.1989.4279003"", ""10.1007/s10676-009-9192-z"", ""10.1145/3173574.3174006"", ""10.1177/2053951719860542"", ""10.1109/MRA.2019.2904644"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199917693.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1465116517723499"", ""10.1080/09614520701469955"", ""10.1002/9780470281819.ch4"", ""10.1609/aimag.v38i3.2741"", ""10.1111/puar.12047"", ""10.4324/9780203427644"", ""10.5871/bacad/9780197263839.001.0001"", ""10.1080/21582041.2018.1563803"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1086/233694"", ""10.1080/13600869.2017.1298499"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1477967"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2020.1761860"", ""10.1177/0162243918793711"", ""10.1109/VLHCC.2013.6645235"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0279-x"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00519"", ""10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2018.07.007"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.1177/0162243915598056"", ""10.1007/BF02639315"", ""10.1109/2.910905"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674736061"", ""10.1145/3173574.3173677"", ""10.1080/10627260802153421"", ""10.1177/0170840618759817"", ""10.4324/9781315658698"", ""10.2307/j.ctvhrcz0v"", ""10.5465/amr.1998.926617"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2010.11.009"", ""10.1177/2053951717738104"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mp9.30"", ""10.1093/idpl/ipx022"", ""10.1177/2053951720923377"", ""10.1177/1367549415577392"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98624-1"", ""10.1016/S0016-3287(97)00035-9"", ""10.1007/s11948-011-9343-6"", ""10.1145/3173574.3174014"", ""10.1093/idpl/ipx005"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372833"", ""10.1177/0007650305275299"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0330-6""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1186/s12910-021-00577-8,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Artificial intelligence for good health: a scoping review of the ethics literature,"AbstractBackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) has been described as the “fourth industrial revolution” with transformative and global implications, including in healthcare, public health, and global health. AI approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global health perspective?MethodsEight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed.ResultsUpon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).ConclusionsThe ethical issues surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.","[{""name"": ""Kathleen Murphy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erica Di Ruggiero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ross Upshur"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Donald J.

10.1007/s10551-019-04160-5,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Circularity Brokers: Digital Platform Organizations and Waste Recovery in Food Supply Chains,"AbstractIn recent years, researchers and practitioners have increasingly paid attention to food waste, which is seen as highly unethical given its negative environmental and societal implications. Waste recovery is dependent on the creation of connections along the supply chain, so that actors with goods at risk of becoming waste can transfer them to those who may be able to use them as inputs or for their own consumption. Such waste recovery is, however, often hampered by what we call ‘circularity holes’, i.e., missing linkages between waste generators and potential receivers. A new type of actor, the digital platform organization, has recently taken on a brokerage function to bridge circularity holes, particularly in the food supply chain. Yet, extant literature has overlooked this novel type of brokerage that exploits digital technology for the transfer and recovery of discarded resources between supply chain actors. Our study investigates this actor, conceptualized as a ‘circularity broker’, and thus unites network research and circular supply chain research. Focusing on the food supply chain, we adopt an interpretive inductive theory-building approach to uncover how platform organizations foster the recovery of waste by bridging circularity holes. We identify and explicate six brokerage roles, i.e., connecting, informing, protecting, mobilizing, integrating and measuring, and discuss them in relation to extant literature, highlighting novelties compared to earlier studies. The final section reflects on contributions, implications, limitations and areas for further research.","[{""name"": ""Francesca Ciulli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ans Kolk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Siri Boe-Lillegraven"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.07.006"", ""10.1111/j.1756-2171.2006.tb00037.x"", ""10.1016/S0925-5273(98)00079-6"", ""10.1111/j.1745-493X.2009.03166.x"", ""10.1177/1468794107085301"", ""10.1057/jibs.2015.20"", ""10.4159/9780674029095"", ""10.1086/421787"", ""10.5465/amj.2007.24162082"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143828"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2010.10.025"", ""10.1111/j.1745-493X.2009.03151.x"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.295"", ""10.1177/0170840612445118"", ""10.2307/4131471"", ""10.5465/19416520.2014.875669"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2007.03.019"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3181-z"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2015.10.010"", ""10.5465/amr.1989.4308385"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00396"", ""10.1177/0008125618764691"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2013.03.027"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.229"", ""10.3102/0013189X022004016"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.038"", ""10.5465/amj.2006.23478255"", ""10.1287/orsc.1060.0242"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2009.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2017.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2017.11.012"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.145"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.006"", ""10.1177/1056492617706029"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.04.159"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.048"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2015.05.015"", ""10.1002/smj.4250120604"", ""10.1177/1094428112452151"", ""10.2189/asqu.2010.55.1.1"", ""10.2307/2393936"", ""10.1287/orsc.5.3.363"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.028"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2014.07.012"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.12.005"", ""10.1111/j.1937-5956.2006.tb00156.x"", ""10.1287/opre.1080.0628"", ""10.2307/2393655"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.069"", ""10.1108/17410380910984212"", ""10.1108/IJPDLM-11-2014-0285"", ""10.1177/027614678600600103"", ""10.1300/J125v11n01_03"", ""10.1002/smj.2904"", ""10.1287/orsc.2017.1162"", ""10.1080/10864415.1999.11518348"", ""10.5465/amr.1991.4278958"", ""10.1177/0018726717727046"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3585-4"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2010.01.005"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00954.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4005-0"", ""10.1080/13814788.2017.1375092"", ""10.1525/cmr.2016.58.3.88"", ""10.1080/00207543.2014.917215"", ""10.5465/amd.2017.0081"", ""10.1108/S1479-8387(2011)0000006007"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.05.038"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.042"", ""10.2189/asqu.2010.55.1.47"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.012"", ""10.1111/jiec.12763"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1853-5"", ""10.1002/smj.2596"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.084"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.047"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.05.024"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2693-2"", ""10.5465/amj.2008.0352"", ""10.2189/asqu.2005.50.1.100"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2018.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2008.02.020"", ""10.1111/j.1745-493X.2009.03162.x"", ""10.1111/jiec.12373"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.04.020"", ""10.1287/orsc.2016.1091"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0397-2"", ""10.1108/01443570510613956"", ""10.5465/amj.2012.1004"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.200"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2017.12.012"", ""10.1111/joms.12244"", ""10.1162/154247603322493212"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.136"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3436-3"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.030"", ""10.1016/j.pursup.2015.04.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2886-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1038-z"", ""10.1108/BFJ-08-2017-0435"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2008.04.020"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2006.00662.x"", ""10.1007/BF02273552"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.26585677"", ""10.5465/amj.2012.0048"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2011.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.appet.2015.08.025"", ""10.1108/BFJ-12-2017-0726"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081309-150054"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(03)00018-5"", ""10.5465/amp.2011.0105"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.11.016"", ""10.1111/joms.12055"", ""10.1287/isre.1100.0322"", ""10.1002/smj.2932""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Food Science', 'Strategy and Management', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"

The decisions such workers face on the front lines are fraught with uncertainty for all stakeholders. Our focus is on the implications for nurses, who are the largest global health care workforce but whose perspectives are not always fully considered. This essay discusses three overarching ethical issues that create a myriad of concerns and will likely affect nurses globally in unique ways: the safety of nurses, patients, colleagues, and families; the allocation of scarce resources; and the changing nature of nurses’ relationships with patients and families. We urge policy‐makers to ensure that nurses’ voices and perspectives are integrated into both local and global decision‐making so as to minimize the structural injustices many nurses have faced to date. Finally, we urge nurses to seek sources of support throughout this pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Georgina Morley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christine Grady"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joan McCarthy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Connie M.

Although this gratitude is undoubtedly appreciated by many, we must be cautious about overuse of the term ‘hero’ in such discussions. The challenges currently faced by healthcare workers are substantially greater than those encountered in their normal work, and it is understandable that the language of heroism has been evoked to praise them for their actions. Yet such language can have potentially negative consequences. Here, I examine what heroism is and why it is being applied to the healthcare workers currently, before outlining some of the problems associated with the heroism narrative currently being employed by the media. Healthcare workers have a clear and limited duty to treat during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be grounded in a broad social contract and is strongly associated with certain reciprocal duties that society has towards healthcare workers. I argue that the heroism narrative can be damaging, as it stifles meaningful discussion about what the limits of this duty to treat are. It fails to acknowledge the importance of reciprocity, and through its implication that all healthcare workers have to be heroic, it can have negative psychological effects on workers themselves. I conclude that rather than invoking the language of heroism to praise healthcare workers, we should examine, as a society, what duties healthcare workers have to work in this pandemic, and how we can support them in fulfilling these.","[{""name"": ""Caitríona L Cox"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/a0022672"", ""10.1001/jama.1987.03400140086030"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-139-7-200310070-00011"", ""10.1136/bmj.327.7427.1342"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00448.x"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30644-9"", ""10.1080/15265160802132951"", ""10.1183/09031936.00041609"", ""10.3201/eid1208.060360"", ""10.1353/hcr.0.0104"", ""10.1080/03605310590907066"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2044.2008.05640.x"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2018.304582"", ""10.1162/152651604773067497"", ""10.1136/jme.2009.032821"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.189""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

It has the potential to tackle social problems through the development of AI-based solutions. Yet, to date, there is only limited understanding of what makes AI socially good in theory, what counts as AI4SG in practice, and how to reproduce its initial successes in terms of policies. This article addresses this gap by identifying seven ethical factors that are essential for future AI4SG initiatives. The analysis is supported by 27 case examples of AI4SG projects. Some of these factors are almost entirely novel to AI, while the significance of other factors is heightened by the use of AI. From each of these factors, corresponding best practices are formulated which, subject to context and balance, may serve as preliminary guidelines to ensure that well-designed AI is more likely to serve the social good.","[{""name"": ""Luciano Floridi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Josh Cowls"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas C.

10.1111/phc3.12658,PHILOSOPHY COMPASS,0101 Philosophy,The ethics of nudging: An overview,"AbstractSo‐called nudge policies utilize insights from behavioral science to achieve policy outcomes. Nudge policies try to improve people's decisions by changing the ways options are presented to them, rather than changing the options themselves or incentivizing or coercing people. Nudging has been met with great enthusiasm but also fierce criticism. This paper provides an overview of the debate on the ethics of nudging to date. After outlining arguments in favor of nudging, we first discuss different objections that all revolve around the worry that nudging vitiates personal autonomy. We split up this worry into different dimensions of autonomy, such as freedom of choice, volitional autonomy, rational agency, and freedom as nondomination. We next discuss worries that nudging is manipulative, violates human dignity, and prevents more important structural reform. Throughout, we will present responses that proponents of nudging can muster. On the whole, we conclude that the objections fail to establish that the nudge program as a whole should be rejected.

Failure of recent data sharing initiatives indicates an urgent need to invest in societal trust in researchers and institutions. Key to an informed understanding of such a ‘social license’ is identifying the views patients and the public may hold with regard to data sharing for health research. Methods We performed a narrative review of the empirical evidence addressing patients’ and public views and attitudes towards the use of health data for research purposes. The literature databases PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched in April 2019 to identify relevant publications. Patients’ and public attitudes were extracted from selected references and thematically categorised. Results Twenty-seven papers were included for review, including both qualitative and quantitative studies and systematic reviews. Results suggest widespread—though conditional—support among patients and the public for data sharing for health research. Despite the fact that participants recognise actual or potential benefits of data research, they expressed concerns about breaches of confidentiality and potential abuses of the data. Studies showed agreement on the following conditions: value, privacy, risk minimisation, data security, transparency, control, information, trust, responsibility and accountability. Conclusions Our results indicate that a social license for data-intensive health research cannot simply be presumed. To strengthen the social license, identified conditions ought to be operationalised in a governance framework that incorporates the diverse patient and public values, needs and interests.","[{""name"": ""Shona Kalkman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Medical Humanities, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Johannes van Delden"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Medical Humanities, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Amitava Banerjee"", ""affiliation"": [""Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London, London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Benoît Tyl"", ""affiliation"": [""Cardiovascular Center for Therapeutic Innovation, Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, Suresnes, France""]}, {""name"": ""Menno Mostert"", ""affiliation"": [""Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, Medical Humanities, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Ghislaine van Thiel"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Medical Humanities, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1093/eurheartj/ehx487"", ""10.1093/scipol/scv075"", ""10.2966/scrip.110114.1"", ""10.1007/s00439-018-1919-7"", ""10.1016/j.ejca.2018.09.032"", ""10.1136/medethics-2014-102374"", ""10.1007/s11019-008-9152-0"", ""10.1080/14615517.2014.941141"", ""10.1111/bioe.12549"", ""10.1038/gim.2015.138"", ""10.12688/wellcomeopenres.13531.1"", ""10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x"", ""10.1586/14737159.2014.961917"", ""10.1177/1355819617751555"", ""10.1038/s41431-019-0340-6"", ""10.3233/JPD-161045"", ""10.1038/ejhg.2016.30"", ""10.1038/ejhg.2015.115"", ""10.2217/cer-2017-0009"", ""10.1007/s12687-017-0300-1"", ""10.2196/jmir.5011"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocw012"", ""10.9778/cmajo.20180105"", ""10.1159/000486588"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-13-72"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.04.003"", ""10.1159/000324705"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024863"", ""10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.01.021"", ""10.1097/MLR.0000000000000786"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0129893"", ""10.1038/s41431-019-0344-2"", ""10.1159/000276767"", ""10.1038/s41436-018-0299-7"", ""10.1186/s40504-014-0015-6"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0359-9"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-126-5-199703010-00006""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Despite its critical importance, it curiously remains poorly understood in a number of dimensions. In order to address this, we have analysed peer review to assess where the major gaps in our theoretical and empirical understanding of it lie. We identify core themes including editorial responsibility, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, the function and quality of peer review, and the social and epistemic implications of peer review. The high-priority gaps are focused around increased accountability and justification in decision-making processes for editors and developing a deeper, empirical understanding of the social impact of peer review. Addressing this at the bare minimum will require the design of a consensus for a minimal set of standards for what constitutes peer review, and the development of a shared data infrastructure to support this. Such a field requires sustained funding and commitment from publishers and research funders, who both have a commitment to uphold the integrity of the published scholarly record. We use this to present a guide for the future of peer review, and the development of a new research discipline based on the study of peer review.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan P.

In emergencies, particularly ones that involve quarantine, GBV often increases. Policymakers must utilize community expertise, technology and existing global guidelines to disrupt these trends in the early stages of the COVID‐19 epidemic. Gender norms and roles relegating women to the realm of care work puts them on the frontlines in an epidemic, while often excluding them from developing the response.

Contact tracing is a well-established feature of public health practice during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics. However, the high proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission in COVID-19 means that standard contact tracing methods are too slow to stop the progression of infection through the population. To address this problem, many countries around the world have deployed or are developing mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing. Informed by the on-going mapping of ‘proximity events’ these apps are intended both to inform public health policy and to provide alerts to individuals who have been in contact with a person with the infection. The proposed use of mobile phone data for ‘intelligent physical distancing’ in such contexts raises a number of important ethical questions. In our paper, we outline some ethical considerations that need to be addressed in any deployment of this kind of approach as part of a multidimensional public health response. We also, briefly, explore the implications for its use in future infectious disease outbreaks.","[{""name"": ""Michael J Parker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christophe Fraser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lucie Abeler-Dörner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Bonsall"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/jcc4.12144"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30792-3"", ""10.7189/jogh.09.020421""]","['Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Health Professions']","['Modeling and Simulation', 'Information Systems', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Digital contact tracing, the Apple/Google API and big tech's newfound role as global health policy makers","AbstractSince the outbreak of COVID-19, governments have turned their attention to digital contact tracing. In many countries, public debate has focused on the risks this technology poses to privacy, with advocates and experts sounding alarm bells about surveillance and mission creep reminiscent of the post 9/11 era. Yet, when Apple and Google launched their contact tracing API in April 2020, some of the world’s leading privacy experts applauded this initiative for its privacy-preserving technical specifications. In an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as greater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. This article proposes to view the Apple/Google API in terms of a broader phenomenon whereby tech corporations are encroaching into ever new spheres of social life. From this perspective, the (legitimate) advantage these actors have accrued in the sphere of the production of digital goods provides them with (illegitimate) access to the spheres of health and medicine, and more worrisome, to the sphere of politics. These sphere transgressions raise numerous risks that are not captured by the focus on privacy harms. Namely, a crowding out of essential spherical expertise, new dependencies on corporate actors for the delivery of essential, public goods, the shaping of (global) public policy by non-representative, private actors and ultimately, the accumulation of decision-making power across multiple spheres. While privacy is certainly an important value, its centrality in the debate on digital contact tracing may blind us to these broader societal harms and unwittingly pave the way for ever more sphere transgressions.","[{""name"": ""Tamar Sharon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203094426"", ""10.1038/526484a"", ""10.1177/1527476418796632"", ""10.1186/s12916-018-1122-7"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2013.07.004"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-0832-5"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3590788"", ""10.4324/9780203927076"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-01578-0"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106314"", ""10.4159/9780674245075"", ""10.1515/9789048513017"", ""10.1515/9780691184395"", ""10.2217/pme-2016-0057"", ""10.1177/2053951718819032"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3633371"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18"", ""10.1525/9780520948693""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

For medical schools, this has manifested as examination and curricular restructuring as well as significant changes to clinical attachments. With the available evidence suggesting that medical students’ mental health status is already poorer than that of the general population, with academic stress being a chief predictor, such changes are likely to have a significant effect on these students. In addition, there is an assumption that these students are an available resource in terms of volunteerism during a crisis. This conjecture should be questioned; however, as those engaging in such work without sufficient preparation are susceptible to moral trauma and adverse health outcomes. This, in conjunction with the likelihood of future pandemics, highlights the need for ‘pandemic preparedness’ to be embedded in the medical curriculum.","[{""name"": ""Lorcan O'Byrne"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Blánaid Gavin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fiona McNicholas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30226-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.03.083"", ""10.1136/postgradmedj-2015-133677"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1535-9"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1227"", ""10.7326/M20-1262"", ""10.1007/s40037-017-0352-2"", ""10.1080/10872981.2019.1603526"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.706339"", ""10.4103/psychiatry.IndianJPsychiatry_767_19"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32347-5"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00540.x"", ""10.7326/M20-1281"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1064"", ""10.1017/dmp.2019.81"", ""10.47102/annals-acadmedsg.V38N8p724"", ""10.1186/s12245-015-0077-0"", ""10.1017/S1049023X00007287"", ""10.1017/dmp.2014.12"", ""10.1097/PEC.0000000000000806"", ""10.5055/ajdm.2013.0119"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2011.05.026"", ""10.1097/00001888-200509000-00007"", ""10.1016/S1607-551X(08)70093-7"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318166a62a"", ""10.5055/ajdm.2010.0015"", ""10.1177/070674370705200405"", ""10.1503/cmaj.1031077"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106227"", ""10.1136/emermed-2017-207216"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105961"", ""10.1007/BF03403782"", ""10.1007/BF03403782"", ""10.3201/eid1212.060584"", ""10.1177/1090198104263660"", ""10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2005.03.006""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology', 'Medicine']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Oncology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

In this paper, we analyse how managers develop responsible management competences and how the competences interact with capabilities at the organisational level. The paper contributes to the responsible management literature by integrating research on absorptive capacity and organisational learning. By creating intersections between these disparate research streams, this study enables a better understanding of the development of responsible management competences. The paper is a systematic literature review on environmental competences, which are a type of responsible management competences referring to the managerial skills aimed at improving environmental sustainability. The findings demonstrate that managers who are able to recognize and acquire external knowledge develop environmental competences, and organisations capable of assimilating, transforming and exploiting knowledge develop environmental capabilities. The paper establishes that a dynamic and recursive relation exists between environmental competences and capabilities. Antecedents and contextual conditions specific to a sustainability context, such as eco-centric values and stakeholder pressures, influence the development of environmental competences. The study shows that environmental competences have a positive direct effect on environmental performance, and an indirect effect as a mediator between environmental capabilities and performance.","[{""name"": ""Tulin Dzhengiz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eva Niesten"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13675567.2013.812193"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12102"",

However, this labor is under-recognized, its magnitude is unknown, and alternative ways of organizing peer review labor are rarely considered. Methods Using publicly available data, we provide an estimate of researchers’ time and the salary-based contribution to the journal peer review system. Results We found that the total time reviewers globally worked on peer reviews was over 100 million hours in 2020, equivalent to over 15 thousand years. The estimated monetary value of the time US-based reviewers spent on reviews was over 1.5 billion USD in 2020. For China-based reviewers, the estimate is over 600 million USD, and for UK-based, close to 400 million USD. Conclusions By design, our results are very likely to be under-estimates as they reflect only a portion of the total number of journals worldwide. The numbers highlight the enormous amount of work and time that researchers provide to the publication system, and the importance of considering alternative ways of structuring, and paying for, peer review. We foster this process by discussing some alternative models that aim to boost the benefits of peer review, thus improving its cost-benefit ratio.","[{""name"": ""Balazs Aczel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Barnabas Szaszi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex O.

The World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern and recently classified Covid‐19 as a worldwide pandemic. As of this writing, the epidemic has not yet peaked in the United States, but community transmission is widespread. President Trump declared a national emergency as fifty governors declared state emergencies. In the coming weeks, hospitals will become overrun, stretched to their capacities. When the health system becomes stretched beyond capacity, how can we ethically allocate scarce health goods and services? How can we ensure that marginalized populations can access the care they need? What ethical duties do we owe to vulnerable people separated from their families and communities? And how do we ethically and legally balance public health with civil liberties?","[{""name"": ""Lawrence O. Gostin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eric A.

Paradoxically, the contagion has resulted in increased use of technology and digital mediation, as well as enhanced hopes for vaccines and biomedical solutions. It has thereby intensified humans’ reliance on the very high-tech economy of cognitive capitalism that caused the problems in the first place. This combination of ambivalent elements in relation to the Fourth Industrial revolution and the Sixth Extinction is the trademark of the posthuman condition.

10.1111/bioe.12771,BIOETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Utilitarianism and the pandemic,"AbstractThere are no egalitarians in a pandemic. The scale of the challenge for health systems and public policy means that there is an ineluctable need to prioritize the needs of the many. It is impossible to treat all citizens equally, and a failure to carefully consider the consequences of actions could lead to massive preventable loss of life. In a pandemic there is a strong ethical need to consider how to do most good overall. Utilitarianism is an influential moral theory that states that the right action is the action that is expected to produce the greatest good. It offers clear operationalizable principles. In this paper we provide a summary of how utilitarianism could inform two challenging questions that have been important in the early phase of the pandemic: (a) Triage: which patients should receive access to a ventilator if there is overwhelming demand outstripping supply? (b) Lockdown: how should countries decide when to implement stringent social restrictions, balancing preventing deaths from COVID‐19 with causing deaths and reductions in well‐being from other causes? Our aim is not to argue that utilitarianism is the only relevant ethical theory, or in favour of a purely utilitarian approach. However, clearly considering which options will do the most good overall will help societies identify and consider the necessary cost of other values. Societies may choose either to embrace or not to embrace the utilitarian course, but with a clear understanding of the values involved and the price they are willing to pay.","[{""name"": ""Julian Savulescu"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", ""Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", ""Visiting Professorial Fellow in Biomedical Ethics, Biomedical Ethics Research Group Murdoch Children’s Research Institute Melbourne Australia"", ""Distinguished Visiting Professor in Law, Melbourne Law School University of Melbourne Melbourne Victoria Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Ingmar Persson"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", ""Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science Gothenburg University Gothenburg Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Dominic Wilkinson"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", ""Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", ""John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland""]}]",[],"['Health Professions', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine']","['Modeling and Simulation', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

The review explores the existing literature on the ethics of digital well-being, with the goal of mapping the current debate and identifying open questions for future research. The review identifies major issues related to several key social domains: healthcare, education, governance and social development, and media and entertainment. It also highlights three broader themes: positive computing, personalised human–computer interaction, and autonomy and self-determination. The review argues that three themes will be central to ongoing discussions and research by showing how they can be used to identify open questions related to the ethics of digital well-being.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Burr"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mariarosaria Taddeo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luciano Floridi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/asi.21540"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199300518.001.0001"", ""10.1109/MPRV.2017.3971134"", ""10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320189"", ""10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016261"", ""10.1109/SKIMA.2015.7399989"", ""10.1109/SpliTech.2016.7555919"", ""10.1109/W-FiCloud.2018.00039"", ""10.2471/BLT.16.187484"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2014.03.001"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6970-0_14"", ""10.23919/SOFTCOM.2017.8115553"", ""10.1007/s11023-019-09497-4"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9479-0"", ""10.1108/18325911011091819"", ""10.1109/MTS.2013.2286429"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9764.001.0001"", ""10.1109/MIS.2011.91"", ""10.1109/ICHI.2017.25"", ""10.1109/CSCWD.2013.6580987"", ""10.1109/ICHI.2016.86"", ""10.1109/MCOMSTD.2017.1700001"", ""10.1177/0956797614557867"", ""10.1126/science.847460"", ""10.1109/VSMM.2010.5665934"", ""10.1109/MITP.2017.265111034"", ""10.4324/9781315745329"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-04093-6_2"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9733-2"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0303-9"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1109/IHTC.2017.8058204"", ""10.1073/pnas.1900949116"", ""10.1109/IoTGC.2017.8008971"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019"", ""10.1108/JICES-01-2013-0001"", ""10.1109/JBHI.2015.2446195"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0285-z"", ""10.1111/add.14007"", ""10.1038/ejhg.2017.75"", ""10.1109/CGC.2013.51"", ""10.1093/heapol/czw095"", ""10.1080/13676261.2016.1212164"", ""10.1126/science.aac4520"", ""10.1007/s11205-011-9966-7"", ""10.1007/11755494_1"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1016/j.invent.2016.10.002"", ""10.1109/IGIC.2013.6659143"", ""10.1159/000345544"", ""10.1109/I2MTC.2012.6229520"", ""10.1109/iTAG.2016.12"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2016.432"", ""10.1109/S3C.2017.8501366"", ""10.1126/science.aaa2709"", ""10.1109/i-Society.2015.7366861"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.024"", ""10.1002/hast.515"", ""10.1109/CBMS.2013.6627764"", ""10.1073/pnas.1320040111"", ""10.1111/bioe.12244"", ""10.1080/15504263.2012.718928"", ""10.1109/MIS.2014.52"", ""10.1136/medethics-2017-104153"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9833.2008.00440.x"", ""10.3389/frobt.2016.00003"", ""10.1016/j.jalz.2007.04.388"", ""10.1080/11038120600673056"", ""10.1109/CTTE.2017.8260988"", ""10.1073/pnas.1710966114"", ""10.1007/s10995-011-0918-2"", ""10.1109/MPRV.2014.25"", ""10.1024/1662-9647/a000088"", ""10.1109/JCSSE.2018.8457335"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9426-4"", ""10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217972"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.12136"", ""10.1038/s41562-018-0506-1"", ""10.1007/s10728-011-0199-3"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00797"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30053-1"", ""10.1109/TISHW.2016.7847773"", ""10.1007/s11948-010-9236-0"", ""10.1007/s10676-016-9385-1"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68"", ""10.1049/ic.2015.0143"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.5"", ""10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037858"", ""10.1109/IHTC.2017.8058187"", ""10.1159/000329483"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2015.390"", ""10.1109/INTERCON.2017.8079641"", ""10.1109/ISTAS.2015.7439434"", ""10.4108/icst.mobihealth.2014.257499"", ""10.1080/17544750.2010.516579"", ""10.1007/s11948-014-9586-0"", ""10.1126/science.aat5991"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9254-2"", ""10.4108/icst.pervasivehealth.2012.248698"", ""10.1177/0146167212474694"", ""10.1037/emo0000403"", ""10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401381"", ""10.1089/cpb.2006.9.584"", ""10.1109/CSCI.2016.0042"", ""10.1007/s10676-009-9202-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190498511.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14034940701271890"", ""10.1037/xge0000057"", ""10.1109/DSAA.2016.89""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Demography', 'Applied Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s10551-022-05049-6,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Ethics of AI-Enabled Recruiting and Selection: A Review and Research Agenda,"AbstractCompanies increasingly deploy artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in their personnel recruiting and selection process to streamline it, making it faster and more efficient. AI applications can be found in various stages of recruiting, such as writing job ads, screening of applicant resumes, and analyzing video interviews via face recognition software. As these new technologies significantly impact people’s lives and careers but often trigger ethical concerns, the ethicality of these AI applications needs to be comprehensively understood. However, given the novelty of AI applications in recruiting practice, the subject is still an emerging topic in academic literature. To inform and strengthen the foundation for future research, this paper systematically reviews the extant literature on the ethicality of AI-enabled recruiting to date. We identify 51 articles dealing with the topic, which we synthesize by mapping the ethical opportunities, risks, and ambiguities, as well as the proposed ways to mitigate ethical risks in practice. Based on this review, we identify gaps in the extant literature and point out moral questions that call for deeper exploration in future research.","[{""name"": ""Anna Lena Hunkenschroer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christoph Luetge"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ijsa.12306"", ""10.5093/jwop2019a7"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9039-z"", ""10.15779/Z38BG31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-51110-4"", ""10.1177/0149206306289829"", ""10.25035/pad.2016.002"", ""10.15779/Z388P5V86M"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00863"", ""10.1016/j.cobeha.2017.04.007"", ""10.1017/iop.2016.6"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.944"", ""10.1109/BESC.2017.8256384"", ""10.1145/3097983.3098095"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1002/per.2092"", ""10.2307/258705"", ""10.1111/0045-3609.00092"", ""10.1145/2090236.2090255"", ""10.1515/pjbr-2020-0030"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3518482"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09517-8"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1589864"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3004002"", ""10.1108/IJM-06-2017-0138"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2180-1"", ""10.5465/AMBPP.2019.210"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2011.00881.x"", ""10.1007/s12599-020-00673-w"", ""10.1111/ijsa.12026"", ""10.2307/2529310"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.11.036"", ""10.1108/JMP-03-2019-0156"", ""10.1111/ijsa.12246"", ""10.1108/JMP-09-2018-0402"", ""10.1177/2053951718756684"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04204-w"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0279-x"", ""10.1007/s13347-020-00406-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2565-9"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3921-3"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0114-4"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.1109/ISTAS48451.2019.8937920"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.03.008"", ""10.1515/9780804772891"", ""10.4135/9781412985000"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04143-6"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032117-104553"", ""10.1108/MD-02-2019-0244"", ""10.1177/0093650211418338"", ""10.1109/CVPRW50498.2020.00022"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-55783-0_15"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2003.tb00757.x"", ""10.1515/mspe-2019-0018"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372828"", ""10.1145/3306618.3314244"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3281765"", ""10.5093/jwop2019a10"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372849"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04371-w"", ""10.1147/JRD.2019.2915067"", ""10.1023/A:1006457810654"", ""10.5465/annals.2015.0101"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.04.012"", ""10.1177/0008125619867910"", ""10.1007/s10799-012-0117-x"", ""10.1145/3419633"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2019.07.004"", ""10.1177/0149206313515524"", ""10.1145/3278721.3278751"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.1111/1468-2389.00245"", ""10.5325/jinfopoli.8.2018.0078"", ""10.1080/1359432X.2019.1681401"", ""10.1108/OIR-10-2018-0334"", ""10.1145/3038912.3052660""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Health Informatics', 'Safety Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

10.1111/jssr.12677,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology,"Culture Wars and COVID-19 Conduct: Christian Nationalism, Religiosity, and Americans' Behavior During the Coronavirus Pandemic","AbstractDuring the COVID‐19 pandemic, Americans’ behavioral responses were quickly politicized. Those on the left stressed precautionary behaviors, while those on the (religious) right were more likely to disregard recommended precautions. We propose the far right response was driven less by partisanship or religiosity per se, but rather by an ideology that connects disregard for scientific expertise; a conception of Americans as God's chosen and protected people; distrust for news media; and allegiance to Trump―Christian nationalism. Analyzing panel data collected in the thick of the COVID‐19 crisis, we find Christian nationalism was the leading predictor that Americans engaged in incautious behavior like eating in restaurants, visiting family/friends, or gathering with 10+ persons (though not attending church), and was the second strongest predictor that Americans took fewer precautions like wearing a mask or sanitizing/washing one's hands. Religiosity, in contrast, was the leading predictor that Americans engaged in more frequent precautionary behaviors. Findings document that Christian nationalism, not religious commitment per se, undergirded the far‐right response to COVID‐19 that disregarded precautionary recommendations, thus potentially worsening the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Samuel L.

Segmentation is valuable for two significant clinical applications, namely lesion detection and classification, providing means to improve accuracy and robustness. The manual segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images is time-consuming. As a result, the use of deep learning (DL) for automation of polyp segmentation has become important. However, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting inability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes. Recent transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation both achieve higher performance and generalise better than alternatives, however typically predict a segmentation map of $$\frac{h}{4}\times \frac{w}{4}$$ spatial dimensions for a $$h\times w$$ input image. To this end, we propose a new architecture for full-size segmentation which leverages the strengths of a transformer in extracting the most important features for segmentation in a primary branch, while compensating for its limitations in full-size prediction with a secondary fully convolutional branch. The resulting features from both branches are then fused for final prediction of a $$h\times w$$ segmentation map. We demonstrate our method’s state-of-the-art performance with respect to the mDice, mIoU, mPrecision, and mRecall metrics, on both the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB dataset benchmarks. Additionally, we train the model on each of these datasets and evaluate on the other to demonstrate its superior generalisation performance.Code available: https://github.com/CVML-UCLan/FCBFormer.","[{""name"": ""Edward Sanderson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bogdan J.

10.3390/rel11100498,RELIGIONS,0101 Philosophy,Positive Religious Coping and Mental Health among Christians and Muslims in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Positive religious coping has frequently been associated with better mental health outcomes when dealing with stressful life events (e.g., natural disasters, domestic abuse, divorce). The COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated infection prevention and control measures (curfew, quarantine, restricted travel, social distancing), represent a society-wide stressor. This study explored positive religious coping among the Muslim and Christian residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) during the early stages of the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 543) completed an online survey assessing religious coping in response to the pandemic, along with symptom measures of depression, anxiety and history of psychological disorder. Muslims (N = 339) reported significantly higher levels of positive religious coping compared to their Christian counterparts (N = 204). Across the whole sample, positive religious coping was inversely related to having a history of psychological disorders. Among the Muslim cohort, positive religious coping was inversely related to depressive symptoms and having a history of psychological disorders. Positive religious coping during infectious disease outbreaks may help some individuals reduce their risk of depressive illness. National pandemic preparedness plans may benefit from including a focus on religion and religious coping.","[{""name"": ""Justin Thomas"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Natural and Health Sciences, Zayed University, Abu Dhabi 144534, UAE""]}, {""name"": ""Mariapaola Barbato"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Natural and Health Sciences, Zayed University, Abu Dhabi 144534, UAE""]}]","[""10.2466/pr0.102.1.181-184"", ""10.1080/13674670903540951"", ""10.1007/s10943-019-00881-z"", ""10.1037/rel0000039"", ""10.1007/s10943-017-0359-3"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2021.10.014"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2007.00348.x"", ""10.1002/gps.945"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2010.02.116"", ""10.1037/a0023155"", ""10.1080/13674676.2020.1768725"", ""10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02575.x"", ""10.1348/014466605X37468"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.2008.00379.x"", ""10.2307/3509881"", ""10.1007/s10943-014-9981-5"", ""10.1207/s15327582ijpr1602_2"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2008.06.026"", ""10.12659/MSM.924609"", ""10.1348/000711201160993"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.10121823"", ""10.1590/S1516-44462006005000006"", ""10.1007/BF00938065"", ""10.2307/1388152"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4<519::AID-JCLP6>3.0.CO;2-1"", ""10.1111/0021-8294.00073"", ""10.3390/rel2010051"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01070-z"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-62397-6_12"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0226622"", ""10.1186/s12882-017-0619-1"", ""10.1007/s00520-018-4088-2"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.4.614"", ""10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bcv080""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

As people across the country find ways to stay at home, telehealth preserves an opportunity to obtain necessary healthcare services. Further, telehealth can help individuals avoid COVID-19 infection, free up hospital beds and other resources for those patients most in need, and prevent infected individuals from spreading that infection. Federal and state regulators have recognized this potential of telehealth and have quickly changed a variety of laws and regulations to enable healthcare providers to deploy solutions quickly. These changes can provide lasting benefits for the use of telehealth well after the current crisis. However, to best realize telehealth’s benefits, further legal and regulatory actions are necessary. Specifically, lawmakers and regulators should focus on six areas: reimbursement, privacy/cybersecurity, liability, licensure, technology access, and artificial intelligence.","[{""name"": ""David A Hoffman"", ""affiliation"": [""Duke University , Sanford School of Public Policy""]}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

I describe an algorithm for justified mandatory vaccination. Penalties or costs could include withholding of benefits, imposition of fines, provision of community service or loss of freedoms. I argue that under conditions of risk or perceived risk of a novel vaccination, a system of payment for risk in vaccination may be superior. I defend a payment model against various objections, including that it constitutes coercion and undermines solidarity. I argue that payment can be in cash or in kind, and opportunity for altruistic vaccinations can be preserved by offering people who have been vaccinated the opportunity to donate any cash payment back to the health service.","[{""name"": ""Julian Savulescu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10730-013-9221-5"", ""10.1111/japp.12215"", ""10.1093/phe/phx021"", ""10.1080/15265161.2013.813602"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30244-9"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2018.304682"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.8711"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106336"", ""10.1111/bioe.12771"", ""10.1111/japp.12400"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02068-2"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.08.042"", ""10.1007/s11019-018-9829-y"", ""10.1093/phe/phv026"", ""10.1111/bioe.12596"", ""10.2307/3564182"", ""10.1136/medethics-2014-102284"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106438"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106365""]","['Neuroscience', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'General Health Professions', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Some governments have declared internet addiction a major public health concern, and the World Health Organization has characterized excessive internet use as a growing problem. Our article shows why scholars, policy makers, and the managers of social media companies should treat social media addiction as a serious moral problem. While the benefits of social media are not negligible, we argue that social media addiction raises unique ethical concerns not raised by other, more familiar addictive products, such as alcohol and cigarettes. In particular, we argue that addicting users to social media is impermissible because it unjustifiably harms users in a way that is both demeaning and objectionably exploitative. Importantly, the attention-economy business model of social media companies strongly incentivizes them to perpetrate this wrongdoing.","[{""name"": ""Vikram R.

10.1186/s41073-023-00133-5,RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND PEER REVIEW,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Fighting reviewer fatigue or amplifying bias? Considerations and recommendations for use of ChatGPT and other large language models in scholarly peer review,"AbstractBackgroundThe emergence of systems based on large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT has created a range of discussions in scholarly circles. Since LLMs generate grammatically correct and mostly relevant (yet sometimes outright wrong, irrelevant or biased) outputs in response to provided prompts, using them in various writing tasks including writing peer review reports could result in improved productivity. Given the significance of peer reviews in the existing scholarly publication landscape, exploring challenges and opportunities of using LLMs in peer review seems urgent. After the generation of the first scholarly outputs with LLMs, we anticipate that peer review reports too would be generated with the help of these systems. However, there are currently no guidelines on how these systems should be used in review tasks.MethodsTo investigate the potential impact of using LLMs on the peer review process, we used five core themes within discussions about peer review suggested by Tennant and Ross-Hellauer. These include 1) reviewers’ role, 2) editors’ role, 3) functions and quality of peer reviews, 4) reproducibility, and 5) the social and epistemic functions of peer reviews. We provide a small-scale exploration of ChatGPT’s performance regarding identified issues.ResultsLLMs have the potential to substantially alter the role of both peer reviewers and editors. Through supporting both actors in efficiently writing constructive reports or decision letters, LLMs can facilitate higher quality review and address issues of review shortage. However, the fundamental opacity of LLMs’ training data, inner workings, data handling, and development processes raise concerns about potential biases, confidentiality and the reproducibility of review reports. Additionally, as editorial work has a prominent function in defining and shaping epistemic communities, as well as negotiating normative frameworks within such communities, partly outsourcing this work to LLMs might have unforeseen consequences for social and epistemic relations within academia. Regarding performance, we identified major enhancements in a short period and expect LLMs to continue developing.ConclusionsWe believe that LLMs are likely to have a profound impact on academia and scholarly communication. While potentially beneficial to the scholarly communication system, many uncertainties remain and their use is not without risks. In particular, concerns about the amplification of existing biases and inequalities in access to appropriate infrastructure warrant further attention. For the moment, we recommend that if LLMs are used to write scholarly reviews and decision letters, reviewers and editors should disclose their use and accept full responsibility for data security and confidentiality, and their reports’ accuracy, tone, reasoning and originality.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Hosseini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Serge P.

Nevertheless, the complexity of processes and physical phenomena, time as well as economic constraints and not least further endeavours as well as achievements in medicine and healthcare continuously raise the need to evaluate and to improve clinical decision-making. This article scrutinises if and how clinical decision-making processes are challenged by the rise of so-called artificial intelligence-driven decision support systems (AI-DSS). In a first step, this article analyses how the rise of AI-DSS will affect and transform the modes of interaction between different agents in the clinic. In a second step, we point out how these changing modes of interaction also imply shifts in the conditions of trustworthiness, epistemic challenges regarding transparency, the underlying normative concepts of agency and its embedding into concrete contexts of deployment and, finally, the consequences for (possible) ascriptions of responsibility. Third, we draw first conclusions for further steps regarding a ‘meaningful human control’ of clinical AI-DSS.","[{""name"": ""Matthias Braun"", ""affiliation"": [""Insitute for Systematic Theology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Patrik Hummel"", ""affiliation"": [""Insitute for Systematic Theology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Susanne Beck"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Criminal Law and Criminology, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Peter Dabrock"", ""affiliation"": [""Insitute for Systematic Theology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany""]}]","[""10.1038/nature21056"", ""10.1093/annonc/mdy166"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.17216"", ""10.1093/annonc/mdx781"", ""10.1038/s41551-018-0305-z"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.8211"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0300-7"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0316-z"", ""10.1186/s13336-015-0019-3"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1702071"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0213-5"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.17217"", ""10.1038/s41551-018-0315-x"", ""10.1002/hast.842"", ""10.1002/hast.895"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2005.06.010"", ""10.1007/s11606-012-2077-6"", ""10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.016281"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1002689"", ""10.1038/s41928-018-0193-y"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2609777"", ""10.15252/embr.201541935"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0114-4"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-105118"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.21552/edpl/2018/3/10"", ""10.1515/zstw-2014-0024"", ""10.54648/COLA2018095"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1001/jamadermatol.2018.2348"", ""10.1136/bmjqs-2018-008551"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3177096"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316597873.002"", ""10.1007/BF02639315"", ""10.5771/9783845237527"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2016.08.028"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-22954-2_12"", ""10.3389/frobt.2018.00015"", ""10.1007/s10506-012-9131-x"", ""10.1109/ROMAN.2012.6343852"", ""10.1017/9781108147972.027"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-11010-9_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04363-6_3"", ""10.1001/jamaoto.2013.6465"", ""10.1136/bmj.k4563"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31925-1""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The drawback of the substantial opportunities AI systems and applications (will) provide in marketing are ethical controversies. Building on the literature on AI ethics, the authors systematically scrutinize the ethical challenges of deploying AI in marketing from a multi-stakeholder perspective. By revealing interdependencies and tensions between ethical principles, the authors shed light on the applicability of a purely principled, deontological approach to AI ethics in marketing. To reconcile some of these tensions and account for the AI-for-social-good perspective, the authors make suggestions of how AI in marketing can be leveraged to promote societal and environmental well-being.","[{""name"": ""Erik Hermann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106548"", ""10.1177/1461444816676645"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04239-z"", ""10.1509/jppm.15.139"",

10.1108/JICES-12-2019-0138,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY,0101 Philosophy,Artificial intelligence ethics guidelines for developers and users: clarifying their content and normative implications,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is clearly illustrate this convergence and the prescriptive recommendations that such documents entail. There is a significant amount of research into the ethical consequences of artificial intelligence (AI). This is reflected by many outputs across academia, policy and the media. Many of these outputs aim to provide guidance to particular stakeholder groups. It has recently been shown that there is a large degree of convergence in terms of the principles upon which these guidance documents are based. Despite this convergence, it is not always clear how these principles are to be translated into practice. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors move beyond the high-level ethical principles that are common across the AI ethics guidance literature and provide a description of the normative content that is covered by these principles. The outcome is a comprehensive compilation of normative requirements arising from existing guidance documents. This is not only required for a deeper theoretical understanding of AI ethics discussions but also for the creation of practical and implementable guidance for developers and users of AI. Findings In this paper, the authors therefore provide a detailed explanation of the normative implications of existing AI ethics guidelines but directed towards developers and organisational users of AI. The authors believe that the paper provides the most comprehensive account of ethical requirements in AI currently available, which is of interest not only to the research and policy communities engaged in the topic but also to the user communities that require guidance when developing or deploying AI systems. Originality/value The authors believe that they have managed to compile the most comprehensive document collecting existing guidance which can guide practical action but will hopefully also support the consolidation of the guidelines landscape. The authors’ findings should also be of academic interest and inspire philosophical research on the consistency and justification of the various normative statements that can be found in the literature.","[{""name"": ""Mark Ryan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernd Carsten Stahl"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/pjbr-2019-0004"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511845239.003"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1177/0008125619864925"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0114-4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9973.1985.tb00173.x""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1093/socrel/sraa039,SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology,Religion in the Age of Social Distancing: How COVID-19 Presents New Directions for Research,"AbstractIn this brief note written during a global pandemic, we consider some of the important ways this historical moment is altering the religious landscape, aiming our investigative lens at how religious institutions, congregations, and individuals are affected by the social changes produced by COVID-19. This unprecedented time prompts scholars of religion to reflect on how to strategically approach the study of religion in the time of “social distancing,” as well as moving forward. Particularly important considerations include developing heuristic, innovative approaches for revealing ongoing changes to religion, as well as how religion continues to structure social life across a wide range of contexts, from the most intimate and personal to the most public and global. Although our note can only be indicative rather than exhaustive, we do suggest that the initial groundwork for reconsiderations might productively focus on several key analytical themes, including: Epidemiology, Ideology, Religious Practice, Religious Organizations and Institutions, as well as Epistemology and Methodology. In offering these considerations as a starting point, we remain aware (and hopeful) that inventive and unanticipated approaches will also emerge.","[{""name"": ""Joseph O Baker"", ""affiliation"": [""East Tennessee State University""]}, {""name"": ""Gerardo Martí"", ""affiliation"": [""Davidson College""]}, {""name"": ""Ruth Braunstein"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Connecticut""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew L Whitehead"", ""affiliation"": [""Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis""]}, {""name"": ""Grace Yukich"", ""affiliation"": [""Quinnipiac University""]}]","[""10.1086/709779"", ""10.1111/socf.12619"", ""10.1007/s10865-011-9318-8"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t89kg5"", ""10.1093/socrel/sry015"", ""10.15585/mmwr.mm6919e6"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2007.00360.x"", ""10.15585/mmwr.mm6920e2"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226555812.001.0001"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479838271.001.0001"", ""10.1017/rac.2020.3"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195172621.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0037768616628789"", ""10.1093/socrel/sraa024"", ""10.1111/ajps.12084"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.190"", ""10.4135/9781452243443"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199827718.001.0001"", ""10.5149/northcarolina/9781469634623.001.0001"", ""10.1093/socrel/srx047"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479838271.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s11007-019-09463-y,CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY REVIEW,0101 Philosophy,Applied phenomenology: why it is safe to ignore the epoche,"AbstractThe question of whether a proper phenomenological investigation and analysis requires one to perform the epoché and the reduction has not only been discussed within phenomenological philosophy. It is also very much a question that has been hotly debated within qualitative research. Amedeo Giorgi, in particular, has insisted that no scientific research can claim phenomenological status unless it is supported by some use of the epoché and reduction. Giorgi partially bases this claim on ideas found in Husserl’s writings on phenomenological psychology. In the present paper, I discuss Husserl’s ideas and argue that while the epoché and the reduction are crucial for transcendental phenomenology, it is much more questionable whether they are also relevant for a non-philosophical application of phenomenology.","[{""name"": ""Dan Zahavi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/156916291X00082"", ""10.1163/156916208X311601"", ""10.1163/156916294X00034"", ""10.1163/156916212X632934"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-4952-7"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-4900-8"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-7445-6"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-2233-4"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-9923-5"", ""10.1007/978-94-024-1597-1"", ""10.1007/BF02911781"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00114.x"", ""10.1007/s11097-018-9597-4"", ""10.1007/s10879-014-9282-z"", ""10.1177/1049732317699381"", ""10.1177/1049732318795474"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6730.001.0001"", ""10.1037/h0074428"", ""10.1177/1049732318817547"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2019.01.014""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Despite this increased attention, extant literature has yielded limited insights particularly into the impact and influence processes of workplace spirituality on performance outcomes at both the individual and unit levels of analysis. Addressing this gap in research, we proposed and tested a multilevel model, underpinned by social cognitive theory, that examines the processes linking perceptions of workplace spirituality and performance outcomes at the individual and organisational level of analysis. Data were obtained from 51 branches of a retail organisation in the United Kingdom. Results from structural equation modelling analysis revealed three salient findings. First, workplace spirituality was positively related to ethical climate, prosocial motivation, and moral judgment. Second, ethical climate partially mediated the relationship between workplace spirituality and prosocial motivation and moral judgment, respectively. Third, aggregated ethical climate significantly relates to branch-level helping behaviour and service performance.","[{""name"": ""Lilian Otaye-Ebede"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samah Shaffakat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Scott Foster"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/tie.20089"", ""10.1108/JWL-11-2015-0086"", ""10.5539/ass.v10n19p107"", ""10.1007/BF02294359"", ""10.1108/00483481011075567"", ""10.1037/a0025739"", ""10.1016/S0191-3085(03)25001-2"", ""10.1177/105649260092008"", ""10.2753/PSS0885-3134280406"", ""10.1080/1331677X.2016.1163946"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.44.9.1175"", ""10.1023/A:1006382407821"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199911)20:6<943::AID-JOB976>3.0.CO;2-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11677-8_2"", ""10.1556/SocEc.34.2012.3.8"", ""10.1080/08832320903449501"", ""10.1177/1094428102005002002"", ""10.1177/109442819921004"", ""10.1023/A:1017965302686"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2009.01165.x"", ""10.1108/eb028998"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.11.009"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2196-6"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.07.002"", ""10.4135/9781849209359"", ""10.1016/0148-2963(89)90001-5"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.07.008"", ""10.1007/s11205-011-9917-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9709-0"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199607)17:4<375::AID-JOB767>3.0.CO;2-8"", ""10.1108/IJCHM-08-2014-0404"", ""10.1080/14766086.2012.744542"", ""10.1023/A:1024767511458"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2700-7"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.93.1.48"", ""10.1037/a0014391"", ""10.1177/1056492604265218"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2745-7"", ""10.1080/14766086.2016.1185292"", ""10.1007/s10869-014-9369-2"", ""10.1177/002224298905300309"", ""10.1023/A:1006149905996"", ""10.1177/1094428105285144"", ""10.5465/amr.1991.4278958"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000015843.22195.b9"", ""10.1177/0950017012438573"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9507-0"", ""10.1080/14766086.2013.801023"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9392-6"", ""10.2307/20159559"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.7.1.83"", ""10.1108/MRR-09-2013-0228"", ""10.1002/hrm.21593"", ""10.1109/ACC.2014.6859463"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.76.1.127"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2013.01.002"", ""10.1108/09534810310484172"", ""10.1108/03090550510771485"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9368-6"", ""10.1177/0149206309356326"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487118"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9452-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1772-5"", ""10.1108/01437730911003911"", ""10.1080/14766086.2017.1291360"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.82.2.262"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1177/014920630002600307"", ""10.3758/BRM.40.3.879"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2246-0"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00289.x"", ""10.5465/amj.2005.19573107"", ""10.1177/0022022101032003002"", ""10.1023/A:1005950108509"", ""10.1016/S0148-2963(00)00125-9"", ""10.1177/1094670504273966"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-0014-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1091-7"", ""10.1348/096317909X440233"", ""10.1348/0963179041752709"", ""10.1177/0265407505056439"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-34556-0"", ""10.5465/amr.1986.4306235"", ""10.1016/S1529-2096(01)03018-8"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.81.5.525"", ""10.1177/0013164497057006009"", ""10.2307/2392857"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2626-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1973-y"", ""10.1177/0018726712460706"", ""10.1177/000765039303200106"", ""10.1177/1046496498294004"", ""10.1007/BF00872307"", ""10.1007/BF00871811"", ""10.5465/amr.1989.4279067"", ""10.1177/1094428106297811"", ""10.1023/A:1017980515603"", ""10.1086/651257"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1153-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11677-8""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Demography', 'Health']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)]]"

10.1215/00318108-8540918,PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW,0101 Philosophy,The Epistemic and the Zetetic,"Call the norms of inquiry zetetic norms. How are zetetic norms related to epistemic norms? At first glance, they seem quite closely connected. Aren't epistemic norms norms that bind inquirers qua inquirers? And isn't epistemology the place to look for a normative theory of inquiry? While much of this thought seems right, this paper argues that the relationship between the epistemic and the zetetic is not as harmonious as one might have thought and liked. In particular, this paper argues that some familiar contemporary epistemic norms are in tension with, and even in conflict with, central zetetic norms.","[{""name"": ""Jane Friedman"", ""affiliation"": [""New York University""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00146.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.1980.tb00396.x"", ""10.1163/18756735-073001008"", ""10.1163/9789042026056_013"", ""10.1111/1467-9329.00101"", ""10.1086/233874"", ""10.1017/epi.2016.22"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2016.1208903"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0510-6"", ""10.1111/phis.12118"", ""10.2307/2653823"", ""10.1007/BF00372404"", ""10.1007/s11098-009-9338-1"", ""10.1007/s11229-009-9640-7"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674334236"", ""10.1111/phpr.12381"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2008.00217.x"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00460.x"", ""10.1007/s10677-006-9056-0"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2007.00148.x"", ""10.1086/392661"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2003.tb00281.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00085.x"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-1803-y"", ""10.1093/mind/fzi509"", ""10.2307/2184520"", ""10.1007/BF01064485"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2011.00197.x"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2010.00183.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00084.x"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2016.1200812"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2011.00196.x"", ""10.1086/289374"", ""10.1093/mind/fzp148"", ""10.2307/2026639"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511617058.003"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2004.00032.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-008-9200-x"", ""10.1086/518954"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1245-3"", ""10.2307/45128617"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511977206.003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195376685.003.0008"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107707573.004"", ""10.1111/nous.12160"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9337.1991.tb00099.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-008-9277-2"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00394.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'General Health Professions', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Recent advancements in the field of deep learning have demonstrated success in variety of clinical tasks: detecting diabetic retinopathy from images, predicting hospital readmissions, aiding in the discovery of new drugs, etc. AI’s progress in medicine, however, has led to concerns regarding the potential effects of this technology on relationships of trust in clinical practice. In this paper, I will argue that there is merit to these concerns, since AI systems can be relied on, and are capable of reliability, but cannot be trusted, and are not capable of trustworthiness. Insofar as patients are required to rely on AI systems for their medical decision-making, there is potential for this to produce a deficit of trust in relationships in clinical practice.","[{""name"": ""Joshua James Hatherley"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1001/jama.2016.17216"", ""10.1145/2783258.2788613"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.20563"", ""10.1111/1468-0009.00223"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195156164.001.0001"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30123-2"", ""10.1007/s11229-008-9435-2"", ""10.1136/bmj.k4563"", ""10.1016/j.ejim.2017.06.017"", ""10.1177/0141076818762648"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.17438"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105586"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00391-6"", ""10.1136/bmj.i2139"", ""10.1002/hast.1079"", ""10.1002/hast.973"", ""10.1145/3233231"", ""10.1086/292745"", ""10.1086/233694"", ""10.2307/3350245""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

This study explored the levels and causes of moral distress and the ethical climate in Dutch ICUs during COVID-19. Methods An extended version of the Measurement of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) and Ethical Decision Making Climate Questionnaire (EDMCQ) were online distributed among all 84 ICUs. Moral distress scores in nurses and intensivists were compared with the historical control group one year before COVID-19. Results Three hundred forty-five nurses (70.7%), 40 intensivists (8.2%), and 103 supporting staff (21.1%) completed the survey. Moral distress levels were higher for nurses than supporting staff. Moral distress levels in intensivists did not differ significantly from those of nurses and supporting staff. “Inadequate emotional support for patients and their families” was the highest-ranked cause of moral distress for all groups of professionals. Of all factors, all professions rated the ethical climate most positively regarding the culture of mutual respect, ethical awareness and support. “Culture of not avoiding end-of-life-decisions” and “Self-reflective and empowering leadership” received the lowest mean scores. Moral distress scores during COVID-19 were significantly lower for ICU nurses (p &lt; 0.001) and intensivists (p &lt; 0.05) compared to one year prior. Conclusion Levels and causes of moral distress vary between ICU professionals and differ from the historical control group. Targeted interventions that address moral distress during a crisis are desirable to improve the mental health and retention of ICU professionals and the quality of patient care.","[{""name"": ""Moniek A.

Scarce resources allocation in the COVID-19 outbreak,"After initially emerging in China, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has advanced rapidly. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared it a pandemic, with Europe becoming its new epicentre. Italy has so far been the most severely hit European country and demand for critical care in the northern region currently exceeds its supply. This raises significant ethical concerns, among which is the allocation of scarce resources. Professionals are considering the prioritisation of patients most likely to survive over those with remote chances, and this news has triggered an intense debate about the right of every individual to access healthcare. The proposed analysis suggests that the national emergency framework in which prioritisation criteria are currently enforced should not lead us to perceive scarce resources allocation as something new. From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice. Rather, it has to do with the extraordinarily high number of people who find themselves personally affected by the implications of scarce resources allocation and who suddenly realise that the principle of ‘equals should be treated equally’ may no longer be applicable. Along with the need to allocate appropriate additional financial resources to support the healthcare system, and thus to mitigate the scarcity of resources, the analysis insists on the relevance of a medical ethics perspective that does not place the burden of care and choice solely on physicians.","[{""name"": ""Chiara Mannelli"", ""affiliation"": [""Candiolo Cancer Institute, FPO-IRCCS, Candiolo, Italy"", ""University of Turin, Department of Philosophy and Education Science, Torino, Italy""]}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9""]",['Health Professions'],"['Emergency Medical Services', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Results show that perceived CSR and its dimensions are positively related to employees’ positive attitudes and behaviours, and negatively related to their negative attitudes and behaviours. The results also partially support the moderating effects of the samples’ demographic characteristics in terms of age and gender, and national culture. This study supplements existing theoretical review articles, and further confirms the psychological effects of perceived CSR. In addition, the results further confirm the rationality of CSR practices and provide suggestions for enterprises to better use CSR strategies to motivate their employees.","[{""name"": ""Yanling

10.1007/s10551-021-05015-8,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Ethical Marketing in the Blockchain-Based Sharing Economy: Theoretical Integration and Guiding Insights,"AbstractSince the introduction of Ethereum in 2015, blockchain technology (BT) has been evolving, and BT has been associated with the concept of the sharing economy by business academics. Despite the marketing research on the sharing economy that has been extensively conducted in the last decade, the linkage between BT and ethical marketing in the sharing economy remains unclear. Through a systematic literature review of 163 articles and a co-citation analysis, this study identifies the key elements of blockchain capabilities, blockchain attributes, and the underlying economic theories of blockchain. It also synthesizes and proposes a shift of ethical marketing logic in the blockchain-based sharing economy that delineates the principles of stakeholder capitalism. The article concludes with a list of future research directions that underline three approaches of stakeholder theory (i.e., the descriptive, instrument, and normative approaches). These directions aim to guide marketing scholars concerning how BT enables an institutionally embedded view of ethical marketing activities and practices that enhance collaborative marketing and subsequently innovate value chains and create sustainable business models in the sharing economy, as well as to the metaverse.","[{""name"": ""Teck Ming Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jari

10.1007/s10551-019-04314-5,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,The Role of Ethical Perceptions in Consumers' Participation and Value Co-creation on Sharing Economy Platforms,"AbstractConsumers’ participation on sharing economy platforms is crucial for the success of the products, services, and companies on those platforms. The participation of consumers enables companies to not only exist, but also to create value for consumers. The sharing economy has witnessed enormous growth in recent years and consumers’ concerns regarding the ethics surrounding these platforms have also risen considerably. The vast majority of the previous research on this topic is either conceptual and focused on organizational aspects, or only discusses privacy and security issues, thus providing a very limited scope of discussion. Therefore, drawing on the marketing and business ethics literature, the present study takes into account a multidimensional view of ethical issues surrounding consumers’ participation on sharing economy platforms. Findings reveal that privacy, security, shared value, fulfillment/reliability and service recovery are the strongest determinants of consumers’ ethical perceptions. These aspects strongly predict the consumers’ value co-creation intentions. Consumers’ participation also predicts their intention to engage in co-creating value, but this effect is stronger with the mediating role of the consumer’s ethical perceptions. The theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Waqar Nadeem"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mari Juntunen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nick Hajli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mina Tajvidi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11747-007-0062-0"", ""10.1257/jel.54.2.442"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3452-3"", ""10.1108/IntR-09-2015-0272"", ""10.1509/jmkg.69.3.19.66363"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411"", ""10.1007/BF02723327"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2006.04.012"", ""10.1509/jmkg.2005.69.4.133"", ""10.1177/002224296703100105"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.10.001"", ""10.1509/jmkg.67.1.14.18592"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.04.002"", ""10.1177/1745691610393980"", ""10.1023/A:1006202107464"", ""10.1108/IJCHM-09-2016-0492"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2018.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.12.072"", ""10.1080/21639159.2015.1012809"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.elerap.2013.07.002"", ""10.1002/mar.20053"", ""10.1080/00401706.1977.10489493"", ""10.1177/1470593109338144"", ""10.1145/2688487"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-28907-6_20"", ""10.1145/2702123.2702189"", ""10.1287/isre.1060.0080"", ""10.1146/annurev-economics-080315-015334"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2614-4"", ""10.4337/9781781003435.00010"", ""10.1016/0167-8116(93)90009-N"", ""10.1177/002224378101800313"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-1571-0"", ""10.1023/A:1017190829683"", ""10.1080/1046669X.2017.1347005"", ""10.1108/09555340810886585"", ""10.1504/IJMDA.2017.10008574"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3036-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2346-x"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.08.026"", ""10.1002/asi.23552"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2016.593"", ""10.1002/mar.20825"", ""10.1177/1094670510375460"", ""10.1007/s10683-011-9273-9"", ""10.1080/0267257X.2013.766630"", ""10.1525/cmr.2013.55.3.5"", ""10.1108/JHTT-08-2016-0041"", ""10.1108/IntR-01-2017-0011"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2013.08.015"", ""10.1086/268109"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.024"", ""10.1016/S0957-4174(03)00116-7"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.07.036"", ""10.2307/30036529"", ""10.1016/j.jengtecman.2017.03.001"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2010.490956"", ""10.1108/17505931111121534"", ""10.1080/10714420490280152"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1339726"", ""10.1145/2998181.2998269"", ""10.1287/isre.1040.0032"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00793"", ""10.3758/s13428-011-0124-6"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2009.02.025"", ""10.1080/10696679.1999.11501828"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.08.018"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6606.2001.tb00101.x"", ""10.1002/cb.1512"", ""10.1177/002224299405800302"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2015.04.008"", ""10.1002/cb.1632"", ""10.1108/S1548-6435(2009)0000006008"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2011.553742"", ""10.1177/1094670504271156"", ""10.2307/25148783"", ""10.1007/s11747-007-0070-0"", ""10.1509/jm.14.0250"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.08.010"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1002/dir.20015"", ""10.1089/cpb.2007.0056"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.07.001"", ""10.1007/BF00383391"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9161-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0365-9"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9645-4"", ""10.1509/jmkg.73.5.30"", ""10.1080/23736992.2016.1258993"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0182-1"", ""10.2307/j.ctv62hf03"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.12.002"", ""10.1016/S0148-2963(00)00120-X"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsx004"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.06.008"", ""10.17705/1jais.00534"", ""10.1509/jmkg.68.1.1.24036"", ""10.1007/s11747-007-0069-6"", ""10.1007/s11747-015-0456-3"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2008.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.im.2015.04.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0823-z"", ""10.1016/S0022-4359(03)00034-4"", ""10.1108/IntR-01-2017-0037"", ""10.1509/jmr.15.0204"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2017.11.010"", ""10.1086/651257"", ""10.2753/JEC1086-4415150101""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1111/bioe.12805,BIOETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Recommendations on COVID-19 triage: international comparison and ethical analysis,"AbstractOn March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization classified COVID‐19, caused by Sars‐CoV‐2, as a pandemic. Although not much was known about the new virus, the first outbreaks in China and Italy showed that potentially a large number of people worldwide could fall critically ill in a short period of time. A shortage of ventilators and intensive care resources was expected in many countries, leading to concerns about restrictions of medical care and preventable deaths. In order to be prepared for this challenging situation, national triage guidance has been developed or adapted from former influenza pandemic guidelines in an increasing number of countries over the past few months. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis of triage recommendations from selected national and international professional societies, including Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Pakistan, South Africa, Switzerland, the United States, and the International Society of Critical Care Medicine. We describe areas of consensus, including the importance of prognosis, patient will, transparency of the decision‐making process, and psychosocial support for staff, as well as the role of justice and benefit maximization as core principles. We then probe areas of disagreement, such as the role of survival versus outcome, long‐term versus short‐term prognosis, the use of age and comorbidities as triage criteria, priority groups and potential tiebreakers such as ‘lottery’ or ‘first come, first served’. Having explored a number of tensions in current guidance, we conclude with a suggestion for framework conditions that are clear, consistent and implementable. This analysis is intended to advance the ongoing debate regarding the fair allocation of limited resources and may be relevant for future policy‐making.","[{""name"": ""Susanne Jöbges"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine University of Zurich  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Rasita Vinay"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Biomedical Ethics and History of Medicine University of Zurich  Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Valerie A.

This is a significant point of tension between ethicists, programmers, clinicians and anyone else working on developing AI for healthcare applications. However, the precise definition of these systems are often left undefined, vague, unclear or are assumed to be standardised within AI circles. This leads to situations where individuals working on AI talk over each other and has been invoked in numerous debates between opaque and explainable systems. This paper proposes a coherent and clear definition for the black box problem to assist in future discussions about AI in healthcare. This is accomplished by synthesising various definitions in the literature and examining several criteria that can be extrapolated from these definitions.","[{""name"": ""Jordan Joseph Wadden"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s13347-019-00382-7"", ""10.1080/13676261.2013.830707"", ""10.1007/s12552-014-9141-2"", ""10.1186/s13037-019-0188-2"", ""10.1007/s11606-016-3921-x"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1662/1/012012"", ""10.1002/9781444342673"", ""10.1258/jrsm.2010.100146"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198747048.003.0011"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0048-x"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106820"", ""10.1145/3236386.3241340"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00372-9"", ""10.2106/JBJS.N.01112"", ""10.1007/s11023-019-09502-w"", ""10.1017/S0963180119000847"", ""10.1136/bmjqs-2019-009484"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190493028.001.0001"", ""10.1001/amajethics.2019.138"", ""10.1007/s10916-018-1088-1""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

A good classification not only gives generally accepted and understandable names to similar rocks but also links the bulk chemical composition to the stoichiometry of the constituent minerals and, potentially, also to the likely source, magmatic evolution and tectonic setting. The ‘ideal’ granitoid classification should be based on chemical criteria amenable to an objective treatment. Statistical analysis helps to identify the most discriminant variables. The key properties are (1) acidity/maficity, (2) alkalinity (balance of Na + K v. Ca), (3) aluminosity (balance of Al v. Ca, Na and K), (4) Fe/Mg balance and (5) Na/K balance and K contents at the given SiO 2 level. These are used by successful classifications, e.g. the I/S dichotomy is based mainly on aluminosity, while the Frost et al. (2001; ‘A geochemical classification for granitic rocks', Journal of Petrology , 42 , 2033–2048, https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033 ) classification includes all but Na/K. Even though it is commonplace to use weight percentages of oxides, we suggest that a better strategy is to employ simple atomic parameters (e.g. millications-based) that can be directly linked to modal proportions and compositions/crystal structure of individual rock-forming minerals. This facilitates a petrological interpretation, which, in turn, can be related to petrogenesis and, ultimately, to likely tectonic setting(s).","[{""name"": ""Bernard Bonin"", ""affiliation"": [""UMR

10.1111/nous.12351,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,The search for invertebrate consciousness,"AbstractThere is no agreement on whether any invertebrates are conscious and no agreement on a methodology that could settle the issue. How can the debate move forward? I distinguish three broad types of approach: theory‐heavy, theory‐neutral and theory‐light. Theory‐heavy and theory‐neutral approaches face serious problems, motivating a middle path: the theory‐light approach. At the core of the theory‐light approach is a minimal commitment about the relation between phenomenal consciousness and cognition that is compatible with many specific theories of consciousness: the hypothesis that phenomenally conscious perception of a stimulus facilitates, relative to unconscious perception, a cluster of cognitive abilities in relation to that stimulus. This “facilitation hypothesis” can productively guide inquiry into invertebrate consciousness. What is needed? At this stage, not more theory, and not more undirected data gathering. What is needed is a systematic search for consciousness‐linked cognitive abilities, their relationships to each other, and their sensitivity to masking.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Birch"", ""affiliation"": [""The London School of Economics and Political Science""]}]","[""10.1073/pnas.1606942113"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1153"", ""10.1111/j.0029-4624.2004.00486.x"", ""10.1007/s10806‐011‐9364‐9"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195304787.003.0006"", ""10.5840/jphil2008105833"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1137"", ""10.4324/9780203712511"", ""10.1002/9781119132363.ch16"", ""10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80127-7"", ""10.1073/pnas.1520084113"", ""10.1093/nc/niy007"", ""10.1037/0735-7044.118.6.1157"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1200"", ""10.1017/S0140525X07002786"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2011.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2006.06.064"", ""10.3389/fphys.2017.00054"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487491"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2018.06.012"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198843702.001.0001"", ""10.1242/jeb.201.4.515"", ""10.1126/science.280.5360.77"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00099"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00356"", ""10.1016/s1364-6613(02)02041-7"", ""10.3758/BF03200062"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2011.03.018"", ""10.1126/science.aan8871"", ""10.1007/BF02379970"", ""10.1017/S0140525X07000982"", ""10.7120/096272812X13353700593365"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10714.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11793.001.0001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01041"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11006.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2010.11.025"", ""10.1007/s00359-019-01320-w"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1168"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1011"", ""10.1073/pnas.1606835113"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1113"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1181"", ""10.1037/0735-7044.115.4.747"", ""10.1038/nrn.2016.22"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2014.08.016"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4962-11.2012"", ""10.1098/rspb.2018.0661"", ""10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.05.002"", ""10.1037/0097-7403.28.1.3"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2006.11.006"", ""10.1016/S1053-8100(03)00002-3"", ""10.1016/S1053-8100(03)00002-3"", ""10.1017/S0140525X09000855"", ""10.3389/fnbeh.2010.00048"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2014.04.009"", ""10.2307/2183914"", ""10.1098/rstb.2017.0353"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2012.08.003"", ""10.1098/rstb.2017.0347"", ""10.1017/S0140525X07001100"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198236979.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X07001124"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2018.02.008"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00483.x"", ""10.1093/bjps/axp046"", ""10.1093/nc/niw005"", ""10.1016/j.beproc.2014.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.007"", ""10.1126/science.aay8064"", ""10.1007/s10071-013-0704-1"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6668-10.2011"", ""10.1080/17470218.2017.1373834"", ""10.1038/nrn.2016.44"", ""10.1098/rstb.2014.0167"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6712.001.0001"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1134"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199758784.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X0700115X"", ""10.1177/0956797615625973""]","['Psychology', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7525), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7489)], [('0713 生态学', 0.7488), ('0710 生物学', 0.7317)]]"

We examine the interrelated influence of these three factors on Americans’ intentions to vote for Trump in 2020. Consistent with previous research, Christian nationalism and Islamophobia remained strong and significant predictors of intention to vote for Trump; however, the effect of xenophobia was stronger. Further, xenophobia and Islamophobia significantly and substantially mediated the effects of Christian nationalism. Consequently, though Christian nationalism remains theoretically and empirically distinct as a cultural framework, its influence on intending to vote for Trump in 2020 is intimately connected to fears about ethnoracial outsiders. In the penultimate year before Trump’s reelection campaign, the strongest predictors of supporting Trump, in order of magnitude, were political party, xenophobia, identifying as African American (negative), political ideology, Christian nationalism, and Islamophobia.","[{""name"": ""Joseph O Baker"", ""affiliation"": [""East Tennessee State University""]}, {""name"": ""Samuel L Perry"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oklahoma""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew L Whitehead"", ""affiliation"": [""Clemson University""]}]","[""10.1177/0003122412465743"", ""10.1080/00380253.2018.1479202"", ""10.1007/s11109-018-9446-8"", ""10.1057/s41290-017-0042-x"", ""10.1093/socrel/sry013"", ""10.1093/socrel/srw056"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1080/01419870.2018.1506142"", ""10.1111/jssr.12510"", ""10.1093/socpro/spaa002"", ""10.1093/sf/soy080"", ""10.1093/socrel/srw057"", ""10.1080/00380253.2019.1625736"", ""10.1080/00380253.2019.1629847"", ""10.1093/socpro/spz039"", ""10.1017/S1537592718003365"", ""10.1080/15570274.2019.1643991"", ""10.1111/ajps.12101"", ""10.1007/s11186-019-09351-7"", ""10.1017/S0022381609090756"", ""10.1177/2053168017737411"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.7.1.83"", ""10.1177/1368430216677304"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226555812.001.0001"", ""10.1093/socrel/sry056"", ""10.1177/1532673X10371300"", ""10.1093/sf/89.4.1409"", ""10.15195/v5.a10"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718155115"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.1080/00380253.2019.1580543"", ""10.1080/01419870.2015.1015584"", ""10.1007/s12552-015-9144-7"", ""10.1177/2332649218790983"", ""10.3758/BF03206553"", ""10.3758/BRM.40.3.879"", ""10.1093/poq/nfz011"", ""10.1111/ssqu.12535"", ""10.1017/S1755048315000322"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77mmb"", ""10.1080/00380253.2017.1383144"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2007.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.electstud.2019.03.011"", ""10.1177/0731121415577724"", ""10.1111/cars.12241"", ""10.1093/socrel/srx070"", ""10.1177/2329496517725333"", ""10.1177/2378023118790189"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479838271.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jlb/lsaa064,JOURNAL OF LAW AND THE BIOSCIENCES,0301 Law; 0101 Philosophy,COVID-19 emergency measures and the impending authoritarian pandemic,"ABSTRACT COVID-19 has brought the world grinding to a halt. As of early August 2020, the greatest public health emergency of the century thus far has registered almost 20 million infected people and claimed over 730,000 lives across all inhabited continents, bringing public health systems to their knees, and causing shutdowns of borders and lockdowns of cities, regions, and even nations unprecedented in the modern era. Yet, as this Article demonstrates—with diverse examples drawn from across the world—there are unmistakable regressions into authoritarianism in governmental efforts to contain the virus. Despite the unprecedented nature of this challenge, there is no sound justification for systemic erosion of rights-protective democratic ideals and institutions beyond that which is strictly demanded by the exigencies of the pandemic. A Wuhan-inspired all-or-nothing approach to viral containment sets a dangerous precedent for future pandemics and disasters, with the global copycat response indicating an impending ‘pandemic’ of a different sort, that of authoritarianization. With a gratuitous toll being inflicted on democracy, civil liberties, fundamental freedoms, healthcare ethics, and human dignity, this has the potential to unleash humanitarian crises no less devastating than COVID-19 in the long run.","[{""name"": ""Stephen Thomson"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Law, City University of Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Eric C Ip"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Medical Ethics and Law, University of Hong Kong""]}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jlb/lsaa034,JOURNAL OF LAW AND THE BIOSCIENCES,0101 Philosophy; 0301 Law,"COVID-19 contact tracing apps: a stress test for privacy, the GDPR, and data protection regimes","Abstract Digital surveillance has played a key role in containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China, Singapore, Israel, and South Korea. Google and Apple recently announced the intention to build interfaces to allow Bluetooth contact tracking using Android and iPhone devices. In this article, we look at the compatibility of the proposed Apple/Google Bluetooth exposure notification system with Western privacy and data protection regimes and principles, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Somewhat counter-intuitively, the GDPR’s expansive scope is not a hindrance, but rather an advantage in conditions of uncertainty such as a pandemic. Its principle-based approach offers a functional blueprint for system design that is compatible with fundamental rights. By contrast, narrower, sector-specific rules such as the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and even the new California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), leave gaps that may prove difficult to bridge in the middle of an emergency.","[{""name"": ""Laura Bradford"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Law, Medicine and Life Sciences (LML), Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Mateo Aboy"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Law, Medicine and Life Sciences (LML), Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Kathleen Liddell"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Law, Medicine and Life Sciences (LML), Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK""]}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

No research team is exempt from the pressures and speed at which COVID-19 research is occurring. And this can increase the risk of honest error as well as misconduct. To date, 33 papers have been identified as unsuitable for public use and either retracted, withdrawn, or noted with concern.

The sequence of S- to I- to A-type granite is repeated at least three times. All the granites are syn-extensional, formed in a dominantly back-arc setting behind a single, stepwise-retreating arc system between 530 and 230 Ma. Peralkaline granites are rare. Systematic S–I–A progressions indicate the progressive dilution of an old crustal component as magmatism evolved from arc (S-type) to proximal back-arc (I-type) to distal back-arc (A-type) magmatism. The alkaline and peralkaline A-type Younger granites of Nigeria were generally hotter and drier than the Lachlan A-type granites and were emplaced into an anhydrous Precambrian basement during intermittent intracontinental rifting. This geodynamic environment contrasts with the distal back-arc setting of the Lachlan A-type granites, where magmatism migrated rapidly across the orogen. Tectonic discrimination diagrams are inappropriate for the Lachlan granites, placing them in the wrong settings. Only the peralkaline Narraburra suite of the Lachlan Orogen fits the genuine ‘within-plate’ setting of the Nigerian A-type granites. Such discrimination diagrams require re-evaluation in the light of an improved modern understanding of tectonic processes, particularly the role of extensional tectonism and its geodynamic drivers.","[{""name"": ""William J.

Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “AI hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.","[{""name"": ""Michael Townsen Hicks"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Humphries"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joe Slater"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7759/cureus.35179"", ""10.1017/9781108635820.011"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198826903.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2143.003.0015"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00016393"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00058611"", ""10.1093/analys/anad002"", ""10.1111/phib.12328"", ""10.1515/9781400826537"", ""10.1017/9781009256315"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262019200.001.0001"", ""10.1162/coli_a_00522"", ""10.1111/papq.12442"", ""10.1145/3498366.3505816""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1007/s10676-020-09573-9,ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,0101 Philosophy; 1205 Library and Information Science & Archive Management,We need to talk about deception in social robotics!,"AbstractAlthough some authors claim that deception requires intention, we argue that there can be deception in social robotics, whether or not it is intended. By focusing on the deceived rather than the deceiver, we propose that false beliefs can be created in the absence of intention. Supporting evidence is found in both human and animal examples. Instead of assuming that deception is wrong only when carried out to benefit the deceiver, we propose that deception in social robotics is wrong when it leads to harmful impacts on individuals and society. The appearance and behaviour of a robot can lead to an overestimation of its functionality or to an illusion of sentience or cognition that can promote misplaced trust and inappropriate uses such as care and companionship of the vulnerable. We consider the allocation of responsibility for harmful deception. Finally, we make the suggestion that harmful impacts could be prevented by legislation, and by the development of an assessment framework for sensitive robot applications.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Sharkey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Noel Sharkey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/JPROC.2011.2173265"", ""10.1016/S0950-5601(54)80001-3"", ""10.1080/09540091.2016.1271400"", ""10.1007/BF00987597"", ""10.4324/9781315562698"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199577415.001.0001"", ""10.1006/nimg.2001.0917"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9441-5"", ""10.1080/09540091.2016.1274959"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.114.4.864"", ""10.1007/s11229-017-1536-3"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.058"", ""10.1007/s13347-014-0158-7"", ""10.1080/09540090600873953"", ""10.1002/gps.1612"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9481-5"", ""10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.01.137"", ""10.1353/ken.2015.0007"", ""10.1126/science.1143921"", ""10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125"", ""10.1016/j.jamda.2013.02.007"", ""10.1007/s00146-016-0667-2"", ""10.1007/s10676-014-9338-5"", ""10.1007/s10676-016-9387-z"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9425-5"", ""10.1109/MRA.2010.940151"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9234-6"", ""10.1075/is.11.2.01sha"", ""10.1080/09540091.2017.1318826"", ""10.1023/A:1021386708994"", ""10.1007/s11023-006-9030-6"", ""10.1073/pnas.0707769104"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195374049.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10401-0_8""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We highlight many general pitfalls of ML model interpretation, such as using interpretation techniques in the wrong context, interpreting models that do not generalize well, ignoring feature dependencies, interactions, uncertainty estimates and issues in high-dimensional settings, or making unjustified causal interpretations, and illustrate them with examples. We focus on pitfalls for global methods that describe the average model behavior, but many pitfalls also apply to local methods that explain individual predictions. Our paper addresses ML practitioners by raising awareness of pitfalls and identifying solutions for correct model interpretation, but also addresses ML researchers by discussing open issues for further research.","[{""name"": ""Christoph Molnar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gunnar König"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julia Herbinger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Timo Freiesleben"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susanne Dandl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian A.

Empirical analysis of a cross-industry sample of 746 listed companies for the period 2002–2013 showed that the use of CSR-linked compensation contracts for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) promotes CSR performance. More specifically, we found that linking NEOs’ compensation to CSR goals produces positive effects in the 3rd year after adoption. As firms accumulate experience and learn how to use the system over the following eight periods, CSR performance increases monotonically. Furthermore, experience accumulated over time affects the different specifications of CSR performance asymmetrically, by reducing both environmental and social CSR concerns and increasing only environmental CSR strengths. Interestingly, we also found that the simultaneous use of other CSR-focused governance systems moderates the effect of a firm’s accumulated experience in using CSR-linked executive compensation on CSR performance: the existence of a CSR committee at the board level and the public release of a CSR report are likely to have a positive moderating effect, while the purchase of a CSR audit has no moderating effect.","[{""name"": ""Giovanni-Battista Derchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Zoni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Dossi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/0471249688"", ""10.1016/S0361-3682(03)00032-1"", ""10.1515/9781400829828"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.10.010"", ""10.1287/orsc.1100.0621"", ""10.1016/j.jacceco.2011.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.jacceco.2010.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.mar.2013.06.003"", ""10.1086/344122"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275520"", ""10.1023/A:1018321610509"", ""10.1257/089533003769204362"", ""10.2307/1600632"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00843.x"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.36461950"", ""10.1002/smj.714"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0909-7"", ""10.1111/j.1475-679X.2008.00275.x"", ""10.5465/amr.1979.4498296"", ""10.1002/smj.2407"", ""10.1002/smj.2131"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2006.09.009"", ""10.2308/accr-51200"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2007.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2006.08.008"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhq112"", ""10.1002/smj.476"", ""10.1002/bse.621"", ""10.1111/1475-679X.00064"", ""10.1177/0149206311411506"", ""10.1177/0149206305280113"", ""10.2308/accr.00000005"", ""10.2308/accr-10218"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2014.1984"", ""10.5465/amr.1989.4279003"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2014.2038"", ""10.1002/smj.3018"", ""10.1111/1467-6419.00150"", ""10.2307/1912791"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2343-0"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.1992.tb00657.x"", ""10.1093/jleo/7.special_issue.24"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2962-0"", ""10.5465/amp.2009.39985541"", ""10.2308/accr-51307"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0869-y"", ""10.2307/256977"", ""10.2308/jmar-51476"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00993.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1614-x"", ""10.1162/00346530151143815"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.09.008"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.14.080188.001535"", ""10.2307/3665557"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2975-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9073-x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1866371"", ""10.2308/accr-50629"", ""10.1177/0007650305281939"", ""10.1023/A:1024119604363"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1526-9"", ""10.1016/S0361-3682(97)00008-1"", ""10.5465/ambpp.2016.14068abstract"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68"", ""10.1002/smj.4250160202"", ""10.5465/amj.2005.17843939"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2007.00683.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1120.1630"", ""10.2308/accr.2009.84.3.937"", ""10.2308/accr.2000.75.3.299"", ""10.1002/bse.284"", ""10.1002/smj.1952""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Accounting', 'Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1007/s10551-023-05339-7,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,The Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) For Meaningful Work,"AbstractThe increasing workplace use of artificially intelligent (AI) technologies has implications for the experience of meaningful human work. Meaningful work refers to the perception that one’s work has worth, significance, or a higher purpose. The development and organisational deployment of AI is accelerating, but the ways in which this will support or diminish opportunities for meaningful work and the ethical implications of these changes remain under-explored. This conceptual paper is positioned at the intersection of the meaningful work and ethical AI literatures and offers a detailed assessment of the ways in which the deployment of AI can enhance or diminish employees’ experiences of meaningful work. We first outline the nature of meaningful work and draw on philosophical and business ethics accounts to establish its ethical importance. We then explore the impacts of three paths of AI deployment (replacing some tasks, ‘tending the machine’, and amplifying human skills) across five dimensions constituting a holistic account of meaningful work, and finally assess the ethical implications. In doing so we help to contextualise the meaningful work literature for the era of AI, extend the ethical AI literature into the workplace, and conclude with a range of practical implications and future research directions.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Bankins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul Formosa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1023/B:HUMA.0000042130.79208.c6"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsz022"", ""10.1111/joms.12406"", ""10.1177/1534484318804653"", ""10.1007/s10676-021-09619-6"", ""10.1080/1359432X.2019.1620328"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-63864-1_4"", ""10.1146/annurev-criminol-051520-012342"", ""10.1287/orsc.2020.1361"", ""10.1023/A:1006023500585"", ""10.1515/bis-2018-0018"", ""10.1177/0001839217713748"", ""10.1080/23808985.2008.11679077"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0275-1"", ""10.32855/fcapital.201902.012"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1017/9781316987308"", ""10.1007/s11023-021-09579-2"", ""10.1007/s00146-020-01089-6"", ""10.1016/j.cose.2021.102382"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019"", ""10.15185/izawol.344"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.24351328"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.93.1.108"", ""10.1111/jels.12276"", ""10.1037/h0076546"", ""10.1016/0030-5073(76)90016-7"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09517-8"", ""10.1109/MC.2018.3620965"", ""10.1016/S0262-4079(20)32269-7"", ""10.55613/jeet.v24i1.12"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.007"", ""10.1177/0266382119883999"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.5465/annals.2018.0174"", ""10.1016/S0167-4870(02)00201-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04204-w"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0118-9"", ""10.1177/1059601112461578"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2018.07.004"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01157"", ""10.1287/orsc.1120.0806"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1675-5"", ""10.1515/9780228002888"", ""10.1007/s00146-019-00887-x"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061200"", ""10.1111/apps.12241"", ""10.1108/JICES-12-2019-0138"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287598"", ""10.1177/09637214221091823"", ""10.1353/sor.2013.0027"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00377-4"", ""10.14763/2019.2.1410"", ""10.1111/joms.12421"", ""10.1080/00963402.2019.1604873"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.110.3.403"", ""10.1177/2053951720919776"", ""10.1007/s13347-014-0156-9"", ""10.2478/jagi-2019-0002"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-08277-2_8"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032516-113115"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7t3cm"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9242-6"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.07.001"", ""10.17705/1thci.00149""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

When beneficial, the psychedelic experience is characterized by features unlike those of other psychiatric and medical treatments. These include senses of losing self-importance, ineffable knowledge, feelings of unity and connection with others and encountering ‘deep’ reality or God. In addition to symptom relief, psychedelic experiences often lead to significant changes in a patient’s personality and worldview. Focusing on the case of psilocybin, we argue that the peculiar features of psychedelics pose certain novel risks, which warrant an enhanced informed consent process–one that is more comprehensive than what may be typical for other psychiatric medications. We highlight key issues that should be focused on during the consent process and suggest discussion prompts for enhanced consent in psychedelic psychiatry. Finally, we respond to potential objections before concluding with a discussion of ethical considerations that will arise as psychedelics proceed from highly controlled research environments into mainstream clinical psychiatry.","[{""name"": ""William R Smith"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominic Sisti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0269881116675512"", ""10.1007/s13311-017-0542-y"", ""10.1177/0269881116675513"", ""10.1007/s00213-017-4771-x"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30065-7"", ""10.1177/0269881116684335"", ""10.3109/00952990.2016.1170135"", ""10.1177/0269881119845793"", ""10.1177/0269881108093587"", ""10.1007/s00213-018-5010-9"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30135-4"", ""10.1177/0269881118806297"", ""10.1097/NMD.0000000000000113"", ""10.1097/JCP.0000000000000436"", ""10.1177/0269881108094300"", ""10.1017/S1358246118000474"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198862086.003.0016"", ""10.1093/nc/niz013"", ""10.1002/cpt.557"", ""10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.03.010"", ""10.1177/0022167817706884"", ""10.1111/acps.12904"", ""10.1177/0269881111420188"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.1992.tb00970.x"", ""10.1177/0022167817709585"", ""10.1007/s00213-017-4701-y"", ""10.1073/pnas.1119598109"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00020"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-13282-7"", ""10.1177/0269881114555249"", ""10.1007/s00213-019-05445-3"", ""10.1007/s00213-015-4162-0"", ""10.1056/NEJMra1411250"", ""10.1001/jama.2011.333"", ""10.1177/0269881116662634"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0063972"", ""10.1017/S0033291719002125"", ""10.1017/S0033291717000162"", ""10.1176/ajp.150.2.188"", ""10.1093/med/9780199234318.003.0014"", ""10.1037/a0014751"", ""10.1016/S0165-1781(99)00041-4"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2008.02.006"", ""10.1037/per0000238"", ""10.1037/bul0000088"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717959.003.0002"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.1994.tb00255.x"", ""10.1007/s12152-018-9386-3"", ""10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182a97e2b"", ""10.1111/j.1748-720X.2006.00014.x"", ""10.1080/15265161.2016.1145285"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13101434"", ""10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.05.012"", ""10.1056/NEJMcp074045"", ""10.1001/archpsyc.1993.01820240059008"", ""10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.01.008""]","['Chemistry', 'Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Complementary and alternative medicine', 'Organic Chemistry']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7239), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7184)], [('0703 化学', 0.7525), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7384)]]"
10.1007/s10551-022-05112-2,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Reviewing Paradox Theory in Corporate Sustainability Toward a Systems Perspective,"AbstractThe complexity of current social and environmental grand challenges generates many conflicts and tensions at the individual, organization and/or systems levels. Paradox theory has emerged as a promising way to approach such a complexity of corporate sustainability going beyond the instrumental business-case perspective and achieving superior sustainability performance. However, the fuzziness in the empirical use of the concept of “paradox” and the absence of a systems perspective limits its potential. In this paper, we perform a systematic review and content analysis of the empirical literature related to paradox and sustainability, offering a useful guide for researchers who intend to adopt the concept of “paradox” empirically. Our analysis provides a comprehensive account of the uses of the construct - which allows the categorization of the literature into three distinct research streams: 1) paradoxical tensions, 2) paradoxical frame/thinking, and 3) paradoxical actions/strategies - and a comprehensive overview of the findings that emerge in each of the three. Further, by adopting a system perspective, we propose a theoretical framework that considers possible interconnections across the identified paradoxical meanings and different levels of analysis (individual, organizational, systems) and discuss key research gaps emerging. Finally, we reflect on the role a clear notion of paradox can have in supporting business ethics scholars in developing a more “immanent” evaluation of corporate sustainability, overcoming the current instrumental view.","[{""name"": ""Simone Carmine"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Valentina De Marchi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10551-019-04265-x"", ""10.1287/orsc.1080.0406"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2019.04.002"", ""10.1002/smj.441"", ""10.1111/joms.12669"", ""10.5465/annals.2015.0095"", ""10.48558/fn21-my74"", ""10.5465/amj.2013.0903"", ""10.2307/2391741"", ""10.2307/41166409"", ""10.5465/amr.2017.0208"", ""10.3390/su10020424"", ""10.1002/bse.2798"", ""10.1002/csr.1972"", ""10.1177/0170840616655483"", ""10.1287/orsc.1090.0426"", ""10.1093/OBO/9780199846740-0201"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3582-7"", ""10.1108/09600030810882816"", ""10.1093/reseval/rvy001"", ""10.1177/0170840619857467"", ""10.1002/csr.1719"", ""10.1177/0266242619884852"", ""10.1002/bse.323"", ""10.1002/tqem.3310080106"", ""10.1177/0170840620937892"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3733-x"", ""10.1177/0170840614563742"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2020.102066"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1245-2"", ""10.5465/amr.1995.9512280024"", ""10.1108/JOCM-01-2018-0018"", ""10.1177/14761270211038635"", ""10.1080/09585192.2015.1033641"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2678-1"", ""10.1002/bse.674"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3587-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2047-5"", ""10.5465/amr.2012.0341"", ""10.1177/0170840616640843"", ""10.5465/amj.2016.0960"", ""10.1007/s10021-001-0101-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-021-04775-7"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6622.2001.tb00434.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04411-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4065-1"", ""10.5465/AMR.2006.22527456"", ""10.5465/AMR.2000.3707712"", ""10.1525/cmr.2014.56.3.58"", ""10.1177/0021886314522322"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.06.006"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3806-5"", ""10.1111/jscm.12213"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2018.06.004"", ""10.5465/AMJ.2008.31767217"", ""10.1080/19416520.2014.873177"", ""10.1080/0034340032000108796"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.06.005"", ""10.1177/1086026608321329"", ""10.1177/1086026614526413"", ""10.5465/AMR.1999.2553253"", ""10.1509/jppm.15.143"", ""10.1126/science.aai9214"", ""10.1007/s10490-015-9448-6"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2018.12.003"", ""10.5465/amj.2012.1004"", ""10.1111/joms.12137"", ""10.1002/bse.2737"", ""10.1007/BF01405730"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9466-5"", ""10.1111/joms.12398"", ""10.1080/19416520.2016.1162422"", ""10.1177/0170840621993238"", ""10.1177/0170840616683739"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3584-5"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198754428.013.23"", ""10.5465/amr.1995.9512280026"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.076"", ""10.1177/0170840612463319"", ""10.1287/orsc.2014.0960"", ""10.1177/1086026619837131"", ""10.1177/0001839217750826"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2009.12.003"", ""10.5465/amr.2009.0223"", ""10.1177/1086026619885108"", ""10.5465/amr.1995.9512280025"", ""10.1002/csr.1786"", ""10.1111/1467-8551.00375"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.06.063"", ""10.1177/1086026615575047"", ""10.1002/csr.1684"", ""10.1080/13602381.2019.1590054"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01073.x"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.002"", ""10.1145/2601248.2601268"", ""10.1111/jscm.12170"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-10-2020-0709""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1007/s11097-019-09634-5,PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES,0101 Philosophy,Loving and knowing: reflections for an engaged epistemology,"AbstractIn search of our highest capacities, cognitive scientists aim to explain things like mathematics, language, and planning (and while explaining them, they often imagine computers at work). But are these really our most sophisticated forms of knowing? In this paper, I point to a different pinnacle of cognition. Our most sophisticatedhuman knowing, I think, lies in how we engage with each other, in our relating. Cognitive science and philosophy of mind have largely ignored the ways of knowing at play here. At the same time, the emphasis on discrete, rational knowing to the detriment of engaged, human knowing pervades societal practices and institutions, often with harmful effects on people and their relations. There are many reasons why we need a new, engaged—or even engaging—epistemology of human knowing. The enactive theory of participatory sense-making takes steps towards this, but it needs deepening. Kym Maclaren’s (2002) idea ofletting beinvites such a deepening. Characterizing knowing as a relationship ofletting beprovides a nuanced way to deal with the tensions between the knower’s being and the being of the known, as they meet in the process of knowing-and-being-known. This meeting of knower and known is not easy to understand. However, there is a mode of relating in which we know it well, and that is: in loving relationships. I propose to look at human knowing through the lens ofloving. We then see that both knowing and loving are existential, dialectic ways in which concrete and particular beings engage with each other.","[{""name"": ""Hanne De Jaegher"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.1007/s11245-015-9355-y"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2015.12.002"", ""10.1177/1059712313482804"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01186.x"", ""10.1007/s11097-014-9404-9"", ""10.1007/s11019-018-9866-6"", ""10.1515/cogsem.2012.4.1.225"", ""10.1017/9781108685214"", ""10.1007/s11097-007-9076-9"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009"", ""10.1098/rstb.2015.0378"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01059"", ""10.1007/s11097-005-9002-y"", ""10.1007/s11245-008-9042-3"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2012.00163"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198735410.013.4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198786849.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11244.001.0001"", ""10.1016/bs.plm.2018.10.002"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64334-2_24"", ""10.1057/9780230109698"", ""10.1075/ceb.6"", ""10.1075/aicr.84.03fuc"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511552045"", ""10.2307/2095141"", ""10.7312/gros18162"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816679584.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315851464"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11cw25q"", ""10.3390/bs8020023"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262018548.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520956865"", ""10.1177/1471301211421073"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9566.2009.01158.x"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01081"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00986"", ""10.1017/S0140525X1900061X"", ""10.1037/a0035293"", ""10.1177/1059712318800673"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.1987.tb01062.x"", ""10.5840/chiasmi2002431"", ""10.5325/j.ctv14gpckz.5"", ""10.1007/s11097-017-9519-x"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-8947-4"", ""10.4324/9780203720714"", ""10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00695.x"", ""10.4324/9781315660813-3"", ""10.4159/9780674033887"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511611162.015"", ""10.1177/1474885118795284"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01390"", ""10.5749/j.ctt1pwt77c"", ""10.1023/B:PHEN.0000048936.73339.dd"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2006.tb01110.x"", ""10.1007/s11097-017-9500-8"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3406-4_5"", ""10.1006/brcg.1997.0907"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6730.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04936-2"", ""10.1007/s11019-013-9515-z"", ""10.1075/celcr.12""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1186/s12910-020-00495-1,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Relational autonomy in end-of-life care ethics: a contextualized approach to real-life complexities,"AbstractBackgroundRespect for autonomy is a paramount principle in end-of-life ethics. Nevertheless, empirical studies show that decision-making, exclusively focused on the individual exercise of autonomy fails to align well with patients’ preferences at the end of life. The need for a more contextualized approach that meets real-life complexities experienced in end-of-life practices has been repeatedly advocated. In this regard, the notion of ‘relational autonomy’ may be a suitable alternative approach. Relational autonomy has even been advanced as a foundational notion of palliative care, shared decision-making, and advance-care planning. However, relational autonomy in end-of-life care is far from being clearly conceptualized or practically operationalized.Main bodyHere, we develop a relational account of autonomy in end-of-life care, one based on a dialogue between lived reality and conceptual thinking. We first show that the complexities of autonomy as experienced by patients and caregivers in end-of-life practices are inadequately acknowledged. Second, we critically reflect on how engaging a notion of relational autonomy can be an adequate answer to addressing these complexities. Our proposal brings into dialogue different ethical perspectives and incorporates multidimensional, socially embedded, scalar, and temporal aspects of relational theories of autonomy. We start our reflection with a case in end-of-life care, which we use as an illustration throughout our analysis.ConclusionThis article develops a relational account of autonomy, which responds to major shortcomings uncovered in the mainstream interpretation of this principle and which can be applied to end-of-life care practices.","[{""name"": ""Carlos Gómez-Vírseda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yves de Maeseneer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Gastmans"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3562967"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625206"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195113976.001.0001"", ""10.1136/medethics-2014-102282"", ""10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2018.12.339"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0151435"", ""10.1007/s11019-011-9365-5"", ""10.1017/9781107337909"", ""10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53317.x"", ""10.1177/0269216315583032"", ""10.1001/jama.284.19.2476"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195123333.001.0001"", ""10.1515/auk-2008-0206"", ""10.1111/jan.12267"", ""10.1186/s13054-018-2187-6"", ""10.1111/opn.12314"", ""10.1177/0969733019848031"", ""10.1017/S1478951519000865"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0417-3"", ""10.1378/chest.09-1574"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2007.04.011"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009895"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.2000.06289.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195123333.003.0001"", ""10.1542/peds.2013-3608D"", ""10.1007/s00520-017-3867-5"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-80253-7"", ""10.1001/archinternmed.2011.180"", ""10.1086/598969"", ""10.1177/0269216310373169"", ""10.1200/JCO.2007.11.1922"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.04101.x"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0361-2"", ""10.1177/0269216311404275"", ""10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2016.02.009"", ""10.1177/1074840718754314"", ""10.1001/jama.274.10.820"", ""10.1001/jama.286.23.2993"", ""10.1093/geront/42.suppl_3.114"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9833.2008.00440.x"", ""10.2307/3563417"", ""10.1002/hast.544"", ""10.1353/ken.2018.0013"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0401-y"", ""10.1186/s12913-018-3622-8"", ""10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01232.x"", ""10.1177/0969733011436206"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199969104.003.0002"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0536-4_22"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199969104.003.0014"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199969104.003.0008"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01056.x"", ""10.1007/s11606-010-1292-2"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181c58842"", ""10.1353/pbm.2003.0093"", ""10.1076/jmep.26.4.365.3012"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhr029"", ""10.1080/13814788.2018.1517154"", ""10.1023/A:1012048907443"", ""10.1542/peds.2018-0516F"", ""10.1177/0969733010386165"", ""10.1111/j.1471-6712.2007.00561.x"", ""10.2307/3563360"", ""10.1177/096973300000700405"", ""10.1111/bioe.12688"", ""10.2143/BIJ.62.3.778"", ""10.1111/1467-8519.00070"", ""10.5737/1181912x223175181"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2004.00383.x"", ""10.3138/ijfab.4.2.79"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1109283"", ""10.1136/jme.10.4.173"", ""10.1111/opn.12255"", ""10.1186/s13010-019-0075-6"", ""10.1111/jan.12412"", ""10.1177/0969733019884621"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49250-6_7"", ""10.4324/9780203927076"", ""10.1017/S095382080800304X"", ""10.1056/NEJMra1801063"", ""10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00638.x""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/beer.12308,BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Political connections and corporate social responsibility: Political incentives in China,"AbstractTo explore the motivations underpinning corporate social responsibility (CSR) decisions in China, a country characterized by extensive government intervention, this paper investigates whether building a good relationship with the government is a political incentive that is driving firms to conduct CSR by examining the effects of political connections on the latter. Our results indicate that politically connected firms exhibit better CSR. However, the effect is considerably more significant for firms with existing political relationships. Additionally, findings show that the effect is more prominent in firms for which political connections are more valuable, namely, non‐state‐owned enterprises, small firms, and firms operating in less market‐oriented cities, indicating that CSR can serve as a differentiation strategy to compete against other bidders. Dividing CSR activities into economic, environmental and social aspects, we find that the social‐based activities are more likely to be driven by political motivations. By categorizing CSR and political connections, this paper not only expands the scope of political CSR and renders the generated results that have been mixed together more distinguishable, but also provides a more precise understanding of the fundamental drivers of CSR in China from the perspective of resource exchange.","[{""name"": ""Shan Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Business Administration South China University of Technology Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Duchi Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Linnan College Sun Yat‐Sen University Guangzhou China""]}]","[""10.1177/0170840617708007"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275678"", ""10.1111/grow.12348"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2014.03.008"", ""10.1080/00207543.2011.564668"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275684"", ""10.2307/257850"", ""10.1111/beer.12176"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2010.09.009"", ""10.1080/01463379409369919"", ""10.1016/j.jfs.2018.02.010"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2012.03.013"", ""10.1177/0149206309347958"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2006.11.003"", ""10.2307/258888"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2014.10.012"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2004.05.010"", ""10.1177/0170840611430595"", ""10.1002/csr.1282"", ""10.1111/joms.12173"", ""10.2307/2785619"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.02.080176.002003"", ""10.1257/000282806776157704"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2006.03.008"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2014.2038"", ""10.1002/smj.2767"", ""10.1111/beer.12115"", ""10.1177/014920639402000101"", ""10.1111/beer.12277"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9982-y"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2010.12.003"", ""10.1111/beer.12144"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.10.002"", ""10.1111/beer.12036"", ""10.1177/0149206309343469"", ""10.1023/A:1016247920461"", ""10.1177/0007650315623014"", ""10.1111/beer.12153"", ""10.3390/su10051582"", ""10.1186/s40991-016-0007-3"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2020.101127"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12112"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2015.08.003"", ""10.1002/ase.1771"", ""10.1111/beer.12223"", ""10.1057/emr.2010.18"", ""10.1177/0149206315602530"", ""10.1002/smj.2127"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2007.03.001"", ""10.1093/ei/cbj031"", ""10.3390/su11020354"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0488-z"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.07.046"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2014.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.01.001"", ""10.1111/jofi.12505"", ""10.1016/j.jacceco.2015.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2009.06.001"", ""10.5465/19416520.2015.1014661"", ""10.1111/beer.12248"", ""10.1111/beer.12228"", ""10.1257/002205105774431252"", ""10.1111/beer.12235"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.05.034"", ""10.2307/258610"", ""10.1108/MD-05-2017-0530"", ""10.1111/beer.12206"", ""10.1111/beer.12164"", ""10.1111/beer.12119"", ""10.1023/A:1010786912118"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.12.024"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00950.x"", ""10.1111/joms.12203"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.4700.2006.sp.00004"", ""10.1017/S0022216X09990186"", ""10.1002/bse.1876"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2017.12.023"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3022-0"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12224"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0183-0"", ""10.3390/su10030741"", ""10.1002/smj.2761"", ""10.1111/beer.12271"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2008.00538.x"", ""10.1057/crr.2009.26"", ""10.1177/0149206310375850"", ""10.5465/amj.2016.5001"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0306-7"", ""10.1016/j.jacceco.2008.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2011.10.005"", ""10.1177/0312896213517894"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0224-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1243-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3622-3"", ""10.1016/j.eneco.2017.10.036"", ""10.1287/orsc.2016.1084"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.050""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']",['Strategy and Management'],"[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

10.1186/s12910-022-00766-z,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Ethics education to support ethical competence learning in healthcare: an integrative systematic review,"Abstract Background Ethical problems in everyday healthcare work emerge for many reasons and constitute threats to ethical values. If these threats are not managed appropriately, there is a risk that the patient may be inflicted with moral harm or injury, while healthcare professionals are at risk of feeling moral distress. Therefore, it is essential to support the learning and development of ethical competencies among healthcare professionals and students. The aim of this study was to explore the available literature regarding ethics education that promotes ethical competence learning for healthcare professionals and students undergoing training in healthcare professions. Methods In this integrative systematic review, literature was searched within the PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo databases using the search terms ‘health personnel’, ‘students’, ‘ethics’, ‘moral’, ‘simulation’, and ‘teaching’. In total, 40 articles were selected for review. These articles included professionals from various healthcare professions and students who trained in these professions as subjects. The articles described participation in various forms of ethics education. Data were extracted and synthesised using thematic analysis. Results The review identified the need for support to make ethical competence learning possible, which in the long run was considered to promote the ability to manage ethical problems. Ethical competence learning was found to be helpful to healthcare professionals and students in drawing attention to ethical problems that they were not previously aware of. Dealing with ethical problems is primarily about reasoning about what is right and in the patient’s best interests, along with making decisions about what needs to be done in a specific situation. Conclusions The review identified different designs and course content for ethics education to support ethical competence learning. The findings could be used to develop healthcare professionals’ and students’ readiness and capabilities to recognise as well as to respond appropriately to ethically problematic work situations.","[{""name"": ""Henrik Andersson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anders Svensson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Catharina Frank"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andreas Rantala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mats Holmberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anders Bremer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03606.x"", ""10.1136/emermed-2014-204081"", ""10.1177/0969733016667773"", ""10.1177/0969733020911077"", ""10.1111/opn.12423"", ""10.1111/scs.12079"", ""10.1016/j.ienj.2015.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.ienj.2010.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.ienj.2011.06.007"", ""10.1177/1477750919851050"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05425.x"", ""10.1177/0969733019848044"", ""10.1186/s12910-018-0334-x"", ""10.1016/j.jen.2012.12.009"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6198.1987.tb00794.x"", ""10.1136/emermed-2017-207216"", ""10.1108/03090599710171567"", ""10.1111/jan.12213"", ""10.1177/0969733016642627"", ""10.1177/0969733007082142"", ""10.1177/0969733014533241"", ""10.1177/0969733007082116"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2011.02.006"", ""10.1177/0969733011408054"", ""10.1197/j.aem.2004.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2013.02.012"", ""10.4102/curationis.v41i1.1925"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03621.x"", ""10.1136/bmj.b2700"", ""10.1186/s13643-016-0384-4"", ""10.1177/1049732302238251"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.1997.1997025977.x"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.4103/1357-6283.210501"", ""10.1080/17496535.2015.1023737"", ""10.1136/medethics-2011-100468"", ""10.1177/0091217418791445"", ""10.1136/medethics-2012-101278"", ""10.1177/0969733021994188"", ""10.1177/1363459319889102"", ""10.1186/s12910-018-0297-y"", ""10.1186/s12910-015-0017-9"", ""10.1177/0969733015583184"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02425-6"", ""10.1177/0969733015622060"", ""10.1016/j.kjms.2013.05.005"", ""10.4103/jehp.jehp_708_20"", ""10.1177/0969733013505308"", ""10.1016/j.kjms.2013.05.006"", ""10.3109/13561820.2016.1146877"", ""10.1080/00981389.2014.884042"", ""10.1111/jmwh.12185"", ""10.1111/nin.12174"", ""10.1016/j.profnurs.2012.04.020"", ""10.5116/ijme.5b39.d5d2"", ""10.1111/ajr.12016"", ""10.3109/08039488.2014.994032"", ""10.4103/1357-6283.178927"", ""10.1136/medethics-2016-103762"", ""10.3390/ijerph17217748"", ""10.1177/0969733011398097"", ""10.20529/IJME.2018.056"", ""10.1177/0969733014542673"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104601"", ""10.1007/s10728-020-00401-1"", ""10.3205/zma001470"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03722.x"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1181-7"", ""10.1152/advan.00183.2016"", ""10.3390/ijerph18010241"", ""10.1177/0969733016667775"", ""10.2147/CIA.S213644"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2021.105026"", ""10.1111/medu.14154"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104389"", ""10.1177/0969733014523166"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2018.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2011.03.018"", ""10.1186/s12910-018-0325-y"", ""10.1177/0969733015574925""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1002/hast.1080,HASTINGS CENTER REPORT,0101 Philosophy; 1204 Public Administration; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,"Trust, Risk, and Race in American Medicine","AbstractThere is ample evidence that patient mistrust toward the American medical system is to some extent associated with communal and individual experiences of racism. For groups who have faced exploitation and discrimination at the hands of physicians, the medical profession, and medical institutions, trust is a tall order and, in many cases, would be naive. Nevertheless, trust is often regarded as a central feature of the physician‐patient relationship. In this article, I draw on empirical research, ethical theory, and clinical cases to propose one way that providers might address and, ideally, resolve mistrust when it arises in an immediate case.I describe how medical mistrust has been characterized empirically within medical and bioethics scholarship, and I provide an overview of theories of trust, arguing that they may be unable to account for the risks that providers must take in seeking to establish trust within many American medical institutions. Common assumptions in medical and bioethical scholarship on trust notwithstanding, caring and competence are not always enough to establish a trusting relationship between physician and patient. I suggest that, in an atmosphere of mistrust, comprehension of the existence and source of suspicion is essential to effective signaling of trustworthiness.","[{""name"": ""Laura Specker Sullivan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102526"", ""10.1073/pnas.1516047113"", ""10.1086/JCE2016272154"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.16.1.34"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.2002.11132.x"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.1999.07048.x"", ""10.1177/1077558700057001S07"", ""10.1016/S0033-3549(04)50262-5"", ""10.1007/s11524-016-0054-9"", ""10.1016/S0027-9684(15)30439-9"", ""10.1086/292745"", ""10.1086/667838"", ""10.1086/233694"", ""10.1076/jmep.27.1.11.2975"", ""10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2018.12.017"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511618024"", ""10.1007/s11406-009-9218-0""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Pharmacy', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

We re-examine the prevailing model inferred from this classification that magma-rich margins have excess decompression melting at lithospheric breakup compared with steady-state seafloor spreading, while magma-poor margins have inhibited melting. We investigate the magmatic budget related to lithospheric breakup along two high-resolution long-offset deep reflection seismic profiles across the SE Indian (magma-poor) and Uruguayan (magma-rich) rifted margins. Resolving the magmatic budget is difficult and several interpretations can explain our seismic observations, implying different mechanisms to achieve lithospheric breakup and melt production for each archetype. We show that the Uruguayan and other magma-rich margins may indeed involve excess decompression melting compared with steady-state seafloor spreading but could also be explained by a gradual increase with an early onset relative to crustal breakup. A late onset of decompression melting relative to crustal breakup enables mantle exhumation characteristic of magma-poor margin archetypes (e.g. SE India). Despite different volumes of magmatism, the mechanisms suggested at lithospheric breakup are comparable between both archetypes. Considerations on the timing of decompression melting onset relative to crustal thinning may be more important than the magmatic budget to understand the evolution and variability of rifted margins.","[{""name"": ""Julie Tugend"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg, CNRS-UMR 7516, Université de Strasbourg, 1 rue Blessig, F-67084 Strasbourg Cedex, France"",

In a region that suffers from severe inequalities, public healthcare systems are the only source of medical care for a large sector of the population who work in the informal economy or are unemployed. State‐run hospitals and clinics are already overstressed by continuous demand for treatment of vector‐borne diseases and community‐acquired infections as well as high rates of non‐communicable diseases. Ideological misconceptions and denial among Latin America’s political leaders prevented timely preparations for the pandemic and added to chronic governance problems. As ethical expertise in Latin America focuses on research ethics, few hospitals in the region have functioning clinical ethics committees or clinical ethics policy, forcing healthcare personnel to make excruciating treatment decisions in an environment dominated by material scarcity and public distrust. This essay examines the emergence of COVID‐19 in Latin America and the serious challenge that it poses for Latin America's public healthcare systems.","[{""name"": ""Sergio G.

In various cases, such algorithms have preserved or even exacerbated biases against vulnerable communities, sparking a vibrant field of research focused on so‐called algorithmic biases. This research includes work on identification, diagnosis, and response to biases in algorithm‐based decision‐making. This paper aims to facilitate the application of philosophical analysis to these contested issues by providing an overview of three key topics: What is algorithmic bias? Why and how can it occur? What can and should be done about it? Throughout, we highlight connections—both actual and potential—with philosophical ideas and concerns.","[{""name"": ""Sina Fazelpour"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy and Religion Northeastern University  Boston Massachusetts USA""]}, {""name"": ""David Danks"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy Carnegie Mellon University  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania USA""]}]","[""10.1177/2053951720949566"", ""10.1515/9781400836826"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0007"", ""10.1111/hypa.12170"", ""10.1515/pjbr-2019-0004"", ""10.1177/0049124118782533"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939698"", ""10.1145/2783258.2788613"", ""10.1089/big.2016.0047"", ""10.1145/3376898"", ""10.1145/3097983.3098095"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-05469-3"", ""10.1126/science.aba9647"", ""10.1086/709729"", ""10.1145/3306618.3314228"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2017/654"", ""10.1145/3313831.3376638"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2010.06.003"", ""10.1037/xge0000033"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wrc78"", ""10.1145/2090236.2090255"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375828"", ""10.1145/2783258.2783311"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7585.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9801-7"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287573"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287563"", ""10.1093/annonc/mdy166"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1573912"", ""10.1145/3178876.3186044"", ""10.1145/3351095.3375674"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287600"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02696-y"", ""10.1007/s10115-011-0463-8"", ""10.1093/jla/laz001"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00372-9"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-00274-3"", ""10.1145/3097983.3098066"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375808"", ""10.1002/hast.973"", ""10.1037/a0016539"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226261317.001.0001"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287576"", ""10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-125902"", ""10.4324/9781315545882"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479833641.001.0001"", ""10.1126/science.aax2342"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287567"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0858-1"", ""10.2307/1122890"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287598"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2013.07.046"", ""10.1007/s11229-010-9793-4"", ""10.2307/1340593"", ""10.1017/apa.2016.25""]","['Neuroscience', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s10670-020-00252-1,ERKENNTNIS,0101 Philosophy,What Is the Function of Confirmation Bias?,"AbstractConfirmation bias is one of the most widely discussed epistemically problematic cognitions, challenging reliable belief formation and the correction of inaccurate views. Given its problematic nature, it remains unclear why the bias evolved and is still with us today. To offer an explanation, several philosophers and scientists have argued that the bias is in fact adaptive. I critically discuss three recent proposals of this kind before developing a novel alternative, what I call the ‘reality-matching account’. According to the account, confirmation bias evolved because it helps us influence people and social structures so that they come to match our beliefs about them. This can result in significant developmental and epistemic benefits for us and other people, ensuring that over time we don’t become epistemically disconnected from social reality but can navigate it more easily. While that might not be the only evolved function of confirmation bias, it is an important one that has so far been neglected in the theorizing on the bias.","[{""name"": ""Uwe Peters"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139208536"", ""10.1007/s11238-007-9043-5"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.67.2.264"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2007.05.001"", ""10.1177/01461672952111011"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.20"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.85.3.386"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.75.2.545"", ""10.5840/monist201396319"", ""10.1111/mila.12174"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8295.1996.tb02587.x"", ""10.1007/s11097-020-09658-2"", ""10.1016/j.shpsa.2019.05.006"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00351.x"", ""10.1177/1368430200003003001"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.14.1.51"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0045457"", ""10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_3"", ""10.1515/9781400873296"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2012.08.010"", ""10.2307/1128917"", ""10.1016/j.tree.2013.05.014"", ""10.1038/nature10384"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195366600.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X1500062X"", ""10.1038/s41593-019-0549-2"", ""10.1080/09515089.2017.1299857"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1101_01"", ""10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60315-1"", ""10.1111/jcc4.12105"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1177/0146167210376391"", ""10.1007/s11229-017-1477-x"", ""10.1080/14792779943000062"", ""10.1177/1745691616687745"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.47.6.1231"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.72.4.791"", ""10.1037/pspi0000142"", ""10.1007/s11199-006-8866-9"", ""10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01406.x"", ""10.1037/a0035127"", ""10.1098/rstb.2011.0301"", ""10.1017/S0140525X10000968"", ""10.2307/4609267"", ""10.1037/h0076539"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4124.001.0001"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-50821-w"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.71.6.1155"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.83.4.602"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175"", ""10.1007/s10539-016-9532-4"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucy004"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005684"", ""10.1177/0146167294204002"", ""10.1093/bjps/axy079"", ""10.1111/mila.12194"", ""10.1007/s11097-018-9584-9"", ""10.1162/003355399555945"", ""10.1177/147470491201000501"", ""10.1038/nn.2949"", ""10.1037/12061-002"", ""10.1007/s11229-017-1414-z"", ""10.11612/resphil.1766"", ""10.1006/obhd.2000.2926"", ""10.1075/bct.4.06sny"", ""10.1177/0963721413480174"", ""10.1086/699714"", ""10.1093/bjps/axi157"", ""10.1098/rstb.2006.2006"", ""10.1111/mila.12182"", ""10.4135/9781446249222.n27"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.46.6.1287"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.62.3.392"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2015"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.10.017"", ""10.1111/cogs.12303"", ""10.1038/s41562-018-0483-4"", ""10.1017/S0140525X10001354"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2007.00319.x"", ""10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01458.x"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02566-"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-31363-z"", ""10.4324/9781315652535-16"", ""10.1002/ejsp.429"", ""10.1016/0022-1031(74)90059-6"", ""10.1080/13869790802239235"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8441.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2008.00109.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

However, there is a need to consider how AI developers can be practically assisted to anticipate, identify and address ethical issues regarding AI technologies. This is particularly important in the development of AI intended for healthcare settings, where applications will often interact directly with patients in various states of vulnerability. In this paper, we propose that an ‘embedded ethics’ approach, in which ethicists and developers together address ethical issues via an iterative and continuous process from the outset of development, could be an effective means of integrating robust ethical considerations into the practical development of medical AI.","[{""name"": ""Stuart McLennan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amelia Fiske"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Tigard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ruth Müller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sami Haddadin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alena Buyx"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139046855.020"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09517-8"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0114-4"", ""10.1093/cjres/rsaa002"", ""10.1353/sor.2019.0022"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09521-y"", ""10.1145/3330794"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30127-X"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30123-2"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.17163"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16391-4_11"", ""10.1038/d41586-019-02871-3"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-05267-x"", ""10.7861/futurehosp.6-2-94"", ""10.1159/000319015"", ""10.2196/13216"", ""10.2196/10410"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1606181"", ""10.1001/amajethics.2019.121"", ""10.1007/s11948-017-9976-1"", ""10.1016/j.rasd.2011.05.006"", ""10.1126/science.aax2342"", ""10.1038/s42256-020-0214-1"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9444-x"", ""10.1186/s12910-018-0304-3"", ""10.1016/S0160-791X(03)00041-1"", ""10.1007/BF02687530"", ""10.1002/9781118551424"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-8956-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30371-6"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.05.008"", ""10.1002/9781118551424.ch3"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3914119"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00354-x"", ""10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1"", ""10.1016/j.inffus.2019.12.012"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-105118"", ""10.1076/0360-5310(200006)25:3;1-H;FT285"", ""10.1002/eahr.500065"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870052"", ""10.2307/j.ctvhrd092.18""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

We propose that these two approaches can be brought together into a productive synthesis. The key is to recognize that the two approaches are pursuing different but complementary types of explanation. Both approaches seek to explain behavior in terms of the animal–environment relation, but they start at opposite ends. Ecological psychologists pursue an ontological strategy. They begin by describing the habitat of the species, and use this to explain how action possibilities are constrained for individual actors. Enactivists, meanwhile, pursue an epistemic strategy: start by characterizing the exploratory, self-regulating behavior of the individual organism, and use this to understand how that organism brings forth its animal-specific umwelt. Both types of explanation are necessary: the ontological strategy explains how structure in the environment constrains how the world can appear to an individual, while the epistemic strategy explains how the world can appear differently to different members of the same species, relative to their skills, abilities, and histories. Making the distinction between species habitat and animal-specific umwelt allows us to understand the environment in realist terms while acknowledging that individual living organisms are phenomenal beings.","[{""name"": ""Edward Baggs"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anthony Chemero"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0966-6362(99)00051-X"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_5"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8367.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0959354395054001"", ""10.1007/s11097-007-9076-9"", ""10.4324/9781315643670-11"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(81)90009-3"", ""10.1075/is.13.3.06fro"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794325.001.0001"", ""10.1037/11579-005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511814563"", ""10.1080/10407413.2017.1297187"", ""10.4324/9780203120330"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262036115.001.0001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01321"", ""10.4324/9780203720714"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199775224.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10407413.2014.958035"", ""10.1080/03081079208945072"", ""10.1207/s15326969eco0304_2"", ""10.1207/s15326969eco0403_3"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(81)90002-0"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2014.10.012"", ""10.1093/0198244274.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6730.001.0001"", ""10.1515/semi.1992.89.4.319"", ""10.1007/s11245-017-9484-6""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Applying the Multidimensional Development Theory to the online environment, we identify the important factors under four dimensions—i.e., environmental, individual, information management, and interaction management. We tested our model using data from an online survey of 2417 individuals in Hong Kong. The results show that the factors under all four dimensions are significant in the formation of Internet privacy concern. Specifically, familiarity with government legislation, Internet knowledge, benefit of information disclosure, privacy protection, and social presence reduce Internet privacy concern, while individuals’ previous privacy invasion experience, risk avoidance personality, and sensitivity of information requested by websites increase Internet privacy concern. We conducted an analysis of unobserved heterogeneity to confirm the significance of these factors. A follow-up moderation analysis shows that the individual factors (i.e., previous privacy invasion experience, risk avoidance personality, and Internet knowledge) moderate the effects of the information management factor (i.e., information sensitivity) and the interaction management factors (i.e., privacy protection and social presence). The findings provide an integrated understanding of the formation of Internet privacy concern.","[{""name"": ""Weiyin Hong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank K. Y.

10.1007/s10551-019-04141-8,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Too Much of a Good Thing? On the Relationship Between CSR and Employee Work Addiction,"AbstractRecent research highlights the positive effects of organizational CSR engagement on employee outcomes, such as job and life satisfaction, performance, and trust. We argue that the current debate fails to recognize the potential risks associated with CSR. In this study, we focus on the risk of work addiction. We hypothesize that CSR has per se a positive effect on employees and can be classified as a resource. However, we also suggest the existence of an array of unintended negative effects of CSR. Since CSR positively influences an employee’s organizational identification, as well as his or her perception of engaging in meaningful work, which in turn motivates them to work harder while neglecting other spheres of their lives such as private relationships or health, CSR indirectly increases work addiction. Accordingly, organizational identification and work meaningfulness both act as buffering variables in the relationship, thus suppressing the negative effect of CSR on work addiction, which weakens the positive role of CSR in the workplace. Drawing on a sample of 565 Swiss employees taken from the 2017 Swiss Public Value Atlas dataset, our results provide support for our rationale. Our results also provide evidence that the positive indirect effects of organizational CSR engagement on work addiction, via organizational identification and work meaningfulness, become even stronger when employees care for the welfare of the wider public (i.e., the community, nation, or world).

The establishment of this discipline and its assumptions about the nature of science together with its goals and structure are briefly discussed. The history of science became a discipline only at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century, and its start is associated with the work of chemist James Conant, a high-level administrator in Manhattan project who was also president of Harvard University and a high-ranking bureaucrat. It was based also on the narrative developed by Alfred North Whitehead, Edwin Burtt, Alexandre Koyré and other historians of science, which claimed modern science was the creator of modernity and a necessary condition for the geopolitical domination of the West. In that understanding, modern science meant science since the time of Galileo and Newton. The author provides a critical analysis of this foundation narrative for the discipline and of its consequences while showing how contemporary history of science has overcome it. The contradiction between modernism and historicism has been resolved in favor of the latter. A key role in this was played by the book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn, which held the potential to undo the presumed monolithic unity of science by rejecting teleology and introducing incommensurability and discontinuities into the historical process. By rejecting explanation of the knowledge of other times and places in terms of modern science, the discipline faced a radical multiplication of independent types of knowledge. This was facilitated by the reorientation to the study of knowledge practices that took place in the 1980s. As a result, the subject matter of the history of science began to erode, and this launched discussion of the prospects for a transition to a history of knowledge based on the study of practices. The sweep of this change of vision is illustrated by the example of classifying sciences according to both their subject matter and the similarities in their research practices. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the new discipline along with its prospects and the challenges it faces are discussed.",[],[],['Arts and Humanities'],['History and Philosophy of Science'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)]]"

With the available evidence suggesting that medical students’ mental health status is already poorer than that of the general population, with academic stress being a chief predictor, such changes are likely to have a significant effect on these students. This online, cross-sectional study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 on perceived stress levels of medical students, investigate possible contributing and alleviating factors, and produce recommendations for medical schools to implement during future healthcare emergencies. The majority (54.5%) of respondents reported levels of stress ranging from moderate to extreme. Higher levels of stress were significantly associated with female gender (p=0.039) and international status (p=0.031). A significant association was also noted between reported stress and the transition to online learning (p&lt;0.0001) and online assessment formatting (p&lt;0.0001), concerns for personal health (p&lt;0.0001) and for the health of family members (p&lt;0.0001). Students who reported higher stress levels were less confident in their government’s management of the crisis (p=0.041). Additionally, students who reported lower stress agreed highly that their medical school had an appropriate response to the crisis (p&lt;0.0001), had provided sufficient information regarding the crisis (p=0.015), that they trust their school in handling the continuing of their education (p=0.020) and that their school had appropriate plans in place to support the continuing of education (p=0.017)","[{""name"": ""Lorcan O'Byrne"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Blánaid Gavin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dimitrios Adamis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""You Xin Lim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fiona McNicholas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/medethics-2020-106353"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02117-1"", ""10.1136/postgradmedj-2015-133677"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1535-9"", ""10.1080/10872981.2019.1603526"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.706339"", ""10.1007/S40037-017-0352-2"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2019.1652259"", ""10.1177/1039856220947945"", ""10.1017/ipm.2020.39"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018023"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031765"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.022"", ""10.1007/BF03403782"", ""10.1177/1090198104263660"", ""10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2005.03.006"", ""10.3201/eid1212.060584"", ""10.1017/S0033291708002778"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1912-4"", ""10.1111/medu.14206"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.04188.x"", ""10.1080/01421590600607195"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2003.01405.x"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2013.11.003""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The role of social media and emotional contagion,"AbstractPeople share their emotions on social media and evidence suggests that in times of crisis people are especially motivated to post emotional content. The current Coronavirus pandemic is such a crisis. The online sharing of emotional content during the Coronavirus crisis may contribute to societal value change. Emotion sharing via social media could lead to emotional contagion which in turn could facilitate an emotional climate in a society. In turn, the emotional climate of a society can influence society’s value structure. The emotions that spread in the current Coronavirus crisis are predominantly negative, which could result in a negative emotional climate. Based on the dynamic relations of values to each other and the way that emotions relate to values, a negative emotional climate can contribute to societal value change towards values related to security preservation and threat avoidance. As a consequence, a negative emotional climate and the shift in values could lead to a change in political attitudes that has implications for rights, freedom, privacy and moral progress. Considering the impact of social media in terms of emotional contagion and a longer-lasting value change is an important perspective in thinking about the ethical long-term impact of social media technology.","[{""name"": ""Steffen Steinert"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/a0034818"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2018.11.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511616037"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199685523.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2018.11.004"", ""10.1037/xge0000673"", ""10.1073/pnas.1618923114"", ""10.1109/ISI.2013.6578782"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190868413.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00447.x"", ""10.1080/00223980009600869"", ""10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00741.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0090315"", ""10.1038/s41562-017-0213-3"", ""10.2307/1519895"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3572023"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0110184"", ""10.1098/rstb.2004.1512"", ""10.1080/02699930441000238"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0231924"", ""10.1177/0956797619831964"", ""10.1017/S0007123402000121"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2020.01.009"", ""10.1177/0956797612452572"", ""10.1098/rspb.2010.1217"", ""10.1086/227049"", ""10.1017/9781108613880"", ""10.1073/pnas.1320040111"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9614-y"", ""10.1037/a0019086"", ""10.3390/ijerph17062032"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.2.294"", ""10.1101/2020.04.03.20052936"", ""10.1177/1754073912468165"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3582550"", ""10.1111/pops.12173"", ""10.1207/s15327957pspr1004_4"", ""10.1177/1754073908097189"", ""10.1002/ejsp.700"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610202"", ""10.1177/0162243915596231"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.1999.tb00047.x"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00062"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00764.x"", ""10.1037/a0029393"", ""10.1177/1948550617732610"", ""10.1080/23299460.2020.1738024"", ""10.1111/phc3.12167"", ""10.1108/IJTC-03-2018-0024"", ""10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00007.x"", ""10.1177/2056305117744392"", ""10.1177/2056305119897319"", ""10.1177/1461444817707349"", ""10.1177/2329488419882755""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The study was conducted taking measurements of deformation features such as fractures and deformation bands on multiple 1D scanlines along fault walls. The resulting datasets are used to plot the frequency distribution of deformation features and to constrain the geometrical width of the damage zone for the studied faults. The damage-zone width of a single fault is constrained by identifying the changes in the slope of cumulative plots made on the frequency data. The cumulative plot further shows high deformation frequency by a steep slope (inner damage zone) and less deformation as a gentle slope (outer damage zone). Statistical distributions of displacement and damage-zone width and their relationship are improved, and show two-slope power-law distributions with a break point at c. 100 m displacement. Bleached sandstones in the studied siliciclastic rocks of Utah are associated with a higher frequency of deformation bands and a wider damage zone compared to the unbleached zone of similar lithology. Fault damage zones in the carbonate rocks of Majella are often host to open fractures (karst), demonstrating that they can also be conductive to fluid flow.","[{""name"": ""A.

10.1007/s10551-022-05056-7,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Artificial Intelligence and Declined Guilt: Retailing Morality Comparison Between Human and AI,"AbstractSeveral technological developments, such as self-service technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), are disrupting the retailing industry by changing consumption and purchase habits and the overall retail experience. Although AI represents extraordinary opportunities for businesses, companies must avoid the dangers and risks associated with the adoption of such systems. Integrating perspectives from emerging research on AI, morality of machines, and norm activation, we examine how individuals morally behave toward AI agents and self-service machines. Across three studies, we demonstrate that consumers’ moral concerns and behaviors differ when interacting with technologies versus humans. We show that moral intention (intention to report an error) is less likely to emerge for AI checkout and self-checkout machines compared with human checkout. In addition, moral intention decreases as people consider the machine less humanlike. We further document that the decline in morality is caused by less guilt displayed toward new technologies. The non-human nature of the interaction evokes a decreased feeling of guilt and ultimately reduces moral behavior. These findings offer insights into how technological developments influence consumer behaviors and provide guidance for businesses and retailers in understanding moral intentions related to the different types of interactions in a shopping environment.","[{""name"": ""Marilyn Giroux"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jungkeun Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jacob C.

One such emergent technology is the digital twin which we define here as a living replica of a physical system (human or non-human). A digital twin combines various emerging technologies such as AI, Internet of Things, big data and robotics, each component bringing its own socio-ethical issues to the resulting artefacts. The question thus arises which of these socio-ethical themes surface in the process and how they are perceived by stakeholders in the field. In this report we present the results of a qualitative study into the socio-ethical benefits and socio-ethical risks of using digital twins in healthcare. Employing insights from ethics of technology and the Quadruple Helix theory of innovation, we conducted desk research of white literature and 23 interviews with representatives from the four helixes: industry, research, policy and civil society. The ethical scan revealed several important areas where the digital twin can produce socio-ethical value (e.g., prevention and treatment of disease, cost reduction, patient autonomy and freedom, equal treatment) but also several important areas of socio-ethical risks (e.g., privacy and property of data, disruption of existing societal structures, inequality and injustice). We conclude with a reflection on the employed analytical tool and suggestions for further research.","[{""name"": ""Eugen Octav Popa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mireille van Hilten"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elsje Oosterkamp"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marc-Jeroen Bogaardt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-27844-1_7"", ""10.1186/s13073-019-0701-3"", ""10.1007/s11569-012-0141-7"", ""10.1080/23299460.2020.1771144"", ""10.3389/fgene.2018.00031"", ""10.1504/IJTM.2009.023374"", ""10.1016/J.ENG.2017.04.009"", ""10.1109/MMUL.2018.023121167"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7585.001.0001"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998358"", ""10.1007/s13132-018-0521-5"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-51667-1.50044-6"", ""10.1016/S0160-791X(01)00047-1"", ""10.1017/S0266462305050415"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-18732-3_6"", ""10.1007/s11098-007-9103-2"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474"", ""10.1080/15027570.2010.536401"", ""10.1063/1.5031520"", ""10.1007/s11569-011-0119-x"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1356-7"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1212328"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-5765-8_2"", ""10.1093/0198280084.001.0001"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55577-9"", ""10.1002/9781118551424.ch2"", ""10.1080/13698570701306906"", ""10.1148/radiology.190.2.8284422"", ""10.1057/9781137349088"", ""10.5040/9781350222458.ch-015"", ""10.1007/s11569-007-0005-8"", ""10.1007/s00170-017-0233-1"", ""10.1155/2011/154798"", ""10.1002/9781118551424.ch4"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.470"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2333.001.0001""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)]]"

Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour, among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning. Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification. This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts: Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.","[{""name"": ""Tarek R.

Using a sample of UK firms during the 2013–2017 period, our results suggest that female audit partners are more likely than male audit partners to disclose more KAMs with more details after controlling for both client and audit firm attributes. Furthermore, female audit partners are found to use a less optimistic tone and provide less readable audit reports, compared to their male counterparts, suggesting that behavioural variances between female and male audit partners may have significant implications on their writing style. Therefore, this study offers new insights on the role of audit partner gender in extended audit reporting. Our findings have important implications for audit firms, investors, policymakers and governments in relation to the development, implementation and enforcement of gender diversity.","[{""name"": ""Tarek Abdelfattah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Elmahgoub"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed A.

This article aims to clarify our current thinking about these phenomena so as to facilitate future theoretical and empirical work. Drawing on recent work in the sociology of culture, we distinguish between culturalized religion as a form of constituted culture, a form of pragmatic culture, and a form of identity; and theorize three principal types of relations connecting each of these modalities: reinforcing relationships, resource relationships, and destabilizing relationships. In so doing, we develop an inclusive and dynamic approach to studying culturalized religion that clears the ground for further research into its diverse modalities and manifestations, as well as their points of intersection and interaction.","[{""name"": ""Avi Astor"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona""]}, {""name"": ""Damon Mayrl"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology Colby College""]}]","[""10.1515/9780804783095"", ""10.1111/jssr.12321"", ""10.1016/j.religion.2010.07.002"", ""10.1111/1468-5906.00183"", ""10.1017/S0748081400000242"", ""10.1515/9781614516477"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-17273-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812507"", ""10.1057/s41290-017-0042-x"", ""10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00486.x"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1023/A:1007068714468"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199654123.001.0001"", ""10.1163/9789004380073_006"", ""10.2307/j.ctvxhrhx3"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226190204.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57894-1"", ""10.1080/01596306.2015.1013247"", ""10.1057/9780230374249"", ""10.1353/wp.1997.0009"", ""10.1002/9781394260249"", ""10.2307/1387339"", ""10.1177/003776800047001013"", ""10.1080/01419870802298454"", ""10.1177/001139218102900203"", ""10.1080/03906701.2011.544199"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071811-145424"", ""10.1525/california/9780520280465.001.0001"", ""10.1080/01419870.1994.9993841"", ""10.1515/9781400827213"", ""10.14220/jrat.2016.2.1.37"", ""10.1177/019685998601000204"", ""10.1093/socrel/67.4.365"", ""10.1215/9780822388890"", ""10.1017/S0003975613000040"", ""10.1177/0037768618767962"", ""10.1017/S0010417518000543"", ""10.1017/S0003975605000044"", ""10.1093/socrel/srv026"", ""10.1017/9781108278195"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815096"", ""10.1177/0037768616654236"", ""10.1163/9789004380073_003"", ""10.1177/0003122416675175"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316217368"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195172621.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791017"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043123"", ""10.2307/1958356"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226749198.001.0001"", ""10.1525/california/9780520230002.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jssr.12597"", ""10.18261/ISSN1890-7008-2011-01-05"", ""10.1353/sor.2009.0002"", ""10.1515/9781400830978"", ""10.2307/j.ctvxrpz54"", ""10.1093/esr/jcn044"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190057886.001.0001"", ""10.2307/3711806"", ""10.1353/sof.0.0038"", ""10.1093/sf/sow065"", ""10.1017/S0003975615000120"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2012.01666.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226391717.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Organisations globally have affirmed the commitment of fair global access, but the means by which a successful vaccine can be mass produced and equitably distributed remains notably unanswered. Barriers for low-income countries include the inability to afford vaccines as well as inadequate resources to vaccinate, barriers that are exacerbated during a pandemic. Fair distribution of a pandemic vaccine is unlikely without a solid ethical framework for allocation. This piece analyses four allocation paradigms: ability to develop or purchase; reciprocity; ability to implement; and distributive justice, and synthesises their ethical considerations to develop an allocation model to fit the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Yangzi Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Sanjana Salwi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Brian C Drolet"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA""]}]","[""10.1056/NEJMp2005630"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.6641"", ""10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.026"", ""10.1186/s12913-017-2626-0"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.08.019"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000247"", ""10.3201/eid1401.070700"", ""10.1111/bioe.12039"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60137-9"", ""10.1378/chest.14-0742"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0778"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.5046""]","['Health Professions', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine']","['Modeling and Simulation', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

In this article, we critically assess evidence about putative effects of DBS on PIAAAS. We conducted a literature review of more than 1535 articles to investigate the prevalence of scientific evidence regarding these potential DBS-induced changes. While we observed an increase in the number of publications in theoretical neuroethics that mention putative DBS-induced changes to patients’ postoperative PIAAAS, we found a critical lack of primary empirical studies corroborating these claims. Our findings strongly suggest that the theoretical neuroethics debate on putative effects of DBS relies on very limited empirical evidence and is, instead, reliant on unsubstantiated speculative assumptions probablyin lieuof robust evidence. As such, this may reflect the likelihood of a speculative neuroethics bubble that may need to be deflated. Nevertheless, despite the low number of first-hand primary studies and large number of marginal and single case reports, potential postoperative DBS changes experienced by patients remain a critical ethical concern. We recommend further empirical research in order to enhance theoretical neuroethics work in the area.

10.1007/s10551-020-04428-1,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,How Pro-social Framing Affects the Success of Crowdfunding Projects: The Role of Emphasis and Information Crowdedness,"AbstractCrowdfunding is regarded a financing mechanism that could improve the funding opportunities of businesses with a pro-social orientation. Indeed, it is assumed that on digital platforms, citizens are inclined to provide more support to projects with a social benefit than to those without such an orientation, with significant ethical implications for the common good. Yet, extant empirical evidence regarding such a claim is still inconclusive. To advance this discussion, the present paper analyzes the conditions that influence crowd support for projects displaying a pro-social orientation on a reward-based crowdfunding platform. To build our hypotheses, we adopt the lens of framing theory, and we relate it to the digital context. Beginning from the premise that, on crowdfunding platforms, information about projects has ahierarchical structure,we argue that a project’s success crucially depends on how much its proponent emphasizes the pro-social cues within this structure. Moreover, we propose that because pro-social cues demarcate a project over others, the effectiveness of pro-social framing is enhanced when the number of projects on the platform, i.e., itscrowdedness, increases. Logit estimates on 8631 Kickstarter projects indicate that pro-social framing is positively associated with success as we expected, yet only when it is moderately emphasized. Further, we find that crowdedness on the platform positively moderates the effect of pro-social orientation on success.","[{""name"": ""Daniela Defazio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chiara Franzoni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cristina Rossi-Lamastra"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/etap.12108"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.09.002"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3652-x"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2008.03.005"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2006.00107.x"", ""10.5465/amj.2013.0903"", ""10.2307/223459"", ""10.1016/S0361-3682(01)00049-6"", ""10.1086/209535"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9730-3"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00451.x"", ""10.2307/20159339"", ""10.1016/J.JCPS.2014.05.003"", ""10.1525/9780520352018"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198816225.003.0005"", ""10.1111/joms.12201"", ""10.1111/etap.12139"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00331.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.103054"", ""10.1111/etap.12118"", ""10.1080/19416520.2014.875669"", ""10.1023/A:1010793013027"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2013.08.004"", ""10.1017/s0022381609990521"", ""10.1002/cb.332"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2873-0"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.0211"", ""10.1177/000312240507000103"", ""10.1177/0001839215571125"", ""10.2307/2667123"", ""10.1227/01.NEU.0000349921.14519.2A"", ""10.4324/9781410605689"", ""10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2015.05.046"", ""10.1002/smj.2268"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2257-x"", ""10.1177/1059601116651181"", ""10.1509/jmkr.37.4.427.18796"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00738.x"", ""10.1108/1066240410542670"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2016.10.004"", ""10.2307/2669268"", ""10.1006/obhd.1998.2804"", ""10.1037/apl0000217"", ""10.5465/ambpp.2015.12914abstract"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00499.x"", ""10.1086/380283"", ""10.2307/25075331"", ""10.1177/0149206316657594"", ""10.1016/0020-7373(92)90062-p"", ""10.2307/3151336"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2013.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.12.004"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9621-z"", ""10.1287/orsc.1100.0602"", ""10.1509/jm.13.0387"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2013.08.001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173933"", ""10.2307/41165964"", ""10.5465/amj.2012.0686"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1707-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0124-y"", ""10.1509/jmkr.38.2.225.18838"", ""10.1177/107769900408100211"", ""10.1002/smj.2499"", ""10.1177/0149206309342746"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-268330-5.50010-X"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.01.002"", ""10.1002/sej.34"", ""10.1287/orsc.1050.0133"", ""10.1111/1467-9817.00140"", ""10.1207/S15327590IJHC1301_5""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management Information Systems', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1186/s12910-021-00585-8,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Digital tools in the informed consent process: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Providing understandable information to patients is necessary to achieve the aims of the Informed Consent process: respecting and promoting patients’ autonomy and protecting patients from harm. In recent decades, new, primarily digital technologies have been used to apply and test innovative formats of Informed Consent. We conducted a systematic review to explore the impact of using digital tools for Informed Consent in both clinical research and in clinical practice. Understanding, satisfaction and participation were compared for digital tools versus the non-digital Informed Consent process. Methods We searched for studies on available electronic databases, including Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane. Studies were identified using specific Mesh-terms/keywords. We included studies, published from January 2012 to October 2020, that focused on the use of digital Informed Consent tools for clinical research, or clinical procedures. Digital interventions were defined as interventions that used multimedia or audio–video to provide information to patients. We classified the interventions into 3 different categories: video only, non-interactive multimedia, and interactive multimedia. Results Our search yielded 19,579 publications. After title and abstract screening 100 studies were retained for full-text analysis, of which 73 publications were included. Studies examined interactive multimedia (29/73), non-interactive multimedia (13/73), and videos (31/73), and most (34/38) studies were conducted on adults. Innovations in consent were tested for clinical/surgical procedures (26/38) and clinical research (12/38). For research IC, 21 outcomes were explored, with a positive effect on at least one of the studied outcomes being observed in 8/12 studies. For clinical/surgical procedures 49 outcomes were explored, and 21/26 studies reported a positive effect on at least one of the studied outcomes. Conclusions Digital technologies for informed consent were not found to negatively affect any of the outcomes, and overall, multimedia tools seem desirable. Multimedia tools indicated a higher impact than videos only. Presence of a researcher may potentially enhance efficacy of different outcomes in research IC processes. Studies were heterogeneous in design, making evaluation of impact challenging. Robust study design including standardization is needed to conclusively assess impact.","[{""name"": ""Francesco Gesualdo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Margherita Daverio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Palazzani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dimitris Dimitriou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Javier Diez-Domingo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jaime Fons-Martinez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sally Jackson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pascal Vignally"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caterina Rizzo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alberto Eugenio Tozzi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2105/AJPH.2017.304103"", ""10.2307/3564231"", ""10.1136/bmj.j463"", ""10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70128-1"", ""10.1515/9783110182521.391"", ""10.1515/9783110208856.227"", ""10.2471/BLT.14.141390"", ""10.1016/j.amjsurg.2009.02.010"", ""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123134"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16942-0"", ""10.1177/014107680509800806"", ""10.1097/MLR.0b013e318241e8e1"", ""10.1136/medethics-2011-100178"", ""10.7861/clinmedicine.4-3-269"", ""10.1001/journalofethics.2016.18.9.peer2-1609"", ""10.1056/NEJMsa021212"", ""10.1001/jama.292.13.1593"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.158.11.1911"", ""10.1016/S0738-3991(03)00162-9"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-14-28"", ""10.1136/bmj.b2700"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.9989"", ""10.1186/s12911-017-0423-7"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD003717.pub2"", ""10.2471/BLT.14.146159"", ""10.1186/s12910-017-0232-7"", ""10.1016/j.cct.2013.05.011"", ""10.2196/jmir.6710"", ""10.1200/JCO.2011.39.5186"", ""10.1002/cncr.26438"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2020-036977"", ""10.3389/fped.2020.520803"", ""10.1093/heapol/czw056"", ""10.1136/jamia.2000.0070177"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2354.1999.00123.x"", ""10.1177/1461444818797082""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Gasol offers a wide variety of cost models that allow inferring the gas consumption associated to selected types of EVM instructions and/or inferring the number of times that such types of bytecode instructions are executed. Among others, we have cost models to measure only storage opcodes, to measure a selected family of gas-consumption opcodes following the Ethereum’s classification, to estimate the cost of a selected program line, etc. After choosing the desired cost model and the function of interest, Gasol returns to the user an upper bound of the cost for this function. As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions that access the storage, Gasol uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the selected function. Our tool can be used within an Eclipse plugin for which displays the gas and instructions bounds and, when applicable, the gas-optimized function.","[{""name"": ""Elvira Albert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesús Correas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Gordillo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guillermo Román-Díez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Rubio"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_46"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69166-2_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_30"", ""10.1145/3167084"", ""10.1145/2993600.2993611"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.1109/SANER.2017.7884650"", ""10.1145/3276486"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89722-6_10"", ""10.1145/3158136"", ""10.14722/ndss.2018.23082"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330560"", ""10.1145/2976749.2978309"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03427-6_33"", ""10.1145/3274694.3274743"", ""10.1145/3360611"", ""10.1145/3243734.3243780""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

We account for relevant dissimilarities, indicating where conceptual boundaries may be drawn. Guided by a “reasoning by analogy” approach, the article addresses the structural analogy and machinewashing idiosyncrasies leading to a novel and theoretically informed model of machinewashing. Consequently, machinewashing is defined as a strategy that organizations adopt to engage in misleading behavior (communication and/or action) about ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI)/algorithmic systems. Machinewashing involves misleading information about ethical AI communicated or omitted via words, visuals, or the underlying algorithm of AI itself. Furthermore, and going beyond greenwashing, machinewashing may be used for symbolic actions such as (covert) lobbying and prevention of stricter regulation. By outlining diverse theoretical foundations of the established greenwashing domain and their relation to specific research questions, the article proposes a machinewashing model and a set of theory-related research questions on the macro, meso, and micro-level for future machinewashing research. We conclude by stressing limitations and by outlining practical implications for organizations and policymakers.","[{""name"": ""Peter Seele"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mario D.

Originally proposed to account for perception, learning, and action, the free-energy principle has been applied to the evolution, development, morphology, anatomy and function of the brain, and has been called apostulate, anunfalsifiable principle, anatural law, and animperative. While it might afford a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between environment, life, and mind, its epistemic status is unclear. Also unclear is how the free-energy principle relates to prominent theoretical approaches to life science phenomena, such as organicism and mechanism. This paper clarifies both issues, and identifies limits and prospects for the free-energy principle as a first principle in the life sciences.","[{""name"": ""Matteo Colombo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cory Wright"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.conb.2017.08.010"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1288-5"", ""10.1142/S0218339009002715"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.038"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8328.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1239-1"", ""10.1016/j.jmp.2017.09.004"", ""10.1023/A:1005272027245"", ""10.1093/bjps/axw034"", ""10.1007/BF00127087"", ""10.1023/A:1009662321079"", ""10.1093/bjps/axr043"", ""10.1016/j.bandc.2016.02.003"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511498442"", ""10.1162/neco.1995.7.5.889"", ""10.1111/cogs.12444"", ""10.1038/nrn2787-c1"", ""10.1016/j.neunet.2003.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2009.04.005"", ""10.1038/nrn2787"", ""10.1038/nrn2787-c2"", ""10.3390/e14112100"", ""10.1098/rsif.2013.0475"", ""10.1016/j.jphysparis.2006.10.001"", ""10.1007/s11229-007-9237-y"", ""10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999<::AID-DVDY1036>3.0.CO;2-A"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198779711.001.0001"", ""10.4249/scholarpedia.8291"", ""10.1073/pnas.93.25.14256"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-01306-0_32"", ""10.1111/nous.12062"", ""10.2307/2185246"", ""10.1086/661755"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139225700.011"", ""10.3390/e19040169"", ""10.1098/rsif.2017.0792"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1250-6"", ""10.1016/j.tins.2004.10.007"", ""10.1145/2330784.2330946"", ""10.3389/fncom.2016.00094"", ""10.1016/S0020-7373(75)80015-0"", ""10.1023/A:1012990030867"", ""10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9837-2"", ""10.1002/cplx.20191"", ""10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.07.005"", ""10.1038/srep11548"", ""10.1007/s11229-011-9898-4"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226507194.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.plrev.2017.09.001"", ""10.1038/4580"", ""10.1111/nous.12042"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139644129"", ""10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.07.006"", ""10.1016/S1355-2198(01)00016-8"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0532-0"", ""10.1016/0303-2647(74)90031-8""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Plant Science', 'Astronomy and Astrophysics', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s11097-019-09654-1,PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES,0101 Philosophy,Enactive becoming,"AbstractThe enactive approach provides a perspective on human bodies in their organic, sensorimotor, social, and linguistic dimensions, but many fundamental issues still remain unaddressed. A crucial desideratum for a theory of human bodies is that it be able to account for concrete human becoming. In this article I show that enactive theory possesses resources to achieve this goal. Being an existential structure, human becoming is best approached by a series of progressive formal indications. I discuss three standpoints on human becoming as open, indeterminate, and therefore historical using the voices of Pico della Mirandola, Gordon W. Allport, and Paulo Freire. Drawing on Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of individuation we move from an existential to an ontological register in looking at modes of embodied becoming. His scheme of interpretation of the relation between modes of individuation allows us to understand human becoming in terms of a tendency to neotenization. I compare this ontology with an enactive theoretical account of the dimensions of embodiment, finding several compatibilities and complementarities. Various forms of bodily unfinishedness in enaction fit the Simondonian ontology and the existential analysis, where transindividuality corresponds to participatory sense-making and Freire’s joint becoming of individuals and communities correlates with the open tensions in linguistic bodies between incorporation and incarnation of linguistic acts. I test some of this ideas by considering the plausibility of artificial bodies and personal becoming from an enactive perspective, using the case of replicants in the filmBlade Runner. The conclusion is that any kind of personhood, replicants included, requires living through an actual history of concrete becoming.","[{""name"": ""Ezequiel A.

10.1111/phpr.12555,PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH,0101 Philosophy,Social Structures and the Ontology of Social Groups,"Social groups—like teams, committees, gender groups, and racial groups—play a central role in our lives and in philosophical inquiry. Here I develop and motivate a structuralist ontology of social groups centered on social structures (i.e., networks of relations that are constitutively dependent on social factors). The view delivers a picture that encompasses a diverse range of social groups, while maintaining important metaphysical and normative distinctions between groups of different kinds. It also meets the constraint that not every arbitrary collection of people is a social group. In addition, the framework provides resources for developing a broader structuralist view in social ontology.","[{""name"": ""Katherine Ritchie"", ""affiliation"": [""CUNY Graduate Center and City College of New York""]}]","[""10.1093/0195137345.001.0001"", ""10.1086/448319"", ""10.1111/phc3.12265"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199227013.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00385837"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1086/421418"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.2007.00346.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199381104.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1475-4975.00004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.2008.00370.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195154061.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16161-4"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16638-1"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226308760.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.00071"", ""10.1111/1468-0068.00430"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0434-5"", ""10.1080/00455091.2015.1019176"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-3783-1_11"", ""10.1111/j.1533-6077.2007.00123.x"", ""10.1111/j.0066-7373.2006.00128.x"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00201"", ""10.7591/9781501725623"", ""10.1086/683535"", ""10.1111/phpr.12020"", ""10.4135/9781452276052.n192"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539895.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276196.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672707.003.0005"", ""10.1111/j.0029-4624.2004.00487.x"", ""10.1111/phc3.12381"", ""10.1023/A:1004532016219"", ""10.2307/302821"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.2007.00332.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.1989.tb00144.x"", ""10.1111/phc3.12213"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-0030-5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199546046.003.0012"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199697908.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-3783-1_3"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7snkj.6"", ""10.1111/1536-7150.t01-1-00005"", ""10.1080/02698595.2013.783979""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1186/s41073-020-00101-3,RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND PEER REVIEW,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0101 Philosophy,Comparing quality of reporting between preprints and peer-reviewed articles in the biomedical literature,"Abstract Background Preprint usage is growing rapidly in the life sciences; however, questions remain on the relative quality of preprints when compared to published articles. An objective dimension of quality that is readily measurable is completeness of reporting, as transparency can improve the reader’s ability to independently interpret data and reproduce findings. Methods In this observational study, we initially compared independent samples of articles published in bioRxiv and in PubMed-indexed journals in 2016 using a quality of reporting questionnaire. After that, we performed paired comparisons between preprints from bioRxiv to their own peer-reviewed versions in journals. Results Peer-reviewed articles had, on average, higher quality of reporting than preprints, although the difference was small, with absolute differences of 5.0% [95% CI 1.4, 8.6] and 4.7% [95% CI 2.4, 7.0] of reported items in the independent samples and paired sample comparison, respectively. There were larger differences favoring peer-reviewed articles in subjective ratings of how clearly titles and abstracts presented the main findings and how easy it was to locate relevant reporting information. Changes in reporting from preprints to peer-reviewed versions did not correlate with the impact factor of the publication venue or with the time lag from bioRxiv to journal publication. Conclusions Our results suggest that, on average, publication in a peer-reviewed journal is associated with improvement in quality of reporting. They also show that quality of reporting in preprints in the life sciences is within a similar range as that of peer-reviewed articles, albeit slightly lower on average, supporting the idea that preprints should be considered valid scientific contributions.","[{""name"": ""Clarissa F.

Design A screening tool was developed using the four-stage approach proposed by Moher et al. This included defining the scope, reviewing the evidence base, suggesting a list of items from piloting, and holding a consensus meeting. The initial checklist was set-up by a core group who had been involved in the assessment of problematic RCTs for several years. We piloted this in a consensus panel of several stakeholders, including health professionals, reviewers, journal editors, policymakers, researchers, and evidence-synthesis specialists. Each member was asked to score three articles with the checklist and the results were then discussed in consensus meetings. Outcome The Trustworthiness in RAndomised Clinical Trials (TRACT) checklist includes 19 items organised into seven domains that are applicable to every RCT: 1) Governance, 2) Author Group, 3) Plausibility of Intervention Usage, 4) Timeframe, 5) Drop-out Rates, 6) Baseline Characteristics, and 7) Outcomes. Each item can be answered as either no concerns, some concerns/no information, or major concerns. If a study is assessed and found to have a majority of items rated at a major concern level, then editors, reviewers or evidence synthesizers should consider a more thorough investigation, including assessment of original individual participant data. Conclusions The TRACT checklist is the first checklist developed specifically to detect trustworthiness issues in RCTs. It might help editors, publishers and researchers to screen for such issues in submitted or published RCTs in a transparent and replicable manner.","[{""name"": ""Ben W.

An ethical reflection on the trend of automated consultations in health care,"AbstractMany experts have emphasised that chatbots are not sufficiently mature to be able to technically diagnose patient conditions or replace the judgements of health professionals. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has significantly increased the utilisation of health-oriented chatbots, for instance, as a conversational interface to answer questions, recommend care options, check symptoms and complete tasks such as booking appointments. In this paper, we take a proactive approach and consider how the emergence of task-oriented chatbots as partially automated consulting systems can influence clinical practices and expert–client relationships. We suggest the need for new approaches in professional ethics as the large-scale deployment of artificial intelligence may revolutionise professional decision-making and client–expert interaction in healthcare organisations. We argue that the implementation of chatbots amplifies the project of rationality and automation in clinical practice and alters traditional decision-making practices based on epistemic probability and prudence. This article contributes to the discussion on the ethical challenges posed by chatbots from the perspective of healthcare professional ethics.","[{""name"": ""Jaana Parviainen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juho Rantala"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2196/18301"", ""10.4159/DLCL.aristotle-nicomachean_ethics.1926"", ""10.1111/jan.14417"", ""10.4103/0972-6748.57864"", ""10.1186/s40635-019-0286-6"", ""10.1007/s11019-018-9846-x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226113623.001.0001"", ""10.1186/s12910-021-00581-y"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocaa167"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226046778.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262035927.001.0001"", ""10.1145/2933566.2933573"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04299-8"", ""10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.0-172"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7725.003.0004"", ""10.4159/9780674053885"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878254"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocaa130"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511997891"", ""10.1093/elt/ccaa035"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.2724"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3486518"", ""10.1093/iwc/iwz022"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487118"", ""10.2196/12887"", ""10.4159/9780674250062"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195082890.001.0001"", ""10.2196/16222"", ""10.1111/1467-9566.00339"", ""10.1001/amajethics.2019.121"", ""10.1631/FITEE.1700826"", ""10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.08.005"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_625890"", ""10.1007/s11023-019-09513-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68059-0_2""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'General Health Professions', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1186/s12910-020-0457-8,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Structural racism in precision medicine: leaving no one behind,"Abstract Background Precision medicine (PM) is an emerging approach to individualized care. It aims to help physicians better comprehend and predict the needs of their patients while effectively adopting in a timely manner the most suitable treatment by promoting the sharing of health data and the implementation of learning healthcare systems. Alongside its promises, PM also entails the risk of exacerbating healthcare inequalities, in particular between ethnoracial groups. One often-neglected underlying reason why this might happen is the impact of structural racism on PM initiatives. Raising awareness as to how structural racism can influence PM initiatives is paramount to avoid that PM ends up reproducing the pre-existing health inequalities between different ethnoracial groups and contributing to the loss of trust in healthcare by minority groups. Main body We analyse three nodes of a process flow where structural racism can affect PM’s implementation. These are: (i) the collection of biased health data during the initial encounter of minority groups with the healthcare system and researchers, (ii) the integration of biased health data for minority groups in PM initiatives and (iii) the influence of structural racism on the deliverables of PM initiatives for minority groups. We underscore that underappreciation of structural racism by stakeholders involved in the PM ecosystem can be at odds with the ambition of ensuring social and racial justice. Potential specific actions related to the analysed nodes are then formulated to help ensure that PM truly adheres to the goal of leaving no one behind, as endorsed by member states of the United Nations for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Conclusion Structural racism has been entrenched in our societies for centuries and it would be naïve to believe that its impacts will not spill over in the era of PM. PM initiatives need to pay special attention to the discriminatory and harmful impacts that structural racism could have on minority groups involved in their respective projects. It is only by acknowledging and discussing the existence of implicit racial biases and trust issues in healthcare and research domains that proper interventions to remedy them can be implemented.","[{""name"": ""Lester Darryl Geneviève"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Martani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Shaw"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernice Simone Elger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tenzin Wangmo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1056/NEJMp1500523"", ""10.1038/nrg.2016.86"", ""10.1016/j.nbt.2012.03.004"", ""10.1186/s12916-018-1122-7"", ""10.1038/nature15816"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.12137"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1624"", ""10.1093/eurpub/ckm039"", ""10.1038/gim.2016.92"", ""10.2105/AJPH.87.11.1773"", ""10.1038/s41436-018-0032-6"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.0030019"", ""10.1186/s40246-014-0023-x"", ""10.1038/538161a"", ""10.1093/ije/dyl056"", ""10.1053/j.ajkd.2015.09.023"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-13-402"", ""10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.314970"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1506241"", ""10.1080/15265161.2018.1431322"", ""10.1007/s10865-008-9185-0"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.12.037"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30569-X"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2018.304314"", ""10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040617-014158"", ""10.1097/01.COT.0000285929.98853.6b"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.12.027"", ""10.1093/ser/mwu011"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.3867"", ""10.1001/jama.2015.17949"", ""10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.4503"", ""10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.1790"", ""10.1186/s12889-017-4375-8"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2015.302903"", ""10.1017/S1742058X11000191"", ""10.1073/pnas.1516047113"", ""10.1542/peds.2012-2500"", ""10.1097/MLR.0000000000000533"", ""10.1177/2372732214548430"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2009.11.004"", ""10.1001/jama.2015.9260"", ""10.1001/jama.286.2.180"", ""10.1016/S0195-668X(03)00081-2"", ""10.1001/jama.291.21.2591"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0300-7"", ""10.1007/s10618-017-0506-1"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-05469-3"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287593"", ""10.1038/d41586-019-02872-2"", ""10.1016/S0033-3549(04)50068-7"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2018.10.010"", ""10.1177/1077558711420263"", ""10.1182/blood-2018-99-115609"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60327-5"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61029-X"", ""10.1089/omi.2017.0156"", ""10.1056/NEJMsr1809937"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-06950-9"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1001779"", ""10.1093/aje/kwx246"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33067-8"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1814269"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.03.036"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2015.302631"", ""10.1080/09581596.2010.493173"", ""10.15252/embr.201846579"", ""10.1147/JRD.2019.2942287"", ""10.1111/cge.12268"", ""10.2147/PGPM.S141546""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Medicine']","['Genetics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Cancer Research']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0836 生物工程', 0.6862), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.684)]]"
10.3390/rel11120646,RELIGIONS,0101 Philosophy,The COVID-19 Pandemic's Impact on Religiosity in Poland,"Background: Poland is one of Europe’s most religious societies. Methods: The article presents the results of an online survey conducted in April 2020 during the period of the Polish government’s strictest restrictions to date in response to the pandemic. A quota sample of 1001 adult Poles was surveyed. Results: Around one-fifth (21.3%) of people declared that they spent more time praying and engaging in other religious practices than previously. As many as 61.3% of people who previously practiced religion several times a week spent more time on these practices, and, more interestingly, religious observance also increased among people who had previously practiced only once every few years (15.9%) and those who had not previously practiced at all (7.4%). People who previously practiced sporadically or not at all, but who began to pray more during the pandemic, are found to be distinguished from others by a greater fear of losing their job. Spending more time on religious observance is shown to be related to, e.g., disregard for some government restrictions, possession of less knowledge about COVID-19, and a greater tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. Conclusions: Overall, religious practices increased during the Polish spring lockdown. Although these increases are unlikely to be long-lasting, changes in religiosity caused by COVID-19 appear to be a real phenomenon. As the pandemic continues, more research on different aspects of this phenomenon is needed.","[{""name"": ""Rafał Boguszewski"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Sociological Sciences and Pedagogy, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-787 Warsaw, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Marta Makowska"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Sociological Sciences and Pedagogy, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-787 Warsaw, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Marta Bożewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Political Science and International Studies, Warsaw University, 00-927 Warsaw, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Monika Podkowińska"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Sociological Sciences and Pedagogy, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 02-787 Warsaw, Poland""]}]","[""10.1093/ej/uez008"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2021.10.014"", ""10.1093/aje/kwy142"", ""10.1093/owc/9780199540129.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11205-007-9187-2"", ""10.3758/BF03193146"", ""10.1515/jcim-2017-0172"", ""10.1002/jclp.20049"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01058-9"", ""10.1093/geront/28.1.18"", ""10.1177/0003122410386686"", ""10.1093/geront/36.4.454"", ""10.1080/14616696.2020.1836383"", ""10.21203/rs.3.rs-31214/v1"", ""10.1080/14616696.2020.1821075"", ""10.1007/s10943-018-0559-5"", ""10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.007"", ""10.1093/socrel/srw055"", ""10.1080/2153599X.2020.1749339"", ""10.2307/3511225""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Towards an ethics of digital twins in medicine,"Simulations are used in very different contexts and for very different purposes. An emerging development is the possibility of using simulations to obtain a more or less representative reproduction of organs or even entire persons. Such simulations are framed and discussed using the term ‘digital twin’. This paper unpacks and scrutinises the current use of such digital twins in medicine and the ideas embedded in this practice. First, the paper maps the different types of digital twins. A special focus is put on the concrete challenges inherent in the interactions between persons and their digital twin. Second, the paper addresses the questions of how far a digital twin can represent a person and what the consequences of this may be. Against the background of these two analytical steps, the paper defines first conditions for digital twins to take on an ethically justifiable form of representation.","[{""name"": ""Matthias Braun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/s13073-019-0701-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02203-7_2"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.178"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01614-2_19"", ""10.5771/9781786612281"", ""10.1007/s11948-020-00228-y"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12549.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11444.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00119-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7_4"", ""10.1007/s11019-016-9683-8"", ""10.1016/j.eng.2019.01.014"", ""10.3389/fgene.2018.00031"", ""10.1007/s11831-018-9301-4"", ""10.1177/1749975520939779"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1832615"", ""10.1215/9780822388128-005"", ""10.3998/mpub.9904"", ""10.4324/9780203994610"", ""10.31228/osf.io/mu2kf"", ""10.1007/s10676-020-09574-8""]","['Engineering', 'Medicine']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Health Informatics']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)]]"

This interpretation is intended as a corrective for the philosophical debate over internalist and externalist interpretations of cognitive boundaries; we stake out a compromise position. We first survey key principles of new radical (extended, enactive, embodied) views of cognition. We then describe an internalist interpretation premised on the Markov blanket formalism. Having reviewed these accounts, we develop our positive multiscale account. We argue that the statistical seclusion of internal from external states of the system—entailed by the existence of a Markov boundary—can coexist happily with the multiscale integration of the system through its dynamics. Our approach does not privilege any given boundary (whether it be that of the brain, body, or world), nor does it argue that all boundaries are equally prescient. We argue that the relevant boundaries of cognition depend on the level being characterised and the explanatory interests that guide investigation. We approach the issue of how and where to draw the boundaries of cognitive systems through a multiscale ontology of cognitive systems, which offers a multidisciplinary research heuristic for cognitive science.","[{""name"": ""Maxwell J.

The question is relevant because, initially, vaccine availability will likely be limited. After healthcare and some other essential workers, it might seem the most obvious candidates are the elderly and other groups that are more vulnerable to the virus. However, we argue that this is not necessarily the case. Protecting the most vulnerable might require prioritizing vaccinating children in order to maximize the benefits of indirect immunity for the elderly and the other vulnerable groups. Whether this will be the best strategy from a public health perspective will depend on characteristics of the vaccine and of the virus, which are currently unknown. Here, we assess this possibility from an ethical point of view, by drawing comparisons and analogies with the case of the flu vaccination and with other examples of health policies and practices. We conclude that there are strong ethical reasons to vaccinate the young to protect the old, provided that the risks imposed on children are reasonable, even if that implies using children as a means to protect the elderly and the vulnerable.","[{""name"": ""Alberto Giubilini"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Julian Savulescu"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"", ""Melbourne Law School, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Dominic Wilkinson"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics and Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK""]}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

It is extremely important to bring together all the alternative frames of thinking—from the various communities of developers, researchers, business leaders, policymakers, and citizens—to properly start acknowledging AI. This article highlights the ‘fruitful collaboration’ that sociology and AI could develop in both social and technical terms. We discuss how biases and unfairness are among the major challenges to be addressed in such a sociotechnical perspective. First, as intelligent machines reveal their nature of ‘magnifying glasses’ in the automation of existing inequalities, we show how the AI technical community is calling for transparency and explainability, accountability and contestability. Not to be considered as panaceas, they all contribute to ensuring human control in novel practices that include requirement, design and development methodologies for a fairer AI. Second, we elaborate on the mounting attention for technological narratives as technology is recognized as a social practice within a specific institutional context. Not only do narratives reflect organizing visions for society, but they also are a tangible sign of the traditional lines of social, economic, and political inequalities. We conclude with a call for a diverse approach within the AI community and a richer knowledge about narratives as they help in better addressing future technical developments, public debate, and policy. AI practice is interdisciplinary by nature and it will benefit from a socio-technical perspective.","[{""name"": ""Laura Sartori"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andreas Theodorou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3351095.3372871"", ""10.1007/s00146-019-00918-7"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3569083"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2019/802"", ""10.1177/1461444816676645"", ""10.1515/9781400822300"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.20.080194.002203"", ""10.1016/j.inffus.2019.12.012"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615573"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11022.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10506-017-9214-9"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-7725-9_16"", ""10.1109/MC.2017.154"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2016.1154086"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.1126/science.aal4230"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0020-9"", ""10.1007/s11186-020-09411-3"", ""10.1086/226983"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11805.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30371-6"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262015554.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03637751.2017.1375130"", ""10.1525/9780520915008"", ""10.1007/s13347-020-00396-6"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019"", ""10.1145/3236009"", ""10.1145/3442188.3445866"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1477967"", ""10.3386/w25548"", ""10.2307/3105385"", ""10.1111/1540-4560.00248"", ""10.1518/hfes.46.1.50_30392"", ""10.1111/soc4.12851"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04144-6"", ""10.1038/s42256-021-00323-0"", ""10.1353/tech.2015.0023"", ""10.3389/frai.2021.737072"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2018.07.007"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-073117-041106"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2433.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1354856517715164"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1pwt9w5"", ""10.1126/science.aax2342"", ""10.1109/RCIS.2017.7956539"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1606266"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674736061"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019780"", ""10.1126/science.1170165"", ""10.1002/poi3.153"", ""10.1177/000271626234000103"", ""10.3389/frobt.2018.00015"", ""10.1177/2041905820911746"", ""10.2307/3341290"", ""10.1126/sciadv.abd4201"", ""10.1177/00027649921955335"", ""10.1126/science.aat5991"", ""10.30965/9783957437488_009"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0136-y"", ""10.1080/09540091.2017.1310182"", ""10.54675/RAPC9356"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-7762-0_20"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-14108-y"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aan6080"", ""10.1093/litthe/frl057"", ""10.1177/00027640121957286"", ""10.1086/229649"", ""10.1177/0038038585019004005"", ""10.1613/jair.1.11345""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

While a clause expresses that at least one literal must be true, a cardinality constraint expresses that at least n literals must be true and a pseudo-Boolean constraint states that a weighted sum of literals must be greater than a constant. These contraints have a high expressive power, have been intensively studied in 0/1 programming and are close enough to the satisfiability problem to benefit from the recents advances in this field. Besides, optimization problems are naturally expressed in the pseudo-Boolean context. This chapter presents the inference rules on pseudo-Boolean constraints and demonstrates their increased inference power in comparison with resolution. It also shows how the modern satisfiability algorithms can be extended to deal with pseudo-Boolean constraints.","[{""name"": ""Olivier Roussel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vasco Manquinho"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

The approach uses phenomenology’s concepts, namely existentials, rather than methods such as the epoché or reductions. We here introduce the approach to both philosophers and qualitative researchers, as we believe that these studies are best conducted through interdisciplinary collaboration. In section 1, we review the debate over phenomenology’s role in qualitative research and argue that qualitative theorists have not taken full advantage of what philosophical phenomenology has to offer, thus motivating the need for new approaches. In section 2, we introduce our alternative approach, which we call Phenomenologically Grounded Qualitative Research (PGQR). Drawing parallels with phenomenology’s applications in the cognitive sciences, we explain how phenomenological grounding can be used to conceptually front-load a qualitative study, establishing an explicit focus on one or more structures of human existence, or of our being in the world. In section 3, we illustrate this approach with an example of a qualitative study carried out by one of the authors: a study of the existential impact of early parental bereavement. In section 4, we clarify the kind of knowledge that phenomenologically grounded studies generate and how it may be integrated with existing approaches.","[{""name"": ""Allan Køster"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anthony Vincent Fernandez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596"", ""10.1163/156916203322847119"", ""10.1080/14780887.2015.1076917"", ""10.1007/s11019-008-9174-7"", ""10.1163/156916212X632943"", ""10.1037/hum0000144"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1106-0"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803157.013.105"", ""10.1007/s11097-017-9506-2"", ""10.1111/j.2041-6962.2012.00108.x"", ""10.2989/IPJP.2012.12.3.4.1112"", ""10.4324/9780203126752"", ""10.1163/156916211X599762"", ""10.1093/0199253048.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11097-015-9433-z"", ""10.1007/s11097-016-9485-8"", ""10.1007/s11017-017-9422-z"", ""10.7146/pl.v40i1.113238"", ""10.1017/9781108776660.011"", ""10.1080/13576275.2019.1632277"", ""10.1007/s11097-020-09657-3"", ""10.1176/ajp.101.2.141"", ""10.4324/9780203720714"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2019.02.002"", ""10.1353/ncr.2002.0052"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.04.256"", ""10.4324/9781315829753"", ""10.1007/s11097-006-9022-2"", ""10.1016/j.yebeh.2006.05.013"", ""10.1007/s11097-018-9597-4"", ""10.1093/med/9780199206469.001.0001"", ""10.1111/misp.12071"", ""10.1007/s11097-020-09666-2"", ""10.1007/s10746-015-9372-2"", ""10.1177/1049732315591146"", ""10.1177/1049732318799577"", ""10.4324/9780203815816"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803157.013.85"", ""10.1007/s11019-006-9012-8"", ""10.1080/17482620802646204"", ""10.1007/BF01322837"", ""10.4324/9781315422657"", ""10.1177/1049732317699570"", ""10.1177/1049732318795474"", ""10.1177/1049732319827293"", ""10.1007/BF02331805"", ""10.1007/s11007-019-09463-y"", ""10.4324/9781315441603"", ""10.1111/nup.12276"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2019.01.014""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/monist/onz037,MONIST,0101 Philosophy,Aesthetic Emotions Reconsidered,"AbstractWe define aesthetic emotions as emotions that underlie the evaluative assessment of artworks. They are separated from the wider class of art-elicited emotions. Aesthetic emotions historically have been characterized as calm, as lacking specific patterns of embodiment, and as being a sui generis kind of pleasure. We reject those views and argue that there is a plurality of aesthetic emotions contributing to praise. After presenting a general account of the nature of emotions, we analyze twelve positive aesthetic emotions in four different categories: emotions of pleasure, contemplation, amazement, and respect. The emotions that we identify in each category, including feelings of fluency, intrigue, wonder, and adoration, have been widely neglected both within aesthetics and in emotion research more broadly.","[{""name"": ""Joerg Fingerhut"", ""affiliation"": [""Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Jesse J Prinz"", ""affiliation"": [""The Graduate Center, City University of New York, United States""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9973.1970.tb00784.x"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.114.2.296"", ""10.1080/13506285.2017.1341441"", ""10.1016/bs.pbr.2018.03.004"", ""10.1017/S0031819199000674"", ""10.1093/mind/os-IX.34.188"", ""10.1080/02699930302297"", ""10.1037/a0031820"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199279456.003.0040"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199243167.001.0001"", ""10.1037/rev0000135"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691517.003.0006"", ""10.1093/0199263655.001.0001"", ""10.1037/h0077714"", ""10.1080/02699930600923668"", ""10.2190/12AV-AH2P-MCEH-289E"", ""10.1037/1528-3542.5.1.89"", ""10.1037/pspi0000131""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Sensory Systems', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7388), ('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7302)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This article examines the role that structural gaslighting plays in white feminist methodology and epistemology using Miranda Fricker's discussion of hermeneutical injustice as an illustration (Fricker 2007). Fricker's work produces structural gaslighting through several methods: i) the outright denial of the role that structural oppression plays in producing interpretive harm, ii) the use of single-axis conceptual resources to understand intersectional oppression, and iii) the failure to recognize the legacy of women of color's epistemic resistance work surrounding the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace. I argue that Fricker's whitewashed discussion of epistemic resistance to sexual harassment in the United States is a form of structural gaslighting that fails to treat women of color as knowers and exemplifies the strategic forgetting that is a central methodological tactic of white feminism.","[{""name"": ""Nora Berenstain"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/21565503.2017.1403934"", ""10.1017/9780511840067"", ""10.1007/s12114-011-9100-8"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjsf541"", ""10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.1.0024"", ""10.3138/cjwl.24.2.275"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01175.x"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01177.x"", ""10.1353/ff.2013.0006"", ""10.3366/epi.2006.3.1-2.96"", ""10.1080/02691728.2013.782585"", ""10.1215/9780822382799"", ""10.1086/697490"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2006.tb01113.x"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01222.x"", ""10.1177/1077801209360857"", ""10.1057/fr.1988.42"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195367690.001.0001"", ""10.1111/hypa.12066"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1111/hypa.12060"", ""10.1017/hyp.2020.33"", ""10.1111/josp.12297"", ""10.1007/s10560-018-0530-z"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929023.001.0001"", ""10.3998/mpub.8504605"", ""10.1086/494491""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/hyp.2020.33,HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology,Cultural Gaslighting,"AbstractThis essay frames systemic patterns of mental abuse against women of color and Indigenous women on Turtle Island (North America) in terms of larger design-of-distribution strategies in settler colonial societies, as these societies use various forms of social power to distribute, reproduce, and automate social inequalities (including public health precarities and mortality disadvantages) that skew socioeconomic gain continuously toward white settler populations and their descendants. It departs from traditional studies in gender-based violence research that frame mental abuses such as gaslighting—commonly understood as mental manipulation through lying or deceit—stochastically, as chance-driven, interpersonal phenomena. Building on structural analyses of knowledge in political epistemology (Dotson 2012a; Berenstain 2016), political theory (Davis and Ernst 2017), and Indigenous social theory (Tuck and Yang 2012), I develop the notion ofcultural gaslightingto refer to the social and historical infrastructural support mechanisms that disproportionately produce abusive mental ambients in settler colonial cultures in order to further the ends of cultural genocide and dispossession. I conclude by proposing a social epidemiological account of gaslighting that a) highlights the public health harms of abusive ambients for minority populations, b) illuminates the hidden rules of social structure in settler colonial societies, and c) amplifies the corresponding need for structural reparations.","[{""name"": ""Elena Ruíz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199843633.001.0001"", ""10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182932238"", ""10.1192/bjp.150.4.553"", ""10.1353/aq.2017.0064"", ""10.1073/pnas.1516047113"", ""10.1080/02691728.2013.782585"", ""10.1177/070674378202700310"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.7560/728752"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-13-228"", ""10.1089/jwh.2017.6467"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2019.05.002"", ""10.2307/j.ctv9hvrrv"", ""10.1111/j.1470-9856.2007.00224.x"", ""10.1177/1557085117701574"", ""10.2979/HYP.2008.23.2.160"", ""10.1177/1177180118783301"", ""10.1503/cmaj.111719"", ""10.1086/491758"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184618"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816696314.001.0001"", ""10.1080/02691728.2017.1346721"", ""10.1515/9781400843497"", ""10.1111/phis.12165"", ""10.1016/j.healthplace.2013.04.007"", ""10.5206/fpq/2018.3.5775"", ""10.1176/ajp.2006.163.7.1147"", ""10.1080/14681994.2018.1444274"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195154276.001.0001"", ""10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.1.0024"", ""10.1503/cmaj.160117"", ""10.1093/bjc/azy052"", ""10.2307/3177922"", ""10.1097/JPN.0000000000000306"", ""10.1111/phc3.12302"", ""10.1136/jech.55.3.160"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01177.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.01.053"", ""10.1080/14680777.2018.1447395"", ""10.1353/aq.2012.0017"", ""10.1177/1177180119828075"", ""10.1089/jwh.2013.4334"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30569-X"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.04.045"", ""10.1016/j.ssmph.2018.09.003"", ""10.4324/9781315426570"", ""10.1624/105812400X87653""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s10676-020-09543-1,ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,0101 Philosophy; 1205 Library and Information Science & Archive Management,Trust in farm data sharing: reflections on the EU code of conduct for agricultural data sharing,"AbstractDigital farming technologies promise to help farmers make well-informed decisions that improve the quality and quantity of their production, with less labour and less impact on the environment. This future, however, can only become a reality if farmers are willing to share their data with agribusinesses that develop digital technologies. To foster trust in data sharing, in Europe the EU Code of Conduct for agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement was launched in 2018 which encourages transparency about data use. This article looks at the EU Code through the lens of literature on trust and contract agreements. We agree with the makers of the EU Code that a contract can make an important contribution to trust relationships as it is needed to mitigate the detrimental effects of power relationships between experts and non-experts. Building on Onora O’Neills perspective to trust, however, we argued that a contract can only be successful in fostering trust when (a) information is comprehended by the more vulnerable party in this relationship who has to sign the contract, (b) the more powerful partner takes responsibility to provide that information, and (c) information is tailored to the information needs of the party signing the contract, even when data are re-used over a longer period. In addition, we think that differences between trust relationships and relationships of accountability, give reason to add to informed consent other more substantive ethical components in a more encompassing code of conduct.","[{""name"": ""Simone van der Burg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leanne Wiseman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jovana Krkeljas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s12687-015-0238-0"", ""10.22215/timreview/1135"", ""10.1177/2053951716648174"", ""10.1111/bioe.12030"", ""10.1183/09031936.00165006"", ""10.14763/2016.1.405"", ""10.1111/soru.12120"", ""10.1007/978-1-59745-423-0_1"", ""10.1007/s10676-011-9279-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199231461.003.0006"", ""10.1007/s10806-017-9704-5"", ""10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201458"", ""10.1007/s13593-018-0501-y"", ""10.1163/157180908X338269"", ""10.1038/sj.bjc.6604795"", ""10.1007/s11019-005-0397-6"", ""10.1038/nbt.2349"", ""10.1136/jme.2008.024851"", ""10.1016/j.compag.2017.09.037"", ""10.1016/j.njas.2018.11.002"", ""10.1038/nrg1396"", ""10.1177/2053951714564227"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511814600"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511606250"", ""10.1136/jme.29.1.4"", ""10.1016/j.njas.2019.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2017.01.010"", ""10.1007/s11023-010-9201-3"", ""10.1007/s12130-010-9113-9"", ""10.1016/j.njas.2019.01.001"", ""10.1136/bmj.332.7540.544"", ""10.2307/3563696"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2017.01.023""]",['Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],"['Food Science', 'Plant Science']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1007/s10551-019-04176-x,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,The Deliberate Engagement of Narcissistic CEOs in Earnings Management,"AbstractCorroborating upper echelons theory, this study picks up the notion that narcissistic chief executive officers (CEOs) take advantage of accounting choices to enhance their firms’—and inherently their own—personal track records. Using a set of 15 indicators, reflecting the narcissistic trait of 1126 CEOs for the period 1992 to 2012, we find evidence of highly narcissistic CEOs engaging in accrual-based earnings management (ABEM). In contrast to prior research, the results show evidence not only for income-increasing but also for income-decreasing ABEM. This indicates that highly narcissistic CEOs not only strive to influence stakeholders’ perception of current performance. We conclude that they also assess their potential to influence perception of current and future earnings. The results imply that highly narcissistic CEOs’ accounting choices are driven by self-serving behavior rather than by the intention to provide additional information to the market. When earnings management techniques are used to derive personal advantage from the presentation of a firm’s earnings, the literature refers to this as a case of low earnings quality reflecting unethical behavior. Accordingly, this study contributes to the field of business ethics by showing that CEO narcissism is related to low earnings quality in that it is associated to discretionarily decreasing accruals.","[{""name"": ""Frerich Buchholz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerstin Lopatta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karen Maas"", ""affiliation"":

10.1111/jssr.12720,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology,Religion Protected Mental Health but Constrained Crisis Response During Crucial Early Days of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"AbstractThis study demonstrates that religion protected mental health but constrained support for crisis response during the crucial early days of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Data from a national probability‐based sample of the U.S. population show that highly religious individuals and evangelicals suffered less distress in March 2020. They were also less likely to see the coronavirus outbreak as a crisis and less likely to support public health restrictions to limit the spread of the virus. The conservative politicization of religion in the United States can help explain why religious Americans (and evangelicals in particular) experienced less distress and were less likely to back public health efforts to contain the virus. We conclude that religion can be a source of comfort and strength in times of crisis, but—at least in the case of the COVID‐19 pandemic—it can also undercut efforts to end the root causes of suffering.","[{""name"": ""Landon Schnabel"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology Cornell University""]}, {""name"": ""Scott Schieman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology University of Toronto""]}]","[""10.1086/709779"", ""10.1177/0022146520970190"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.03.015"", ""10.1080/01419870.2021.1867216"", ""10.1080/17439760.2020.1832247"", ""10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100078"", ""10.1093/sf/soaa018"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01058-9"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106231"", ""10.15195/v1.a24"", ""10.1177/1088868309353750"", ""10.1093/geront/gnaa168"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2008.07.007"", ""10.1017/S1755048319000208"", ""10.1093/socrel/srt056"", ""10.1111/jssr.12677"", ""10.1093/socrel/sraa047"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01070-z"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01583.x"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4276-5_22"", ""10.1111/jssr.12502"", ""10.15195/v4.a28"", ""10.1111/0021-8294.00065"", ""10.1007/s10943-012-9591-z"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0884-z"", ""10.1093/socrel/srx070"", ""10.1177/0049124194023002004""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1017/S1755048319000208,POLITICS AND RELIGION,0101 Philosophy; 0302 Political Science,Who Wants to Make America Great Again? Understanding Evangelical Support for Donald Trump,"AbstractWhite evangelicals overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in the 2016 election, producing extensive debate as to who evangelicals are, what it means to be an evangelical in the United States today, and whether the electoral results are surprising or not. This paper offers empirical clarity to this protracted discussion by asking and answering a series of questions related to Trump's victory in general and his support from white evangelicals in particular. In doing so, the analyses show that the term “evangelical” has not become a synonym for conservative politics and that white evangelical support for Trump would behigherif public opinion scholars used a belief-centered definition of evangelicalism rather than relying on the more common classification strategies based on self-identification or religious denomination. These findings go against claims thatnominalevangelicals, those who call themselves evangelicals but are not religious, make up the core of Trump's support base. Moreover, strong electoral support among devout evangelicals is not unique to the 2016 election but rather is part of a broader trend of evangelical electoral behavior, even when faced with non-traditional Republican candidates. Finally, the paper explores why white evangelicals might support a candidate like Trump. The paper presents evidence that negative partisanship helps explain why devout evangelicals—despite Trump's background and behaviors being cause for concern—coalesced around his presidential bid. Together, the findings from this paper help make sense of both the 2016 presidential election and evangelical public opinion, both separately and together.","[{""name"": ""Michele F.

10.1007/s10551-022-05081-6,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,"Unethical Leadership: Review, Synthesis and Directions for Future Research","AbstractThe academic literature on unethical leadership is witnessing an upward trend, perhaps given the magnitude of unethical conduct in organisations, which is manifested in increasing corporate fraud and scandals in the contemporary business landscape. Despite a recent increase, scholarly interest in this area has, by and large, remained scant due to the proliferation of concepts that are often and mistakenly considered interchangeable. Nevertheless, scholarly investigation in this field of inquiry has picked up the pace, which warrants a critical appraisal of the extant research on unethical leadership. To this end, the current study systematically reviews the existing body of work on unethical leadership and offers a robust and multi-level understanding of the academic developments in this field. We organised the studies according to various themes focused on antecedents, outcomes and boundary conditions. In addition, we advance a multi-level conceptualisation of unethical leadership, which incorporates macro, meso and micro perspectives and, thus, provide a nuanced understanding of this phenomenon. The study also explicates critical knowledge gaps in the literature that could broaden the horizon of unethical leadership research. On the basis of these knowledge gaps, we develop potential research models that are well grounded in theory and capture the genesis of unethical leadership under our multi-level framework. Scholars and practitioners will find this study useful in understanding the occurrence, consequences and potential strategies to circumvent the negative effects of unethical leadership.","[{""name"":

10.1111/phc3.12668,PHILOSOPHY COMPASS,0101 Philosophy,The relationship between belief and credence,"AbstractSometimes epistemologists theorize aboutbelief, a tripartite attitude on which one can believe, withhold belief, or disbelieve a proposition. In other cases, epistemologists theorize aboutcredence, a fine‐grained attitude that represents one's subjective probability or confidence level toward a proposition. How do these two attitudes relate to each other? This article explores the relationship between belief and credence in two categories: descriptive and normative.

10.1108/JICES-04-2020-0052,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY,0101 Philosophy,The COVID-19 pandemic: new concerns and connections between eHealth and digital inequalities,"Purpose Telemedicine has been advancing for decades and is more indispensable than ever in this unprecedented time of the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown, eHealth appears to be effective for routine management of chronic conditions that require extensive and repeated interactions with healthcare professionals, as well as the monitoring of symptoms and diagnostics. Yet much needs to be done to alleviate digital inequalities that stand in the way of making the benefits of eHealth accessible to all. The purpose of this paper is to explore the recent shift in healthcare delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic towards telemedicine in healthcare delivery and show how this rapid shift is leaving behind those without digital resources and exacerbating inequalities along many axes. Design/methodology/approach Because the digitally disadvantaged are less likely to use eHealth services, they bear greater risks during the pandemic to meet ongoing medical care needs. This holds true for both medical conditions necessitating lifelong care and conditions of particular urgency such as pregnancy. For this reason, the authors examine two case studies that exemplify the implications of differential access to eHealth: the case of chronic care diseases such as diabetes requiring ongoing care and the case of time-sensitive health conditions such as pregnancy that may be compromised by gaps in continuous care. Findings Not only are the digitally disadvantaged more likely to belong to populations experiencing greater risk – including age and economic class – but they are less likely to use eHealth services and thereby bear greater risks during the pandemic to meet ongoing medical care needs during the pandemic. Social implications At the time of writing, almost 20% of Americans have been unable to obtain medical prescriptions or needed medical care unrelated to the virus. In light of the potential of telemedicine, this does not need to be the case. These social inequalities take on particular significance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value In light of the COVID-19 virus, ongoing medical care requires exposure to risks that can be successfully managed by digital communications and eHealth advances. However, the benefits of eHealth are far less likely to accrue to the digitally disadvantaged.","[{""name"": ""Aneka Khilnani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeremy Schulz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Robinson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1046/j.1365-2370.2003.00395.x"", ""10.1258/1357633991932793"", ""10.1038/jp.2015.183"", ""10.1542/peds.2009-1785"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.02.020"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68341-4"", ""10.1089/dia.2018.0384"", ""10.1080/13691180601063982"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2013.777759"", ""10.1177/0002764210361685"", ""10.1016/j.jhqr.2019.08.004"", ""10.1097/00004703-200604000-00003"", ""10.1055/s-0038-1675158"", ""10.1177/000992280304200704"", ""10.2196/resprot.6167"", ""10.1177/0022146510383498"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2015.1012532"", ""10.1136/jamia.2010.006015"", ""10.1097/01.AOG.0000483637.05137.18"", ""10.1177/1461444818797082"", ""10.1007/s00125-012-2708-9""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Oncology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.3390/rel11050254,RELIGIONS,0101 Philosophy,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Organization of Religious Behaviour in Different Christian Denominations in Poland,"Any pandemic disorganizes the life of wider society. One of the manifestations of social activity is religious life. Despite progressing secularization, both religion, churches, and denominational associations have an impact on individual ethical choices and business decisions. This is true especially in Poland, where over 90 percent of the citizens declare affiliation with some religion, mostly Christian. The purpose of the present article is to demonstrate what activities are undertaken by churches in Poland at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, and what differences there are in their organization of religious life. In order to achieve the set goal, qualitative methods were implemented in the research. As part of the qualitative paradigm, in-depth individual interviews were used, involving individuals responsible for organizing religious life at the parish or congregation level. The interviewees were clergymen from the most important denominations, ranging from Catholic and Orthodox to broadly understood Protestant denominations. The paper contains a review of relevant literature. It presents the results and discussion of qualitative research, and it also indicates the research limitations. The study reveals that individual churches have limited (Catholic and Orthodox) or totally suspended (Protestants) their religious life in the actual community-based dimension. The decisions made by the clergymen, regardless of their personal views, resulted from the assumed ecclesiology and tradition. While changing the organization of religious life, the churches maintained contact with the believers in various ways, using modern technologies and access to public media in this regard. Although the churches are not changing their doctrinal positions, they declare different forms of cooperation.","[{""name"": ""Lukasz Sulkowski"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Management and Social Communication, Institute of Public Affairs, Jagiellonian University, 31-007 Cracow, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Grzegorz Ignatowski"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Management, University of Social Sciences, 90-113 Lodz, Poland""]}]","[""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199645831.001.0001"", ""10.1177/154230500305700210"", ""10.1177/1094428106297812"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-72711-0"", ""10.1177/00333549101250S314"", ""10.1007/s12111-009-9105-6"", ""10.1073/pnas.0610941104"", ""10.3390/rel11010047"", ""10.4324/9781315572710"", ""10.3390/rel2040707"", ""10.1080/17441692.2011.604039"", ""10.1080/13552070600980344"", ""10.1163/9789042032804"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.01.004"", ""10.7833/82-0-902"", ""10.1016/j.annepidem.2018.02.013"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-145-2-200607180-00132"", ""10.2307/j.ctt13wwwwt.13"", ""10.2478/joim-2020-0029"", ""10.1108/14715201011090585"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.2648""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Religious studies', 'Safety Research', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

A Reflection on the Environmental Sustainability of Big Data Initiatives","AbstractThis paper addresses a problem that has so far been neglected by scholars investigating the ethics of Big Data and policy makers: that is the ethical implications of Big Data initiatives’ environmental impact. Building on literature in environmental studies, cultural studies and Science and Technology Studies, the article draws attention to the physical presence of data, the material configuration of digital service, and the space occupied by data. It then explains how this material and situated character of data raises questions concerning the ethics of the increasingly fashionable Big Data discourses. It argues that attention should be paid to (1) the vocabulary currently used when discussing the governance of data initiatives; (2) the internal tension between current data initiatives and environmental policies; (3) issues of fair distribution. The article explains how taking into account these aspects would allow for a more responsible behaviour in the context of data storage and production.","[{""name"": ""Federica Lucivero"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/en10101470"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2004.01.003"", ""10.3390/su10082662"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878"", ""10.5130/csr.v20i1.3832"", ""10.1057/9781137483591_1"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1606268"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-59702-2"", ""10.3929/ETHZ-A-007337628"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262029513.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09505431.2013.786990"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0301-8"", ""10.1177/2053951714528481"", ""10.1177/00027649921955326"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23282-9"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262014649.001.0001"", ""10.1063/pt.5.025300"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9652-2"", ""10.1016/J.ERSS.2018.01.018"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-3879-9"", ""10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2019.02.018"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199589074.013.0005"", ""10.1080/09644016.2013.755387"", ""10.2217/pme-2016-0057"", ""10.1177/2053951718819032"", ""10.17742/IMAGE.LD.8.2.5"", ""10.1177/2053951717736335"", ""10.1007/s11027-017-9763-y"", ""10.5325/j.ctv14gp4w7"", ""10.17742/IMAGE.LD.8.2.2"", ""10.1080/00141844.2018.1471513"", ""10.1038/530144a"", ""10.1001/jama.2014.4228"", ""10.1016/J.BUILDENV.2014.08.021"", ""10.1038/535345a"", ""10.1038/nature10682""]","['Environmental Science', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Safety Research', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Archean granites define a continuum of compositions between several end members: (i) magmas that originated by partial melting of a range of crustal sources, from amphibolites to metasediments (‘C-type’ granitoids); and (ii) magmas that formed by partial melting of an enriched mantle source, the most common agent of enrichment being felsic (TTG) melts. Differences in the degree of metasomatism results in different primitive liquids for these ‘M-type’ granitoids. Mixed sources, differentiation and interactions between different melts resulted in a continuous range of compositions, defined by variable proportions of each end member. During the Archean, evolved crustal sources (sediments or felsic crust) and metasomatized mantle sources become increasingly more important, mirroring the progressive maturation of crustal segments and the stabilization of the global tectonic system.","[{""name"": ""Jean-François Moyen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.lithos.2010.07.026"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00103-0"",

Cretaceous third- and fourth-order hothouse sea-level changes, the sequence-stratigraphic framework, are linked to Milankovitch-type climate cycles, especially the longer-period sequence-building bands of 405 kyr and 1.2 myr. In the absence of continental ice sheets during Cretaceous hothouse phases (e.g. Cenomanian–Turonian), growing evidence indicates groundwater-related sea-level cycles: (1) the existence of Milankovitch-type humid-arid climate oscillations, proven via intense humid weathering records during times of regression and sea-level lowstands; (2) missing or inverse relationships of sea-level and the marine δ 18 O archives, i.e. the lack of a pronounced positive excursion, cooling signal during sea-level lowstands; and (3) the anti-phase relationship of sea and lake levels, attesting to high groundwater levels and charged continental aquifers during sea-level lowstands. This substantiates the aquifer-eustasy hypothesis. Rates of aquifer-eustatic sea-level change remain hard to decipher; however, reconstructions range from a very conservative minimum estimate of 0.04 mm a −1 (longer time intervals) to 0.7 mm a −1 (shorter, probably asymmetric cycles). Remarkably, aquifer-eustasy is recognized as a significant component for the Anthropocene sea-level budget.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Sames"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Geodynamics and Sedimentology, University of Vienna, UZA 2, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria"", ""Sam Noble Museum, University of Oklahoma, 2401 Chautauqua Ave, Norman, OK 73072, USA""]}, {""name"": ""M.

In this paper, I consider two similar albeit seemingly rival answers to this question: the Wittgensteinian theory, according to which deep disagreements are disagreements over hinge propositions, and the fundamental epistemic principle theory, according to which deep disagreements are disagreements over fundamental epistemic principles. I assess these theories against a set of desiderata for a satisfactory theory of deep disagreement, and argue that while the fundamental epistemic principle theory does better than the Wittgensteinian theory on this score, the fundamental epistemic principle theory nevertheless struggles to explain the variety of deep disagreement.","[{""name"": ""Chris Ranalli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.22329/il.v25i1.1045"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199287185.001.0001"", ""10.5840/jphil2008105929"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2007.00292.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2003.tb00307.x"", ""10.1057/9781137336644"", ""10.1215/00318108-2006-035"", ""10.2307/2024672"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2002.tb00204.x"", ""10.1057/9781137501899"", ""10.1093/0199270023.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10730-013-9227-z"", ""10.22329/il.v25i1.1040"", ""10.22329/il.v25i1.1044"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487521"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487521"", ""10.1111/phis.12029"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2006.00255.x"", ""10.1017/epi.2013.46"", ""10.1007/s10677-014-9523-y"", ""10.1111/1467-9264.t01-1-00003"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1041-0"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7602.001.0001"", ""10.1163/22105700-00603010"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199682751.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10670-013-9448-1"", ""10.1007/s11245-018-9576-y"", ""10.1057/9780230504462"", ""10.1163/22105700-00603003"", ""10.1093/mind/fzp097"", ""10.1007/s11229-008-9330-x"", ""10.22329/il.v28i2.541"", ""10.1007/s11050-007-9022-y"", ""10.1515/9781614511601.43"", ""10.1002/9781444392494.ch14"", ""10.1515/9781400873913"", ""10.2307/2564607"", ""10.1093/0198247613.001.0001"", ""10.22329/il.v25i1.1042"", ""10.2307/2678454"", ""10.3366/epi.2007.4.1.93""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

We argue that while there are significant challenges and ample room for improvement, research on the causes, psychological properties, and behavioral effects of implicit bias continues to deserve a role in the sciences of the mind as well as in efforts to understand, and ultimately combat, discrimination and inequality.","[{""name"": ""Michael Brownstein"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy John Jay College and The Graduate Center, CUNY""]}, {""name"": ""Alex Madva"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy Cal Poly Pomona""]}, {""name"": ""Bertram Gawronski"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Psychology University of Texas at Austin""]}]","[""10.1037/a0021594"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.84.5.888"", ""10.1177/1948550617728995"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.33.4.344"", ""10.3758/s13428-013-0410-6"", ""10.31219/osf.io/p2akj"", ""10.1037/xge0000383"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2008.11.002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198766179.003.0010"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0017.2012.01450.x"", ""10.1177/1088868312440047"", ""10.1207/S15327957PSPR0501_3"", ""10.1177/0956797610378685"", ""10.1521/soco.2014.32.supp.124"", ""10.1037/0096-3445.135.1.70"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.89.4.469"", ""10.1177/0146167216675331"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00328"", ""10.1111/rati.12170"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2012.06.003"", ""10.1017/S0140525X11002214"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139878364"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(04)36001-6"", ""10.1006/jesp.1997.1331"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.3.505"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60318-4"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1013"", ""10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00280.x"", ""10.1002/ejsp.842"", ""10.1037/pspa0000160"", ""10.1027/1618-3169.54.4.247"", ""10.1080/10463280802556958"", ""10.1126/science.1160769"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.132.5.692"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-385522-0.00002-0"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2017.1373546"", ""10.1177/1088868313480096"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511996481.016"", ""10.1177/0146167216684131"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464"", ""10.1037/a0015575"", ""10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01195.x"", ""10.1037/pspa0000016"", ""10.1027/1614-0001.29.2.70"", ""10.1111/1467-9264.00062"", ""10.1080/00455091.2015.1019176"", ""10.1037/xge0000623"", ""10.3390/philosophies2020012"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420180207"", ""10.1177/1948550611421635"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.91.1.16"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2017.1373555"", ""10.1037/amp0000364"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.01.013"", ""10.1126/science.1261375"", ""10.1097/00005053-193611000-00051"", ""10.1177/1745691611406921"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0005"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2017.1373557"", ""10.1007/s11229-015-0874-2"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0008"", ""10.1111/papq.12212"", ""10.1111/nous.12182"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0083543"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2015.08.002"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.50.9.741"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00235"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.102.2.246"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2266"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00477.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.03.036"", ""10.1177/0013916591234005"", ""10.1037/a0032734"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.277"", ""10.1177/0146167210383440"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2017.1380460"", ""10.1111/spc3.12148"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2010.09.007"", ""10.1521/soco.2007.25.5.657"", ""10.1037/a0014996"", ""10.1177/1948550614567357"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0122245"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.90.1.109"", ""10.1080/10888691.2014.983635"", ""10.1037/a0026838"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00047.x"", ""10.4135/9781412984997"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.74.2.166"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2017.1373554"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog2202_2"", ""10.1207/s15327957pspr0803_1"", ""10.1007/s11211-008-0071-2"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.78.5.853"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2005.tb00495.x"", ""10.1037/a0037461"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0152719"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.107.1.101"", ""10.1177/0013164495055002002"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.013""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Despite worries about the explainability and accuracy of such medical AI systems, it is reasonable to assume that they will be increasingly implemented in medical practice. Current ethical debates focus mainly on design requirements and suggest embedding certain values such as transparency, fairness, and explainability in the design of medical AI systems. Aside from concerns about their design, medical AI systems also raise questions with regard to physicians' responsibilities once these technologies are being implemented and used. How do physicians’ responsibilities change with the implementation of medical AI? Which set of competencies do physicians have to learn to responsibly interact with medical AI? In the present article, we will introduce the notion of forward‐looking responsibility and enumerate through this conceptual lens a number of competencies and duties that physicians ought to employ to responsibly utilize medical AI in practice. Those include amongst others understanding the range of reasonable outputs, being aware of own experience and skill decline, and monitoring potential accuracy decline of the AI systems.","[{""name"": ""Martin Sand"", ""affiliation"": [""TU Delft Faculty of Technology Delft The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Juan Manuel Durán"", ""affiliation"": [""TU Delft Faculty of Technology Delft The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Karin Rolanda Jongsma"", ""affiliation"": [""University Medical Center Utrecht Utrecht University Utrecht The Netherlands""]}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

This paper reports a case study of a construction company, exploring how different tensions emerged to challenge company-level aspirations for strategic CSR integration. The study identifies three types of persistent CSR tensions and four management practices, discussing how the management practices led the organization to navigate CSR tensions in both active and defensive ways. Furthermore, the study explicates why the case company succeeded in integrating CSR into formal business strategy and shared attitudes but struggled with CSR integration in the domain of day-to-day operations. The paper contributes to the CSR literature by developing a tension-centric perspective on CSR development. It highlights the necessity of tension navigation at both the organizational and the action levels, the key role of active (as opposed to defensive) navigation of CSR tensions, and the importance of alignment between organizational and action levels in navigating tensions for sustaining strategic focus on CSR over time.","[{""name"": ""Jaakko Siltaloppi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Risto Rajala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henri Hietala"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.02.142"", ""10.1111/iops.12059"", ""10.5465/annals.2015.0095"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.27745504"", ""10.1177/0018726704048357"", ""10.2307/41166409"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275679"", ""10.1002/jsc.731"", ""10.2307/257850"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.0697"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2782-2"", ""10.2307/3069417"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1245-2"", ""10.1177/1094428112452151"", ""10.1177/1476127017702819"", ""10.1002/bse.674"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3587-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2047-5"", ""10.1177/0170840615604506"", ""10.5465/amr.2012.0341"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9712-5"", ""10.5465/amj.2016.0960"", ""10.1016/S0024-6301(03)00115-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2941-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3583-6"", ""10.1177/1476127013481016"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.0772"", ""10.1108/14630010610711757"", ""10.1108/07363760110410281"", ""10.5465/amr.2000.3707712"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9738-8"", ""10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00175-6"", ""10.5465/amj.2008.31767217"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9804-2"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2009.00278.x"", ""10.2307/3556659"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2006.00580.x"", ""10.2307/41166340"", ""10.1177/1086026608321329"", ""10.1509/jppm.15.143"", ""10.2307/258559"", ""10.5465/19416520.2016.1162421"", ""10.1007/BF00382966"", ""10.1023/A:1025645402328"", ""10.1111/joms.12014"", ""10.5465/amj.2011.0932"", ""10.5840/beq201323327"", ""10.5465/19416520.2012.672039"", ""10.1177/0170840619856034"", ""10.1177/1086026615575047"", ""10.1023/A:1005726901050"", ""10.2307/256975"", ""10.1023/A:1016542207069"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0710-z""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"
10.3390/rel11060276,RELIGIONS,0101 Philosophy,"The Absence of Presence and the Presence of Absence: Social Distancing, Sacraments, and the Virtual Religious Community during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The response of churches to the challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic invites a closer examination of the relationships between virtual and embodied religious communities during a time of social distancing. The speed and the scale of the closure of church buildings during Easter 2020 sheds light upon the multiplicity of practical, emotional, and spiritual responses to a relationship between church and people that is increasingly dominated by online interactions. Such a seismic shift in social culture opens up the possibility and challenges of a new understanding of belonging and participation in a religious community. Given its liturgical, pastoral, and sacramental significance, Easter 2020 was a highly charged moment for the relationship between the Christian churches and the faithful, and between religious worship and social media. In the shift from embodied community to virtual congregation that followed, the material absence of physical presence in collective worship was striking, as was the psychological presence of that absence. This paper analyses different understandings of religion, church, and community in the period of a pandemic, and argues for the value of an approach that situates the debates spawned in the context of historical precedent, personal experience, and theoretical approaches to networks, communities, religion, and social media.","[{""name"": ""Helen Parish"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of History, The University of Reading, Reading RG6 6AH, UK""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315163253"", ""10.4324/9780203084861"", ""10.1163/9789004375871"", ""10.4159/9780674059276"", ""10.1177/2050303219848039"", ""10.1515/9781503617353"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00365.x"", ""10.56021/9780801828430"", ""10.1080/01972240600677805"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4729.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203328064"", ""10.1093/jaarel/lfj024"", ""10.1111/moth.12190""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Philosophy'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Immunity passports for COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led a number of countries to introduce restrictive ‘lockdown’ policies on their citizens in order to control infection spread. Immunity passports have been proposed as a way of easing the harms of such policies, and could be used in conjunction with other strategies for infection control. These passports would permit those who test positive for COVID-19 antibodies to return to some of their normal behaviours, such as travelling more freely and returning to work. The introduction of immunity passports raises a number of practical and ethical challenges. In this paper, we seek to review the challenges relating to various practical considerations, fairness issues, the risk to social cooperation and the impact on people’s civil liberties. We make tentative recommendations for the ethical introduction of immunity passports.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca C H Brown"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julian Savulescu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bridget Williams"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominic Wilkinson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1056/NEJMoa2006100"", ""10.7326/M20-3012"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-0869-5"", ""10.1126/science.abb3221"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa2008457"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.017"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-01451-0"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.8102"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31034-5"", ""10.1093/infdis/jiaa352"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30788-1"", ""10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365"", ""10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007"", ""10.1002/jmv.25855"", ""10.1136/bmj.m2516"", ""10.1093/phe/phz004"", ""10.1016/j.bja.2020.04.011"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106336"", ""10.1093/ahr/rhz176"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199599493.001.0001"", ""10.1136/bmj.i5594"", ""10.1007/s10728-019-00366-w"", ""10.1257/aer.90.4.980"", ""10.1016/S1090-5138(01)00093-9"", ""10.1126/science.abb6936"", ""10.1109/ISTAS.2009.5155910"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106314""]","['Medicine', 'Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Modeling and Simulation', 'Health', 'Infectious Diseases']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)]]"

Through in-depth, qualitative interviews of 39 women leaders in STEM, we identify common gender microaggressions they experience, and explore how these microaggressions affect their leadership experience and outcomes in the workplace. Our findings highlight five types of gender microaggressions women most often encounter, and how and when these microaggressions occur. We explore the negative impact that microaggressions can have on women’s work identities and how they can trigger a cycle of rumination and self-doubt that may ultimately result in women choosing to leave STEM. Importantly, we surface the interventional and empowering role that allies play in triggering a redemptive sensemaking process that can support women leaders to build resilience and counter the negative effects of microaggressions.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Y.

When assessed by sector, hospital care, clinical services, medical structures, and pharmaceuticals are the top emitters. For 15 years, research has been dedicated to the medical structures and equipment that contribute to carbon emissions. More recently, hospital care and clinical services have been examined. However, the carbon of pharmaceuticals is understudied. This article will focus on the carbon emissions of pharmaceuticals since they are consistently calculated to be among the top contributors to healthcare carbon and assess the factors that contribute to pharmaceutical carbon emissions. Specifically, overprescription, pharmaceutical waste, antibiotic resistance, routine prescriptions, non-adherence, drug dependency, lifestyle prescriptions, and drugs given due to a lack of preventive healthcare will be identified. Prescribing practices have environmental ramifications. Carbon reduction, when focused on pharmaceuticals, can lead to cleaner, more sustainable healthcare.","[{""name"": ""Cristina Richie"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6376(15)60854-6"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479858033.001.0001"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab19e1"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0157014"", ""10.1016/j.puhe.2014.06.015"", ""10.1071/AH13022"", ""10.1038/eye.2013.9"", ""10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.839"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.204"", ""10.18192/riss-ijhs.v2i2.1519"", ""10.1186/s40780-018-0125-z"", ""10.1007/s12152-008-9023-7"", ""10.1007/s00267-019-01199-y"", ""10.1136/bmj.b326"", ""10.1001/jama.2009.1610"", ""10.1136/bmj.e8243"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010508"", ""10.1007/s00127-016-1306-4"", ""10.1001/jama.2015.13766"", ""10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2019.2901"", ""10.1086/510393"", ""10.1177/2042098617736192"", ""10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.05.029"", ""10.1186/s12875-016-0566-0"", ""10.1007/s11606-018-4325-x"", ""10.5694/mja15.01387"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60648-6"", ""10.1177/1073110520979371"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1500848"", ""10.1038/534027a"", ""10.1503/cmaj.1041594"", ""10.1038/ijo.2017.287"", ""10.1213/ANE.0b013e31824f6940"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2013.09.003"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2018.304397""]","['Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7721), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7606)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

We present an overview of how these three aspects interact in the contemporary literature and discuss those alternative projects that have yet to be explored based on our suggested typology. We show how choices about each element in a conceptual engineering project constrain the possibilities for the others, thereby giving rise to distinct groupings of possible projects under the banner of conceptual engineering. We conclude with a critical reflection on the potential ethical issues that arise as a result of effectively putting conceptual engineering into practice.","[{""name"": ""Manuel Gustavo Isaac"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Philosophy University of Zurich  Zurich Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Steffen Koch"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy Bielefeld University  Bochum Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Ryan Nefdt"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy University of Cape Town  Cape Town South Africa""]}]","[""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1850339"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2021.1983457"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-05308-0_3"", ""10.2307/3071157"", ""10.1007/s10670‐015‐9791‐5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.001.0001"", ""10.1111/rati.12265"", ""10.1007/s13164‐017‐0340‐9"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198814719.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487132"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1817141"", ""10.1007/s11229‐017‐1615‐5"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2022.2075454"", ""10.1007/s10670‐020‐00221‐8"", ""10.1007/s11098‐020‐01416‐z"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1853343"", ""10.1007/s11098‐021‐01619‐y"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1860122"", ""10.4324/9781003164869-3"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1773309"", ""10.1007/s11098‐020‐01570‐4"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐9973.2011.01693.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198833635.001.0001"", ""10.3196/004433007782418090"", ""10.2307/2182440"", ""10.1111/j.1468‐0017.2009.01376.x"", ""10.1086/288185"", ""10.1111/0029‐4624.00201"", ""10.2979/HYP.2005.20.4.10"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199892631.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0012"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198803331.003.0013"", ""10.1007/s11406‐021‐00367‐x"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1719881"", ""10.1111/rati.12311"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2021.1887758"", ""10.1007/s10670‐021‐00447‐0"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2022.2028230"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1809514"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2022.2062045"", ""10.1017/apa.2022.22"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2019.1567381"", ""10.1007/s11229‐020‐02868‐w"", ""10.1007/s11229‐018‐02007‐6"", ""10.1007/s11098‐020‐01546‐4"", ""10.1007/s11229‐022‐03563‐8"", ""10.1111/j.1475‐4975"", ""10.1007/s11229‐021‐03365‐4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198712053.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195306880.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198807520.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2021.1967190"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198803331.003.0014"", ""10.1111/phpr.12843"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1850342"", ""10.1007/s11229‐019‐02096‐x"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2019.1667870"", ""10.1007/s10670‐021‐00441‐6"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2021.1926316"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2021.1956368"", ""10.1111/rati.12164"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1853342"", ""10.1007/s10670‐020‐00223‐6"", ""10.1093/mind/fzz069"", ""10.1093/pq/pqab023"", ""10.1007/s11229‐020‐02815‐9"", ""10.1111/papq.12394"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0017"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2019.1675534"", ""10.1093/arisoc/aoy008"", ""10.1017/can.2020.5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0018"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1805708"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2021.1986424"", ""10.1080/00201740701698589"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199653850.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0019"", ""10.1111/phpr.12207"", ""10.1007/s10670‐014‐9648‐3"", ""10.1007/s11229‐021‐03454‐4"", ""10.1515/9783486828542"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0021"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2021.2000118"", ""10.13169/intecritdivestud.4.1.0010""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1093/mind/fzz069,MIND,0101 Philosophy,"Conceptual Engineering, Metasemantic Externalism and Speaker-Meaning","Abstract What is the relationship between conceptual engineering and metasemantic externalism? Sally Haslanger has argued that metasemantic externalism justifies the seemingly counterintuitive consequences of her proposed conceptual revisions. But according to Herman Cappelen, metasemantic externalism makes conceptual engineering effectively impossible in practice. After raising objections to Haslanger’s and Cappelen’s views, I argue for a very different picture, on which metasemantic externalism bears very little on conceptual engineering. I argue that, while metasemantic externalism principally operates at the level of semantic-meaning, we should understand conceptual engineering to operate largely at the level of speaker-meaning. This ‘Speaker-Meaning Picture’ has two key benefits. Firstly, it makes conceptual engineering often easy in practice. Secondly, it suggests a new, normative response to the well known objection that conceptual engineering serves only to change the subject.","[{""name"": ""Mark Pinder"", ""affiliation"": [""The Open University""]}]","[""10.1007/s10670-015-9791-5"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.1979.tb00374.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198814719.001.0001"", ""10.1093/019823757X.003.0007"", ""10.2307/2183321"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00201"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2006.00139.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198712053.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0383-z"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2017.1385522"", ""10.1017/S0265052500001060"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2006.00140.x"", ""10.1111/phpr.12207"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2017.1392894""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The exceptional circumstances brought by the COVID-19 global pandemic lead to more extensive, on both their scope and their duration, restrictions of human rights than in usual times. This article introduces the States’ specific right to derogate to human rights in circumstances of public emergency and the conditions of a legitimate derogation in the context of COVID-19. It argues that States must ensure that the general measures they adopt to face the crisis do not disproportionally harm vulnerable people.","[{""name"": ""Audrey Lebret"", ""affiliation"": [""Copenhagen University, Faculty of Law, CeBIL, Copenhagen, Denmark""]}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/phc3.12822,PHILOSOPHY COMPASS,0101 Philosophy,Animal sentience,"Abstract‘Sentience’ sometimes refers to the capacity for any type of subjective experience, and sometimes to the capacity to have subjective experiences with a positive or negative valence, such as pain or pleasure. We review recent controversies regarding sentience in fish and invertebrates and consider the deep methodological challenge posed by these cases. We then present two ways of responding to the challenge. In a policy‐making context, precautionary thinking can help us treat animals appropriately despite continuing uncertainty about their sentience. In a scientific context, we can draw inspiration from the science of human consciousness to disentangle conscious and unconscious perception (especially vision) in animals. Developing better ways to disentangle conscious and unconscious affect is a key priority for future research.","[{""name"": ""Heather Browning"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science London School of Economics and Political Science  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Birch"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science London School of Economics and Political Science  London UK""]}]","[""10.1016/0091-3057(95)02015-2"", ""10.1111/j.0029-4624.2004.00486.x"", ""10.1007/s10806-011-9364-9"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195304787.003.0006"", ""10.1016/j.neulet.2013.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.applanim.2009.03.013"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.07.004"", ""10.1073/pnas.1520084113"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2011.05.017"", ""10.1242/jeb.218008"", ""10.1073/pnas.2017543118"", ""10.1093/oseo/instance.00077240"", ""10.1080/02699930302289"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1200"", ""10.1086/699744"", ""10.5840/philtopics20204812"", ""10.1111/nous.12351"", ""10.1007/s10539-020-09772-0"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2020.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2020.102992"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00038188"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00625"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01954"", ""10.1079/9781780644035.0000"", ""10.1007/s10071-014-0761-0"", ""10.5840/philtopics20204815"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2018.06.012"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198843702.001.0001"", ""10.5840/philtopics20204811"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.023"", ""10.1016/S1364-6613(02)02041-7"", ""10.1126/science.280.5360.77"", ""10.1016/j.isci.2021.102229"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.043"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0646-13.2013"", ""10.1111/jzo.12434"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198848981.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139172967"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2011.03.018"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-18015-6_4"", ""10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.002"", ""10.1093/icesjms/fsy058"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1027"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wrc78"", ""10.1080/0007166021000025109"", ""10.1016/j.applanim.2006.04.011"", ""10.1242/jeb.066845"", ""10.1007/BF01963580"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.01.028"", ""10.1016/j.beproc.2017.03.022"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01686"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10714.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11793.001.0001"", ""10.1242/jeb.120550"", ""10.1126/science.1248811"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11006.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12266"", ""10.1038/srep45825"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2016.02.001"", ""10.1038/srep19850"", ""10.51291/2377-7478.1065"", ""10.1098/rstb.2019.0281"", ""10.1007/s13164-012-0104-5"", ""10.1007/s10539-012-9351-1"", ""10.1007/s10806-017-9662-y"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2020.01.026"", ""10.2983/035.035.0426"", ""10.3390/ani10101870"", ""10.1016/j.applanim.2009.02.023"", ""10.1017/S0140525X07000891"", ""10.2307/2183914"", ""10.1126/science.abb1447"", ""10.1016/0091-3057(83)90391-X"", ""10.1016/j.beproc.2016.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.11.014"", ""10.1007/s10158-017-0203-1"", ""10.1126/science.aaf4454"", ""10.1098/rstb.2017.0348"", ""10.3390/ani2040628"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0010244"", ""10.1242/bio.20149654"", ""10.1126/science.277.5328.968"", ""10.1016/j.brainres.2004.03.027"", ""10.1080/20026491051668"", ""10.1111/faf.12010"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00483.x"", ""10.1093/bjps/axp046"", ""10.4324/9781351115865-8"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104546"", ""10.1016/S0168-1591(03)00113-8"", ""10.1016/j.brainresrev.2004.07.007"", ""10.1098/rspb.2003.2349"", ""10.1067/S1526-5900(03)00717-X"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.09.007"", ""10.1002/wcs.1320"", ""10.1007/s11098-009-9439-x"", ""10.1007/s13164-012-0102-7"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6668-10.2011"", ""10.1080/17470218.2017.1373834"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2015.10.002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190278014.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199758784.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X0700115X"", ""10.1016/0091-3057(91)90102-8"", ""10.1016/0091-3057(84)90185-0""]","['Neuroscience', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Psychology']","['Genetics', 'Social Psychology', 'Sensory Systems']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7388), ('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7302)]]"
10.1186/s41073-022-00122-0,RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND PEER REVIEW,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0101 Philosophy,ACCORD guideline for reporting consensus-based methods in biomedical research and clinical practice: a study protocol,"Abstract Background Structured, systematic methods to formulate consensus recommendations, such as the Delphi process or nominal group technique, among others, provide the opportunity to harness the knowledge of experts to support clinical decision making in areas of uncertainty. They are widely used in biomedical research, in particular where disease characteristics or resource limitations mean that high-quality evidence generation is difficult. However, poor reporting of methods used to reach a consensus – for example, not clearly explaining the definition of consensus, or not stating how consensus group panellists were selected – can potentially undermine confidence in this type of research and hinder reproducibility. Our objective is therefore to systematically develop a reporting guideline to help the biomedical research and clinical practice community describe the methods or techniques used to reach consensus in a complete, transparent, and consistent manner. Methods The ACCORD (ACcurate COnsensus Reporting Document) project will take place in five stages and follow the EQUATOR Network guidance for the development of reporting guidelines. In Stage 1, a multidisciplinary Steering Committee has been established to lead and coordinate the guideline development process. In Stage 2, a systematic literature review will identify evidence on the quality of the reporting of consensus methodology, to obtain potential items for a reporting checklist. In Stage 3, Delphi methodology will be used to reach consensus regarding the checklist items, first among the Steering Committee, and then among a broader Delphi panel comprising participants with a range of expertise, including patient representatives. In Stage 4, the reporting guideline will be finalised in a consensus meeting, along with the production of an Explanation and Elaboration (E&amp;E) document. In Stage 5, we plan to publish the reporting guideline and E&amp;E document in open-access journals, supported by presentations at appropriate events. Dissemination of the reporting guideline, including a website linked to social media channels, is crucial for the document to be implemented in practice. Discussion The ACCORD reporting guideline will provide a set of minimum items that should be reported about methods used to achieve consensus, including approaches ranging from simple unstructured opinion gatherings to highly structured processes.","[{""name"": ""William T.

MML is based on the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to automatically identify patterns and act on medical data to guide clinical decisions. MML poses challenges and raises important questions, including (1) How will regulators evaluate MML-based medical devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness? and (2) What additional MML considerations should be taken into account in the international context? To address these questions, we analyze the current regulatory approaches to MML in the USA and Europe. We then examine international perspectives and broader implications, discussing considerations such as data privacy, exportation, explanation, training set bias, contextual bias, and trade secrecy.","[{""name"": ""Timo Minssen"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Advanced Studies in Biomedical Innovation Law, Copenhagen, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Sara Gerke"", ""affiliation"": [""Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Mateo Aboy"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Law, Medicine, and Life Sciences (LML), Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Nicholson Price"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Glenn Cohen"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard Law School and Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, USA""]}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

They have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths; Covid patients eighty years or older on ventilators had fatality rates higher than 90 percent. How could we have better protected older adults? Both the popular press and government entities blamed nursing homes, labeling them “snake pits” and imposing harsh fines and arduous new regulations. We argue that this approach is unlikely to improve protections for older adults. Rather than focusing exclusively on acute and critical resources, including ventilators, a plan that respected the best interests of older adults would have also supported nursing homes, a critical part of the health care system. Better access to protective equipment for staff members, early testing of staff members and patients, and enhanced means of communication with families were what was needed. These preventive measures would have offered greater benefit to the oldest members of our population than the exclusive focus on acute care.","[{""name"": ""Tia Powell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eran Bellin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amy R.

We conclude with some reasons for the ineludible importance of interpretability, such as the establishment of trust, in overcoming perhaps the most difficult challenge ML will face in a high-stakes environment like healthcare: professional and public acceptance.","[{""name"": ""Chang Ho Yoon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert Torrance"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Naomi Scheinerman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/s41746-020-0221-y"", ""10.1038/s41433-019-0626-5"", ""10.1038/nature21056"", ""10.1002/hast.973"", ""10.1089/big.2016.0051"", ""10.1177/1477370819876762"", ""10.1126/science.aax2342"", ""10.1162/99608f92.4bb9d7a7"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3403301"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.20563"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.17163"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1328"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0048-x"", ""10.18653/v1/N16-3020"", ""10.1177/0963721415591878"", ""10.1126/science.359.6377.725"", ""10.1038/nrg3920"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007560"", ""10.1038/s42256-020-00291-x"", ""10.1002/widm.1379"", ""10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2019.2923"", ""10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1"", ""10.1007/BF02639315"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocz229""]",['Medicine'],"['Family Practice', 'Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"
10.1007/s10805-023-09485-5,JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC ETHICS,0101 Philosophy,How Common is Cheating in Online Exams and did it Increase During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Systematic Review,"AbstractAcademic misconduct is a threat to the validity and reliability of online examinations, and media reports suggest that misconduct spiked dramatically in higher education during the emergency shift to online exams caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reviewed survey research to determine how common it is for university students to admit cheating in online exams, and how and why they do it. We also assessed whether these self-reports of cheating increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with an evaluation of the quality of the research evidence which addressed these questions. 25 samples were identified from 19 Studies, including 4672 participants, going back to 2012. Online exam cheating was self-reported by a substantial minority (44.7%) of students in total. Pre-COVID this was 29.9%, but during COVID cheating jumped to 54.7%, although these samples were more heterogenous. Individual cheating was more common than group cheating, and the most common reason students reported for cheating was simply that there was an opportunity to do so. Remote proctoring appeared to reduce the occurrence of cheating, although data were limited. However there were a number of methodological features which reduce confidence in the accuracy of all these findings. Most samples were collected using designs which makes it likely that online exam cheating is under-reported, for example using convenience sampling, a modest sample size and insufficient information to calculate response rate. No studies considered whether samples were representative of their population. Future approaches to online exams should consider how the basic validity of examinations can be maintained, considering the substantial numbers of students who appear to be willing to admit engaging in misconduct. Future research on academic misconduct would benefit from using large representative samples, guaranteeing participants anonymity.","[{""name"": ""Philip M.

10.1007/s11019-021-10033-4,MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Empathy in patient care: from 'Clinical Empathy' to 'Empathic Concern',"AbstractAs empathy gains importance within academia, we propose this review as an attempt to bring clarity upon the diverse and widely debated definitions and conceptions of empathy within the medical field. In this paper, we first evaluate the limits of the Western mainstream medical culture and discuss the origins of phenomena such asdehumanizationanddetached concernas well as their impacts on patient care. We then pass on to a structured overview of the debate surrounding the notion of clinical empathy and its taxonomy in the medical setting. In particular, we present the dichotomous conception of clinical empathy that is articulated in the debate aroundcognitive empathyandaffective empathy. We thus consider the negative impacts that this categorization brings about. Finally, we advocate for a more encompassing, holistic conception of clinical empathy; one that gives value to a genuine interest in welcoming, acknowledging and responding to the emotions of those suffering. Following this line of reasoning, we advance the notion of ‘empathic concern’, a re-conceptualization of clinical empathy that finds its source in Halpern in Med Health Care Philos (2014) 17:301–311engaged curiosity. We ultimately advance Narrative Medicine as an approach to introduce, teach and promote such an attitude among medical trainees and practitioners.","[{""name"": ""Clarissa Guidi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chiara Traversa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17482620600789438"", ""10.1001/jama.1958.02990210034008"", ""10.1353/sho.2004.000"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00302.x"", ""10.1001/archinte.1994.00420120093010"", ""10.1097/00001888-200502000-00013"", ""10.1001/jama.287.23.3143"", ""10.1089/acm.2005.11.591"", ""10.1056/NEJM196402272700906"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2008.09.007"", ""10.1001/jama.286.15.1897"", ""10.1002/9780470755167"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195166750.001.0001"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.644600"", ""10.1353/lm.1995.0027"", ""10.1097/00001888-200510000-00004"", ""10.1097/00001888-200106000-00008"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-135-3-200108070-00022"", ""10.1353/pbm.0.0130"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181b17b11"", ""10.1177/1754073914558466"", ""10.1159/000317771"", ""10.1177/1754073910374662"", ""10.1100/tsw.2006.221"", ""10.1017/S0954579408000503"", ""10.3399/bjgp13X660814"", ""10.1037/0278-6133.5.6.581"", ""10.1037/0278-6133.12.2.93"", ""10.1542/peds.2018-3109"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2003.09.006"", ""10.1001/archpsyc.1979.01780040035003"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2016.1248925"", ""10.5334/ijic.490"", ""10.1177/1049732309350732"", ""10.1056/NEJM196903062801004"", ""10.1177/1049732311420580"", ""10.1001/jama.289.8.1001"", ""10.1007/s11606-008-0849-9"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.30.4.467"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0061526"", ""10.1159/000075540"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780195111194.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8884.003.0020"", ""10.1007/s11019-013-9510-4"", ""10.1177/1745691611429706"", ""10.5694/j.1326-5377.2007.tb01305.x"", ""10.1016/j.conb.2008.07.012"", ""10.1001/jama.1992.03480100065032"", ""10.1001/jama.1994.03520200039032"", ""10.1177/107937390903100403"", ""10.1177/00131640121971158"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2004.01911.x"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182086fe1"", ""10.1177/1062860612464731"", ""10.1016/j.biopsych.2011.07.027"", ""10.1007/s11019-015-9631-z"", ""10.7812/TPP/11-111"", ""10.1001/jama.2009.352"", ""10.1177/0163278704267037"", ""10.1136/bmj.325.7366.682"", ""10.1001/jama.293.9.1100"", ""10.1001/jama.1997.03540310051034"", ""10.1007/s10912-010-9123-3"", ""10.1089/107555303771952226"", ""10.1370/afm.1910"", ""10.1136/ewjm.173.4.244"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318221e615"", ""10.1007/BF02598163"", ""10.1017/S0265052500001515"", ""10.1007/s11019-007-9104-0"", ""10.1001/jama.2010.1455"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318209897f"", ""10.1001/jama.1997.03540280088045"", ""10.1097/00005650-199808000-00004"", ""10.1525/maq.1987.1.1.02a00020"", ""10.1162/jocn.2007.19.8.1354"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-136-5-200203050-00008"", ""10.1007/s11606-005-0102-8"", ""10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181ac4dfd"", ""10.1001/archinternmed.2012.3199"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8884.003.0023"", ""10.1001/archinte.1989.00390100028008"", ""10.1016/0277-9536(90)90188-X"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00443.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5833.001.0001"", ""10.1097/00005650-199312000-00002"", ""10.1001/jama.1997.03540320082047"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.04.020"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2710.2001.00363.x"", ""10.1038/sj.bjc.6600798"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02099.x""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

This paper distinguishes between variants of the moral encroachment thesis, pointing out how they address different problems, are motivated by different considerations, and are not all subject to the same objections. It also explores how the family of moral encroachment views compare to classical pragmatic encroachment accounts.","[{""name"": ""Renée Jorgensen Bolinger"", ""affiliation"": [""Princeton University""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198833314.003.0010"", ""10.2307/1229093"", ""10.1111/phis.12137"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1219-z"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1137-0"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184619"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-1809-5"", ""10.1111/nous.12008"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0182-y"", ""10.1093/arisoc/aov001"", ""10.1215/00318108-111-1-67"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199550623.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00372404"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1111/papq.12203"", ""10.1007/s11098-019-01359-0"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1081-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95993-1_11"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9801-7"", ""10.1007/s11098-007-9143-7"", ""10.5840/jphil20081051022"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-01965-1"", ""10.1093/pq/pqz006"", ""10.1080/05568640409485146"", ""10.1111/phc3.12415"", ""10.1111/phpr.12036"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184616"", ""10.1093/arisoc/aoy007"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198792154.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phis.12150"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00768.x"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184615"", ""10.5840/jphil20161131137"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00552.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198833314.003.0013"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9718-1"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184617"", ""10.1093/0199288038.001.0001"", ""10.1086/500337"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2005.00068.x"", ""10.1111/papq.12075"", ""10.1111/phpr.12673""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'General Health Professions', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In this paper, I argue that it is not and explain why it would be wrong. This is difficult to do because there is a powerful argument for thinking that weshouldconvict and punish defendants using statistical evidence. It looks as if the relevant cases are cases of decision under risk and it seems we know what we should do in such cases (i.e., maximize expected value). Given some standard assumptions about the values at stake, the case for convicting and punishing using statistical evidence seems solid. In trying to show where this argument goes wrong, I shall argue (against Lockeans, reliabilists, and others) that beliefs supported only by statistical evidence are epistemically defective and (against Enoch, Fisher, and Spectre) that these epistemic considerations should matter to the law. To solve the puzzle about the role of statistical evidence in the law, we need to revise some commonly held assumptions about epistemic value and defend the relevance of epistemology to this practical question.","[{""name"": ""Clayton Littlejohn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7551/mitpress/1554.001.0001"", ""10.1093/pq/pqu034"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199550005.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phis.12019"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00004.x"", ""10.1002/tht3.163"", ""10.11612/resphil.2015.92.2.4"", ""10.1093/0199263256.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00123"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2009.01326.x"", ""10.1111/nous.12099"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198722762.003.0003"", ""10.1111/papa.12000"", ""10.2307/3131397"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9198-8_2"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199673391.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118609033"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0231-6"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198735779.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-006-0012-2"", ""10.1086/392661"", ""10.2307/1288024"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139060097"", ""10.1111/phpe.12064"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6919.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2011.00843.x"", ""10.1215/00318108-109-3-373"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732716.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1352325208080117"", ""10.1007/BF00365003"", ""10.1007/BF00413765"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198755333.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400836918"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198719694.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00676.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0139-1"", ""10.2307/1191633"", ""10.2307/1339610"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199563500.003.0010"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511481505""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1215/00318108-8012843,PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW,0101 Philosophy,The Game of Belief,"It is plausible that there is a distinctively epistemic standard of correctness for belief. It is also plausible that there is a range of practical reasons bearing on belief. These theses are often thought to be in tension with each other. To resolve the tension, the authors draw on an analogy with a similar distinction between types of reasons for actions in the context of activities. This motivates a two-level account of the structure of normativity. The account relies upon a further distinction between normative reasons and authoritatively normative reasons. Only the latter constitutively play the functional role of explaining what state one just plain ought to be in. The authors conjecture that all and only practical reasons are authoritative. Hence, in one important sense, all reasons for belief are practical reasons. But this account also preserves the autonomy and importance of epistemic reasons.","[{""name"": ""Barry Maguire"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University""]}, {""name"": ""Jack Woods"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leeds""]}]","[""10.1093/analys/anx162"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184611"", ""10.1111/phib.12140"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511616037"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199654680.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118609088"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672165.001.0001"", ""10.1080/07481187.2018.1430084"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2012.00075.x"", ""10.4159/9780674029651"", ""10.1007/s11229-017-1521-x"", ""10.1093/mind/fzm511"", ""10.2307/2653823"", ""10.1093/0199241279.003.0006"", ""10.1111/phpr.12381"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9801-7"", ""10.1111/phc3.12412"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672134.003.0005"", ""10.1093/mind/fzt090"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674800.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jopp.12180"", ""10.1111/phc3.12542"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198841449.003.0010"", ""10.1007/s11098-019-01307-y"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487101"", ""10.1080/05568640409485146"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2003.tb00281.x"", ""10.1111/nous.12379"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198754282.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2184520"", ""10.1080/00048402.2016.1237532"", ""10.1093/mind/fzx011"", ""10.1086/668704"", ""10.4324/9780203579146"", ""10.1023/A:1013934513554"", ""10.1080/00048402.2018.1425306"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672134.003.0004"", ""10.1111/phpr.12024"", ""10.1086/381694"", ""10.2307/2182230"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199675500.003.0002"", ""10.1007/s11098-006-0007-3"", ""10.1111/phis.12061"", ""10.1111/phpr.12229"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1104-9"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00128.x"", ""10.1215/00318108-2010-017"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2006.454.x"", ""10.26556/y73fx144"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0640-x"", ""10.1007/s11098-008-9239-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511977206.003"", ""10.1086/500337"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0139-1"", ""10.1086/664749"", ""10.1093/pq/pqw026"", ""10.1111/ejop.12319"", ""10.1080/00455091.2018.1433795"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790587.003.0005"", ""10.1111/j.0309-7013.2004.00121.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Primary I-type granites represent fractionated liquids from intermediate magma systems of broadly andesitic composition. Fluid-fluxed melting of igneous rocks that resided in the continental crust generates secondary I-type granites. The former are directly related to subduction, with Cordilleran batholiths as the most characteristic examples. Experiments with lower crust granulite sources, in the presence of water, show that amphibole is formed by a water-fluxed peritectic rehydration melting reaction . Entrainment of only 10% of restites composed of amphibole, pyroxene, plagioclase and magnetite, is sufficient to account for discrepancies in aluminium saturation index and maficity in secondary I-type granites. Lower crust granulite xenoliths, attached to a sanukitoid containing 6 wt% water, have been used in two-layer capsules to test fluid-fluxed melting reactions as the origin of secondary I-type granites. It is proposed that sanukitoid magmas act as water donors that trigger extensive melting of the lower crust, giving rise to granodioritic liquids. Because primary granites are related to coeval subduction, and secondary ones are crustal melts from older subduction-related rocks, the distinction between both I-types is essential in tectonic reconstructions of ancient orogenic belts.","[{""name"": ""Antonio Castro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/286335a0"", ""10.1007/s00410-008-0351-8"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2003.08.003"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00929-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/egi084"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2014.07.004"", ""10.1093/petrology/egh019"", ""10.1130/G33455.1"", ""10.1086/314356"", ""10.1093/petrology/33.5.1039"", ""10.1007/BF00306477"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.S7-XV.3-4.209"", ""10.1144/sjg40010049"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2007.09.012"", ""10.1007/s004100050511"", ""10.1093/petrology/44.7.1309"", ""10.1093/petrology/egq019"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2011.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2011.03.011"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2013.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.08.011"", ""10.1017/S0263593300014139"", ""10.1046/j.1440-0952.2000.00766.x"", ""10.1017/S0263593300000973"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2012.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2011.07.004"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-05313-2"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2003.09.003"", ""10.1086/314363"", ""10.1139/e05-022"", ""10.1130/G39956.1"", ""10.1029/GL004i010p00465"", ""10.1093/petrology/egp010"", ""10.1093/petrology/egq078"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2018.09.004"", ""10.1007/s004100050244"", ""10.1130/G33371.1"", ""10.1144/jgs.158.3.521"", ""10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033"", ""10.1093/petrology/egl030"", ""10.1130/G20018.1"", ""10.1130/MEM28"", ""10.1007/s004100050276"", ""10.1038/nature05191"", ""10.1144/1467-787302-010"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2007.01.007"", ""10.1007/BF00372365"", ""10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00416-2"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2011.10.022"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-61049-3"", ""10.1007/s00531-016-1434-9"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.06.017"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(01)00165-2"", ""10.1007/s00410-005-0056-1"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2007.09.025"", ""10.2138/am-2015-5121"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511535581"", ""10.1007/BF00402106"", ""10.1093/petrology/egm084"", ""10.2138/am-2001-11-1208"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2004.04.055"", ""10.1007/BF00457293"", ""10.1007/s00410-016-1281-5"", ""10.1017/S1755691009016120"", ""10.1038/ngeo1781"", ""10.2475/ajs.274.4.321"", ""10.1007/s00410-008-0371-4"", ""10.1007/BF00287111"", ""10.1016/S1464-1895(01)00059-X"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.02.002"", ""10.1007/s00410-016-1278-0"", ""10.2475/ajs.283.10.993"", ""10.1007/s004100050495"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2008.11.007"", ""10.1144/gsjgs.156.4.0673"", ""10.1016/S0024-4937(98)00080-2"", ""10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.06.024"", ""10.1029/94JB03376"", ""10.1093/petrology/egh071"", ""10.1086/623788"", ""10.1007/BF00384745"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2014.02.006"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00481-2"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-5832-9"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.044"", ""10.1007/s00410-013-0854-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/36.4.891"", ""10.1007/s00410-005-0677-4"", ""10.1080/11035895709447195"", ""10.1038/nature08510"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.12.017"", ""10.1130/B32028.1"", ""10.1086/662033"", ""10.1029/95RG01302"", ""10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/03016-4"", ""10.1038/310222a0"", ""10.1007/BF00283225"", ""10.1007/s00410-004-0632-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/43.2.291"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1988.038.01.23"", ""10.1046/j.1440-0952.2001.00880.x"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0078:ROSEIT>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1007/BF00307341"", ""10.1139/e89-145"", ""10.1093/petrology/egy017"", ""10.1093/petrology/37.6.1579"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2014.08.021"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(77)90003-8"", ""10.2138/am.2010.3371"", ""10.1093/petrology/27.5.1095"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2005.12.001""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

In order to capture commercial revenue-generating opportunities, traditional nonprofit organizations need to deliberately transform themselves into social enterprises. Through the theoretical lens of institutional entrepreneurship, we explore the institutional work that supports this transformation by analyzing field interviews with 64 institutional entrepreneurs from UK-based social enterprises. We find that the route to incorporate commercial processes and convert traditional nonprofit organizations into social enterprises requires six distinct kinds of institutional work at three different domains; these are—“engaging commercial revenue strategies”, “creating a professionalized organizational form”, and “legitimating a socio-commercial business model”. In elaborating on social entrepreneurship research and practice, we offer a comprehensive framework delineating the key practices contributing to the transformation from traditional nonprofit organizations to social enterprises. This extends our understanding of theex-antestrategy of incorporating commercial processes within social organizations. Furthermore, the identification of these practices also offers an important tool for scholars in this field to examine the connection (or disconnection) of each practice with different ethical concerns of social entrepreneurship in greater depth.","[{""name"": ""Wai Wai Ko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gordon Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09585190600964350"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.04.001"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2445-8"", ""10.1177/0899764012454685"", ""10.1177/0899764012450777"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2446-7"", ""10.1080/08985626.2011.577242"", ""10.5465/amj.2013.0903"", ""10.1177/0899764015583313"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2019.1006.1002"", ""10.1080/0267257X.2003.9728235"", ""10.1080/19420676.2016.1166147"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3794-5"", ""10.1177/089976409202100406"", ""10.1007/s11266-11019-00188-11263"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2439-6"", ""10.1007/s11266-006-9010-8"", ""10.1177/0899764009351591"", ""10.1177/0001839216636103"", ""10.1177/0899764004263522"", ""10.1007/s11266-017-9884-7"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00430.x"", ""10.1177/0899764018757024"", ""10.1177/0899764099283002"", ""10.2307/3069292"", ""10.1177/0170840613492071"", ""10.1177/1094428112452151"", ""10.4135/9781849209236"", ""10.1287/orsc.1090.0453"", ""10.5465/amj.2006.20785498"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00730.x"", ""10.4135/9781446280669.n11"", ""10.1023/A:1011238719394"", ""10.1080/09585192.2017.1328610"", ""10.1177/0170840617717097"", ""10.2189/asqu.2009.54.2.268"", ""10.1177/0275074010387293"", ""10.1002/sej.1198"", ""10.1177/1350508404046457"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-3012-7"", ""10.1287/orsc.10.5.535"", ""10.1108/EJM-03-2012-0142"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4047-3"", ""10.1111/etap.12041"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0679-7"", ""10.1177/0899764011411722"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12040"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3231-6"", ""10.2307/20159610"", ""10.1177/0899764014561796"", ""10.1177/0170840605056395"", ""10.5465/amr.2015.0303"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00397.x"", ""10.5465/amj.2011.0405"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.10.065"", ""10.1177/1476127007079956"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1438504"", ""10.1080/02681102.2014.992002"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2353-y"", ""10.1016/S0191-3085(00)22007-8"", ""10.1002/hrm.22002"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2012.02.012"", ""10.1177/0899764013508606"", ""10.1177/1350508412464894"", ""10.1177/0899764013485159"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4046-4"", ""10.1177/0899764009350370"", ""10.1002/smj.640"", ""10.1007/s11266-006-9012-6"", ""10.1287/orsc.1090.0522"", ""10.1007/s10796-017-9770-2"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2008.00795.x"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2017.08.003"", ""10.1509/jppm.11.034"", ""10.5465/amr.2013.0506"", ""10.1111/beer.12118"", ""10.2189/asqu.2010.55.2.189""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Distinguishing ectogestation and ectogenesis using the metaphysics of pregnancy,"AbstractA 2017 Nature report was widely touted as hailing the arrival of the artificial womb. But the scientists involved claim their technology is merely an improvement in neonatal care. This raises an under‐considered question: what differentiates neonatal incubation from artificial womb technology? Considering the nature of gestation—or metaphysics of pregnancy—(a) identifies more profound differences between fetuses and neonates/babies than their location (in or outside the maternal body) alone: fetuses and neonates have different physiological and physical characteristics; (b) characterizes birth as a physiological, mereological and topological transformation as well as a (morally relevant) change of location; and (c) delivers a clear distinction between neonatal incubation and ectogestation: the former supports neonatal physiology; the latter preserves fetal physiology. This allows a detailed conceptual classification of ectogenetive and ectogestative technologies according to which the 2017 system is not just improved neonatal incubation, but genuine ectogestation. But it is not an artificial womb, which is a term that is better put to rest. The analysis reveals that any ethical discussion involving ectogestation must always involve considerations of possible risks to the mother as well as her autonomy and rights. It also adds a third and potentially important dimension to debates in reproductive ethics: the physiological transition from fetus/gestateling to baby/neonate.","[{""name"": ""Elselijn Kingma"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Humanities University of Southampton Southampton United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland""]}, {""name"": ""Suki Finn"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Humanities University of Southampton Southampton United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland""]}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7036), ('1001 基础医学', 0.6984)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"
10.1007/s11229-019-02327-1,SYNTHESE,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Joint attention to mental content and the social origin of reasoning,"AbstractGrowing evidence indicates that our higher rational capacities depend on social interaction—that only through engaging with others do we acquire the ability to evaluate beliefs as true or false, or to reflect on and evaluate the reasons that support our beliefs. Up to now, however, we have had little understanding of how this works. Here we argue that a uniquely human socio-linguistic phenomenon which we call ‘joint attention to mental content’ (JAM) plays a key role. JAM is the ability to focus together in conversation on the content of our mental states, such as beliefs and reasons. In such conversations it can be made clear that our attitudes to beliefs or reasons may conflict—that what I think is true, you might think is false, or that what I think is a good reason for believing something, you might think is a bad reason. We argue that through JAM, children discover that mental contents can be evaluated under various attitudes, and that this discovery transforms their mind-reading and reasoning abilities.","[{""name"": ""Cathal O’Madagain"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Tomasello"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780195080056.001.0001"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0173793"", ""10.1111/mila.12036"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5834.1998.tb02774.x"", ""10.1111/mila.12014"", ""10.1111/infa.12202"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511597909.011"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.1982.tb01546.x"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00076664"", ""10.1515/COG.2006.015"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199245635.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9946-z"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01120.x"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(83)90005-1"", ""10.1093/0198236360.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1130386"", ""10.1111/1467-7687.00289"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511597985.014"", ""10.1111/mila.12114"", ""10.1126/science.1243091"", ""10.1007/BF03173132"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01742.x"", ""10.1016/j.jecp.2017.09.018"", ""10.1126/science.aaf8110"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.26.3.398"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(94)90029-9"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00597"", ""10.1017/S0140525X10000968"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01018.x"", ""10.1207/s15327647jcd0703_9"", ""10.1037/a0028633"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.43.2.309"", ""10.1080/135467898394148"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00518.x"", ""10.1126/science.1107621"", ""10.1126/science.1201216"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2012.08.004"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.t01-1-00529"", ""10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb01303.x"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00438"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02377.x"", ""10.1016/j.cogdev.2006.08.002"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.33.1.12"", ""10.1007/s13164-015-0290-z"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01324.x"", ""10.1111/1467-7687.00048"", ""10.1037/a0013774"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01944.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01943.x"", ""10.1016/0388-0001(88)90006-X"", ""10.1017/S0140525X0003123X"", ""10.1111/1468-0017.00217"", ""10.1126/science.1121448"", ""10.1016/S0361-476X(03)00024-9"", ""10.1037/a0032419"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199334919.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2016.10.021"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00437""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Language and Linguistics', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1007/s10551-022-05193-z,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Achieving Sustainable Development Goals Through Collaborative Innovation: Evidence from Four European Initiatives,"AbstractThe role to be played by multi-stakeholder partnerships in addressing the ‘wicked problems’ of sustainable development is made explicit by the seventeenth Sustainable Development Goal. But how do these partnerships really work? Based on the analysis of four sustainability-oriented innovation initiatives implemented in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and France, this study explores the roles and mechanisms that collaborating actors may enact to facilitate the pursuit of sustainable development, with a particular focus on non-profit organizations. The results suggest that collaborative innovations for sustainability contribute simultaneously to the fulfilment of different Sustainable Development Goals, reaching beyond their original intent, and that the value being created has the potential to reinforce such roles and mechanisms. These partnerships are prompted and managed by non-profit organizations that act as metagovernors of collaborative innovation processes as they play the roles of cultural spreaders, enablers, relational brokers, service provides, and influencers. These findings will help policy-makers and practitioners in the public and non-profit sector to identify and utilize emerging opportunities for value creation through collaborative innovation, and to better design existing and prospective collaborative efforts aimed at sustainable objectives, thereby supporting progress towards the implementation of Agenda 2030.","[{""name"": ""Laura Mariani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benedetta Trivellato"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mattia Martini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elisabetta Marafioti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0899764099284003"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.08.013"", ""10.1007/s11266-012-9309-6"", ""10.1111/puar.12238"", ""10.1111/puar.12432"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.02.014"", ""10.1080/14719037.2021.1960736"", ""10.1007/s10997-020-09505-1"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.01.003"", ""10.1504/IJGEI.2006.008994"", ""10.1300/J054v19n02_02"", ""10.2307/258557"", ""10.1002/tqem.3310080106"", ""10.1093/jopart/mur011"", ""10.1177/0899764016661247"", ""10.4337/9781845424596"", ""10.1177/0891242416674808"", ""10.1111/puar.12136"", ""10.58235/sjpa.v19i4.14992"", ""10.1007/s12208-008-0001-x"", ""10.4135/9781446221600"", ""10.1177/002224299305700304"", ""10.1080/09537329808524310"", ""10.4324/9780203643457"", ""10.1177/002224296903300103"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-3012-7"", ""10.1002/nvsm.151"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2097.003.0013"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3885-3"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00664.x"", ""10.1177/002224299005400403"", ""10.1080/14719030600853022"", ""10.2307/2393698"", ""10.1108/14636680110803003"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60685-0"", ""10.1504/IJEV.2018.092709"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2006.01.003"", ""10.1080/09644010701419121"", ""10.1068/c10222"", ""10.1111/puar.13254"", ""10.1177/002224299405800104"", ""10.1177/0095399711418768"", ""10.1177/0275074016643181"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2005.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.12.025"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1430248"", ""10.1080/14719037.2016.1200662"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316105337"", ""10.1080/14494035.2020.1794749"", ""10.1111/padm.12559"", ""10.1177/0275074020939263"", ""10.1080/15693430701526336"", ""10.1007/s11266-020-00208-7"", ""10.1177/0899764011409757"", ""10.1002/sd.367"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04548-8""]","['Environmental Science', 'Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Public Administration', 'Management of Technology and Innovation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)]]"

Tectonism started with the formation of a Tonian passive margin on a Baltica-derived ribbon dispersed into the Mirovoi Ocean. Obduction of an oceanic terrane onto the ribbon produced olistostromes, deformation and metamorphism before 750 Ma. Obduction was followed by a Tonian (750–730 Ma) arc on the created composite crust. A pause in magmatism between 730 and 700 Ma is the next event. Subsequently, a Cyrogenian (700–670 Ma) arc was formed, which may have collided with Baltica or another buoyant element nearby. Thereafter, a long-lasting (640–565 Ma) continental arc was erected which, combined with the late Ediacaran–Early Paleozoic sedimentary cover, represents the hallmark of West Avalonia. A Caribbean-style incursion of the Ediacaran arc into the widening Tornquist gap between Amazonia and Baltica led to a diachronous collision with the Ganderian arc. Strike-slip slivering produced a complex transfer of terranes to both: Carolinia and smaller terranes to Ganderia, and East Avalonia to West Avalonia. The Rheic Ocean opened diachronously at c. 500 Ma, following a plate reorganization and re-establishment of an oblique subduction zone beneath Amazonia. As a result, Avalonia and Ganderia became progressively separated and dispersed into the Iapetus Ocean.","[{""name"": ""C.

10.1093/mind/fzz054,MIND,0101 Philosophy,Autonomy and Aesthetic Engagement,"Abstract There seems to be a deep tension between two aspects of aesthetic appreciation. On the one hand, we care about getting things right. Our attempts at aesthetic judgments aim at correctness. On the other hand, we demand autonomy. We want appreciators to arrive at their aesthetic judgments through their own cognitive efforts, rather than through deferring to experts. These two demands seem to be in tension; after all, if we want to get the right judgments, we should defer to the judgments of experts. How can we resolve this tension? The best explanation, I suggest, is that aesthetic appreciation is something like a game. When we play a game, we try to win. But often, winning isn’t the point; playing is. Aesthetic appreciation involves the same flipped motivational structure: we aim at the goal of correctness, but having correct judgments isn’t the point. The point is the engaged process of interpreting, investigating, and exploring the aesthetic object. When one defers to aesthetic testimony, then, one makes the same mistake as when one looks up the answer to a puzzle, rather than solving it for oneself. The shortcut defeats the whole point. This suggests a new account of aesthetic value: the engagement account. The primary value of the activity of aesthetic appreciation lies in the process of trying to generate correct judgments, and not in having correct judgments.","[{""name"": ""C Thi Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": [""Utah Valley University""]}]","[""10.1093/bjaesthetics/43.4.386"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayw088"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.12063"", ""10.1007/s11098-004-7825-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199593248.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp052"", ""10.5840/jphil201811538"", ""10.2307/2026523"", ""10.2307/2027007"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00134"", ""10.5840/jphil201110838"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2012.00873.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2006.00143.x"", ""10.2307/2564672"", ""10.1080/00048400701343010"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayw074"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays003"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00316.x"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/43.3.260"", ""10.1093/0199277346.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv032"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayl019"", ""10.5840/jphil201110837"", ""10.1017/epi.2016.4"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2004.tb00384.x"", ""10.1111/j.0066-7373.2004.00087.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658442.001.0001"", ""10.5840/philtopics201038216"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayw089"", ""10.1215/00318108-7697863"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190052089.001.0001"", ""10.1023/A:1011843723057"", ""10.1007/s10892-010-9089-4"", ""10.1111/phpr.12467"", ""10.1080/00948705.1977.10654132"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2006.00144.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/44.3.277"", ""10.1093/pq/pqz004"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.3.0499"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu099"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199936472.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

10.1186/s41073-019-0088-0,RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND PEER REVIEW,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0101 Philosophy,The role of geographic bias in knowledge diffusion: a systematic review and narrative synthesis,"Abstract Background Descriptive studies examining publication rates and citation counts demonstrate a geographic skew toward high-income countries (HIC), and research from low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) is generally underrepresented. This has been suggested to be due in part to reviewers’ and editors’ preference toward HIC sources; however, in the absence of controlled studies, it is impossible to assert whether there is bias or whether variations in the quality or relevance of the articles being reviewed explains the geographic divide. This study synthesizes the evidence from randomized and controlled studies that explore geographic bias in the peer review process. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify research studies that explicitly explore the role of geographic bias in the assessment of the quality of research articles. Only randomized and controlled studies were included in the review. Five databases were searched to locate relevant articles. A narrative synthesis of included articles was performed to identify common findings. Results The systematic literature search yielded 3501 titles from which 12 full texts were reviewed, and a further eight were identified through searching reference lists of the full texts. Of these articles, only three were randomized and controlled studies that examined variants of geographic bias. One study found that abstracts attributed to HIC sources elicited a higher review score regarding relevance of the research and likelihood to recommend the research to a colleague, than did abstracts attributed to LIC sources. Another study found that the predicted odds of acceptance for a submission to a computer science conference were statistically significantly higher for submissions from a “Top University.” Two of the studies showed the presence of geographic bias between articles from “high” or “low” prestige institutions. Conclusions Two of the three included studies identified that geographic bias in some form was impacting on peer review; however, further robust, experimental evidence is needed to adequately inform practice surrounding this topic. Reviewers and researchers should nonetheless be aware of whether author and institutional characteristics are interfering in their judgement of research.","[{""name"": ""Mark Skopec"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hamdi Issa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julie Reed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Harris"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1001/jama.280.3.246"", ""10.1016/S0008-6363(02)00712-5"", ""10.1001/jama.295.14.1675"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0191901"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2011.05.005"", ""10.1038/srep00902"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2014.04.008"", ""10.1511/2000.41.873"", ""10.1136/bmj.38069.518137.F6"", ""10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.09.004"", ""10.1073/pnas.1418218112"", ""10.1002/asi.23318"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.10.012"", ""10.1016/S0167-4870(99)00023-9"", ""10.1016/j.ibusrev.2003.05.004"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490824"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490539"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00011183"", ""10.1186/s12992-017-0304-y"", ""10.1186/s41073-018-0049-z"", ""10.1590/S0034-89102006000400006"", ""10.1136/emj.20.2.164"", ""10.1177/1049732312452938"", ""10.1186/s12913-014-0579-0"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0773"", ""10.1073/pnas.1707323114"", ""10.1016/S0895-4356(99)00236-X"", ""10.1002/14651858.MR000016.pub3"", ""10.1177/0002764208318939"", ""10.1136/bmj.c6424"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0182513""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The competition is an annual comparative evaluation of fully automatic software verifiers for C and Java programs. The objective is to provide an overview of the state of the art in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of software verification, establish standards, provide a platform for exchange to developers of such tools, educate PhD students on reproducibility approaches and benchmarking, and provide computing resources to developers that do not have access to compute clusters. The competition consisted of 15 648 verification tasks for C programs and 586 verification tasks for Java programs. Each verification task consisted of a program and a property (reachability, memory safety, overflows, termination). The new category on data-race detection was introduced as demonstration category. SV-COMP 2022 had 47 participating verification systems from 33 teams from 11 countries.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_27"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00121"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_25"", ""10.1134/S0361768820080022"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_33"", ""10.1609/aaai.v31i1.10641"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_38"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_43"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-71500-7_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_18"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5831008"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5831003"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5838498"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5959149"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_22"", ""10.1145/2049697.2049700"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_22"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985839"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33826-7_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48869-1_5"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00619-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27940-9_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15"", ""10.1007/s10009-015-0407-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_7"", ""10.1007/s10817-019-09535-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89963-3_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49052-6"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00617-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_29"", ""10.1145/3478536"", ""10.1145/3332466.3374529"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02508-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02508-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_22"", ""10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774672"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_44"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_24"", ""10.1145/1889997.1890000"", ""10.1007/s10515-013-0122-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_7"", ""10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_28"", ""10.5281/zenodo.6147218"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_27"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409734"", ""10.1007/s10817-016-9389-x"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102257"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_23"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970337"", ""10.15514/ISPRAS-2017-29(4)-13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_3"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5720267"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-09284-3_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_36"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_34""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1111/phpr.12701,PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH,0101 Philosophy,Oppressive Things,"AbstractIn analyzing oppressive systems like racism, social theorists have articulated accounts of the dynamic interaction and mutual dependence betweenpsychologicalcomponents, such as individuals’ patterns of thought and action, andsocialcomponents, such as formal institutions and informal interactions. We argue for the further inclusion ofphysicalcomponents, such as material artifacts and spatial environments. Drawing on socially situated and ecologically embedded approaches in the cognitive sciences, we argue that physical components of racism are not only shaped by, but also shape psychological and social components of racism. Indeed, while our initial focus is on racism and racist things, we contend that our framework is also applicable to other oppressive systems, including sexism, classism, and ableism. This is because racist things are part of a broader class ofoppressive things,which are material artifacts and spatial environments that are in congruence with an oppressive system.","[{""name"": ""Shen‐yi Liao"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Puget Sound""]}, {""name"": ""Bryce Huebner"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University""]}]","[""10.1215/9780822388074"", ""10.1177/0191453710375589"", ""10.1017/apa.2018.27"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9833.1992.tb00489.x"", ""10.1177/10442073050160010801"", ""10.5772/20200"", ""10.1038/s41562-018-0384-6"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732587.001.0001"", ""10.5840/swjphil197910121"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.070"", ""10.2307/2657316"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198766179.001.0001"", ""10.1353/ken.2017.0014"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2010.04.055"", ""10.1075/pc.4.1.09cla"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195333213.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8284.00096"", ""10.1098/rsif.2017.0685"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11805.001.0001"", ""10.1177/2053951716648346"", ""10.1111/mila.12166"", ""10.2307/2108038"", ""10.1177/0048393108328149"", ""10.4324/9780203076828"", ""10.1037/pspa0000160"", ""10.1007/s10506-017-9212-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9833.1996.tb00225.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16161-4"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16638-1"", ""10.1177/030639689904000212"", ""10.1111/0033-0124.00310"", ""10.1086/648588"", ""10.18061/dsq.v33i4.3871"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199892631.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00455091.2015.1019176"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0434-5"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11647.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199926275.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0003"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1881.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2004.06.008"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9599-8"", ""10.1111/hypa.12483"", ""10.1093/mind/fzaa011"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02696-y"", ""10.1353/lan.2005.0071"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(94)00017-U"", ""10.1007/s00146-010-0272-8"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2008.11.027"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1869-11.2011"", ""10.1007/s10682-016-9821-z"", ""10.1037/a0036260"", ""10.1037/xge0000179"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9476.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-18446-8_9"", ""10.1023/A:1022874712554"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00692"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479833641.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt32bbp0"", ""10.1515/9781400847266"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01222.x"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-51667-1.50037-9"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.003"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2016.07.002"", ""10.22230/cjc.2009v34n1a2196"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195379457.001.0001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01166"", ""10.1177/0963721417724239"", ""10.2478/disp-2018-0014"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2018.08.008"", ""10.1111/0047-2786.00150"", ""10.1007/s11098-019-01288-y"", ""10.1177/0162243919862862"", ""10.1007/s11097-010-9174-y"", ""10.1007/s11097-010-9178-7"", ""10.1353/book5200"", ""10.1080/1090377032000063333"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262014038.003.0009"", ""10.1007/s10708-013-9491-0"", ""10.22439/fs.v0i19.4822"", ""10.4324/9781315212043-17"", ""10.1080/00048402.2013.868008"", ""10.5325/j.ctv14gp4w7"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226852904.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0956797619844270"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-1952-9"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195392388.003.0002"", ""10.5206/fpq/2018.1.4""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

I argue that the language of ownership acts as a metaphor and reflects multiple concerns about current data use and the disenfranchisement of citizens and collectives in the existing data ecosystem. But exactly which core interests and concerns ownership claims allude to remains opaque. Too often, we jump straight from ‘ownership’ to ‘private property’ and conclude ‘the data belongs to the patient’. I will argue here that private property is only one type of relevant relationship between people, communities and data. There are several reasons to doubt that conceptualising data as private property presents a compelling response to concerns about clinical data ownership. In particular I argue that clinical data are co-constructed, so a property account would fail to confer exclusive rights to the patient. A non-property account of ownership acknowledges that the data are ‘about the patient’, and therefore the patient has relevant interests, without jumping to the conclusion that the data ‘belongs to the patient’. On this broader account of ownership, the relevant harm is the severing of the connection between the patient and their data, and the solution is to re-engage and re-connect patients to the data research enterprise.","[{""name"": ""Angela Ballantyne"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Primary Health Care and General Practice and the Bioethics Center, Otago University, Wellington, New Zealand""]}]","[""10.1080/20502877.2017.1314893"", ""10.1186/s40504-017-0060-z"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2915518"", ""10.23943/9781400889457"", ""10.1215/9780822377009"", ""10.1146/annurev-genom-082509-141811"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1005203"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9652-2"", ""10.1038/ejhg.2014.71"", ""10.22459/CAEPR38.11.2016"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2016.00007"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62267-4""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Medicine']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Physiology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"
10.1111/nous.12302,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,"Conceptual Innovation, Function First","AbstractCan we engineer conceptual change? While a positive answer to this question would be exciting news for philosophy, there has been a growing number of pessimistic voices in the literature. This paper resists this trend. Its central aim is to argue not only that conceptual engineering is possible but also that it is not even distinctively hard. In order to achieve this, we will develop a novel approach to conceptual engineering that has two key components. First, it proposes a reorientation of the conceptual engineering project away from fixing conceptual defects and towards bringing about conceptual innovation. Second, it offers a new account of when conceptual engineering is successful in terms of etiological functions. We then turn to the reasons that have motivated various forms of pessimism about conceptual engineering and show that, on our novel approach, none of them stands up to scrutiny.","[{""name"": ""Mona Simion"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Glasgow""]}, {""name"": ""Christoph Kelp"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Glasgow""]}]","[""10.1007/s11229-009-9623-8"", ""10.1023/A:1006559512367"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.1979.tb00374.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12086"", ""10.1111/phc3.12085"", ""10.1215/00318108-1334478"", ""10.1111/1467-8284.00096"", ""10.1215/00318108-2683531"", ""10.1057/9781137344557_15"", ""10.2307/2216063"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00815.x"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00201"", ""10.1111/nous.12153"", ""10.5840/jphil201711426"", ""10.5840/jphil2017114828"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4124.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.tree.2017.12.006"", ""10.1086/289610"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198842811.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199653850.001.0001"", ""10.1017/epi.2015.56"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2017.1392894"", ""10.1111/phis.12152"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2018.1562373"", ""10.2307/2215895"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0021"", ""10.1007/s10892-008-9038-7"", ""10.2307/2183766""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1111/nous.12328,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,Addiction and the self,"AbstractAddiction is standardly characterized as a neurobiological disease of compulsion. Against this characterization, I argue that many cases of addiction cannot be explained without recognizing the value of drugs to those who are addicted; and I explore in detail an insufficiently recognized source of value, namely, a sense of self and social identity as an addict. For people who lack a genuine alternative sense of self and social identity, recovery represents an existential threat. Given that an addict identification carries expectations of continued consumption despite negative consequences, there is therefore a parsimonious explanation of why people who identify as addicts continue to use drugs despite these consequences: they self‐identify as addicts and that is what addicts are supposed to do. I conclude by considering how it is nonetheless possible to overcome addiction despite this identity, in part by imagining and enacting a new one. Importantly, this possibility requires the availability of social support and material resources that are all too frequently absent in the lives of those who struggle with addiction.","[{""name"": ""Hanna Pickard"", ""affiliation"": [""Johns Hopkins University""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315689197-4"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.conb.2013.01.028"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.08.015"", ""10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596"", ""10.1016/S0893-133X(96)00164-9"", ""10.1177/0022167817706884"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2017.1323463"", ""10.3109/16066359.2015.1075980"", ""10.1046/j.1360-0443.2001.961736.x"", ""10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.06.013"", ""10.1177/0269881114565144"", ""10.1038/s41386-019-0594-2"", ""10.1007/s00213-013-3120-y"", ""10.1525/9780520943315"", ""10.1037/a0032480"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190639488.001.0001"", ""10.1162/152651602317533686"", ""10.1001/archpsyc.64.5.566"", ""10.1162/152651602317533695"", ""10.1016/S0165-0173(01)00088-1"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033457"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198727224.003.0004"", ""10.4324/9781315689197-8"", ""10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.10.023"", ""10.1016/j.abrep.2016.04.002"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.08.080182.000245"", ""10.1101/050401"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524021.003.0012"", ""10.1097/00008877-200002000-00010"", ""10.1177/0963721415588082"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjf9xd9"", ""10.1037/e550762010-001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-97529-0_18"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199862580.003.0012"", ""10.1177/0269881114548296"", ""10.1016/0277-9536(94)90405-7"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2013.01.005"", ""10.1111/phib.12063"", ""10.5840/jphil2017114828"", ""10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.01.026"", ""10.1037/a0027640"", ""10.1177/1049732312450325"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198714040.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X11000057"", ""10.1177/0269881118780612"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717959.001.0001"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09121743"", ""10.1111/phpr.12025"", ""10.1016/j.ijlp.2015.04.008"", ""10.1111/mila.12106"", ""10.1007/s12152-016-9295-2"", ""10.4324/9781315689197-2"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199862580.003.0009"", ""10.1007/s00213-009-1655-8"", ""10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.02.004"", ""10.1001/jama.1990.03450190043026"", ""10.1016/0165-0173(93)90013-P"", ""10.4324/9781315689197-29"", ""10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.12.024"", ""10.1124/pr.54.1.1"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2013.07.007"", ""10.1037/tps0000061"", ""10.1001/archpsyc.63.3.324"", ""10.3109/10826080902961179"", ""10.5840/jphil20181151133"", ""10.1177/1745691616689495"", ""10.1146/annurev.ps.33.020182.000245"", ""10.1177/026988119801200104"", ""10.1016/j.addbeh.2015.01.026"", ""10.1080/10002002058538724"", ""10.1038/s41593-018-0246-6"", ""10.4324/9781315689197-28"", ""10.1056/NEJMra1511480"", ""10.1097/00008877-199905000-00004"", ""10.1097/00008877-199712000-00009"", ""10.1093/ntr/nts268"", ""10.4324/9781315689197-37"", ""10.1176/ajp.133.1.37""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

But there is an emerging consensus that questionable research practices are more harmful due to their high prevalence. QRPs have in common that they can help to make study results more exciting, more positive and more statistically significant. That makes them tempting to engage in. Research institutions have the duty to empower their research staff to steer away from QRPs and to explain how they realize that in a Research Integrity Promotion Plan. Avoiding perverse incentives in assessing researchers for career advancement is an important element in that plan. Research institutions, funding agencies and journals should make their research integrity policies as evidence-based as possible. The dilemmas and distractions researchers face are real and universal. We owe it to society to collaborate and to do our utmost best to prevent QRPs and to foster research integrity.","[{""name"": ""Lex Bouter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1556264618813737"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2018.10.025"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2017.12.016"", ""10.1186/s41073-016-0024-5"", ""10.1007/s11948-018-0034-4"", ""10.1186/s41073-019-0081-7"", ""10.1038/520429a"", ""10.1177/0049124104268664"", ""10.1093/ilar/ilz015"", ""10.1002/14651858.mr000038.pub2"", ""10.1126/science.aap9097"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.2004089"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01832""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Safety Research']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

By analyzing 59 empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals, we unraveled how the concept of spiritual leadership was defined, developed, utilized and validated by researchers across disciplines. This article also provides some directions for future research by highlighting knowledge gaps and critical issues identified in previous studies, such as definitions, methodologies, construct measurements, research contexts, and nomological relationships of spiritual leadership.

10.1007/s10551-022-05055-8,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,From Reality to World. A Critical Perspective on AI Fairness,"AbstractFairness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) decisions has become a big challenge for governments, companies, and societies. We offer a theoretical contribution to consider AI ethics outside of high-level and top-down approaches, based on the distinction between “reality” and “world” from Luc Boltanski. To do so, we provide a new perspective on the debate on AI fairness and show that criticism of ML unfairness is “realist”, in other words, grounded in an already institutedrealitybased on demographic categories produced by institutions. Second, we show that the limits of “realist” fairness corrections lead to the elaboration of “radical responses” to fairness, that is, responses that radically change the format of data. Third, we show that fairness correction is shifting to a “domination regime” that absorbs criticism, and we provide some theoretical and practical avenues for further development in AI ethics. Using an ad hoccritical spacestabilized by reality tests alongside the algorithm, we build a shared responsibility model which is compatible with the radical response to fairness issues. Finally, this paper shows the fundamental contribution of pragmatic sociology theories, insofar as they afford a social and political perspective on AI ethics by giving an active role to material actors such as database formats on ethical debates. In a context where data are increasingly numerous, granular, and behavioral, it is essential to renew our conception of AI ethics on algorithms in order to establish new models of responsibility for companies that take into account changes in the computing paradigm.","[{""name"": ""Jean-Marie John-Mathews"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominique Cardon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christine Balagué"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/202114"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226336763.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1461444816676645"", ""10.1287/opre.2019.1902"", ""10.1177/053901883022004003"", ""10.1186/s40537-015-0036-x"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375823"", ""10.3917/res.211.0173"", ""10.17705/1jais.00214"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2019.04.007"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2680-7"", ""10.1038/538311a"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3112-z"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375828"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00354-x"", ""10.1111/beer.12240"", ""10.1080/07421222.2016.1267526"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2019.258"", ""10.1111/j.1467-985X.1997.00078.x"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1573912"", ""10.1111/bioe.12419"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12517.001.0001"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121209"", ""10.1145/2702123.2702520"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2020.113302"", ""10.1145/3219617.3219634"", ""10.1016/S0933-3657(01)00077-X"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2018.3093"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199256044.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0960085X.2018.1473932"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04204-w"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98131-4_9"", ""10.1287/mnsc.16.8.B466"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10302.001.0001"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287564"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3921-3"", ""10.17705/2msqe.00012"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000043492.42150.b6"", ""10.1145/3457607"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04207-7"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0114-4"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00165-5"", ""10.1126/science.aax2342"", ""10.23915/distill.00024.001"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2009.191"", ""10.3917/res.177.0163"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375819"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372849"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287598"", ""10.1145/3219819.3220046"", ""10.1145/2460276.2460278"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375810""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Delegating tasks to so-called automated decision-making systems (ADMS) can improve efficiency and enable new solutions. However, these benefits are coupled with ethical challenges. For example, ADMS may produce discriminatory outcomes, violate individual privacy, and undermine human self-determination. New governance mechanisms are thus needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical, while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of automation. In this article, we consider the feasibility and efficacy of ethics-based auditing (EBA) as a governance mechanism that allows organisations to validate claims made about their ADMS. Building on previous work, we define EBA as a structured process whereby an entity’s present or past behaviour is assessed for consistency with relevant principles or norms. We then offer three contributions to the existing literature. First, we provide a theoretical explanation of how EBA can contribute to good governance by promoting procedural regularity and transparency. Second, we propose seven criteria for how to design and implement EBA procedures successfully. Third, we identify and discuss the conceptual, technical, social, economic, organisational, and institutional constraints associated with EBA. We conclude that EBA should be considered an integral component of multifaced approaches to managing the ethical risks posed by ADMS.","[{""name"": ""Jakob Mökander"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jessica Morley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mariarosaria Taddeo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luciano Floridi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.11586/2020013"", ""10.1177/2053951720949566"", ""10.1177/1461444816676645"", ""10.1007/s00146-018-0848-2"", ""10.1016/j.inffus.2019.12.012"", ""10.1147/JRD.2019.2942287"", ""10.1109/MSP.2018.2701147"", ""10.1007/s11023-017-9449-y"", ""10.1177/2053951720983865"", ""10.1109/MC.2017.154"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986948"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0080"", ""10.1145/3278721.3278740"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00146-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91575-3"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3198732"", ""10.2514/6.2004-6313"", ""10.1176/ajp.134.8.aj1348938"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0337-z"", ""10.1007/s10515-014-0168-9"", ""10.3390/systems2030273"", ""10.1080/21670811.2014.976411"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2017/655"", ""10.1177/1088868318811759"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/851"", ""10.1145/3278721.3278731"", ""10.1007/s10676-016-9400-6"", ""10.1007/s11948-020-00272-8"", ""10.1145/2593812.2593816"", ""10.1007/BF00872018"", ""10.1007/s11948-020-00276-4"", ""10.1007/s11948-012-9413-4"", ""10.1098/rsta.2016.0112"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9733-2"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0291-1"", ""10.1007/s11023-017-9438-1"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0303-9"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00354-x"", ""10.1162/99608f92.8cd550d1"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09539-2"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105586"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09517-8"", ""10.1111/j.1751-1097.1994.tb09662.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12524-0_2"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1007/s11948-020-00241-1"", ""10.1080/13600869.2017.1298499"", ""10.1007/s43681-021-00039-2"", ""10.1145/3290607.3310433"", ""10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2017.43"", ""10.2861/59990"", ""10.1109/MSP.2017.16"", ""10.1111/rego.12369"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0084"", ""10.1002/ejoc.201200111"", ""10.1007/s43681-020-00013-4"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0279-x"", ""10.1145/3317287.3328534"", ""10.1007/s10676-020-09564-w"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2019.09.009"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287596"", ""10.1007/s11023-021-09557-8"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00165-5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198296034.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9430-8"", ""10.1145/3306618.3314244"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372873"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372849"", ""10.1109/DEXA.2009.55"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375812"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-35333-9_26"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00133-z"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198713395.001.0001"", ""10.1098/rsta.2016.0113"", ""10.1126/science.aat5991"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3172840"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3662302"", ""10.1108/JICES-06-2018-0056"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2747994"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09537-4"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3063289"", ""10.2307/248959"", ""10.1145/3306618.3314289"", ""10.1177/0162243915605575""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

It is a term that has been much used in relation to COVID-19, particularly in social media. On its widest definition, it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people. Given the biological, behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity, this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others. Nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease: it can potentially be used to describe events, policies or settings. This article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic. One problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged super-spreaders. Another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission. The author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition.","[{""name"": ""Emma Cave"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.003"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1384"", ""10.1073/pnas.1409968111"", ""10.1038/nature04153"", ""10.1016/j.ijid.2010.06.020"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.1585"", ""10.1016/j.chom.2015.09.013"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30845-X""]","['Neuroscience', 'Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Modeling and Simulation', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1111/nous.12323,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,"Being neutral: Agnosticism, inquiry and the suspension of judgment","AbstractEpistemologists often claim that in addition to belief and disbelief there is a third, neutral, doxastic attitude. Various terms are used: ‘suspending judgment’, ‘withholding’, ‘agnosticism’. It is also common to claim that the factors relevant to the justification of these attitudes are epistemic in the narrow sense of being factors that bear on the strength or weakness of one's epistemic position with respect to the target proposition. This paper addresses two challenges to such traditionalism about doxastic attitudes. The first concerns the relevance of non‐epistemic factors we might call “future‐comparative” – e.g., that you'll have more decisive evidence on whether p tomorrow – to the justification of suspending judgment. The second, from Jane Friedman, is to explain the point of the neutral attitude without appealing to inquiry and thus taking goal‐related factors, which are not epistemic, such as the value of the goal or the prospects for finding means to achieve it, to bear on the justification of the neutral attitude. My defense of traditionalism relies on distinguishing three ways of being neutral on a question: agnosticism, inquiry and suspension of judgment. Traditionalism is saved because, of these, agnosticism alone is a genuine doxastic attitude.","[{""name"": ""Matthew McGrath"", ""affiliation"": [""Rutgers University""]}]","[""10.5840/factaphil1999116"", ""10.1111/j.1533-6077.2010.00179.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199347520.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199253722.001.0001"", ""10.1215/00318108-2366479"", ""10.1007/s11098-008-9225-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199550623.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0195128923.003.0006"", ""10.1111/nous.12137"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9753-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672707.003.0003"", ""10.2307/2184520"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.263"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716419.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00048409612347521"", ""10.1057/9781137400901"", ""10.1007/BF00375761"", ""10.1007/s11098-008-9222-4"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1104-9"", ""10.1093/mind/fzm055"", ""10.1023/A:1024409201289"", ""10.1086/664753"", ""10.1215/00318108-114-4-497"", ""10.1111/japp.12107"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00506.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198719694.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-015-0780-7"", ""10.5840/jphil2008105932""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Meanwhile there is little pull for automation from ecology-based, diversified farming realms. Noting this gap, we here explore the potential for robots to foster an agroecological approach to crop production. The research was situated in The Netherlands within the case of pixel cropping, a nascent farming method in which multiple food and service crops are planted together in diverse assemblages employing agroecological practices such as intercropping and biological pest control. Around this case we engaged with a variety of specialists in discussion groups, workshops, and design challenges to explore the potential of field robots to meet the multifaceted demands of highly diverse agroecological cropping systems. This generated a spectrum of imaginations for how automated tools might—or might not—be appropriately used, ranging from fully automated visions, to collaborative scenarios, to fully analogue prototypes. We found that automating agroecological cropping systems requires finding ways to imbue the ethos of agroecology into designed tools, thereby seeking to overcome tensions between production aims and other forms of social and ecological care. We conclude that a rethinking of automation is necessary for agroecological contexts: not as a blueprint for replacing humans, but making room for analogue and hybrid forms of agricultural work. These findings highlight a need for design processes which include a diversity of actors, involve iterative design cycles, and incorporate feedback between designers, practitioners, tools, and cropping systems.","[{""name"": ""Lenora Ditzler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clemens Driessen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/su9030349"", ""10.1080/03066150.2011.582947"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.11.004"", ""10.1111/gcb.15747"", ""10.1051/ocl/2017028"", ""10.1080/09640568.2015.1009627"", ""10.1177/0263775820963128"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109576"", ""10.3389/fpls.2021.734167"", ""10.1016/j.njas.2019.03.001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9523.2004.00270.x"", ""10.5751/ES-09595-220408"", ""10.1080/03066150.2019.1584189"", ""10.1007/s10460-020-10032-w"", ""10.1007/s13593-012-0091-z"", ""10.1016/j.tree.2021.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2019.02.008"", ""10.1016/j.eja.2020.126197"", ""10.1007/s10460-014-9515-5"", ""10.31256/WP2018.2"", ""10.1007/s10460-021-10244-8"", ""10.1007/s10806-017-9704-5"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.05.023"", ""10.1215/9780822371816"", ""10.1016/j.agee.2014.11.018"", ""10.2307/3106015"", ""10.3390/s20092672"", ""10.1300/J064v22n03_10"", ""10.1016/S0048-7333(02)00062-8"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2010.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.gfs.2019.04.011"", ""10.1080/01436597.2013.784599"", ""10.1016/S2542-5196(20)30277-1"", ""10.1300/J064v07n01_07"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2010.08.007"", ""10.1016/j.fcr.2020.108015"", ""10.1016/j.still.2019.104293"", ""10.1016/j.gfs.2019.100347"", ""10.1007/s43154-020-00034-1"", ""10.1080/01442872.2020.1724384"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2018.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.01.032"", ""10.1080/1389224X.2012.638781"", ""10.1177/1094428120948600"", ""10.1038/s41598-021-82784-2"", ""10.1002/aepp.13177"", ""10.2134/agronj2018.12.0779"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-811050-8.00024-8"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.06.013"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4503-2_18"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2016.08.002"", ""10.1177/2053951719849444"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0229910"", ""10.1080/21683565.2018.1499578"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2010.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.05.010"", ""10.1007/s11119-006-9014-9"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2019.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103225"", ""10.1007/s00163-016-0233-4"", ""10.1177/0306312715599851"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0982-76"", ""10.1016/j.njas.2019.100307"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.04.029"", ""10.1038/s43016-021-00287-9"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103103"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.01.023"", ""10.1007/s43681-021-00104-w"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102856"", ""10.3390/su9030330"", ""10.1017/S174217050700213X"", ""10.3389/fnut.2018.00104"", ""10.1073/pnas.1906419116"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2021.102778"", ""10.1007/s11119-020-09757-9"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aba1715"", ""10.1007/s10460-014-9581-8"", ""10.3389/fsufs.2020.584605"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc77bcc"", ""10.1016/j.njas.2019.01.001"", ""10.1080/03066150.2020.1725489"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.09.003"", ""10.1080/00438240903429649"", ""10.1215/22011919-3527731"", ""10.1080/14735903.2020.1743553"", ""10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105031"", ""10.1016/j.eja.2019.125936"", ""10.1007/BF01530663"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.12.005"", ""10.1051/agro/2009004"", ""10.1007/s13593-013-0180-7""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Molecular Biology', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)], [('0713 生态学', 0.7488), ('0710 生物学', 0.7317)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"

The recently determined Bajocian age for salt deposition (using 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopes) is integrated by modifying the plate kinematic framework with a new Equatorial Atlantic reconstruction that expands the gap between the Americas by 180 km over many kinematic frameworks. NW–SE synrift lithospheric extension along western Florida–Bahamas is estimated at 40%, implying thinned continental crust beneath Great Bank, Bahamas, the conjugate for the Guianas Basin margin. In cordilleran Mexico (excluding the Yucatán Block), we propose two new means by which continental crust migrated into the ‘Colombian overlap position’ of Pangaean reconstructions. The first involved Jurassic–earliest Cretaceous sinistral displacement of the Oaxaca Block along a NW–SE ‘North Oaxaca Transfer’ through or adjacent to the Cuicateco Belt. The second applies to the continental crust in eastern Mexico to the north of Cuicateco, a region we refer to as ‘peninsular Mexico’. There, most Mesozoic basement faults trend NW–SE, and the common occurrence of Permian mid-crustal anatectic basement directly beneath Mesozoic red beds, salt and marine strata suggests extreme extension prior to the onset of sedimentation. Because these Mesozoic sedimentary sections typically sum to 3–8 km in thickness, the post-rift crust of peninsular Mexico probably averaged about 25 km in thickness before later orogenesis. Our reconstructions suggest that this Triassic–Middle Jurassic extension approached 100%, beginning with overthickened Alleghanian (Permian) crust about 50 km in thickness in palaeo-northern Mexico, and was accompanied by a significant sinistral component broadly distributed across the rift array. The updated model provides an exploration and kinematic framework for the entire region.","[{""name"": ""James Pindell"", ""affiliation"": [""Tectonic Analysis Ltd, Chestnut House, Burton Park,

We introduce the starting point of moral distress that arises from ethical challenges when actions of the healthcare professional are constrained. We examine how situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic can exponentially increase moral distress in healthcare professionals. Then, we explore how moral resilience can help cope with moral distress. We propose the term collective moral resilience to capture the shared capacity arising from mutual engagement and dialogue in group settings, towards responding to individual moral distress and towards building an ethical practice environment. Finally, we look at CoPs in healthcare and explore how these group experiences can be used to build collective moral resilience.","[{""name"": ""Janet Delgado"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Serena Siow"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Janet de Groot"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brienne McLane"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Margot Hedlin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/00012272-200701000-00009"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64626-8"", ""10.1007/s10730-012-9176-y"", ""10.1177/0969733013502803"", ""10.1001/jama.2019.21576"", ""10.1016/j.cpr.2009.07.003"", ""10.4037/aacnacc2016275"", ""10.1177/0969733013505312"", ""10.1111/jocn.14332"", ""10.1093/med/9780190619268.003.0002"", ""10.1111/bioe.12064"", ""10.1136/jme.2007.021246"", ""10.1097/NHL.0b013e3182a1bf33"", ""10.1177/0969733015615172"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113024"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3976"", ""10.1007/s00134-020-06121-3"", ""10.1136/bmj.m2150"", ""10.7326/M20-1376"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1211"", ""10.1002/hast.1110"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1764138"", ""10.1016/j.outlook.2017.03.009"", ""10.1111/jocn.13989"", ""10.1108/JME-12-2014-0041"", ""10.1136/bmj.k1333"", ""10.1348/014466608X357893"", ""10.1057/9780230307698_5"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1177/0018726716661040"", ""10.1186/1472-6963-11-273"", ""10.1097/00124784-200411001-00010"", ""10.1197/j.aem.2007.06.015"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2019.1691909"", ""10.1007/s11019-007-9072-4"", ""10.1093/oseo/instance.00258595"", ""10.1007/s11019-006-9033-3"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002327"", ""10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00331-8"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0175891"", ""10.3310/hsdr06370"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.14387"", ""10.1080/13561820.2017.1377692"", ""10.1186/1748-5908-4-11"", ""10.1056/NEJMp078104"", ""10.1097/00001888-200402000-00019"", ""10.1007/s11606-013-2665-0"", ""10.1001/journalofethics.2017.19.6.stas1-1706"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002117"", ""10.4300/JGME-D-15-00038.1"", ""10.4300/JGME-D-19-00085.1"", ""10.1186/s12961-015-0023-x""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Emergency Medical Services', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1017/beq.2019.21,BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Stakeholder Dialogue as Agonistic Deliberation: Exploring the Role of Conflict and Self-Interest in Business-NGO Interaction,"ABSTRACT:Many companies engage in dialogue with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) about societal issues. The question is what a regulative ideal for such dialogues should be. In the literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR), the Habermasian notion of communicative action is often presented as a regulative ideal for stakeholder dialogue, implying that actors should aim at consensus and set strategic considerations aside. In this article, we argue that in many cases, communicative action is not a suitable regulative ideal for dialogue between companies and NGOs. We contend that there is often an adversarial element in the relation between companies and NGOs, and that an orientation towards consensus can be in tension with this adversarial relation. We develop an alternative approach to stakeholder dialogue called ‘agonistic deliberation.’ In this approach, conflict and strategic considerations play a legitimate and, up to a certain point, desirable role.","[{""name"": ""Teunis Brand"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vincent Blok"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marcel Verweij"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00344.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2007.00267.x"", ""10.1007/s11077-006-9024-5"", ""10.1177/0149206305279601"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.978-1-909493-32-2_10"", ""10.1177/0090591791019002003"", ""10.5840/beq20041412"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275682"", ""10.5465/amr.1995.9507312924"", ""10.5840/beq200717230"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-8202-7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815768"", ""10.1177/0191453709343385"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1830-z"", ""10.1002/pa.229"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3330-4"", ""10.1017/beq.2015.2"", ""10.4337/9781784718862.00024"", ""10.5840/pom201413211"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198793991.013.20"", ""10.2307/256972"", ""10.1111/1467-8594.00161"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3027-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1057-9"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0109-x"", ""10.1093/ojls/7.1.1"", ""10.1002/smj.759"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1319-1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00548.x"", ""10.5465/ame.2003.9474812"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9743-y"", ""10.1177/0090591794022002001"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3580-9"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.1997.tb00066.x"", ""10.1002/csr.171"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9044-2"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.978-1-909493-32-2_4"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9175-5"", ""10.1111/joms.12203"", ""10.1177/0090591797025003002"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199990481.001.0001"", ""10.1111/beer.12049"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.978-1-909493-32-2_5"", ""10.1017/beq.2017.33"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2756-4"", ""10.5840/beq201222333"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2012.06.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-2033-3"", ""10.5840/beq201121437"", ""10.1023/A:1020341526691"", ""10.1111/joms.12092"", ""10.1080/23299460.2014.924239"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1193-2"", ""10.1017/beq.2016.73"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9316-x"", ""10.2307/3857232"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-5355-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9405-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9573-3"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.26585837"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00950.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.081306.070555"", ""10.1525/sp.2008.55.4.480"", ""10.1108/14720700510630059"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2003.10.009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511626708"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.4700.2002.su.00006"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2009.00279.x""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"
10.1007/s11229-018-02013-8,SYNTHESE,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Situated anticipation,"AbstractIn cognitive science, long-term anticipation, such as when planning to do something next year, is typically seen as a form of ‘higher’ cognition, requiring a different account than the more basic activities that can be understood in terms of responsiveness to ‘affordances,’ i.e. to possibilities for action. Starting from architects that anticipate the possibility to make an architectural installation over the course of many months, in this paper we develop a process-based account of affordances that includes long-term anticipation within its scope. We present a framework in which situations and their affordances unfold, and can be thought of as continuing a history of practices into a current situational activity. In this activity affordances invite skilled participants to act further. Via these invitations one situation develops into the other; an unfolding process that sets up the conditions for its own continuation. Central to our process account of affordances is the idea that engaged individuals can be responsive to the direction of the process to which their actions contribute. Anticipation, at any temporal scale, is then part and parcel of keeping attuned to the movement of the unfolding situations to which an individual contributes. We concretize our account by returning to the example of anticipation observed in architectural practice. This account of anticipation opens the door to considering a wide array of human activities traditionally characterized as ‘higher’ cognition in terms of engaging with affordances.","[{""name"": ""Ludger van Dijk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erik Rietveld"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9780470996492.ch19"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1239-1"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00599"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_5"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8367.001.0001"", ""10.1037/h0070405"", ""10.1093/0199271941.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794325.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-50121-0_22"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.1989.tb00133.x"", ""10.1007/978-0-585-33485-1_6"", ""10.4324/9781410600479"", ""10.4324/9780203818336"", ""10.4324/9780203559055"", ""10.1111/phpr.12039"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9476.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822384151"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.1981.tb00023.x"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674063013"", ""10.1093/mind/fzn050"", ""10.1075/aicr.86.11rie"", ""10.1007/s40279-016-0520-2"", ""10.1007/s11097-016-9475-x"", ""10.1080/10407413.2014.958035"", ""10.1515/9780271023717"", ""10.1007/978-94-6209-128-3_2"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.1983.tb00460.x"", ""10.5840/monist196953115"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_2"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-74711-8_3"", ""10.1080/09515089.2016.1213379"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01969"", ""10.1177/0959354313517415"", ""10.1177/0959354315596080""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1093/phe/phad017,PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Health as Complete Well-Being: The WHO Definition and Beyond,"Abstract The paper defends the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of health against widespread criticism. The common objections are due to a possible misinterpretation of the word complete in the descriptor of health as ‘complete physical, mental and social well-being’. Complete here does not necessarily refer to perfect well-being but can alternatively mean exhaustive well-being, that is, containing all its constitutive features. In line with the alternative reading, I argue that the WHO definition puts forward a holistic account, not a notion of perfect health. I use historical and analytical evidence to defend this interpretation. In the second part of the paper, I further investigate the two different notions of health (holistic health and perfect health). I argue that both ideas are relevant but that the holistic interpretation is more adept for political aims.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Schramme"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of Liverpool , Gillian Howie House, Mulberry Street, Liverpool, L69 7SH , UK""]}]","[""10.1007/978-94-017-8688-1_48"", ""10.1016/B978-012373960-5.00550-5"", ""10.1093/ije/1.4.347"", ""10.2307/3527467"", ""10.1002/wmh3.221"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.001233"", ""10.1017/9781108692878"", ""10.56021/9780801801839"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2019.305177"", ""10.1515/9780691221878"", ""10.1097/00005650-199205001-00003"", ""10.1136/bmj.d4163"", ""10.1177/0952695121995355"", ""10.1007/BF00300458"", ""10.1177/0020731418782653"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-0241-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-29091-1_12"", ""10.56021/9781421420325"", ""10.1080/15265161.2014.998374"", ""10.1136/bmj.314.7091.1409"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-8688-1_49"", ""10.1097/00000441-193206000-00023"", ""10.4324/9781315163307"", ""10.1186/s12913-022-07702-2"", ""10.2105/AJPH.71.6.620""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Health Professions', 'Philosophy']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

An account of epistemic justice for a global bioethics,"The silencing of the epistemologies, theories, principles, values, concepts and experiences of the global South constitutes a particularly egregious epistemic injustice in bioethics. Our shared responsibility to rectify that injustice should be at the top of the ethics agenda. That it is not, or only is in part, is deeply problematic and endangers the credibility of the entire field. As a first step towards reorienting the field, this paper offers a comprehensive account of epistemic justice for global health ethics. We first introduce several different conceptions of justice and decolonisation in relation to knowledge, purposefully drawing on work emanating from the global South as well as the global North. We then apply those conceptions to the global health ethics context to generate a tripartite account of the layers of epistemic justice in the field: who is producing ethics knowledge; what theories and concepts are being applied to produce ethics knowledge; and whose voices are sought, recorded and used to generate ethics knowledge. These layers reflect that the field spans conceptual and empirical research. We conclude by proposing that, going forward, three avenues are key to achieve greater epistemic justice at each layer and to help decolonise global health ethics: namely, understanding the problem, dialogue and structural change.","[{""name"": ""Bridget Pratt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jantina de Vries"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/ken.2016.0027"", ""10.1007/s11017-017-9402-3"", ""10.1111/dewb.12189"", ""10.1186/s12910-018-0338-6"", ""10.20529/IJME.2017.047"", ""10.4324/9780203082225"", ""10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00317-X"", ""10.1136/bmjgh-2021-008169"", ""10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005292"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511984792.007"", ""10.3402/gha.v7.23569"", ""10.1215/26410478-8855227"", ""10.25159/2413-3086/3251"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780195386097.003.0001"", ""10.4324/9780429438189-3"", ""10.1080/18186874.2017.1392125"", ""10.2307/j.ctv125jgv8"", ""10.21248/gjn.13.02.257"", ""10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00301-6"", ""10.1177/0268580900015002005"", ""10.1080/09502380601162548"", ""10.1177/1468795X221105421"", ""10.1080/03080188.2020.1840225"", ""10.1080/09502380601162514"", ""10.1215/00382876-101-1-57"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-40523-4_5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315542294-4"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01177.x"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2006.tb01091.x"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32417-X"", ""10.1515/9781400820412"", ""10.1080/15265161.2017.1365185"", ""10.1086/381709"", ""10.1111/j.1748-720X.2012.00648.x"", ""10.1111/1468-2346.00298"", ""10.1007/s11017-017-9406-z"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.034"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-7-1"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-2512-6_63"", ""10.1080/16549716.2018.1561175"", ""10.1080/21501378.2021.1922075"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113829"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0391-9"", ""10.1007/s11673-012-9424-5""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions', 'Physiology']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"

Section I makes the case that vaccine distribution should occur at a global level in order to accelerate development and fair, efficient vaccine allocation. Section II puts forth ethical values to guide vaccine distribution including helping people with the greatest need, reducing health disparity, saving the most lives and promoting narrow social utility. It also responds to objections which claim that earlier years have more value than later years. Section III puts forth a practical ethical framework to aid decision-makers and compares it with alternatives.","[{""name"": ""Nancy S Jecker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aaron G Wightman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Douglas S Diekema"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/s12910-020-00477-3"", ""10.3386/w27212"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31873-0"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195103915.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199385263.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199257671.003.0008"", ""10.1136/bmj.316.7140.1310"", ""10.1136/bmj.314.7087.1114"", ""10.1007/978-1-4684-4424-7_2"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7"", ""10.1126/science.abd7672"", ""10.1016/j.smim.2018.10.010"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2014811"", ""10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100404"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1548"", ""10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.048126"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.6548"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1851812"", ""10.4324/9781315461731-23"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2018.304883"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106516"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000003416"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114"", ""10.1126/science.abe2803"", ""10.1080/21645515.2017.1338547"", ""10.1111/j.1467-842X.2004.tb00027.x"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-02483-2"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0069586"", ""10.1002/hast.1100"", ""10.12927/hcq.2014.23833"", ""10.1007/s11673-020-10022-x"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1764140"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2026913"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.20847""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Medicine']","['Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"
10.1007/s11097-021-09781-8,PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES,0101 Philosophy,Phenomenological psychology and qualitative research,"AbstractThis article presents the tradition of phenomenologically founded psychological research that was originally initiated by Amedeo Giorgi. This data analysis method is inseparable from the broader project of establishing an autonomous phenomenologically based human scientific psychology. After recounting the history of the method from the 1960’s to the present, we explain the rationale for why we view data collection as a process that should be adaptable to the unique mode of appearance of each particular phenomenon being researched. The substance of the article is then devoted to a detailed outline of the method’s whole-part-whole procedure of data analysis. We then offer a sample analysis of a brief description of an ordinary daydream. This is an anxiety daydream in response to the recent Covid-19 pandemic. We present this daydream analysis in full to show the concrete hands-on 5 step process through which the researcher explicated the participants’ expressions from the particular to the general. From this brief sample analysis, the researcher offers a first-person reflection on the data analysis process to offer the reader an introduction to the diacritical nature of phenomenological psychological elucidation.","[{""name"": ""Magnus Englander"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Morley"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/156916283X00117"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341255"", ""10.1017/9781316827178"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341256"", ""10.1037/qup0000116"", ""10.1037/0000257-000"", ""10.1163/156916295X00033"", ""10.1163/156916288X00103"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59932-4"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341368"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-95204-5"", ""10.1177/1363461512447139"", ""10.1163/156916207X234275"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341266"", ""10.1037/hum0000107"", ""10.1037/hum0000144"", ""10.1163/156916292X00090"", ""10.1163/156916297X00103"", ""10.1207/s15473333thp3404_2"", ""10.1080/08873267.2014.933052"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341319"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341375"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341382"", ""10.1163/156916211X567497"", ""10.1163/156916205774651096"", ""10.4135/9781526405555.n11"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3718-8"", ""10.11575/jah.v0i0.53187"", ""10.1163/156916298X00049"", ""10.1177/0959354399091005"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.10.009"", ""10.1163/156916208X338783"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341355"", ""10.1163/156916211X599753"", ""10.1080/20797222.2017.1392759"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341385"", ""10.5840/schutz201688"", ""10.1163/15691624-12341311""]",['Psychology'],"['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/nous.12285,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,Perceptual Pluralism,"AbstractPerceptual systems respond to proximal stimuli by forming mental representations of distal stimuli. A central goal for the philosophy of perception is to characterize the representations delivered by perceptual systems. It may be that all perceptual representations are in some way proprietarily perceptual and differ from the representational format of thought (Dretske 1981; Carey 2009; Burge 2010; Block ms.). Or it may instead be that perception and cognition always trade in the same code (Prinz 2002; Pylyshyn 2003). This paper rejects both approaches in favor ofperceptual pluralism, the thesis that perception delivers a multiplicity of representational formats, some proprietary and some shared with cognition. The argument for perceptual pluralism marshals a wide array of empirical evidence in favor of iconic (i.e., image‐like, analog) representations in perception as well as discursive (i.e., language‐like, digital) perceptual object representations.","[{""name"": ""Jake Quilty‐Dunn"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Philosophy &amp; Brasenose College University of Oxford""]}]","[""10.1111/1467-9280.00327"", ""10.1080/13506280344000158"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.631.x"", ""10.1080/00048402.2017.1329329"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2014.05.007"", ""10.1111/phpr.12135"", ""10.1037/h0028589"", ""10.4324/9781410603005"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2006.00220.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9985-5"", ""10.1177/0956797614532656"", ""10.1017/S0140525X07002804"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199581405.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phpr.12136"", ""10.1111/phpr.12093"", ""10.1080/14640748708401795"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2007.00124.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00245.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195367638.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X10003092"", ""10.3758/BF03194827"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00001515"", ""10.1017/S0140525X12000477"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2011.06.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625312"", ""10.1016/0042-6989(85)90110-5"", ""10.3758/s13414-017-1353-2"", ""10.1006/cogp.2001.0760"", ""10.1037/0278-7393.8.2.142"", ""10.1017/S0140525X15000965"", ""10.1037/0096-1523.32.4.840"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5684.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199548774.001.0001"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(88)90031-5"", ""10.1167/11.12.3"", ""10.1002/9781444310498"", ""10.3758/BF03342209"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-385522-0.00002-0"", ""10.5040/9781350928541"", ""10.3758/s13414-014-0683-6"", ""10.3758/BF03207558"", ""10.1037/0278-7393.26.1.136"", ""10.1080/13506280903004190"", ""10.3758/PP.70.4.667"", ""10.1111/nous.12207"", ""10.1093/bjps/axx055"", ""10.1111/mila.12144"", ""10.1037/xge0000053"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199734337.003.0030"", ""10.1167/8.6.497"", ""10.1037/xlm0000031"", ""10.1215/00318108-109-4-483"", ""10.1037/0096-3445.123.4.410"", ""10.1037/a0017836"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511758621"", ""10.1037/0278-7393.18.2.307"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1479.003.0014"", ""10.1080/713756783"", ""10.1080/13506280903338911"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(92)90007-O"", ""10.1037/rev0000099"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3653.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3965.003.0010"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(77)90004-4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195179088.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0096-1523.4.1.47"", ""10.1007/s13164-014-0218-z"", ""10.2307/2214671"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.86.2.276"", ""10.1038/36846"", ""10.1016/j.cogpsych.2009.04.002"", ""10.1007/s13164-015-0253-4"", ""10.1111/nous.12089"", ""10.1111/phpr.12368"", ""10.1016/j.neulet.2017.11.035"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2004.03.008"", ""10.3758/BF03194997"", ""10.1177/0956797617719949"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2015.08.003"", ""10.3758/s13423-013-0393-4"", ""10.1037/0096-3445.113.3.426"", ""10.1037/0096-1523.16.1.199"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3169.001.0001"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00277"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2004.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X99002022"", ""10.1017/S0140525X02000043"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6137.001.0001"", ""10.1163/156856888X00122"", ""10.1093/analys/any022"", ""10.1111/mila.12242"", ""10.1111/phpr.12625"", ""10.1007/s11098-017-0962-x"", ""10.1080/00048402.2017.1358754"", ""10.1037/0096-1523.15.4.673"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(80)90009-2"", ""10.1093/bjps/axp012"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00619.x"", ""10.1007/s002219900257"", ""10.1167/3.1.2"", ""10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00152-9"", ""10.3758/s13414-016-1220-6"", ""10.1167/17.6.15"", ""10.1037/h0029790"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199832798.003.0004"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(70)90002-2"", ""10.1126/science.171.3972.701"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198797081.001.0001"", ""10.1080/135062800394658"", ""10.1037/h0093759"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199289769.003.0016"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3877.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.03451"", ""10.1037/xlm0000295"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2016.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.03.026"", ""10.1073/pnas.1010919107""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s10551-019-04174-z,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Decoupling from Moral Responsibility for CSR: Employees' Visionary Procrastination at a SME,"Abstract Most studies of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have focused on the organisational level, while the individual level of analysis has been treated as a ‘black box’ when researching antecedents of CSR engagement or disengagement. This article offers insights into a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) that is recognised as a pioneer in CSR. Although the extant literature suggests that the owner-manager is crucial in the implementation of CSR, this study reveals that employees drive CSR. The employees in the focal firm voluntarily joined forces based on their shared perception of moral responsibility for CSR and they developed strict targets to be achieved by 2030. Despite their strong ethical and moral perspective when enacting CSR, they disengaged from their moral responsibility for CSR in various contexts. This paper contributes to the theory of moral decoupling by uncovering a novel context of disengagement—‘visionary procrastination’. Visionary procrastination is suggested to be a particularly relevant context of disengagement when individuals perceive moral responsibility for CSR. Moreover, by delivering insights into the antecedents of employee-initiated CSR on the organisational level, this study adds to the growing body of literature on the micro-foundations of CSR.","[{""name"": ""Tina Sendlhofer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5465/amr.2007.25275678"", ""10.1177/0149206311436079"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.013"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1602-1"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1542"", ""10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3"", ""10.2307/1131888"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.27745504"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1827-7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2007.00493.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2791-1"", ""10.5465/19416520.2012.684462"", ""10.1504/IJLC.2011.045068"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2006.00466.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2161-4"", ""10.1177/1350508413478584"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.0697"", ""10.1017/beq.2015.31"", ""10.1108/SRJ-07-2011-0028"", ""10.1007/s10677-014-9504-1"", ""10.1177/0007650315575107"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2818-7"", ""10.1504/IJPM.2013.056764"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2429-8"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2008.00540.x"", ""10.5465/AMBPP.2017.15452abstract"", ""10.1177/1094428109351319"", ""10.1177/1094428112452151"", ""10.1177/0007650318789867"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9080-y"", ""10.1002/job.2170"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2847-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3791-8"", ""10.1007/s10790-013-9391-z"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.08.006"", ""10.1177/030630700402900403"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9182-6"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2009.01546.x"", ""10.2307/2392366"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2220-x"", ""10.5465/amp.2012.0047"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3792-7"", ""10.1287/orsc.8.6.663"", ""10.11143/40867"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9848-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0591-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0118-9"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2006.00585.x"", ""10.3390/su8121278"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0931-9"", ""10.17763/haer.62.3.8323320856251826"", ""10.2307/3857398"", ""10.2307/4609267"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9447-8"", ""10.17813/maiq.5.1.g54k222086346251"", ""10.1111/j.1754-9434.2012.01478.x"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02417"", ""10.1002/job.380"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032414-111505"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2938-0"", ""10.1007/BF01686345"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2057-3"", ""10.1287/orsc.2014.0960"", ""10.2307/3857536"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8594.2007.00308.x"", ""10.1177/0007650314523256"", ""10.1016/j.adolescence.2013.02.003"", ""10.5465/amr.1986.4306235"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.6.1.25"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511488658"", ""10.1007/s11135-012-9713-4"", ""10.5840/bpej19832349"", ""10.5840/beq200313436"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.4700.2006.sp.00006"", ""10.1007/s12103-009-9068-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0708-6"", ""10.5465/amd.2015.0009"", ""10.5465/amj.2015.0718"", ""10.2307/2392599"", ""10.17813/maiq.5.1.h8ru112776715vq7""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Demography', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"
10.1007/s10551-021-04956-4,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Corporate Social Performance and the Likelihood of Bankruptcy: Evidence from a Period of Economic Upswing,"AbstractThe paper aims to investigate the effects of corporate social performance (CSP) on bankruptcy likelihood in times of economic upswing. This is important because prior related literature focused on data containing times of economic crises. We measure bankruptcy likelihood with the Altman Z score and CSP with Refinitiv ESG scores. By applying static panel data regressions and instrumental variable regressions on a sample of 6696 US-firm-year observations from 2010 to 2019 our main findings are: (i) In contrast to existing research, the level of firms’ CSP seems to have no (positive) effect on the likelihood of bankruptcy during times of economic upswing. (ii) Increasing a firm’s CSP in times of economic upswing leads to a rise in bankruptcy likelihood. We conclude that the positive effects of CSP on stakeholder relationships fail to materialize in flourishing business environments. The costs of increasing CSP, thus, exceed their immediate positive effects and raise bankruptcy likelihood. However, as they reduce financial default risk in subsequent crises, CSP investments can be seen as a balancing measure. Our findings bear implications for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers.","[{""name"": ""Florian Habermann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Felix Bernhard Fischer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1968.tb00843.x"", ""10.1111/jifm.12053"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3213-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2658-5"", ""10.2307/1191499"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3139-1"", ""10.1016/0165-4101(94)90026-4"", ""10.1080/13504851.2011.591721"", ""10.1016/j.econmod.2020.05.012"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3017-x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01434.x"", ""10.1016/j.frl.2020.101716"", ""10.1111/joms.12550"", ""10.1177/0001839217695089"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04621-2"", ""10.1002/smj.2131"", ""10.1108/SEF-01-2018-0013"", ""10.1177/0148558X14560898"", ""10.1111/joms.12216"", ""10.5465/ambpp.2015.16433abstract"", ""10.1057/jam.2015.31"", ""10.1002/csr.1282"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.08.013"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2011.03.021"", ""10.1057/jibs.2016.4"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1864-2"", ""10.1017/S0022109017000680"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2015.12.003"", ""10.1007/s11156-007-0048-5"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2014.2038"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2015.2229"", ""10.1080/20430795.2015.1118917"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.180"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0143-8"", ""10.1002/smj.750"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2646-9"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2963-z"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1799589"", ""10.1057/jibs.2012.26"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.05.006"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2007.12.040"", ""10.1057/emr.2010.18"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2014.02.013"", ""10.2308/accr-10209"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6288.2009.00216.x"", ""10.1111/jofi.12487"", ""10.1016/j.adiac.2018.08.001"", ""10.1111/jofi.12505"", ""10.2307/1992030"", ""10.2307/3556659"", ""10.1257/aer.104.5.177"", ""10.2307/259398"", ""10.1023/B:APJM.0000024085.96792.44"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.190"", ""10.1108/ASR-06-2015-0004"", ""10.1108/14720700210430298"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2014.11.013"", ""10.1016/j.adiac.2012.06.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3788-3"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1120.1630"", ""10.1111/1467-8551.00193"", ""10.1111/joms.12514"", ""10.1007/BF02745946"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(90)90063-6"", ""10.1002/smj.2579""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Accounting', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

From a strategic perspective, firms may proactively undertake philanthropic efforts to limit the spread of the pandemic and avoid a degraded business environment. From the perspective of non-trivial costs, increased economic uncertainty can raise concerns about business survival and lead to conservative philanthropic strategies. Following the proverb “prosperity makes friends, adversity tries them,” at the provincial level, our results support the second perspective. Specifically, when the spread of the pandemic worsens in a province, local firms are less likely to make COVID-19-related donations in terms of likelihood and amount. Investors also react negatively, not only to the local spread of COVID-19 but also to COVID-19-related philanthropic donations. At the organizational level, our evidence indicates that there is at least some level of cost–benefit analysis underlying corporate philanthropic decisions. Specifically, corporate philanthropic donations, especially those made to the local business environment, are significantly affected by organizational-level factors, such as pre-existing resource availability and motives to acquire political and reputational resources. Overall, our multilevel study presents a comprehensive picture of corporate philanthropic decisions amid the COVID-19 crisis.","[{""name"": ""Hanwen Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Siyi Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xin Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daoguang Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1467-6486.00113"", ""10.3386/w27418"", ""10.1108/14720701011069641"", ""10.3386/w26983"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.93.1.65"", ""10.1257/aer.20180615"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.00138"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-7443-4"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2006.02.001"", ""10.1177/000765039903800203"", ""10.1023/A:1006080417909"", ""10.2307/257850"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-G"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9257-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9553-7"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-00741-x"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199902)20:2<147::AID-SMJ11>3.0.CO;2-Q"", ""10.1177/0007650307305368"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2017.07.002"", ""10.1177/0899764004263422"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3551-1"", ""10.1111/0045-3609.00066"", ""10.2307/256324"", ""10.2307/2393734"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9087-4"", ""10.1016/j.pacfin.2011.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2010.12.003"", ""10.1108/MD-03-2013-0102"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1969-7"", ""10.5539/ijms.v3n1p2"", ""10.5465/amr.2005.18378878"", ""10.1002/smj.750"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5973.2005.00465.x"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2020.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2011.04.001"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000020964.80208.c9"", ""10.1002/1097-0266(200101)22:2<125::AID-SMJ150>3.0.CO;2-H"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2006.00583.x"", ""10.5465/ambpp.2013.11535abstract"", ""10.1057/emr.2010.18"", ""10.5465/AMBPP.2017.16563abstract"", ""10.1007/s10997-009-9087-8"", ""10.1002/smj.810"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2167-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1921-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0690-z"", ""10.1002/joe.20298"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2009.06.001"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275683"", ""10.5465/19416520.2015.1014661"", ""10.1177/109114218601400402"", ""10.1002/smj.917"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0861-6"", ""10.5465/amr.2012.0031"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9710-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2556-x"", ""10.1086/296420"", ""10.1177/000765030104000402"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9534-x"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.54533222"", ""10.1016/j.mar.2013.06.007"", ""10.1017/S1930297500004447"", ""10.1080/02664763.2014.909969"", ""10.1177/0007650303042002002"", ""10.1023/A:1006169005234"", ""10.1002/nvsm.6090020109"", ""10.1177/0007650304263919"", ""10.29302/oeconomica.2010.12.1.28"", ""10.1509/jmkr.38.2.225.18838"", ""10.1086/209519"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0183-0"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2386-2"", ""10.1177/0001839213475800"", ""10.2307/41166548"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199704)18:4<303::AID-SMJ869>3.0.CO;2-G"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.0548"", ""10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100329"", ""10.1101/2020.02.25.20027433v2"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3934-y"", ""10.1007/s11704-010-0505-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0067-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0248-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1209-6""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/mind/fzz036,MIND,0101 Philosophy,The Mental Affordance Hypothesis,"Abstract Our successful engagement with the world is plausibly underwritten by our sensitivity to affordances in our immediate environment. The considerable literature on affordances focuses almost exclusively on affordances for bodily actions such as gripping, walking or eating. I propose that we are also sensitive to affordances for mental actions such as attending, imagining and counting. My case for this ‘Mental Affordance Hypothesis’ is motivated by a series of examples in which our sensitivity to mental affordances mirrors our sensitivity to bodily affordances. Specifically, subjects perceive opportunities to perform a mental action and their doing so leads, under the right conditions, to the automatic preparation of that action. I conclude by sketching a mental affordance research program that would reinforce my case for the Mental Affordance Hypothesis and establish its ramifications for a number of debates across philosophy and psychology.","[{""name"": ""Tom McClelland"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Warwick""]}]","[""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.08.001"", ""10.1046/j.1468-1331.1998.540347.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.neuro.051508.135409"", ""10.1215/00318108-110-4-495"", ""10.1016/j.conb.2004.03.008"", ""10.1023/A:1021351606209"", ""10.1068/p5405"", ""10.1080/00048400802346813"", ""10.4324/9781410600479"", ""10.1016/0028-3932(95)00073-C"", ""10.1007/s11097-010-9152-4"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00127"", ""10.1093/0199268509.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0421-x"", ""10.1093/pq/pqv128"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_3"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2010.00407.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199695379.001.0001"", ""10.1145/301153.301168"", ""10.5840/philtopics20053319"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01291"", ""10.1080/00335558008248231"", ""10.1098/rstb.2007.2050"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195314595.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77915-5_7"", ""10.1075/aicr.86.11rie"", ""10.1080/10407413.2014.958035"", ""10.1086/377380"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2008.09.004"", ""10.1037/0096-1523.25.1.120"", ""10.1111/1467-9264.00135"", ""10.1207/s15326969eco0403_3"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658428.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199746996.003.0013"", ""10.1075/pc.14.2.12zha""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s11229-021-03142-3,SYNTHESE,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Pain and the field of affordances: an enactive approach to acute and chronic pain,"AbstractIn recent years, the societal and personal impacts of pain, and the fact that we still lack an effective method of treatment, has motivated researchers from diverse disciplines to try to think in new ways about pain and its management. In this paper, we aim to develop an enactive approach to pain and the transition to chronicity. Two aspects are central to this project. First, the paper conceptualizes differences between acute and chronic pain, as well as the dynamic process of pain chronification, in terms of changes in the field of affordances. This is, in terms of the possibilities for action perceived by subjects in pain. As such, we aim to do justice to the lived experience of patients as well as the dynamic role of behavioral learning, neural reorganization, and socio-cultural practices in the generation and maintenance of pain. Second, we aim to show in which manners such an enactive approach may contribute to a comprehensive understanding of pain that avoids conceptual and methodological issues of reductionist and fragmented approaches. It proves particularly beneficial as a heuristic in pain therapy addressing the heterogenous yet dynamically intertwined aspects that may contribute to pain and its chronification.","[{""name"": ""Sabrina Coninx"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Stilwell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.pain.2010.11.010"", ""10.1016/j.pain.2003.12.015"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-02020-9"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4123-07.2008"", ""10.1038/srep45975"", ""10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.06.009"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00599"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30488-4"", ""10.1007/s11097-020-09670-6"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01928"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_5"", ""10.1515/9783110688405"", ""10.15585/mmwr.mm6736a2"", ""10.1016/j.ijosm.2016.01.005"", ""10.1017/9781108685214"", ""10.1080/09540261.2020.1830753"", ""10.1007/s11097-017-9534-y"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02864-0"", ""10.1126/science.847460"", ""10.1176/ajp.137.5.535"", ""10.1007/s11097-019-09635-4"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30489-6"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00508"", ""10.1093/0199271941.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794325.001.0001"", ""10.11612/resphil.1723"", ""10.1353/ppp.2020.0002"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32130-X"", ""10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112936"", ""10.1007/s13164-013-0170-3"", ""10.3138/ptc.2013-55BC"", ""10.1093/brain/awt211"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01638"", ""10.1016/j.berh.2017.08.004"", ""10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.01013.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262018548.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1526-4637.2006.00212.x"", ""10.1007/s11406-015-9645-z"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10480.001.0001"", ""10.1136/bjsports-2018-099878"", ""10.1111/jep.12713"", ""10.1080/17437199.2013.840951"", ""10.1007/s11097-018-9594-7"", ""10.3233/RNN-139003"", ""10.1097/AJP.0000000000000838"", ""10.1016/j.jpain.2017.08.008"", ""10.1016/j.cobeha.2018.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.brat.2020.103635"", ""10.1212/01.wnl.0000174515.07205.11"", ""10.1016/j.pain.0000000000000014"", ""10.2307/2183914"", ""10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001167"", ""10.1111/j.1748-3743.2012.00329.x"", ""10.1016/j.sjpain.2017.07.011"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198735410.001.0001"", ""10.1093/ptj/pzaa021"", ""10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.10.013"", ""10.1177/204946370800100203"", ""10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001939"", ""10.1093/med/9780199206469.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10407413.2014.958035"", ""10.1093/pm/pny175"", ""10.1186/s40945-020-00082-y"", ""10.1186/s12891-018-1943-8"", ""10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000740"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5280-10.2011"", ""10.1186/s12891-017-1831-7"", ""10.1111/j.1526-4637.2008.00540.x"", ""10.1007/s11097-019-09624-7"", ""10.1136/medhum-2020-011874"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_2"", ""10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001822"", ""10.1007/s11007-015-9325-5"", ""10.5694/mja12.10468"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01162"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01257"", ""10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001384"", ""10.1016/j.pain.2008.07.022"", ""10.1249/JES.0000000000000121"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6730.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10255.001.0001"", ""10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050718-095744"", ""10.1016/j.brat.2016.08.016"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.12.003"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6541.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

A Scoping Review","AbstractThe aim of this study is to analyze the influence of Confucianism on health behaviors, health outcomes and medical decisions. The research was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, CINHAL, PsycINFO and Web of Science, without restrictions of language and year of publication. The search process identified 833 publications matching the search criteria, and after the review process, 40 articles were included. Family is a central aspect of Confucianism, and it seems to affect participation in medical decisions, taking care of relatives, ethical dilemmas and mental health problems. Although most Confucianist influence seems to be positive, some ways of thinking could increase suffering, burnout and a delay in healthcare seeking. Understanding these values could help health professionals to deal with the growing contingent of patients with different cultures and religious beliefs.","[{""name"": ""Barbara Badanta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""María González-Cano-Caballero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paola Suárez-Reina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Giancarlo Lucchetti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rocío de Diego-Cordero"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.cpr.2011.05.003"", ""10.31744/einstein_journal/2020ED5562"", ""10.1111/jore.12328"", ""10.1080/1364557032000119616"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhz016"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhr036"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-6757-0_3"", ""10.1080/10410236.2016.1146568"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2001.01968.x"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhq046"", ""10.1097/01.NCC.0000305702.07035.4d"", ""10.1097/01.ANS.0000300182.48854.65"", ""10.1093/aje/kwy142"", ""10.1016/S0020-7489(00)00036-5"", ""10.1111/jan.13235"", ""10.1177/1043659616677641"", ""10.1017/S0021932007001988"", ""10.1076/jmep.29.2.149.31506"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-13-48"", ""10.1007/s10943-019-00780-3"", ""10.1111/jocn.14340"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-6757-0_10"", ""10.1007/s10730-006-7984-7"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhv014"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.12.008"", ""10.1590/1413-81232020254.21672018"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.12.002"", ""10.1177/0011000018798042"", ""10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00406-8"", ""10.1177/1049732302239596"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01331.x"", ""10.1332/204674314X13898785887043"", ""10.1037/1099-9809.2.1.35"", ""10.1177/0030222815575014"", ""10.1002/ase.1771"", ""10.1016/j.gerinurse.2008.01.002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195118667.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0894318408324320"", ""10.1177/0898264308328636"", ""10.1080/13607860903483060"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhv015"", ""10.1186/s12904-016-0117-4"", ""10.1007/s11017-016-9383-7"", ""10.1177/0033294117700857"", ""10.5172/conu.2007.25.1-2.31"", ""10.1007/s12529-015-9491-1"", ""10.1002/wmh3.377"", ""10.1007/s11019-019-09893-8"", ""10.1080/13573322.2013.833504"", ""10.1186/1472-6955-11-28"", ""10.1186/s12888-020-02991-5"", ""10.1007/s11019-018-9835-0"", ""10.1080/13548506.2013.819439"", ""10.1177/0898010107303890"", ""10.1515/ijamh-2013-0031"", ""10.1080/00207590344000024"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589618"", ""10.1111/nhs.12166"", ""10.1177/1084822310376610"", ""10.1007/s11673-014-9564-x"", ""10.1177/0022022116658260"", ""10.1177/1043659620905891"", ""10.1093/phe/phq030"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2020.151483""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Applied Psychology', 'Health']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)]]"

Research shows that businesses that pursue these strategies—or BoP businesses—face distinct sets of challenges that require unique capabilities. There is, however, limited effort to synthesize current evidence on the mechanisms through which these businesses create social value. We systematically review the literature on BoP businesses, covering 110 studies published in business and management journals. We start by using bibliographic analysis to map the broad contours of the literature in terms of its common theoretical and empirical approaches, intellectual core, and evolution in time. We subsequently conduct a qualitative content analysis on the identified articles to synthesize their main findings. The analysis leads to a conceptual framework that explicates the antecedents, constraints, capabilities, and contingencies that drive social value creation. In addition to providing a rich and systematically organized account of the evidence, our analysis provides a critical reflection on the ethical dilemmas of social value creation efforts for the BoP, and outlines promising avenues for future research.","[{""name"": ""Addisu A.

10.1111/beer.12274,BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,CSR for Happiness: Corporate determinants of societal happiness as social responsibility,"AbstractOver the past decade, societal happiness has increasingly been considered important to public policy initiatives globally, supported by interdisciplinary scholarly efforts spanning the social sciences, economics, and public health. Curiously, despite for‐profit corporations being core social institutions of modern societies, scant attention has been given to the social role and responsibilities of corporations in relation to societal happiness. In this article, we review and integrate research from positive psychology and related disciplines to examine happiness as a social outcome of corporate activity. We propose that corporations have a social responsibility to respect, preserve, and advance people's right to, and experience of, happiness—which we term CSR for Happiness. Within the existing literature, stakeholder happiness has generally been narrowly conceptualized in hedonic terms and has failed to consider the broader impacts of corporate activities on societal happiness. Drawing on advances in psychological theory and research, we provide a holistic conceptualization of happiness, which includes objective, subjective, hedonic, and eudaimonic dimensions of happiness. We offer an integrative conceptual framework, which includes the macro‐to‐micro and micro‐to‐macro pathways through which corporations directly and indirectly impact upon societal happiness. Finally, we consider implications of happiness research for the intersections of business and society.","[{""name"": ""Austin Chia"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Positive Psychology Melbourne Graduate School of Education The University of Melbourne Melbourne VIC Australia"", ""Department of Management and Marketing Faculty of Business and Economics The University of Melbourne Melbourne VIC Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Margaret L.

Far-Right Ecologism (FRE) as a Framework for Future Inquiries,"The enduring and consistent rise of the far right has enabled its representatives to affect environmental debates on a larger scale. Although such incursions are often labeled ‘eco-fascist’, the term itself term may be insufficient to account for the complexity of this intersection. Building upon existing attempts to organise such discourses in a coherent sub-ideological set, ‘far-right ecologism’ (FRE) is suggested as an overarching term, deriving its morphology from fascism, conservatism, as well as national-populism. Therefore, values emanating from these strands, such as naturalism, spirituality, mysticism, authority, organicism, autarky, nostalgia and Manicheanism, constitute FRE as a heuristic device.","[{""name"": ""BalŠa Lubarda"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy Central European University Nador u. 9, Budapest, 1051, Hungary""]}]","[""10.4159/9780674020221"", ""10.1080/13532944.2014.926698"", ""10.1080/10455750500108278"", ""10.1080/713665584"", ""10.1080/09644010701211650"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674416345"", ""10.3197/096327109X404771"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.08.012"", ""10.1177/0963662506066775"", ""10.5840/enviroethics19868436"", ""10.1017/S0960777300003623"", ""10.1080/026654300364074"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199665570.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13569319608420743"", ""10.3167/nc.2015.100204"", ""10.1080/17524032.2018.1470546"", ""10.1080/09644010500215407"", ""10.1080/13597560600852524"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2018.05.029"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780192802811.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13569317.2016.1260813"", ""10.1080/01629770903086244"", ""10.5840/enviroethics19802115"", ""10.1126/science.162.3859.1243"", ""10.3197/096327101129340804"", ""10.3197/096327107X228382"", ""10.3197/096327119X15519764179809"", ""10.3197/096327109X12532653285777"", ""10.1134/S1995425513070056"", ""10.1080/09644010802055576"", ""10.1017/S0010417598001698"", ""10.1515/9781503619104"", ""10.1080/23251042.2018.1488516"", ""10.4324/9781351104043-11"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199256044.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09644016.2018.1458411"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511806568"", ""10.1080/09644019608414288"", ""10.2307/3097132"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.1995.tb00636.x"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1353/pew.0.0061"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.035"", ""10.3368/lj.19.1-2.73"", ""10.1177/096327199800700204"", ""10.1075/jlp.17024.ryd"", ""10.1093/envhis/emv116"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2016.01.008"", ""10.3197/096327114X13947900181996"", ""10.4324/9780203876558"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300108996.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781351104043-16"", ""10.1215/9780822385806"", ""10.1080/23251042.2017.1310966"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511617485""]",['Environmental Science'],['Nature and Landscape Conservation'],"[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

I sketch a deontological framework for assessing when it is morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work to protect their families from infection and when it is a dereliction of duty to patients. I argue that it is morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work when their duty to treat is outweighed by the combined risks and burdens of that work. For HCWs who live with their families, the obligation to protect one’s family from infection contributes significantly to those burdens. There are, however, a range of complicating factors including the strength of duty to treat which varies according to the HCW’s role, the vulnerability of family members to the disease, the willingness of family members to risk infection and the resources available to the HCW to protect their family. In many cases, HCWs in ‘frontline’ roles with a weak duty to treat and families at home will be morally permitted to abstain from work given the risks posed by COVID-19; therefore, society should provide additional incentives to maintain sufficient staff in these roles.","[{""name"": ""Doug McConnell"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy, University of Oxford, Oxford 2678, UK""]}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-6-3"", ""10.1097/DMP.0b013e3181c12959"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30644-9"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.2648"", ""10.1016/j.puhe.2008.12.005"", ""10.1136/jme.2006.018978"", ""10.1080/15265160802132951"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00446.x""]",['Health Professions'],"['Emergency Medical Services', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1017/can.2020.21,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy,A Taxonomy of Transparency in Science,"AbstractBoth scientists and philosophers of science have recently emphasized the importance of promoting transparency in science. For scientists, transparency is a way to promote reproducibility, progress, and trust in research. For philosophers of science, transparency can help address the value-ladenness of scientific research in a responsible way. Nevertheless, the concept of transparency is a complex one. Scientists can be transparent about many different things, for many different reasons, on behalf of many different stakeholders. This paper proposes a taxonomy that clarifies the major dimensions along which approaches to transparency can vary. By doing so, it provides several insights that philosophers and other science studies scholars can pursue. In particular, it helps address common objections to pursuing transparency in science, it clarifies major forms of transparency, and it suggests avenues for further research on this topic.","[{""name"": ""Kevin C.

First, there are questions about which policies are most effective and fair in the here and now, as the pandemic unfolds. These polices concern, for example, who should receive priority in being tested, how to implement contact tracing, or how to decide who should get ventilators or vaccines when not all can. Second, it is imperative to anticipate the medium‐ and longer‐term consequences that these policies have. The case of vaccine rationing is particularly instructive. Ethical, epidemiological, and economic reasons demand that rationing approaches give priority to groups who have been structurally and historically disadvantaged, even if this means that overall life years gained may be lower.","[{""name"": ""Harald Schmidt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1101/2020.04.06.20055632"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.7197"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114"", ""10.1037/hea0000368"", ""10.3386/w26951""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

The paper argues for a relational approach to ethics which includes solidarity, relational autonomy, duty, equity, trust and reciprocity as core values. The needs of the poor and socially disadvantaged are highlighted. Relational autonomy and solidarity are explored in relation to isolation and social distancing. Reciprocity is discussed with reference to healthcare workers’ duty of care and its limits. Priority setting and access to treatment raise ethical issues of utility and equity. Difficult ethical dilemmas around triage, do not resuscitate decisions, and withholding and withdrawing treatment are discussed in the light of recently published guidelines. The paper concludes with the hope for a wider discussion of relational ethics and a glimpse of a future after the pandemic has subsided.","[{""name"": ""David Ian Jeffrey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/1472-6939-7-12"", ""10.1093/phe/phn025"", ""10.1353/hcr.0.0104"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195123333.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0141076816643333"", ""10.1177/0141076816680120"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-7-5"", ""10.1136/jme.2009.032821"", ""10.1503/cmaj.060911"", ""10.4997/jrcpe.2017.312""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['General Health Professions', 'Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

Their generation is intimately related to crustal thickening and the active deformation and metamorphism of metapelites. Data from Proterozoic to present day orogenic belts show that collisional leucogranites (CLGs) are peraluminous, with muscovite, biotite and tourmaline as characteristic minerals. Isotopic ratios uniquely identify the metapelitic sequences in which CLGs occur as sources. Organic material in pelitic sources results in f O 2 in CLGs that is usually below the fayalite–magnetite–quartz buffer. Most CLGs form under vapour-poor conditions with melting involving a peritectic breakdown of muscovite. The low concentrations of Mg, Fe and Ti that characterize CLGs are largely related to biotite–melt equilibria in the source rocks. Concentrations of Zr, Th and rare earth elements are lower than expected from zircon and monazite saturation models because these minerals often remain enclosed in residual biotite during melting. Melting involving muscovite may limit the temperatures achieved in the source regions. A lack of nearby mantle heat sources in thick collisional orogens has led to thermal models for the generation of CLGs that involve flux melting, or large amounts of radiogenic heat generation, or decompression melting or shear heating, the last one emphasizing the link of leucogranites and their sources to crustal-scale shear zone systems.","[{""name"": ""Peter I.

The creation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) arguably offered a new take on sustainable development by adopting hybrid and principle-based governance approaches, where public, private, not for profit and knowledge-institutions were invited to engage around achieving common medium-term targets. Cross-sector partnerships and multi-stakeholder engagement for sustainability have consequently taken shape. But the call for collaboration has also come with fundamental challenges to meaningful engagement strategies—when private enterprises try to establish elaborate multi-stakeholder configurations. How can the purpose of businesses be mitigated through multi-stakeholder principle-based partnerships to effectively serve the purpose of a common sustainability agenda? In selecting nine scholarly contributions, this special issue aims at advancing this discourse. To stimulate further progress in business studies, this introductory essay, furthermore, identifies three pathways for research on multi-stakeholder engagement processes in support of the Decade of Action along three coupling lines: multi-sector alignment (relational coupling), operational perception alignment (cognitive coupling) and goal and strategic alignment (material coupling).","[{""name"": ""G.

10.1007/s10551-022-05239-2,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Ethics at the Centre of Global and Local Challenges: Thoughts on the Future of Business Ethics,"AbstractTo commemorate 40 years since the founding of the Journal of Business Ethics, the editors in chief of the journal have invited the editors to provide commentaries on the future of business ethics. This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme Ethics at the centre of global and local challenges. For much of the history of the Journal of Business Ethics, ethics was seen within the academy as a peripheral aspect of business. However, in recent years, the stakes have risen dramatically, with global and local worlds destabilized by financial crisis, climate change, internet technologies and artificial intelligence, and global health crises. The authors of these commentaries address these grand challenges by placing business ethics at their centre. What if all grand challenges were framed as grand ethical challenges? Tanusree Jain, Arno Kourula and Suhaib Riaz posit that an ethical lens allows for a humble response, in which those with greater capacity take greater responsibility but remain inclusive and cognizant of different voices and experiences. Focussing on business ethics in connection to the grand(est) challenge of environmental emergencies, Steffen Böhm introduces the deceptively simple yet radical position that business is nature, and nature is business. His quick but profound side-step from arguments against human–nature dualism to an ontological undoing of the business–nature dichotomy should have all business ethics scholars rethinking their “business and society” assumptions. Also, singularly concerned with the climate emergency, Boudewijn de Bruin posits a scenario where, 40 years from now, our field will be evaluated by its ability to have helped humanity emerge from this emergency. He contends that Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth) v. Royal Dutch Shell illustrates how human rights take centre stage in climate change litigation, and how business ethics enters the courtroom. From a consumer ethics perspective, Deirdre Shaw, Michal Carrington and Louise Hassan argue that ecologically sustainable and socially just marketplace systems demand cultural change, a reconsideration of future interpretations of “consumer society”, a challenge to the dominant “growth logic” and stimulation of alternative ways to address our consumption needs. Still concerned with global issues, but turning attention to social inequalities, Nelarine Cornelius links the capability approach (CA) to global and corporate governance, arguing that CA will continue to lie at the foundation of human development policy, and, increasingly, CSR and corporate governance. Continuing debate on the grand challenges associated with justice and equality, Laurence Romani identifies a significant shift in the centrality of business ethics in debates on managing (cultural) differences, positing that dialogue between diversity management and international management can ground future debate in business ethics. Finally, the essay concludes with a commentary by Charlotte Karam and Michelle Greenwood on the possibilities of feminist-inspired theories, methods, and positionality for many spheres of business ethics, not least stakeholder theory, to broaden and deepen its capacity for nuance, responsiveness, and transformation. In the words of our commentators, grand challenges must be addressed urgently, and the Journal of Business Ethics should be at the forefront of tackling them.","[{""name"": ""Steffen Böhm"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michal Carrington"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nelarine Cornelius"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Boudewijn de Bruin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michelle Greenwood"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Louise Hassan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tanusree Jain"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Charlotte Karam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Arno Kourula"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laurence Romani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suhaib Riaz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deirdre Shaw"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10551-018-4080-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-021-04949-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-021-04973-3"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2004.tb01266.x"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12221"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4085-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-1393-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04425-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9500-7"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1677-3"", ""10.1111/misp.12090"", ""10.1515/9781478004318"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2065-3"", ""10.1177/00076503211068029"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3858-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1205-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-4049-1"", ""10.1023/A:1010776922597"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9016-6"", ""10.1017/9781108399821"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2818-7"", ""10.1111/joms.12173"", ""10.1007/s10551-022-05175-1"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11315v0"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3733-x"", ""10.1177/0170840614563742"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3939-6"", ""10.1017/9781108539500"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1056492620940793"", ""10.5465/amj.2016.4007"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3801-x"", ""10.1017/9781108123495.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3510-x"", ""10.1215/22011919-3615934"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102467"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3580-9"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04694-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-022-05079-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1478-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-022-05121-1"", ""10.1023/A:1016336118528"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1747-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2737-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3555-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-022-05078-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0204-z"", ""10.1111/reel.12416"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9539-5"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-8947-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04389-0"", ""10.1086/342914"", ""10.1177/00076503221077452"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3798-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-9465-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9650-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0730-8"", ""10.1023/A:1005711414306"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9932-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9252-9"", ""10.1111/0045-3609.00119"", ""10.1007/s10551-021-04840-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-022-05057-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04219-3"", ""10.1080/10301763.2006.10669327"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1074-8"", ""10.1017/S0265052506060043""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"

This paper discusses a number of questions that should be addressed when assessing the ethical challenges of mobile applications for digital contact-tracing of COVID-19: Which safeguards should be designed in the technology? Who should access data? What is a legitimate role for “Big Tech” companies in the development and implementation of these systems? How should cultural and behavioural issues be accounted for in the design of these apps? Should use of these apps be compulsory? What does transparency and ethical oversight mean in this context? We demonstrate that responses to these questions are complex and contingent and argue that if digital contract-tracing is used, then it should be clear that this is on a trial basis and its use should be subject to independent monitoring and evaluation.","[{""name"": ""Federica Lucivero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nina Hallowell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephanie Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Barbara Prainsack"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gabrielle Samuel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tamar Sharon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1371/journal.pmed.1001083"", ""10.2196/jmir.1157"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2013.07.004"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106314"", ""10.1080/01442872.2020.1723519"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002199"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002616"", ""10.1177/2053951718819032""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Mathematics']","['Epidemiology', 'Information Systems', 'Modeling and Simulation']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)]]"

Such advancements have also raised many questions, especially about public trust. As a response to these concerns there has been a concentrated effort from public bodies, policy-makers and technology companies leading the way in AI to address what is identified as a ""public trust deficit"". This paper argues that a focus on trust as the basis upon which a relationship between this new technology and the public is built is, at best, ineffective, at worst, inappropriate or even dangerous, as it diverts attention from what is actually needed to actively warrant trust. Instead of agonising about how to facilitate trust, a type of relationship which can leave those trusting vulnerable and exposed, we argue that efforts should be focused on the difficult and dynamic process of ensuring reliance underwritten by strong legal and regulatory frameworks. From there, trust could emerge but not merely as a means to an end. Instead, as something to work in practice towards; that is, the deserved result of an ongoing ethical relationship where there is the appropriate, enforceable and reliable regulatory infrastructure in place for problems, challenges and power asymmetries to be continuously accounted for and appropriately redressed.","[{""name"": ""Charalampia (Xaroula) Kerasidou"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Angeliki Kerasidou"", ""affiliation"": [""The Ethox Centre, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Monika Buscher"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen Wilkinson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics, Philosophy, & Religion, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK""]}]","[""10.1038/s41591-018-0268-3"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1799-6"", ""10.1080/01442872.2020.1723519"", ""10.2217/pme-2016-0057"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1007/s11019-017-9810-1"", ""10.1086/292745"", ""10.1007/s11019-016-9721-6"", ""10.1111/nous.12000"", ""10.1007/s12553-017-0179-1"", ""10.1177/0968533220945766"", ""10.1017/9781108620024.011"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30193-1"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-13-1"", ""10.1136/medethics-2014-102374"", ""10.1007/s11019-015-9661-6"", ""10.1136/bmj.g1702"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3445421"", ""10.1136/bmj.i3636"", ""10.1088/0963-6625/2/4/003"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00165-5"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0085"", ""10.1145/3236024.3264833"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0315-5"", ""10.1353/sor.2019.0022"", ""10.1177/2053951720942541"", ""10.2307/j.ctvhrd092.18"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0300-7"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-1042-x"", ""10.1136/bmj.m689"", ""10.1162/99608f92.cb91a35a"", ""10.1136/bmj.m428"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1220-6"", ""10.1089/omi.2017.0156"", ""10.1111/j.1466-769X.2007.00294.x"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0114-4"", ""10.1136/bmj.m815"", ""10.1111/bioe.12536"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5930.2005.00312.x"", ""10.1080/00048409412345881"", ""10.1007/s10677-017-9812-3"", ""10.1002/hast.1207"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-106048"", ""10.36644/mlr.116.3.regulating""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Safety Research']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

However, these AI Ethics Principles often fail to be actioned in governmental policy. This paper proposes a novel framework for the development of ‘Actionable Principles for AI’. The approach acknowledges the relevance of AI Ethics Principles and homes in on methodological elements to increase their practical implementability in policy processes. As a case study, elements are extracted from the development process of the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI of the European Commission’s “High Level Expert Group on AI”. Subsequently, these elements are expanded on and evaluated in light of their ability to contribute to a prototype framework for the development of 'Actionable Principles for AI'. The paper proposes the following three propositions for the formation of such a prototype framework: (1) preliminary landscape assessments; (2) multi-stakeholder participation and cross-sectoral feedback; and, (3) mechanisms to support implementation and operationalizability.","[{""name"": ""Charlotte Stix"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3351095.3372860"", ""10.1353/jod.2019.0029"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3518482"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.12775/SetF.2018.015"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09517-8"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1356-7"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00165-5"", ""10.1002/9781118551424.ch2"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372873"", ""10.1177/2053951720942541"", ""10.1108/JICES-12-2019-0138"", ""10.31235/osf.io/8jaz4"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.05.008"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3547922"", ""10.2307/j.ctvhrd092.18""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

It is often the case, however, that applications in these fields require determining the satisfiability of formulas in more expressive logics such as first-order logic. Also, these applications typically require not general first-order satisfiability, but rather satisfiability with respect to some background theory, which fixes the interpretations of certain predicate and function symbols. For many background theories, specialized methods yield decision procedures for the satisfiability of quantifier-free formulas or some subclass thereof. Specialized decision procedures have been discovered for a long and still growing list of theories with practical applications. These include the theory of equality, various theories of arithmetic, and certain theories of arrays, as well as theories of lists, tuples, records, and bit-vectors of a fixed or arbitrary finite size. The research field concerned with determining the satisfiability of formulas with respect to some background theory is called Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). This chapter provides a brief overview of SMT together with references to the relevant literature for a deeper study. It begins with an overview of techniques for solving SMT problems by encodings to SAT. The rest of the chapter is mostly concerned with an alternative approach in which a SAT solver is integrated with a separate decision procedure (called a theory solver) for conjunctions of literals in the background theory. After presenting this approach as a whole, the chapter provides more details on how to construct and combine theory solvers, and discusses several extensions and enhancements.","[{""name"": ""Clark Barrett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roberto Sebastiani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sanjit A.

Advances in neuroscience and technology are indeed impressive and pose a range of challenges for the law, and some novel applications give grounds for human rights concerns. But whether addressing these concerns requires adopting novel human rights, and whether the proposed neurorights are suitable candidates, are a different matter. This paper argues that the proposed rights, as individuals and a class, should not be adopted and lobbying on their behalf should stop. The proposal tends to promote rights inflationism, is tainted by neuroexceptionalism and neuroessentialism, and lacks grounding in relevant scholarship. None of the proposed individual rights passes quality criteria debated in the field. While understandable from a moral perspective, the proposal is fundamentally flawed from a legal perspective. Rather than conjuring up novel human rights, existing rights should be further developed in face of changing societal circumstances and technological possibilities.","[{""name"": ""Jan Christoph Bublitz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/d41586-019-03295-9"", ""10.1038/551159a"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199238781.001.0001"", ""10.1017/9781108676106.002"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-50004-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199596492.003.0016"", ""10.1186/s40504-017-0050-1"", ""10.1007/s12152-020-09438-4"", ""10.1093/jlb/lsz015"", ""10.1093/law/9780199640133.003.0032"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199570706.013.0049"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0237-0"", ""10.1017/9781108676106.031"", ""10.5235/175799611798204932"", ""10.1007/s11019-013-9539-4"", ""10.1038/s41587-019-0230-z"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.031"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614484"", ""10.2307/4135723"", ""10.4324/9780203703489"", ""10.1093/analys/58.1.7"", ""10.5771/2747-5182-2021-1-30"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199338207.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jlb/lsaa051"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8027.001.0001"", ""10.1016/bs.dnb.2021.06.001"", ""10.17176/20191104-162816-0"", ""10.1007/s12152-021-09468-6"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107337923.006"", ""10.1017/S0922156521000297"", ""10.1136/jme.2006.016543"", ""10.1093/jlb/lsaa006"", ""10.1017/9781108676106.032"", ""10.25162/arsp-2014-0001"", ""10.1196/annals.1305.014"", ""10.1196/annals.1305.014"", ""10.1093/jlb/lst003"", ""10.1098/rstb.2004.1546""]",['Neuroscience'],"['Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7525), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7489)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In this paper, we evaluate the ethical justifications for and strength of the US legal framework that aims to protect patients, research participants, and consumers from genetic discrimination in employment and health insurance settings in the context of advancing genetic technology. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) and other laws prohibit genetic and other health-related discrimination in the United States, but these laws have significant limitations, and some provisions are under threat. If accuracy and predictive power increase, specific instances of use of genetic information by employers may indeed become ethically justifiable; however, any changes to laws would need to be adopted cautiously, if at all, given that people have consented to genetic testing with the expectation that there would be no genetic discrimination in employment or health insurance settings. However, if our society values access to healthcare for both the healthy and the sick, we should uphold strict and broad prohibitions against genetic and health-related discrimination in the context of health insurance, including employer-based health insurance. This is an extremely important but often overlooked consideration in the current US debate on healthcare.","[{""name"": ""Carolyn Riley Chapman"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Medical Ethics, Department of Population Health, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Kripa Sanjay Mehta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brendan Parent"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Arthur L Caplan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Physiology']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"

There has been little work on the role of implicit biases in women’s under-representation in surgery. Nor has the impact of epistemic injustice, whereby stereotyping influences knowledge or credibility judgements, been explored. This article reports findings of a qualitative in-depth interview study with women surgeons that investigates gender biases in surgery, including subtle types of bias. The study was conducted with 46 women surgeons and trainees of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. Maximum variance sampling strategies ensured a comprehensive set of perspectives. Data were analysed using iterative thematic analysis to document and classify forms of gender bias experienced by the participants, including implicit bias and epistemic injustice. It found four types of bias affecting women surgeons: (1) workplace factors such as access to parental leave and role models; (2) epistemic injustices—unfair assessments of women surgeons’ credibility by patients and colleagues; (3) stereotyped expectations that they will carry out more of surgery’s carework, such as meeting the emotional needs of patients and (4) objectification. Implicit biases arose in each category. Given that many of the biases identified in this study are small, are harmless on their own and are not necessarily under anyone’s conscious control, important questions arise regarding how they cause harm and how to address them. I draw on theoretical work on cumulative harm to answer these questions.","[{""name"": ""Katrina Hutchison"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.07.044"", ""10.1097/SLA.0b013e3182111120"", ""10.1016/j.amjsurg.2005.04.008"", ""10.1111/j.1445-2197.2008.04473.x"", ""10.1001/archsurg.2011.1693"", ""10.1016/j.amjsurg.2012.04.009"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199325603.001.0001"", ""10.1257/aer.90.4.715"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315212043"", ""10.1097/PRS.0000000000002668"", ""10.1136/bmj.311.6999.251"", ""10.4324/9781315212043-8"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195389364.003.0012"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32612-6"", ""10.1007/s10677-006-9019-5"", ""10.1111/hypa.12483"", ""10.1111/japp.12057"", ""10.1037//0022-3514.66.1.37""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Gender Studies', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

We distinguish two categories of potential weakness. The first category concerns persistent weaknesses, i.e., those which are not specific to big data research, but may be exacerbated by it. The second category concerns novel weaknesses, i.e., those which are created by and inherent to big data projects. Within this second category, we further distinguish between purview weaknesses related to the ERC’s scope (e.g., how big data projects may evade ERC review) and functional weaknesses, related to the ERC’s way of operating. Based on this analysis, we propose reforms aimed at improving the oversight capacity of ERCs in the era of big data science.ConclusionsWe believe the oversight mechanism could benefit from these reforms because they will help to overcome data-intensive research challenges and consequently benefit research at large.","[{""name"": ""Agata Ferretti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marcello Ienca"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Sheehan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alessandro Blasimme"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Edward S.

10.1007/s10551-020-04512-6,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,"Doing Good, Feeling Good? Entrepreneurs' Social Value Creation Beliefs and Work-Related Well-Being","AbstractEntrepreneurs with social goals face various challenges; insights into how these entrepreneurs experience and appreciate their work remain a black box though. Drawing on identity, conservation of resources, and person–organization fit theories, this study examines how entrepreneurs’ social value creation beliefs relate to their work-related well-being (job satisfaction, work engagement, and lack of work burnout), as well as how this process might be influenced by social concerns with respect to the common good. Using data from the German Public Value Atlas 2015 and 2019 and the Swiss Public Value Atlas 2017, a three-study design analyzes three samples of entrepreneurs in Germany and Switzerland. Study 1 reveals that entrepreneurs report higher job satisfaction when they believe their organization creates social value. Study 2 indicates that these beliefs relate negatively to work burnout; entrepreneurs’ perceptions of having meaningful work mediate this relationship. Study 3 affirms and extends these results by showing that a sense of work meaningfulness mediates the relationship between social value creation beliefs and work engagement and that this mediating role is more prominent among entrepreneurs with strong social concerns. This investigation thus identifies a critical pathway—the extent to which entrepreneurs experience their work activities as important and personally meaningful—that connects social value creation beliefs with enhanced work-related well-being, as well as how this process might vary with a personal orientation that embraces the common good.","[{""name"": ""Steven A.

We use triangulation of theories, namely deep ecology, legitimacy, and we introduce a new perspective to the stakeholder theory that considers species as a ‘stakeholder’. Using Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) regression, we examine a sample of 200 Fortune Global companies over 3 years. Our results indicate significant positive relations between ecologically conscious companies that are accountable for the protection of biodiversity and species extinction and external assurance, environmental performance, partnerships with socially responsible organizations and awards for sustainable activities. Our empirical results appear to be robust in controlling for possible endogeneities. Our findings contribute to the discussion on the concern of species loss and habitat destruction in the context of corporate accountability, especially in responding to the sixth mass extinction event and COVID-19 crisis. Our results can also guide the policymakers and stakeholders of the financial market in better decision making.","[{""name"": ""Lee Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Monomita Nandy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abeer Hassan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suman Lodh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed A.

For this reason, AI‐based CDSS has an impact on the doctor–patient relationship, shaping their decisions with its suggestions. We may be on the verge of a paradigm shift, where the doctor–patient relationship is no longer a dual relationship, but a triad. This paper analyses the role of AI‐based CDSS for shared decision‐making to better comprehend its promises and associated ethical issues. Moreover, it investigates how certain AI implementations may instead foster the inappropriate paradigm of paternalism. Understanding how AI relates to doctors and influences doctor–patient communication is essential to promote more ethical medical practice. Both doctors' and patients' autonomy need to be considered in the light of AI.","[{""name"": ""Giorgia Lorenzini"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Biomedical Ethics University of Basel Basel Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Laura Arbelaez Ossa"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Biomedical Ethics University of Basel Basel Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""David Martin Shaw"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Biomedical Ethics University of Basel Basel Switzerland"", ""Care and Public Health Research Institute Universiteit Maastricht Maastricht The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Bernice Simone Elger"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Biomedical Ethics University of Basel Basel Switzerland"", ""Center for Legal Medicine, Unit for Health Law and Humanitarian Medicine University of Geneva Geneva Switzerland""]}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Health Informatics', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The analysis is conducted at four levels of the engineering education system. First, the individual level is dedicated to findings about teaching practices reported by instructors. Second, the institutional level brings together findings about the implementation and presence of ethics within engineering programmes. Third, the level of policy situates findings about engineering ethics education in the context of accreditation. Finally, there is the level of the culture of engineering education. The multi-level analysis allows us to address some of the limitations of higher education research which tends to focus on individual actors such as instructors or remains focused on the levels of policy and practice without examining the deeper levels of paradigm and purpose guiding them. Our approach links some of the challenges of engineering ethics education with wider debates about its guiding paradigms. The main contribution of the paper is to situate the analysis of the theoretical and empirical findings reported in the literature on engineering ethics education in the context of broader discussions about the purpose of engineering education and the aims of reform programmes. We conclude by putting forward a series of recommendations for a socio-technical oriented reform of engineering educationforethics.","[{""name"": ""Diana Adela Martin"", ""affiliation"": []},

But how could this leave room for a learning theory, that shows that some algorithms are better than others? Drawing parallels to the philosophy of induction, we point out that the no-free-lunch results presuppose a conception of learning algorithms as purely data-driven. On this conception, every algorithm must have an inherent inductive bias, that wants justification. We argue that many standard learning algorithms should rather be understood as model-dependent: in each application they also require for input a model, representing a bias. Generic algorithms themselves, they can be given a model-relative justification.","[{""name"": ""Tom F. Sterkenburg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter D.

10.1007/s10551-022-05050-z,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,The Dawn of the AI Robots: Towards a New Framework of AI Robot Accountability,"AbstractBusiness, management, and business ethics literature pay little attention to the topic of AI robots. The broad spectrum of potential ethical issues pertains to using driverless cars, AI robots in care homes, and in the military, such as Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems. However, there is a scarcity of in-depth theoretical, methodological, or empirical studies that address these ethical issues, for instance, the impact of morality and where accountability resides in AI robots’ use. To address this dearth, this study offers a conceptual framework that interpretively develops the ethical implications of AI robot applications, drawing on descriptive and normative ethical theory. The new framework elaborates on how the locus of morality (human to AI agency) and moral intensity combine within context-specific AI robot applications, and how this might influence accountability thinking. Our theorization indicates that in situations of escalating AI agency and situational moral intensity, accountability is widely dispersed between actors and institutions. ‘Accountability clusters’ are outlined to illustrate interrelationships between the locus of morality, moral intensity, and accountability and how these invoke different categorical responses: (i) illegal, (ii) immoral, (iii) permissible, and (iv) supererogatory pertaining to using AI robots. These enable discussion of the ethical implications of using AI robots, and associated accountability challenges for a constellation of actors—from designer, individual/organizational users to the normative and regulative approaches of industrial/governmental bodies and intergovernmental regimes.","[{""name"": ""Zsófia Tóth"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert Caruana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thorsten Gruber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claudia Loebbecke"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5898/JHRI.6.1.Admoni"", ""10.1057/s41265-016-0032-4"", ""10.2308/isys-52633"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2687-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0994-7"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2020/14418"", ""10.1111/isj.12243"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2020.103239"", ""10.1023/A:1011957832141"", ""10.17705/2msqe.00016"", ""10.1023/A:1009903815157"", ""10.1007/BF00382936"", ""10.4017/gt.2009.08.02.002.00"", ""10.1111/isj.12243"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04226-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2950-4"", ""10.1108/JOSM-07-2017-0179"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2161-4"", ""10.15680/IJIRCCE.2016.0403062"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000062"", ""10.1002/job.228"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0073-5"", ""10.1080/00048409212345181"", ""10.1007/s10892-017-9252-2"", ""10.1007/s10806-008-9134-5"", ""10.1177/0170840618765568"", ""10.1080/16184742.2018.1518468"", ""10.2307/3857340"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8975.001.0001"", ""10.2307/3857520"", ""10.1080/0960085X.2018.1470776"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9175-5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195370294.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199990481.001.0001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01535"", ""10.5465/amj.2007.28166219"", ""10.5772/intechopen.79460"", ""10.1007/s11747-010-0193-6"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2020/15108"", ""10.2307/258867"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2180-1"", ""10.1007/s40926-017-0059-9"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2019.09.003"", ""10.2214/AJR.17.19178"", ""10.1007/BF01666535"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0956-0_3"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.10.006"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3239-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3921-3"", ""10.1057/s41265-017-0037-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1837-5"", ""10.1109/MIS.2006.80"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1pwt9w5"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1193-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139519243"", ""10.1038/521415a"", ""10.1023/A:1025061632660"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.3389/frobt.2017.00075"", ""10.5465/ame.2004.13837400"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3979-y"", ""10.2143/EP.17.2.2049263"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-32552-1_80"", ""10.2307/41166711"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04182-z"", ""10.22215/timreview/1312"", ""10.1108/JOSM-04-2018-0119"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.07.001"", ""10.1080/20479700.2018.1498220"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8683.2012.00926.x"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2010.09.035"", ""10.3726/978-3-0353-0377-3""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1017/apa.2019.30,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION,0101 Philosophy,Naive Normativity: The Social Foundation of Moral Cognition,"AbstractTo answer tantalizing questions such as whether animals are moral or how morality evolved, I propose starting with a somewhat less fraught question: do animals have normative cognition? Recent psychological research suggests that normative thinking, or ought-thought, begins early in human development. Recent philosophical research suggests that folk psychology is grounded in normative thought. Recent primatology research finds evidence of sophisticated cultural and social learning capacities in great apes. Drawing on these three literatures, I argue that the human variety of social cognition and moral cognition encompass the same cognitive capacities and that the nonhuman great apes may also be normative beings. To make this argument, I develop an account of animal social norms that shares key properties with Cristina Bicchieri's account of social norms but which lowers the cognitive requirements for having a social norm. I propose a set of four early developing prerequisites implicated in social cognition that make up what I call naïve normativity: (1) the ability to identify agents, (2) sensitivity to in-group/out-group differences, (3) the capacity for social learning of group traditions, and (4) responsiveness to appropriateness. I review the ape cognition literature and present preliminary empirical evidence supporting the existence of social norms and naïve normativity in great apes. While there is more empirical work to be done, I hope to have offered a framework for studying normativity in other species, and I conclude that we should be open to the possibility that normative cognition is yet another ancient cognitive endowment that is not human-unique.","[{""name"": ""KRISTIN ANDREWS"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1073/pnas.0704452104"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.05.029"", ""10.1007/s10071-004-0239-6"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2012.03.031"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.07.016"", ""10.1016/0162-3095(86)90050-6"", ""10.1007/s10329-006-0022-1"", ""10.1038/s41562-017-0264-5"", ""10.1007/s10071-003-0204-9"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(95)00661-H"", ""10.1017/S0140525X98001745"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674063075"", ""10.1098/rspb.2004.2947"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.019"", ""10.1007/s10539-017-9599-6"", ""10.1007/s10329-010-0212-8"", ""10.1348/026151009X479475"", ""10.1111/j.1750-8606.2011.00178.x"", ""10.1098/rspb.2007.1542"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198753858.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.09.002"", ""10.1073/pnas.0606015103"", ""10.4159/9780674726369"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9283.001.0001"", ""10.1038/415755a"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2006.08.019"", ""10.1111/sjp.12121"", ""10.1073/pnas.0705555104"", ""10.1073/pnas.1611826113"", ""10.1111/desc.12586"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0032494"", ""10.1006/anbe.1994.1285"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190622046.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13869795.2015.1032331"", ""10.1073/pnas.1706286114"", ""10.1098/rstb.2009.0069"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01860.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-5558-4_8"", ""10.1007/s12110-015-9228-5"", ""10.1002/ajp.22259"", ""10.1073/pnas.0705345104"", ""10.1126/science.1221685"", ""10.1080/15248371003699977"", ""10.1007/s10071-014-0766-8"", ""10.1073/pnas.1719445115"", ""10.1111/cdev.12798"", ""10.1037/a0034481"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.0434a.x"", ""10.2307/1128704"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2012.05.003"", ""10.1080/09515080701545981"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.24.4.470"", ""10.1007/s10539-015-9495-x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8441.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.037"", ""10.1007/s10764-006-9111-7"", ""10.1037/0735-7036.114.4.381"", ""10.1073/pnas.1220806110"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.44.3.875"", ""10.1073/pnas.0804141105"", ""10.1016/j.cogdev.2008.07.004"", ""10.1007/s10329-004-0082-z"", ""10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01269.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1203179109"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0007416"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262016797.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400830336-011"", ""10.1038/nature01963"", ""10.1163/15685390152032488"", ""10.1002/ajp.20214"", ""10.1038/s41467-017-00360-7"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2007.05.031"", ""10.1016/S0163-6383(99)00007-7"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199842001.001.0001"", ""10.1163/1568539X-00003146""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In turn, some editors have stated their desire to improve the EDI of their journals and of the wider scientific community. The Royal Society of Chemistry established a minimum set of requirements aimed at improving EDI in scholarly publishing. Additionally, several resources were reported to have the potential to improve EDI, but their effectiveness and feasibility are yet to be determined. In this commentary we suggest six approaches, based on the Royal Society of Chemistry set of requirements, that journals could implement to improve EDI. They are: (1) adopt a journal EDI statement with clear, actionable steps to achieve it; (2) promote the use of inclusive and bias-free language; (3) appoint a journal’s EDI director or lead; (4) establish a EDI mentoring approach; (5) monitor adherence to EDI principles; and (6) publish reports on EDI actions and achievements. We also provide examples of journals that have implemented some of these strategies, and discuss the roles of peer reviewers, authors, researchers, academic institutes, and funders in improving EDI.","[{""name"": ""Omar Dewidar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nour Elmestekawy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vivian Welch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/leap.1414"", ""10.1016/j.tips.2014.06.005"", ""10.1002/ece3.4993"", ""10.1200/JCO.2021.39.15_suppl.11007"", ""10.5860/crln.78.10.548"", ""10.1093/bjsopen/zraa064"", ""10.1177/1077699020904169"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000014304"", ""10.1002/wps.20389"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.2002760"", ""10.1080/23808985.2020.1804434"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32267-0"", ""10.1016/j.jnma.2017.03.003.2017Autumn"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32611-4"", ""10.1126/sciadv.abd0299"", ""10.1016/j.thorsurg.2019.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2017.07.002"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000552"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2012.06.003"", ""10.1186/s41073-017-0027-x"", ""10.1093/infdis/jiz174"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-07634-8"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-05316-5"", ""10.31219/osf.io/wst4q"", ""10.1002/rth2.12610"", ""10.1056/NEJMsa053234"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0083138"", ""10.5694/j.1326-5377.2006.tb00557.x"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-07245-9"", ""10.1177/1744987110387741"", ""10.1086/669608"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097"", ""10.1177/00333549141291S203"", ""10.1136/jech-2015-205701"", ""10.1016/j.bar.2020.100910"", ""10.18549/PharmPract.2017.01.943"", ""10.1186/s13643-020-01328-3"", ""10.1186/s13643-017-0663-8"", ""10.1186/s13643-021-01780-9"", ""10.1186/s41073-016-0007-6"", ""10.1002/ehf2.13733"", ""10.1136/bmj.j5085"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1001333"", ""10.1080/0309877X.2011.614933"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aao6373"", ""10.1080/10401334.2014.910465"", ""10.1093/biosci/biu076"", ""10.1093/biosci/biv138"", ""10.1007/s11162-008-9097-4"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0143093"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32609-6"", ""10.1126/sciadv.1400005"", ""10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.011"", ""10.1038/s41550-017-0141"", ""10.1073/pnas.1915378117""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

We conceptualize constellations of transdisciplinary practices by building up on a social practice perspective. From this perspective, knowledge and learning are ‘done’ in interrelated practices that may span multiple fields like the professional, educational, and research field. Such practices integrate knowledge across disciplines (interdisciplinarity) and sectors (intersectorality) in order to learn to enact, educate, and research complex responsible management. Accordingly, constellations of collaborative transdisciplinary practices span the three layers of the responsible management field: Professional responsible management, responsible management education, and responsible management research. We apply this framework to map both recent responsible management learning publications and contributions to this special issue. We notice that although the responsible management field’s aspiration for transdisciplinarity is high the degree to which it has been realized is low. This results in our proposal for a research agenda, which points out impediments to transdisciplinary, and research directions for the responsible management learning field. We also highlight theoretical implications of our conceptual framework for the larger transdisciplinarity discussion.","[{""name"": ""Oliver Laasch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dirk

Since the 25th May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has applied as valid law concerning genomic research in the EU and now occupies a dominant position in the legal landscape. Yet, the position of the GDPR concerning broad consent has recently been cause for concern in the genomic research community. Whilst the text of the GDPR apparently supports the practice, recent jurisprudence contains language which is decidedly less positive. This article takes an in-depth look at the situation concerning broad consent under the GDPR and – despite the understandable concern flowing from recent jurisprudence – offers a positive outlook. This positive outlook is argued from three perspectives, each of which is significant in defining the current, and ongoing, legitimacy and utility of broad consent under the GDPR: the principled, the legal technical, and the practical.","[{""name"": ""Dara Hallinan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203940402"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2016.02.006"", ""10.1186/s40504-014-0020-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-33525-4_6"", ""10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70618-0"", ""10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834161b8"", ""10.1177/1073110516644188"", ""10.1017/S0963180111000314"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511495342"", ""10.2196/jmir.7108"", ""10.1093/phe/phr020"", ""10.1097/GIM.0b013e31821d2f88"", ""10.1038/ejhg.2012.282"", ""10.1016/j.ejmg.2016.04.002"", ""10.1159/000336604"", ""10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.029"", ""10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.005""]",['Medicine'],"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Physiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"

Those accused usually respond (if not by an admission of fault) by attempting to show that they are doing no such thing. In this paper, I argue that we ought to embrace the charge, rather than angrily reject it. I argue that this response can draw support from cognitive science, on the one hand, and from social epistemology on the other. I claim that we may appropriately concede that what we are doing is (inter alia) virtue signalling, because virtue signalling is morally appropriate. It neither expresses vices, nor is hypocritical, nor does it degrade the quality of public moral discourse. Signalling our commitment to norms is a central and justifiable function of moral discourse, and the same signals provide (higher-order) evidence that is appropriately taken into account in forming moral beliefs.","[{""name"": ""Neil Levy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0030-5073(83)90151-4"", ""10.1073/pnas.1706588114"", ""10.1146/annurev-polisci-051117-050904"", ""10.1215/00318108-2006-035"", ""10.3366/epi.2006.3.1-2.68"", ""10.1007/BF00299889"", ""10.1007/s10539-012-9327-1"", ""10.1037/a0025882"", ""10.1038/s41562-017-0151"", ""10.1177/1043463104046694"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00093.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0223749"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065192"", ""10.2307/3544135"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.03.005"", ""10.1093/poq/nfs038"", ""10.1037/pspi0000186"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199577477.003.0015"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276011.001.0001"", ""10.1017/apa.2019.29"", ""10.2307/2411028"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137400901"", ""10.2307/j.ctt32bbp0"", ""10.1002/bdm.460"", ""10.4324/9780203025352-14"", ""10.1037/xge0000471"", ""10.1111/nous.12316"", ""10.1002/evan.10120"", ""10.1177/1069397103037002003"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9033.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00148"", ""10.1111/papa.12075""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s11229-018-01951-7,SYNTHESE,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Varieties of responsibility: two problems of responsible innovation,"AbstractThe notion of responsible innovation suggests that innovators carry additional responsibilities (to society, stakeholders, users) beyond those commonly suggested. In this paper, we will discuss the meaning of these novel responsibilities focusing on two philosophical problems of attributing such responsibilities to innovators. The first is the allocation of responsibilities to innovators. Innovation is a process that involves a multiplicity of agents and unpredictable, far-reaching causal chains from innovation to social impacts, which creates great uncertainty. A second problem is constituted by possible trade-offs between different kinds of responsibility. It is evident that attributing backward-looking responsibility for product failures diminishes the willingness to learn about such defects and to take forward-looking responsibility. We will argue that these problems can be overcome by elaborating what it is exactly that innovators are responsible for. In this manner, we will distinguish more clearly between holding responsible and taking responsibility. This opens a space for ‘supererogatory’ responsibilities. Second, we will argue that both innovation processes and outcomes can be objects of innovators’ responsibility. Third, we will analyze different kinds of responsibility (blameworthiness, accountability, liability, obligation and virtue) and show that the functions of their attribution are not necessarily contradictory. Based on this conceptual refinement, we will argue that accountability, responsibility-as-virtue and the willingness to take responsibility are crucial for responsible innovation.","[{""name"": ""Ibo van de Poel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Sand"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0270467610391237"", ""10.2307/3327571"", ""10.1017/S0953820806002172"", ""10.1007/s11948-010-9225-3"", ""10.1007/s11948-009-9189-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511814594"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2017.09.012"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625053"", ""10.1002/9781118551424.ch7"", ""10.1177/004839319602600304"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663758"", ""10.1111/j.1088-4963.2000.00342.x"", ""10.1002/9781118551424.ch2"", ""10.3920/JCNS2014.x017"", ""10.1007/s40926-017-0055-0"", ""10.1007/s10892-005-7989-5"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.05.008"", ""10.1177/0162243905285844"", ""10.1201/9781315379593-4"", ""10.4324/9781315734217"", ""10.1002/9781118551424.ch4"", ""10.1007/s11948-011-9277-z"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199697540.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1878-4_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-93468-6_2"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199272273.003.0011"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199272273.003.0010"", ""10.1007/s10677-008-9109-7""]",['Neuroscience'],['Cognitive Neuroscience'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Belief ‘choice’ is subject to an important constraint, however: people can only bring themselves to believe things for which they can find rationalizations. When preferences for similar beliefs are widespread, this constraint generates rationalization markets, social structures in which agents compete to produce rationalizations in exchange for money and social rewards. I explore the nature of such markets, I draw on political media to illustrate their characteristics and behaviour, and I highlight their implications for understanding motivated cognition and misinformation.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Williams"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jesp.2017.04.003"", ""10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00071-4"", ""10.1093/bjps/17.4.319"", ""10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01060.x"", ""10.1080/09515089.2017.1291929"", ""10.1257/000282803322655392"", ""10.1086/258464"", ""10.1007/s11109-019-09528-x"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01497.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001"", ""10.1111/0162-895X.00230"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.04.006"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-214850-7.50022-X"", ""10.1515/9781400888818"", ""10.1136/jamia.2000.0070215"", ""10.1037/h0042769"", ""10.1515/9781400884711"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.1986.tb00078.x"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1002/9781118011690.ch10"", ""10.4324/9780203946558"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.211"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511809477"", ""10.4324/9781315146782"", ""10.1257/aer.102.5.2183"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511621253"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(72)90016-3"", ""10.1086/499414"", ""10.3982/ECTA7195"", ""10.1257/jep.30.3.141"", ""10.1017/S0003055421000290"", ""10.1111/jcom.12284"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190677176.001.0001"", ""10.1257/00028280260136363"", ""10.3386/w26669"", ""10.1111/mila.12326"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198835943.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192893338.003.0009"", ""10.1162/qjec.122.3.1187"", ""10.1017/S0022381611000569"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-214850-7.50025-5"", ""10.1257/0002828054825619"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01402.x"", ""10.1257/aer.20160812"", ""10.2307/1884852"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9221.2010.00772.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.2024292118"", ""10.1038/s41562-018-0301-z"", ""10.1515/9781400823970"", ""10.1177/0963721414534257"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226524689.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0093650209333030"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02549-8""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Covering the intersection of sustainable consumption and anti-consumption, previous studies relied on socio-cognitive models to explain this decision. In order to extend their findings, we consider the moral and emotional perspectives to examine reducing consumption for environmental reasons in a particular context, i.e. air travel. It is against this backdrop that we propose a conceptual model that includes moral foundations as the main antecedent, followed by anticipated guilt and personal responsibility, while intention to reduce consumption (i.e. air travel) for environmental reasons, positive word of mouth about reducing air travel (WOM) and environmental activism represent the outcomes. The proposed model is tested on a sample of 511 respondents from a UK online consumer panel. Our results confirm the importance of moral foundations, anticipated guilt and personal responsibility and their interplay in the prediction of intention to reduce consumption for environmental reasons. Anticipated guilt influences WOM, while personal responsibility influences activism. In addition, intentions to reduce consumption for environmental reasons have a positive impact on WOM and environmental activism. There are several implications for public policy makers and NGOs that fight against climate change that derive from these findings, as well as research opportunities for academics interested in this topic.","[{""name"": ""Barbara Culiberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hichang Cho"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mateja Kos Koklic"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vesna Zabkar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jom.2017.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.02.038"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.05.006"", ""10.1002/mar.21392"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1841-9"", ""10.1002/mar.21267"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2006.12.002"", ""10.1108/07363769410065454"", ""10.1002/jcpy.1038"", ""10.1177/0276146712462892"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.043"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.01.025"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3305-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3676-2"", ""10.1332/204378919X15764490951187"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2017.02.052"", ""10.1002/mar.10009"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0163852"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2009.11.006"", ""10.1080/13504622.2015.1068278"", ""10.15171/ijhpm.2014.68"", ""10.1177/0956797612449177"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2010.10.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3023-z"", ""10.5840/beq20147313"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucx047"", ""10.1016/j.jairtraman.2019.101722"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-407236-7.00002-4"", ""10.1037/t48554-000"", ""10.1037/a0015141"", ""10.1037/a0021847"", ""10.2753/JOA0091-3367360402"", ""10.1089/cyber.2013.0658"", ""10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2012.12.005"", ""10.1177/0047287513500393"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3616-1"", ""10.1111/joca.12104"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0042366"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.01.023"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2013.05.005"", ""10.1002/sd.1598"", ""10.1027//1016-9040.4.2.59"", ""10.1006/jevp.1998.9123"", ""10.1080/09669582.2017.1409230"", ""10.1086/670610"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2012.01.006"", ""10.1111/joca.12089"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.01.024"", ""10.1002/mar.21330"", ""10.1086/208861"", ""10.1038/s41558-020-0797-x"", ""10.1177/0276146717723964"", ""10.1016/j.jairtraman.2015.12.007"", ""10.4337/9781783471270.00027"", ""10.1080/0267257X.2015.1061584"", ""10.1016/j.jretai.2012.08.001"", ""10.1002/mar.21319"", ""10.1038/nclimate1378"", ""10.1080/0267257X.2015.1059352"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.53.2.247"", ""10.1080/09669582.2020.1730388"", ""10.1080/14693062.2018.1551186"", ""10.1002/jsc.2389"", ""10.1016/j.joep.2013.07.005"", ""10.1177/0013916505286012"", ""10.1002/mar.21277"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.01.006"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60358-5"", ""10.1177/0743915618811851"", ""10.1002/mar.21299"", ""10.1177/002224298104500310"", ""10.1002/mar.10008"", ""10.1002/mar.20188"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-5905-3"", ""10.1111/0022-4537.00175"", ""10.1108/MD-12-2016-0907"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2287-4"", ""10.1016/j.cobeha.2021.02.008"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.11.021"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.119"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.06.009"", ""10.1089/cyber.2012.0235"", ""10.1080/0267257X.2010.500136"", ""10.1080/02672571003633610"", ""10.1007/BF00992963"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.08.011"", ""10.1108/BFJ-03-2018-0200"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0687-7"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101408""]","['Environmental Science', 'Business, Management and Accounting', 'Psychology']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Applied Psychology', 'Marketing']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

We have divergent views regarding the morality of abortion, but have come together to address the evidence for fetal pain. Most reports on the possibility of fetal pain have focused on developmental neuroscience. Reports often suggest that the cortex and intact thalamocortical tracts are necessary for pain experience. Given that the cortex only becomes functional and the tracts only develop after 24 weeks, many reports rule out fetal pain until the final trimester. Here, more recent evidence calling into question the necessity of the cortex for pain and demonstrating functional thalamic connectivity into the subplate is used to argue that the neuroscience cannot definitively rule out fetal pain before 24 weeks. We consider the possibility that the mere experience of pain, without the capacity for self reflection, is morally significant. We believe that fetal pain does not have to be equivalent to a mature adult human experience to matter morally, and so fetal pain might be considered as part of a humane approach to abortion.","[{""name"": ""Stuart WG Derbyshire"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John C Bockmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1056/NEJM198711193172105"", ""10.1056/NEJM199201023260109"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(87)90065-1"", ""10.4324/9781315742205-37"", ""10.1136/bmjsrh-2018-200149"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD006714.pub2"", ""10.1136/bmj.2.5365.1107"", ""10.1056/NEJM198203113061006"", ""10.1093/bja/aer097"", ""10.1159/000338146"", ""10.1016/j.tice.2008.04.001"", ""10.1213/ANE.0b013e318232066c"", ""10.1007/s00540-009-0763-2"", ""10.1213/01.ane.0000268145.52345.55"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-41119-8"", ""10.1001/jama.294.8.947"", ""10.1053/j.sane.2006.09.002"", ""10.1053/j.semperi.2007.07.004"", ""10.1017/S0965539508002271"", ""10.1111/papr.12207"", ""10.1007/s00221-010-2340-1"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.084"", ""10.1007/s00429-014-0986-3"", ""10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.0653"", ""10.1111/j.1651-2227.2010.01811.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1710793114"", ""10.1017/S0140525X07000891"", ""10.1017/S092493380000256X"", ""10.1016/0304-3959(96)03135-1"", ""10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000303"", ""10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000357"", ""10.1016/j.siny.2014.08.003"", ""10.1017/S0031819100052827"", ""10.5840/faithphil200623219"", ""10.1136/jme.2010.039537"", ""10.1136/jme.27.suppl_2.ii28"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(94)91279-3"", ""10.1152/jn.00682.2015""]",['Medicine'],"['Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)]]"

Despite the best efforts to achieve this, however, official actions on tainted symbols often fail to take place. In such cases, I argue that political vandalism—the unauthorized defacement, destruction, or removal of political symbols—may be morally permissible or even obligatory. This is when, and insofar as, political vandalism serves as fitting counter‐speech that undermines the authority of tainted symbols in ways that match their publicity, refuses to let them speak in our name, and challenges the derogatory messages expressed through a mechanism I call derogatory pedestalling: the glorification or honoring of certain individuals or ideologies that can only make sense when members of a targeted group are taken to be inferior.","[{""name"": ""Ten‐Herng Lai"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Philosophy Australian National University  Canberra Australian Capital Territory 2601 Australia""]}]","[""10.3366/epi.2006.3.1-2.8"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00820.x"", ""10.1017/S0265052500002545"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198245537.001.0001"", ""10.1111/josp.12151"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2014.02.009"", ""10.1111/nous.12090"", ""10.4324/9780429439001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9833.2009.01474.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199592944.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phib.12022"", ""10.5040/9781472544827.ch-006"", ""10.1177/0191453716638562"", ""10.1007/s10892-018-9265-5"", ""10.1007/s10982-013-9189-y"", ""10.1007/s11158-014-9249-7"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract20154114"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190872199.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-93907-0_27"", ""10.1126/science.1203557"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13504630.2015.1128810"", ""10.1057/9781137003904_4"", ""10.5840/monist197357135"", ""10.1111/1475-4975.00042"", ""10.1126/science.1091721"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198841425.003.0004"", ""10.1080/00048409912349061"", ""10.1111/j.1088-4963.2012.01214.x"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201711125"", ""10.1177/1470594X18764613"", ""10.1111/papa.12162"", ""10.1111/j.1088-4963.1998.tb00058.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199236282.003.0005"", ""10.1111/japp.12034"", ""10.1086/707215"", ""10.1057/9780230251175_6"", ""10.4159/9780674042582"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00129"", ""10.5840/philtopics201745215"", ""10.1111/jopp.12176"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2010.00365.x"", ""10.4324/9780203758502"", ""10.1111/jopp.12130"", ""10.1515/9781400865802"", ""10.2307/3312647"", ""10.1017/S0305741006000063"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201642218"", ""10.1177/0032329205278462"", ""10.1086/292295"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065086"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511809286.002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195367881.003.0009"", ""10.1080/03057240.2016.1277340""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Philosophy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Law']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Drawing on notions from the regulatory and sociology literature, i.e. transparency and normativity, and by interviewing anti-slavery activists and experts, this study explores the limitations of the disclosure and transparency requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act and, more specifically, how anti-slavery activists experience and interpret the new regulations and the regulators’ implementation of the regulation. This research found limited confidence among anti-slavery activists regarding the Act’s call for transparency in relation to the elimination of slavery from global supply chains. The research also found that the limits of the transparency provisions within the Act appear to hinder the attainment of normativity. This study provides new and unique insights into the critical role that social activists play in exposing the lack of corporate transparency and failures of responsibility to protect workers within global supply chains.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Azizul Islam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris J.

10.1111/phpr.12744,PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH,0101 Philosophy,Empathy and the Value of Humane Understanding,"AbstractEmpathy is a form of emotionally charged imaginative perspective‐taking. It is also the unique source of a particular form of understanding, which I will call humane understanding. Humane understanding consists in the direct apprehension of the intelligibility of others’ emotions. This apprehension is an epistemic good whose ethical significance is multifarious. In this paper, I focus on elaborating the sense in which humane understanding of others is non‐instrumentally valuable to its recipients. People have a complex but profound need to be humanely understood. Because we respond to others’ very real need when we pursue this sort of understanding of their emotions, empathy is best understood as itself a way of caring, rather than just a means to promote other caring behavior.","[{""name"": ""Olivia Bailey"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California Berkeley""]}]","[""10.1080/13869795.2013.825004"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262012973.003.0002"", ""10.1177/0146167203254600"", ""10.1080/09608788.2019.1667292"", ""10.1080/09672559.2019.1598081"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199577507.003.0009"", ""10.4324/9780203361894"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539956.003.0002"", ""10.1111/j.2041-6962.2011.00054.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511819568.003"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.2007.01105.x"", ""10.2307/2708680"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262012973.003.0007"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226661926.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199253048.001.0001"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1001968"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615894"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539956.003.0015"", ""10.1007/s10746-015-9361-5"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00097.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199969470.003.0005"", ""10.4324/9781315282015-20"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.00272"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/21.4.291"", ""10.1111/sjp.12097"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539956.003.0003"", ""10.2307/2185873"", ""10.1111/1468-0017.00178"", ""10.1057/9780230347809"", ""10.1111/phpe.12090"", ""10.1007/s12152-017-9350-7"", ""10.1111/j.2041-6962.2011.00069.x"", ""10.1111/1467-9329.00062"", ""10.1007/s10677-013-9417-4"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-1051-5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199696512.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Philosophy', 'Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1111/beer.12265,BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Does context matter for sustainability disclosure? Institutional factors in Southeast Asia,"AbstractCorporate sustainability is a dynamic, socially constructed concept. Relatedly, to understand the variations in the disclosure of corporate sustainability activities across countries, we need to inherently explore their underlying sociopolitical contexts. At present our understanding in this regard, is deficient. We respond to this extant research gap by adopting a multi‐country approach to investigate the relationship between countries' institutional environments and firms' sustainability disclosure (SD) practices, across six countries in the Southeast Asian region. Our findings reflect a common focus of Southeast Asian firms on community and human resources (HRs) related disclosures. Nevertheless, nuanced differences in their overall SD levels confirm the influence of differing legal, normative, and sociocultural systems in engendering greater disclosure and transparency at a national level. By quantifying the institutional environment and identifying external influencing factors, our study provides a useful framework grounded in neo‐institutional theory to widen the existing understanding of how institutional pressures can be measured and compared across different contexts.","[{""name"": ""Mi Tran"", ""affiliation"": [""Huddersfield Business School University of

10.1007/s11229-018-01956-2,SYNTHESE,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0101 Philosophy,Deep disagreement and hinge epistemology,"AbstractThis paper explores the application of hinge epistemology to deep disagreement. Hinge epistemology holds that there is a class of commitments—hinge commitments—which play a fundamental role in the structure of belief and rational evaluation: they are the most basic general ‘presuppositions’ of our world views which make it possible for us to evaluate certain beliefs or doubts as rational. Deep disagreements seem to crucially involve disagreements over such fundamental commitments. In this paper, I consider pessimism about deep disagreement, the thesis that such disagreements are rationally irresolvable, and ask whether the Wittgensteinian account of deep disagreement—according to which such disagreements are disagreements over hinge commitments—provides adequate support for pessimism. I argue that the answer to this question depends on what hinge commitments are and what our epistemic relation to them is supposed to be. I argue for two core claims. First, that non-epistemic theories of hinge commitments provide adequate support for pessimism. Nevertheless, such theories have highly implausible consequences in the context of deep disagreement. Secondly, at least one epistemic theory of hinge commitments, the entitlement theory, permits optimism about such disagreements. As such, while hinge epistemology is mainly pessimistic about deep disagreement, it doesn’t have to be.","[{""name"": ""Chris Ranalli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.22329/il.v25i1.1045"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2007.00292.x"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00465.x"", ""10.1215/00318108-2006-035"", ""10.1057/9781137501899"", ""10.22329/il.v25i1.1041"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195173079.003.0016"", ""10.22329/il.v7i1.2696"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9753-y"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2006.00255.x"", ""10.1007/s11229-006-0012-2"", ""10.1007/s10677-014-9523-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199698370.003.0003"", ""10.1017/epi.2015.10"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1041-0"", ""10.1163/22105700-00603010"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199682751.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10670-013-9448-1"", ""10.1007/s11245-018-9576-y"", ""10.1057/9780230504462"", ""10.1163/22105700-00603003"", ""10.1007/s11229-008-9330-x"", ""10.22329/il.v28i2.541"", ""10.1007/s11229-007-9278-2"", ""10.1002/9781444392494.ch14"", ""10.1515/9781400873913"", ""10.1111/phpr.12280"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199693818.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199682669.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12327"", ""10.1111/j.0309-7013.2004.00121.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In response to the increased interest in social justice, medical educators are thinking of ways to decolonise education and produce doctors who can meet the complex needs of diverse populations. This paper aims to explore decolonising ideas of healing within medical education following recent events including the University College London Medical School’s Decolonising the Medical Curriculum public engagement event, the Wellcome Collection’s Ayurvedic Man: Encounters with Indian Medicine exhibition and its symposium on Decolonising Health, SOAS University of London’s Applying a Decolonial Lens to Research Structures, Norms and Practices in Higher Education Institutions and University College London Anthropology Department’s Flourishing Diversity Series. We investigate implications of ‘recentring’ displaced indigenous healing systems, medical pluralism and highlight the concept of cultural humility in medical training, which while challenging, may benefit patients. From a global health perspective, climate change debates and associated civil protests around the issues resonate with indigenous ideas of planetary health, which focus on the harmonious interconnection of the planet, the environment and human beings. Finally, we look further at its implications in clinical practice, addressing the background of inequality in healthcare among the BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) populations, intersectionality and an increasing recognition of the role of inter-generational trauma originating from the legacy of slavery. By analysing these theories and conversations that challenge the biomedical view of health, we conclude that encouraging healthcare educators and professionals to adopt a ‘decolonising attitude’ can address the complex power imbalances in health and further improve person-centred care.","[{""name"": ""Amali U Lokugamage"", ""affiliation"": [""Clinical and Professional Practice, University College London Medical School, London, UK"", ""Women’s Health, Whittington Health NHS Trust, London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Tharanika Ahillan"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London Medical School, London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""S D C Pathberiya"", ""affiliation"": [""Acculegal Solicitors, London, UK""]}]","[""10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30022-6"", ""10.1136/bmj.l300"", ""10.1136/bmj.i2452"", ""10.1080/09502380601164353"", ""10.1111/j.1742-1241.2007.01436.x"", ""10.1001/archinternmed.2010.482"", ""10.3109/01443615.2014.920794"", ""10.3109/01443615.2015.1110121"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2753.2010.01562.x"", ""10.1176/appi.ps.201500217"", ""10.1037/amp0000289"", ""10.1080/2201473X.2016.1199828"", ""10.3390/brainsci8050083"", ""10.1080/09687599.2011.602860"", ""10.1038/srep00902"", ""10.1136/jech-2017-210082"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61038-8"", ""10.1177/1757975919829713"", ""10.1186/s12992-015-0093-0"", ""10.1002/dta.301"", ""10.1002/cvj.12069"", ""10.1057/fr.2008.4"", ""10.1097/EDE.0000000000000104"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2014.302297"", ""10.1111/1471-0528.13978"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2014.302506"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03530.x"", ""10.1080/10408363.2018.1476455"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD009405.pub2"", ""10.1177/1043659615592677""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Our research extends extant corporate hypocrisy literature by highlighting the role of individual stakeholders’ inferences about a genuine CSR motive in their judgments of corporate hypocrisy. This can serve to differentiate perceived corporate hypocrisy from inconsistency that arises because of a lack of ability and/or resources. Our research further identifies a source for such perceptions: individual stakeholders’ perceptions of firm warmth generated by a firm’s prior record of CSR. In addition, we find that when CSR and CSI are in the same (vs. different) domains, it can strengthen perceptions of hypocrisy. This provides direct evidence to explain why markets react differently when CSR and CSI events occur in the same domain (vs. different ones).","[{""name"": ""Zhifeng Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haiming Hang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephen Pavelin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lynda Porter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0149206311436079"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2003.12.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3973-4"", ""10.1002/smj.750"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2009.00274.x"", ""10.1177/0007650315584317"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.004"", ""10.5465/amj.2014.0795"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3788-3"", ""10.1086/208604"", ""10.3758/BRM.40.3.879"", ""10.1177/0001839217695089"", ""10.1111/joms.12064"", ""10.1111/peps.12029"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucx047"", ""10.1509/jmkg.73.6.77"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.31193458"", ""10.1177/0007650305281939"", ""10.1037/pspa0000056"", ""10.2308/accr-50577"", ""10.1007/s11747-016-0510-9"", ""10.1177/1350508413478310"", ""10.1086/651566"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1866371"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucx053"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(10)43003-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3425-y"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2017.04.002"", ""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1177/0007650316660044"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.82.6.878"", ""10.1177/0146167215572134"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2006.00597.x"", ""10.1207/s15328007sem1201_1"", ""10.1509/jmkr.38.2.225.18838"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(07)00002-0"", ""10.1016/j.jretai.2014.10.001"", ""10.1177/0146167210385922"", ""10.1177/0170840603024003910"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2011.10.004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2009.00276.x"", ""10.5465/amr.2010.0522"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2009.03.009"", ""10.1177/1745691610393980"", ""10.1057/crr.2015.4"", ""10.3758/BF03193146"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2014.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.csda.2004.03.005"", ""10.5465/amr.2005.18378878"", ""10.1509/jmkg.73.6.198"", ""10.1057/palgrave.crr.1540137"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00984.x"", ""10.1509/jm.15.0324"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2011.01627.x"", ""10.1177/0007650308315494"", ""10.1016/j.pubrev.2015.11.009"", ""10.1016/j.jcps.2011.09.006"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-G"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2018.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2014.12.003"", ""10.1007/s11097-007-9066-y"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3169241""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"

Clause learning entails adding a new clause for each conflict during backtrack search. This new clause prevents the same conflict from occurring again during the search process. Moreover, sophisticated techniques such as the identification of unique implication points in a graph of implications, allow creating clauses that more precisely identify the assignments responsible for conflicts. Learned clauses often have a large number of literals. As a result, another paradigm shift has been the development of new data structures, namely lazy data structures, which are particularly effective at handling large clauses. These data structures are called lazy due to being in general unable to provide the actual status of a clause. Efficiency concerns and the use of lazy data structures motivated the introduction of dynamic heuristics that do not require knowing the precise status of clauses. This chapter describes the ingredients of conflict-driven clause learning SAT solvers, namely conflict analysis, lazy data structures, search restarts, conflict-driven heuristics and clause deletion strategies.","[{""name"": ""Joao Marques-Silva"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ines Lynce"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sharad Malik"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Engineering'],['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)]]"

First, I highlight the benefits of big data and machine learning analytics in neuroscience for basic and translational research. Then, I describe some of the technological, social and psychological barriers for securing brain data from unwarranted access. In this context, I then examine ways in which safeguards at the hardware and software level, as well as increasing “data literacy” in society, may enhance the security of neurotechnological devices and protect the privacy of personal brain data. Regarding ethical and legal ramifications of big brain data, I first discuss effects on the autonomy, the sense of agency and authenticity, as well as the self that may result from the interaction between users and intelligent, particularly closed-loop, neurotechnological devices. I then discuss the impact of the “datafication” in basic and clinical neuroscience research on the just distribution of resources and access to these transformative technologies. In the legal realm, I examine possible legal consequences that arises from the increasing abilities to decode brain states and their corresponding subjective phenomenological experiences on the hitherto inaccessible privacy of these information. Finally, I discuss the implications of big brain data for national and international regulatory policies and models of good data governance.","[{""name"": ""Philipp Kellmeyer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.bios.2016.12.001"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1001953"", ""10.1038/nbt.3870"", ""10.1038/nbt.3887"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.2001402"", ""10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032816-044949"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.16010077."", ""10.3389/fncom.2016.00094"", ""10.1111/newe.12013"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790850"", ""10.1002/hbm.23730"", ""10.1109/ECMR.2017.8098658"", ""10.1038/nature18933"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2015.01.010"", ""10.1038/537S49a."", ""10.1038/nature21056"", ""10.1088/1741-2560/14/1/016002"", ""10.1038/ncomms12474"", ""10.1109/ECMR.2017.8098658"", ""10.1146/annurev-vision-082114-035447"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003724"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.16101169"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59758-4_36"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.10.002"", ""10.1101/193730"", ""10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.11.016"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30218-8"", ""10.1038/mp.2015.198"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-31811-0_3"", ""10.1101/209726"", ""10.1001/jama.294.8.955"", ""10.1109/SP.2008.31"", ""10.1038/535345a"", ""10.1109/MSP.2010.38"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01494.x"", ""10.1145/2470654.2481371"", ""10.7146/aahcc.v1i1.21312"", ""10.1186/s40504-017-0050-1"", ""10.1017/S0963180116000359"", ""10.1080/21507740.2015.1076087."", ""10.1007/s11097-015-9421-3"", ""10.1080/21507740.2015.1094538"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1702071."", ""10.1038/551159a"", ""10.1017/S096318011700007X."", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2017.01.026"", ""10.3389/fnins.2018.00082"", ""10.1007/s11572-012-9172-y"", ""10.1080/15265160590960933"", ""10.2307/4141982"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0817-10"", ""10.1111/japp.12108"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-25050-2_4"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4707-4_166."", ""10.1196/annals.1305.014"", ""10.1016/j.fsigen.2009.01.012"", ""10.1080/13669870010027640"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190211745.001.0001""]",['Neuroscience'],['Cognitive Neuroscience'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Many of the roles that staff are being allocated to in the intensive care unit and emergency department pose additional risks to themselves, and new policies for staff reallocation are causing distress and uncertainty to the professionals concerned. In this paper, we analyse a range of ethical issues associated with changes to staff allocation processes in the face of COVID-19. In line with a dominant view in the medical ethics literature, we claim, first, that no individual health professional has a specific, positive obligation to treat a patient when doing so places that professional at risk of harm, and so there is a clear ethical tension in any reallocation process in this context. Next, we argue that the changing asymmetries of health needs in hospitals means that careful consideration needs to be given to a stepwise process for deallocating staff from their usual duties. We conclude by considering how a justifiable process of reallocating professionals to high-risk clinical roles should be configured once those who are ‘fit for reallocation’ have been identified. We claim that this process needs to attend to three questions that we consider in detail: (1) how the choice to make reallocation decisions is made, (2) what justifiable models for reallocation might look like and (3) what is owed to those who are reallocated.","[{""name"": ""Michael Dunn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Sheehan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joshua Hordern"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Helen Lynne Turnham"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dominic Wilkinson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/anae.15054"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.2648"", ""10.1080/15265160802132951"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-122-5-199503010-00010"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114""]",['Health Professions'],"['General Health Professions', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

In this paper we start from Koffka’s recommendation in his Principles of Gestalt Psychology that to realize this ambition psychology should be a “science of molar behaviour”. Molar behavior refers to the purposeful behaviour of the whole organism directed at an environment that is meaningfully structured for the animal. Koffka made a sharp distinction between the “behavioural environment” and the “geographical environment”. We show how this distinction picks out the difference between the environment as perceived by an individual organism, and the shared publicly available environment. The ecological psychologist James Gibson was later critical of Koffka for inserting a private phenomenal reality in between animals and the shared environment. Gibson tried to make do with just the concept of affordances in his explanation of molar behaviour. We argue however that psychology as a science of molar behaviour will need to make appeal both to the concepts of shared publicly available affordances, and of the multiplicity of relevant affordances that invite an individual to act. A version of Koffka’s distinction between the two environments remains alive today in a distinction we have made between the field and landscape of affordances. Having distinguished the two environments, we go on to provide an account of how the two environments are related. Koffka suggested that the behavioural environment forms out of the causal interaction of the individual with a pre-existing, ready-made geographical environment. We argue that such an account of the relation between the two environments fails to do justice to the complex entanglement of the social with the material aspects of the geographical environment. To better account for this sociomaterial reality of the geographical environment, we propose a process-perspective on our distinction between the landscape and field of affordances. While the two environments can be conceptually distinguished, we argue they should also be viewed as standing in a relation of reciprocal and mutual dependence.","[{""name"": ""Julian Kiverstein"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ludger van Dijk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erik Rietveld"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00599"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_5"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8367.001.0001"", ""10.1086/587820"", ""10.1037/13377-000"", ""10.1007/s11097-006-9042-y"", ""10.1080/09515089408573118"", ""10.1093/0199271941.001.0001"", ""10.1002/1520-6696(197101)7:1<3::AID-JHBS2300070102>3.0.CO;2-1"", ""10.1007/BF02424366"", ""10.4324/9781410600479"", ""10.1007/BF02424364"", ""10.4324/9780203994610"", ""10.1177/0170840607081138"", ""10.1093/mind/fzn050"", ""10.1080/10407413.2014.958035"", ""10.1080/09515089408573120"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_2"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01969"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-02013-8"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6730.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.12.003""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'History and Philosophy of Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1186/s41073-019-0089-z,RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND PEER REVIEW,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0101 Philosophy,The acceptability of using a lottery to allocate research funding: a survey of applicants,"Abstract Background The Health Research Council of New Zealand is the first major government funding agency to use a lottery to allocate research funding for their Explorer Grant scheme. This is a somewhat controversial approach because, despite the documented problems of peer review, many researchers believe that funding should be allocated solely using peer review, and peer review is used almost ubiquitously by funding agencies around the world. Given the rarity of alternative funding schemes, there is interest in hearing from the first cohort of researchers to ever experience a lottery. Additionally, the Health Research Council of New Zealand wanted to hear from applicants about the acceptability of the randomisation process and anonymity of applicants. Methods This paper presents the results of a survey of Health Research Council applicants from 2013 to 2019. The survey asked about the acceptability of using a lottery and if the lottery meant researchers took a different approach to their application. Results The overall response rate was 39% (126 of 325 invites), with 30% (76 of 251) from applicants in the years 2013 to 2018, and 68% (50 of 74) for those in the year 2019 who were not aware of the funding result. There was agreement that randomisation is an acceptable method for allocating Explorer Grant funds with 63% (n = 79) in favour and 25% (n = 32) against. There was less support for allocating funds randomly for other grant types with only 40% (n = 50) in favour and 37% (n = 46) against. Support for a lottery was higher amongst those that had won funding. Multiple respondents stated that they supported a lottery when ineligible applications had been excluded and outstanding applications funded, so that the remaining applications were truly equal. Most applicants reported that the lottery did not change the time they spent preparing their application. Conclusions The Health Research Council’s experience through the Explorer Grant scheme supports further uptake of a modified lottery.","[{""name"": ""Mengyao Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vernon Choy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philip Clarke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adrian Barnett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tony Blakely"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lucy Pomeroy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.shpsa.2018.11.006"", ""10.1002/14651858.mr000003.pub2"", ""10.12688/f1000research.11917.2"", ""10.1126/science.352.6282.158-a"", ""10.1186/1741-7015-8-62"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.3000065"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002800"", ""10.1128/mBio.00422-16"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23015-3_9"", ""10.1136/bmj.d4797"", ""10.7554/eLife.13323"", ""10.1073/pnas.1714379115"", ""10.1002/9781118546352"", ""10.1177/0162243918822744"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2017.10.007"", ""10.1128/mBio.01369-16"", ""10.1038/d41586-019-03572-7"", ""10.1002/9780470689516"", ""10.2196/jmir.6.3.e34"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican1018-52"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004462"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006912"", ""10.1186/s41073-017-0043-x""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Based on a random sample of 211 British and 112 Indian consumers and using structural equation modeling, it was found that high levels of physical, social, and psychological proximity leads to high consumer fair trade engagement. Moreover, consumer fair trade engagement was confirmed to have a positive impact on fair trade purchasing behavior. Furthermore, consumer empathic concern was found to positively moderate the association between proximity and consumer fair trade engagement, while the opposite was true with regard to consumer hypocrisy. Finally, consumer nationality was found to have a control effect on physical, social, and psychological proximity, with the latter felt stronger among Indian, as opposed to British consumers.","[{""name"": ""Alvina Gillani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Smirti Kutaula"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leonidas C.

Those on the cultural and political left supported restrictions hoping to protect the vulnerable, while those on the cultural and political right challenged restrictions citing threats to the economy and liberty. We theorize that libertarian and authoritarian impulses within Christian nationalism undergirded much of the resistance to government restrictions. Analyzing national panel data collected before and during the pandemic, we find Christian nationalism is either the first or second strongest predictor that Americans prioritize the economy and liberty and deprioritize the vulnerable when asked about government restrictions. Religiosity works in the opposite direction, however. Findings underscore the centrality of Christian nationalism as an ideological driver of far-right discourse shaping COVID-19 responses.","[{""name"": ""Samuel L Perry"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oklahoma""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew L Whitehead"", ""affiliation"": [""Indiana University‒Purdue University Indianapolis""]}, {""name"": ""Joshua B Grubbs"", ""affiliation"": [""Bowling Green State University""]}]","[""10.1093/socrel/sraa015"", ""10.1111/socf.12619"", ""10.1093/socrel/srw056"", ""10.1111/jssr.12510"", ""10.1080/01419870.2018.1527939"", ""10.1093/sf/soy080"", ""10.1177/2378023120947337"", ""10.1093/socrel/srt051"", ""10.1177/089124399013002004"", ""10.1353/sof.0.0055"", ""10.1037/hea0000586"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479838271.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1532673X10371300"", ""10.1093/socrel/sraa003"", ""10.1080/01419870.2015.1015584"", ""10.1093/socrel/sry046"", ""10.1177/2332649218790983"", ""10.1111/jssr.12677"", ""10.1080/07448481.2019.1583240"", ""10.1177/0003122418822335"", ""10.1080/00380253.2017.1383144"", ""10.1111/cars.12241"", ""10.1093/socrel/srx070"", ""10.1093/socrel/srx047"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074420""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/nous.12316,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,Moral torch fishing: A signaling theory of blame,"AbstractIt is notable that all of the leading theories of blame have to employ ungainly fixes to deflect one or more apparent counterexamples. What these theories share is a content‐based theory of blame's nature. Such approaches overlook or ignore blame's core unifying feature, namely, itsfunction, which is to signal the blamer's commitment to a set of norms. In this paper, we present the problems with the extant theories and then explain what signaling is, how it functions in blame, why appealing to it resolves the problems in other theories, what the signaling function implies for a wider range of gray‐area cases, and what the larger significance is of blame's core function for interpersonal interactions in a variety of (non‐moral) normative domains.","[{""name"": ""David Shoemaker"", ""affiliation"": [""Tulane University New Orleans Louisiana United States""]}, {""name"": ""Manuel Vargas"", ""affiliation"": [""UC San Diego La Jolla California 92093‐0119 United States""]}]","[""10.2307/1960858"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.00259"", ""10.1007/s002650100338"", ""10.1086/427115"", ""10.1086/293071"", ""10.1007/s10892-016-9241-x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199998074.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2653403"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199998074.003.0008"", ""10.1098/rspb.2007.1558"", ""10.1038/415137a"", ""10.1016/j.ijlp.2004.06.005"", ""10.1073/pnas.0500938102"", ""10.1007/s10539-011-9297-8"", ""10.1111/nous.12067"", ""10.1006/jtbi.2003.3104"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674735743"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00073.x"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2004.00023.x"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00138.x"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2012.01.006"", ""10.1353/ppp.0.0003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199740031.001.0001"", ""10.1086/590177"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608560.001.0001"", ""10.1086/678372"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2007.00131.x"", ""10.4159/9780674043145"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717812.003.0008"", ""10.1086/521280"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198715672.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10892-005-7989-5"", ""10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00030-1"", ""10.2307/1882010"", ""10.1257/00028280260136200"", ""10.1007/s10892-011-9112-4"", ""10.1007/s12110-018-9324-4"", ""10.1111/papa.12075"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199697540.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199753673.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199272273.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199753673.003.0013"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199753673.003.0014"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195100358.001.0001""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s10676-019-09522-1,ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,0101 Philosophy; 1205 Library and Information Science & Archive Management,Introducing the pervert's dilemma: a contribution to the critique of Deepfake Pornography,"AbstractRecent technological innovation has made video doctoring increasingly accessible. This has given rise to Deepfake Pornography, an emerging phenomenon in which Deep Learning algorithms are used to superimpose a person’s face onto a pornographic video. Although to most people, Deepfake Pornography is intuitively unethical, it seems difficult to justify this intuition without simultaneously condemning other actions that we do not ordinarily find morally objectionable, such as sexual fantasies. In the present article, I refer to this contradiction as the pervert’s dilemma. I propose that the method of Levels of Abstraction, a philosophical mode of enquiry inspired by Formal Methods in computer science, can be employed to formulate at least one possible solution to the dilemma. From this perspective, the permissibility of some actions appears to depend on the degree to which they are abstracted from their natural context. I conclude that the dilemma can only be solved when considered at low levels of abstractions, when Deepfakes are situated in the macro-context of gender inequality.","[{""name"": ""Carl Öhman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10676-015-9381-x"", ""10.1007/s10676-011-9280-8"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayx031"", ""10.1111/jaac.12091"", ""10.5840/swphilreview200218123"", ""10.1018/00224499.2011.565429"", ""10.1007/s11023-008-9113-7"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199232383.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11948-012-9413-4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199641321.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10676-008-9168-4"", ""10.1093/acprof"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9250-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46595-1""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s10551-022-05183-1,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Exploring the Effectiveness of Sustainability Measurement: Which ESG Metrics Will Survive COVID-19?,"Abstract This paper aims to investigate the current state of play on Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) integration and check the validity of the current metrics system by assessing if it will survive the COVID-19 crisis. By adopting a qualitative research approach through semi-structured anonymous interviews with 14 senior managers of six European listed companies we use a framework by assessing the mechanisms of reactivity on the effectiveness of ESG measures in times of COVID-19. By interpreting the practitioners’ points of view through the lens of the sociological framework by Espeland and Sauder (Am J Sociol 113:1–40, 2007) our findings show different mechanisms of reactivity by companies on the effectiveness of ESG measures in times of COVID-19, i.e., active and passive conformity and active resistance. We also identified the main Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) institutional factors that affect managers’ reactivity. An extensive re-formulation of the ESG metrics is required in the light of times of crisis, given that accountability and transparency are strongly linked to quantitative measures which can play a critical role in the financial system and investors’ engagement. Particularly, the strict distinction between “E”, “S” and “G” issues should be abandoned claiming a different holistic re-design of sustainability measures by considering the increasing relevance of the Social dimension in time of COVID-19. This study provides a valuable contribution to the existing literature on the measurement of sustainability within the link of accountability and crisis by highlighting new corporate needs to re-design the ESG metrics system.","[{""name"": ""Jill Atkins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Federica Doni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Gasperini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sonia Artuso"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ilaria La Torre"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lorena Sorrentino"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/AAAJ-04-2016-2529"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2021.102309"", ""10.1108/MRJIAM-06-2020-1053"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199843909.001.0001"", ""10.2469/faj.v74.n3.2"", ""10.1002/bse.2937"", ""10.1108/MEDAR-01-2014-0002"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2014.02.005"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-05-2017-2929"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-11-2018-3745"", ""10.1111/jacf.12348"", ""10.1177/0007650315576134"", ""10.1002/bse.2520"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-12-2019-4356"", ""10.5465/amp.2019.0053"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128128"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3627439"", ""10.1108/MEQ-12-2017-0149"", ""10.1111/acfi.12746"", ""10.5465/amr.2018.0057"", ""10.1177/0007650315620118"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3667-3"", ""10.1111/jacf.12457"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.01.031"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.12.048"", ""10.1002/bse.2460"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2014.12.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04441-4"", ""10.1016/j.accfor.2017.07.003"", ""10.1177/1086026619899795"", ""10.1007/BF00988593"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-08-2020-4793"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2432-0"", ""10.2307/2095101"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2016.09.004"", ""10.1108/JAOC-10-2013-0081"", ""10.1086/517897"", ""10.1017/S0003975609000150"", ""10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.2.081805.105908"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105215"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1607-9"", ""10.3390/joitmc6040126"", ""10.1007/s11069-011-9753-4"", ""10.5465/amj.2004.14438580"", ""10.1080/13675567.2021.1985095"", ""10.1002/csr.1293"", ""10.1002/csr.2145"", ""10.1002/bse.2007"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.05.030"", ""10.1080/09537287.2020.1768450"", ""10.1108/JIC-03-2016-0030"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2014.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2021.102320"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-05-2021-5279"", ""10.1108/JBS-09-2021-0153"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-12-2013-1547"", ""10.1108/MEDAR-03-2021-1249"", ""10.1002/bse.1927"", ""10.1111/beer.12408"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-073117-041343"", ""10.1002/csr.1357"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-02-2020-4445"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-06-2020-4609"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123282"", ""10.1080/01559982.2022.2045418"", ""10.1111/auar.12364"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.12.052"", ""10.1108/SAMPJ-08-2020-0296"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2323-4"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124947"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.05.035"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.127"", ""10.1108/cpoib-06-2014-0036"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-07-2015-2141"", ""10.1108/MD-01-2017-0018"", ""10.1007/s11356-022-18596-2"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32596-6"", ""10.1002/sd.1951"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112330"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0243263"", ""10.1108/PAR-09-2020-0169""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

We argue they have a duty to participate in pandemic response due to their special skills, but these skills vary between different doctors, and their duties are constrained by other competing rights. We conclude that while doctors should be encouraged to meet the demand for medical aid in the pandemic, those who make the sacrifices and increased efforts are owed reciprocal obligations in return. When reciprocal obligations are not met, doctors are further justified in opting out of specific tasks, as long as this is proportionate to the unmet obligation.","[{""name"": ""Stephanie B Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frances Butcher"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/cc6918"", ""10.1136/medethics-2014-102434"", ""10.1080/15265160802317974"", ""10.3201/eid1208.060360"", ""10.1080/03605310590907066"", ""10.2307/3562420"", ""10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30164-X"", ""10.1007/s00134-020-06121-3"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-7-5"", ""10.1136/bmj.327.7427.1342"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2005.00448.x"", ""10.1183/09031936.00041609"", ""10.1093/med/9780190270742.003.0006"", ""10.1016/j.visj.2020.100740""]","['Health Professions', 'Neuroscience']","['Emergency Medical Services', 'General Health Professions', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1111/phpr.12726,PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH,0101 Philosophy,There is a distinctively epistemic kind of blame,"AbstractIs there a distinctively epistemic kind of blame? It has become commonplace for epistemologists to talk about epistemic blame, and to rely on this notion for theoretical purposes. But not everyone is convinced. Some of the most compelling reasons for skepticism about epistemic blame focus on disanologies, or asymmetries, between the moral and epistemic domains. In this paper, I defend the idea that there is a distinctively epistemic kind of blame. I do so primarily by developing an account of the nature of epistemic blame. My account draws on a prominent line of theorizing in moral philosophy that ties blame to our relationships with one another. I argue that with my account of epistemic blame on hand, the most compelling worries about epistemic blame can be deflated. There is a distinctively epistemic kind of blame.","[{""name"": ""Cameron Boult"", ""affiliation"": [""Brandon University""]}]","[""10.1007/s10670-015-9739-9"", ""10.1111/nous.12270"", ""10.1017/epi.2017.23"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2009.00721.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2010.00422.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1111/nous.12067"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2004.00023.x"", ""10.1080/02691728.2014.971907"", ""10.1007/s10670-011-9299-6"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0643-7"", ""10.1007/s11098-016-0680-9"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-5961-2"", ""10.4324/9780203464601"", ""10.1093/0195078624.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098‐020‐01447‐6"", ""10.1007/s11229-017-1332-0"", ""10.1093/0195128923.003.0003"", ""10.1023/A:1024409201289"", ""10.4159/9780674043145"", ""10.4324/9780429030215-4"", ""10.1086/426957"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199753673.003.0015"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199753673.003.0014""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

While significant advances have been made in recent years towards a better understanding of the concept, a gap exists in the understanding of responsible leadership in emerging countries, specifically how leaders resolve prevalent moral dilemmas. Following Werhane (1999), we use moral imagination as an analytical approach to analyze a dilemmatic stakeholder conflict (between indigenous communities in rural India and an emerging market multinational enterprise headquartered in the same country) through the lense of different responsible leadership mindsets and in light of different ethical principles and moral background theories. Based on this analysis, we arrive at a tentative moral judgement, concluding that the instrumental approach is morally inferior and recommending theintegrative approach as the morally superior choice. In the subsequent discussion—focussed on what “could” (instead of “should”) be done, we apply the integrative script and use moral imagination as a pathway for generating morally justifiable solutions. Through this analysis, we provide novel insights on how to apply an integrative responsible leadership approach to a stakeholder conflict situation, using the single case study to expand the responsible leadership discussion to emerging markets.","[{""name"": ""Nicola M.

Findings from a time-lagged field study and a scenario study indicate (1) an interactive effect between perceived organizational support and employee performance on UPB; (2) that low performers who perceive high levels of organizational support are more likely to engage in UPB; and (3) that feelings of indebtedness to the organization mediate the interactive effect on UPB. Therefore, the paper highlights the importance of conditional factors in motivating UPB by combining employee ‘good intentions’ and ‘disadvantageous situations’ to understand the UPB decision process. The paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications.","[{""name"": ""Xiaoyu Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaotong Zheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shuming Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0146167299025001003"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2010.09.007"", ""10.1037/apl0000111"", ""10.1177/0149206305279602"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.665"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.75.1.51"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.71.3.500"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.02.080176.002003"", ""10.3758/BF03193146"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.91.1.27"", ""10.1177/1059601103257423"", ""10.1037/a0026406"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.94.5.824"", ""10.2307/2092623"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-3087-5_1"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.35.7.603"", ""10.1177/109442819923002"", ""10.1037/10628-000"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3836-z"", ""10.1177/0149206316653930"", ""10.1037/a0035789"", ""10.1037/a0017103"", ""10.1177/0149206315575554"", ""10.1177/1094428112469667"", ""10.2307/1556411"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3456-z"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM0902_1"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.2.171"", ""10.4135/9781452231556"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.78.4.538"", ""10.1080/02699931.2017.1353484"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.87.4.698"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.229"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.91.3.689"", ""10.1037/a0021201"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(1998)19:1+<731::AID-JOB969>3.0.CO;2-P"", ""10.1177/1094428109351241"", ""10.1509/jmkr.47.2.199"", ""10.1037/a0036708"", ""10.2307/256928"", ""10.1177/014920630302900204"", ""10.1287/orsc.1100.0559"", ""10.1037/a0019214"", ""10.1111/peps.12371"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9861-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3782-9"", ""10.1080/02699930500172291"", ""10.2307/257021"", ""10.1016/j.joep.2018.05.007"", ""10.1108/JMP-12-2017-0457"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3966-3""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

However, this process remains time-consuming and burdensome, and it remains unclear how much of the medical record must be made available. Online access to notes offers a way to overcome these challenges and in around 10 countries worldwide, via secure web-based portals, many patients are now able to read at least some of the narrative reports written by clinicians (‘open notes’). However, even in countries that have implemented the practice many clinicians have resisted the idea remaining doubtful of the value of opening notes, and anticipating patients will be confused or anxious by what they read. Against this scepticism, a growing body of qualitative and quantitative research reveals that patients derive multiple benefits from reading their notes. We address the contrasting perceptions of this practice innovation, and claim that the divergent views of patients and clinicians can be explained as a case of epistemic injustice. Using a range of evidence, we argue that patients are vulnerable to (oftentimes, non-intentional) epistemic injustice. Nonetheless, we conclude that the marginalisation of patients’ access to their health information exemplifies a form of epistemic exclusion, one with practical and ethical consequences including for patient safety.","[{""name"": ""Charlotte Blease"", ""affiliation"": [""General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Liz Salmi"", ""affiliation"": [""General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Hanife Rexhepi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Informatics, University of Skövde, Skovde, Västra Götaland, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Maria Hägglund"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Women's and Children's Studies, Uppsala Universitet, Uppsala, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Catherine M DesRoches"", ""affiliation"": [""General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA"", ""Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA""]}]","[""10.1016/j.hlpt.2017.11.003"", ""10.7326/M20-5370"", ""10.2196/13876"", ""10.1016/j.hlpt.2017.06.003"", ""10.2196/jmir.9492"", ""10.1177/1460458216658778"", ""10.2196/jmir.6483"", ""10.2196/mental.9140"", ""10.2196/10521"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61759-1"", ""10.1007/s11019-014-9560-2"", ""10.1136/medethics-2016-103691"", ""10.1192/pb.bp.115.050682"", ""10.1017/S1358246118000620"", ""10.1111/japp.12172"", ""10.4324/9781315212043"", ""10.1177/1460458220944727"", ""10.4018/IJRQEH.2017010103"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00917"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30032-8"", ""10.1503/cmaj.190413"", ""10.1542/peds.2017-2745"", ""10.3366/epi.2010.0005"", ""10.1093/geront/27.6.729"", ""10.1016/S0749-0690(05)70004-5"", ""10.1186/s12910-017-0179-8"", ""10.1177/2150131917697439"", ""10.4324/9781315197999"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-1080-4"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037016"", ""10.1177/1359105317697323"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-157-7-201210020-00002"", ""10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2015.08.001"", ""10.2196/jmir.8444"", ""10.2196/jmir.5705"", ""10.1136/bmj.m753"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.1753"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.5867"", ""10.1515/dx-2018-0106"", ""10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004697"", ""10.1080/09638237.2019.1644490"", ""10.1007/s11606-020-06432-7"", ""10.1176/appi.ps.201600168"", ""10.7326/M18-3197"", ""10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010490"", ""10.2196/jmir.9196"", ""10.1007/s11606-011-1749-y"", ""10.1370/afm.2287"", ""10.1080/17538157.2018.1496092"", ""10.1186/s13643-020-1274-3"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.2823"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2020.527872"", ""10.1016/j.ccell.2020.09.016"", ""10.1177/1460458219881007"", ""10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.0170"", ""10.1016/j.prro.2018.10.004"", ""10.1136/bmj.k3194"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocy134"", ""10.7326/M17-0583"", ""10.1097/PRA.0000000000000450"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocz115"", ""10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30423-X""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1007/s10551-021-04846-9,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Mapping Ethics Education in Accounting Research: A Bibliometric Analysis,"AbstractThe attention being paid to ethics education in accounting has been increasing, especially after the corporate accounting scandals at the turn of the century. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the existing research in the field of ethics education in accounting. To synthesize past research, a bibliometric analysis that references 134 primary studies is performed and three bibliometric methods are applied. First, we visualize the historical evolution of ethics education in accounting research through historiography. Second, we use bibliographic coupling to identify clusters of ethics education in accounting research before, during, and after major corporate scandals. Third, we perform a co-word analysis to connect the identified patterns into a map of a contextual space. The results reveal, in each decade, not only an increasing academic focus on this field of research, but also an increasing number of different research clusters. While the clusters Factors affecting moral judgement, Perception of ethics, and Lack of ethics topics in the last research period develop further from the respective clusters in the previous periods, Accounting beyond technical skills, Integration of ethics in accounting education, Use of developed ethics frameworks, and Professional values on the contrary develop anew in the last decade, as a consequence of a growing demand for teaching ethics. Overall, the paper presents the development patterns of ethics education in accounting research and sets up a research agenda that encourages future research.","[{""name"": ""Tamara Poje"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maja Zaman Groff"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000032700.07607.02"", ""10.1108/S1085-462220170000021002"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2362-x"", ""10.1108/JAEE-08-2016-0070"", ""10.1016/j.jaccedu.2017.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.jaccedu.2011.08.001"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2643-z"", ""10.1016/0748-5751(87)90036-4"", ""10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00325.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1341-3"", ""10.1016/j.rcsar.2017.07.001"", ""10.1016/S0278-4254(02)00042-X"", ""10.1177/1032373210396336"", ""10.2308/iace.2007.22.3.355"", ""10.1007/s11162-010-9212-1"", ""10.2307/2490908"", ""10.1111/abac.12098"", ""10.1080/09639284.2015.1036893"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2009.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2011.07.008"", ""10.1080/09639284.2017.1286602"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2008.12.002"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3411-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2349-7"", ""10.1023/A:1010745425675"", ""10.1080/09639280802436681"", ""10.1080/09639284.2016.1191270"", ""10.1108/S1085-462220160000019004"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1998)49:13<1206::AID-ASI7>3.0.CO;2-F"", ""10.1111/j.1467-629X.2006.00173.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-0020-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04351-0"", ""10.1080/09639284.2020.1760114"", ""10.1002/9781394260270"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9041-5"", ""10.1023/A:1005754201952"", ""10.3923/ajsr.2019.167.178"", ""10.1096/fj.07-9492LSF"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2010.01607.x"", ""10.1007/BF00872085"", ""10.1007/BF02019306"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0706-8"", ""10.1023/A:1017987609769"", ""10.2308/jmar-51592"", ""10.1023/A:1005780120229"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-3897-z"", ""10.1007/BF00871990"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3142-6"", ""10.1007/BF01686451"", ""10.1108/02686900710829426"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-2015-5"", ""10.1007/BF00872084"", ""10.2307/258867"", ""10.1007/BF00412045"", ""10.1080/10291954.2020.1727081"", ""10.1108/S1085-4622(2011)0000012005"", ""10.1007/BF00872114"", ""10.1111/j.1467-629X.2010.00381.x"", ""10.1159/000270857"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2010.01606.x"", ""10.1080/09639284.2015.1051562"", ""10.1016/j.rcsar.2018.02.001"", ""10.1108/S1085-462220140000015000"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2012.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2013.10.004"", ""10.1080/08832323.2018.1466773"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9983-x"", ""10.1007/BF00383611"", ""10.1007/BF00876262"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-2027-1"", ""10.1007/BF00881439"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2006.05.010"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0420-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9845-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-2007-5"", ""10.1108/ARA-09-2015-0088"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9854-5"", ""10.1023/A:1005780402378"", ""10.1111/j.1467-629X.2009.00301.x"", ""10.1007/BF00881312"", ""10.1023/A:1012576631990"", ""10.2307/2490529"", ""10.1002/asi.20550"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-3829-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3396-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9082-9"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3523-5"", ""10.1108/JABS-06-2014-0042"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-1827-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2421-3"", ""10.1108/JAEE-04-2017-0050"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-2929-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9248-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1291-9"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3506-6"", ""10.1108/978-1-78973-417-120201022"", ""10.5324/eip.v11i1.1938"", ""10.3390/su10061991"", ""10.15294/aaj.v9i2.25629"", ""10.1016/0748-5751(91)90003-A"", ""10.1108/ET-01-2019-0006"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000022127.51047.ef"", ""10.1007/s12564-013-9306-5"", ""10.22452/ajba.vol12no1.3"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2711-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9973-z"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2009.01.004"", ""10.1080/0158037X.2010.544524"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2656-7"", ""10.1108/S1574-0765(2011)0000015010"", ""10.1038/s41563-020-0678-8"", ""10.1016/S0306-4573(97)00082-4"", ""10.1080/09638180.2020.1866634"", ""10.1080/09639284.2018.1475244"", ""10.26530/OAPEN_625890"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2455-6"", ""10.2307/258313"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1364-9"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2003.04.002"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0187-9"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2014.07.006"", ""10.1007/s11192-017-2300-7"", ""10.1108/MEDAR-07-2015-0045"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12000"", ""10.1108/MEDAR-09-2016-0076"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2010.07.002"", ""10.1007/BF01845897"", ""10.1016/j.jaccedu.2007.01.001"", ""10.1177/1094428114562629""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Accounting', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"

Conceptualizing corporate purpose as an overarching, relevant, shared ethical vision of why a company exists and where it needs to go, we argue that it is particularly suited for driving employee sustainability behaviors, which are more ethically complex than the types of employee ethical behaviors typically examined by prior research. Through four studies, two involving the actual employees of construction companies, we demonstrate that purpose drives the sustainability behaviors of employees by causing them to take psychological ownership of sustainability.

10.1017/beq.2019.29,BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Contestation in Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives: Enhancing the Democratic Quality of Transnational Governance,"ABSTRACTThis article studies multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) as spaces for both deliberation and contestation between constituencies with competing discourses and disputed values, beliefs, and preferences. We review different theoretical perspectives on MSIs, which see them mainly as spaces to find solutions to market problems (economic approach), as spaces of conflict and bargaining (political approach), or as spaces of consensus (deliberative approach). In contrast, we build on a contestatory deliberative perspective, which gives equal value to both contestation and consensus. We identify four types of internal contestation which can be present in MSIs—procedural, inclusiveness, epistemic, and ultimate-goal—and argue that embracing contestation and engaging in ongoing revision of provisional agreements, criteria, and goals can enhance the democratic quality of MSIs. Finally, we explore the implications of this perspective for theorizing about the democratic quality in MSIs and about the role of corporations in transnational governance.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Arenas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Albareda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jennifer Goodman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5840/beq200616446"", ""10.1525/jer.2011.6.3.3"", ""10.5465/amr.2005.15281448"", ""10.1177/0007650311427426"", ""10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00125-8"", ""10.1287/orsc.2015.0968"", ""10.1017/beq.2016.73"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807763"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.08.007"", ""10.1177/0032329210395000"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500118"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.1997.tb00066.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00344.x"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00361"", ""10.1017/9781316224908"", ""10.1162/GLEP_a_00014"", ""10.5840/beq20112112"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9141-2"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2009.00342.x"", ""10.1017/beq.2015.2"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.01.021"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1093-5"", ""10.1177/1350508407080305"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00206.x"", ""10.1515/bap-2012-0016"", ""10.1787/225520261678"", ""10.1515/9781400826339"", ""10.5465/amp.2007.27895338"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262162500.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12103"", ""10.1177/0191453704043096"", ""10.1002/eet.425"", ""10.1177/0018726717726586"", ""10.5465/ambpp.2014.16194abstract"", ""10.5840/beq201020221"", ""10.5840/beq201222333"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000039400.57827.c3"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00064"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-2033-3"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8675.1994.tb00001.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00950.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511488665"", ""10.1086/518871"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139208628"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.26585837"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.6.121901.085538"", ""10.1177/0170840612450120"", ""10.1111/1468-0491.00199"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2468-1"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.04.008"", ""10.5840/beq201222444"", ""10.1177/0090591704268372"", ""10.5840/beq200919320"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1494-6_88"", ""10.1002/pad.588"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0559-1"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr029"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3027-8"", ""10.5840/beq200717230"", ""10.1002/j.1662-6370.2007.tb00087.x"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.03.012"", ""10.1177/0007650312452868"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1823-y"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01045.x"", ""10.1353/jod.2004.0060"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609848""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1007/s11229-019-02296-5,SYNTHESE,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Axiomatic rationality and ecological rationality,"AbstractAxiomatic rationality is defined in terms of conformity to abstract axioms. Savage (The foundations of statistics, Wiley, New York, 1954) limited axiomatic rationality tosmall worlds(S,C), that is, situations in which the exhaustive and mutually exclusive set of future statesSand their consequencesCare known. Others have interpreted axiomatic rationality as a categorical norm for how human beings should reason, arguing in addition that violations would lead to real costs such as money pumps. Yet a review of the literature shows little evidence that violations are actually associated with any measurable costs. Limiting axiomatic rationality to small worlds, I propose a naturalized version of rationality for situations of intractability and uncertainty (as opposed to risk), all of which are not in (S,C). In these situations, humans can achieve their goals by relying on heuristics that may violate axiomatic rationality. The study of ecological rationality requires formal models of heuristics and an analysis of the structures of environments these can exploit. It lays the foundation of a moderate naturalism in epistemology, providing statements about heuristics weshoulduse in a given situation. Unlike axiomatic rationality, ecological rationality can explain less-is-more effects (when using less information can be expected to generate more accurate predictions), formalize when one should move from ‘is’ to ‘ought,’ and be evaluated by goals beyond coherence, such as predictive accuracy, frugality, and efficiency. Ecological rationality can be seen as a formalization of means–end instrumentalist rationality, based on Herbert Simon’s insight that rational behavior is a function of the mind and its environment.","[{""name"": ""Gerd Gigerenzer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/dec0000043"", ""10.1007/s11229-012-0188-6"", ""10.1287/opre.1070.0485"", ""10.1561/105.00000034"", ""10.1515/9781400833092"", ""10.1023/A:1005228312224"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2006.00020.x"", ""10.1111/j.0029-4624.2005.00545.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511792601.006"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.01.061"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(90)90060-D"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(93)90036-B"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhm075"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226046778.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjps/45.1.1"", ""10.4324/9781315819891"", ""10.3758/PBR.16.1.163"", ""10.1162/neco.1992.4.1.1"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592"", ""10.1561/105.00000092"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.103.4.650"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.102.4.684"", ""10.1007/s11229-011-0030-6"", ""10.1093/0198238207.001.0001"", ""10.1098/rsbl.2007.0111"", ""10.1287/deca.1100.0191"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174084"", ""10.2307/2185044"", ""10.1037/a0022684"", ""10.1023/A:1015516217425"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.05.003"", ""10.7312/quin92204-004"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0584-1"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5759.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.134.2.207"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195315448.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00071053"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1509/jmkg.72.3.082""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Decision Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'General Decision Sciences']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7409), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7377)]]"
10.1007/s10670-021-00441-6,ERKENNTNIS,0101 Philosophy,What is a Conspiracy Theory?,"AbstractIn much of the current academic and public discussion, conspiracy theories are portrayed as a negative phenomenon, linked to misinformation, mistrust in experts and institutions, and political propaganda. Rather surprisingly, however, philosophers working on this topic have been reluctant to incorporate a negatively evaluative aspect when either analyzing or engineering the concept conspiracy theory. In this paper, we present empirical data on the nature of the concept conspiracy theory from five studies designed to test the existence, prevalence and exact form of an evaluative dimension to the ordinary concept conspiracy theory. These results reveal that, while there is a descriptive concept of conspiracy theory, the predominant use of conspiracy theory is deeply evaluative, encoding information about epistemic deficiency and often also derogatory and disparaging information. On the basis of these results, we present a new strategy for engineering conspiracy theory to promote theoretical investigations and institutional discussions of this phenomenon. We argue for engineering conspiracy theory to encode an epistemic evaluation, and to introduce a descriptive expression—such as ‘conspiratorial explanation’—to refer to the purely descriptive concept conspiracy theory.","[{""name"": ""M.

The observations suggest that these salt basins shared a common evolution. Crustal faulting gradually shifted basinward. Consequent thermal/loading subsidence plus lower-crustal thinning generated basinward-shifting accommodation for sag sequences, but slow sedimentation relative to subsidence resulted in deep depressions. A switch to symmetrical boudinage of thinned crust created the troughs and possible reactive mantle diapirs. Evaporites formed during this stage, with deposition near sea-level in proximal positions but 2–3 km deep in basin centres. Oceanic spreading separated the salt into conjugate basins, with allochthonous flow out over oceanic crust.","[{""name"": ""Mark G.

However, researchers have observed that underdeveloped assumptions with respect to the conceptualization of corruption and how firms respond to corruption risk impeding the efficacy of anti-corruption programs. We investigate the relationship between the perceived level of corruption in foreign host countries and the organizational structure of subsidiary operations established by multinational corporations (MNCs). Foreign host market corruption is disaggregated into two components—private and public corruption. We employ an uncertainty-based perspective grounded in transaction cost theory to focus upon the distinct mechanisms through which private and public corruption can each be expected to impact a foreign subsidiary’s organizational structure [wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS) or a joint venture (JV) with a local partner]. We expect that each type of corruption fosters a different type of uncertainty (environmental or behavioral) which predominates in shaping the MNC’s choice of foreign subsidiary investment structure. Hypotheses are developed and tested with a sample of 187 entries into 19 foreign host markets. Each type of corruption was found to exert a distinct effect upon the organizational structure of foreign subsidiaries. More precisely, while heightened perceived levels of public corruption were found to motivate MNCs to invest through a JV with a local partner rather than a WOS, more pronounced private corruption precipitated the opposite outcome.","[{""name"": ""Michael A.

The technique aims to fix the logic of the network at an intermediate layer or at the last layer. NNrepair first uses fault localization to find potentially faulty network parameters (such as the weights) and then performs repair using constraint solving to apply small modifications to the parameters to remedy the defects. We present novel strategies to enable precise yet efficient repair such as inferring correctness specifications to act as oracles for intermediate layer repair, and generation of experts for each class. We demonstrate the technique in the context of three different scenarios: (1) Improving the overall accuracy of a model, (2) Fixing security vulnerabilities caused by poisoning of training data and (3) Improving the robustness of the network against adversarial attacks. Our evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 models shows that NNrepair can improve the accuracy by 45.56% points on poisoned data and 10.40% points on adversarial data. NNrepair also provides small improvement in the overall accuracy of models, without requiring new data or re-training.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Usman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Divya Gopinath"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Youcheng Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yannic Noller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Corina S.

Review of studies in Iberoamerica 2017-2020","El objetivo de este artículo es realizar una revisión de las investigaciones sobre desinformación en el ámbito de Iberoamérica entre 2017 y 2020. Para ello, se siguen las normas APA para revisiones y se analizan alrededor de 60 trabajos publicados en revistas indexadas de Iberoamérica, así como libros publicados sobre la temática. Los resultados se muestran agrupados en tres partes: En la primera se revisan los tres conceptos fundamentales relacionados con la desinformación: el propio término de desinformación, así como posverdad e infodemia. En la segunda, se estudian los principales productos de desinformación: noticias falsas, desórdenes informativos y bulos, atendiendo a sus tipos, temáticas, formatos, y canales. En la tercera parte se presentan las principales estrategias contra la desinformación, revisando los trabajos publicados de dos de ellas: la curación de contenidos y la verificación de hechos. Los autores más destacados sobre la temática a nivel cuantitativo son Magallón-Rosa con 6 trabajos, Ufarte-Ruiz con 4 y García-Marín con 3 trabajos. Asimismo, se pueden destacar por su análisis de la desinformación en el área de Iberoamérica los estudios de Palau-Sampio (2018), Vizoso y Vázquez-Herrero (2019) y Rodríguez-Pérez (2020), por su análisis de las tipologías de bulos el trabajo de Salaverría et al (2020) y por las propuestas sobre curación los trabajos de López-Borrull con colaboradores. Entre las conclusiones, se ha visto que el fenómeno de la desinformación es altamente poliédrico, pero que la sociedad tiene instrumentos para afrontarlo, como la curación y la verificación o fact cheking.","[{""name"": ""Javier Guallar"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Barcelona""]}, {""name"": ""Lluís Codina"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad Pompeu Fabra""]}, {""name"": ""Pere Freixa"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad Pompeu Fabra""]}, {""name"": ""Mario Pérez-Montoro"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Barcelona""]}]","[""10.31009/hipertext.net.2018.i17.07"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.13"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.12"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.08"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.sep.03"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.09"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.jul.17"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.jul.19"", ""10.20318/recs.2020.5531"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.02"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.jul.11"", ""10.3145/thinkepi.2018.33"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.jul.07"", ""10.1344/bid2020.44.5"", ""10.3145/thinkepi.2019.e13e07"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.nov.17"", ""10.5209/esmp.65246"", ""10.5209/esmp.59949"", ""10.26441/rc18.1-2019-a12"", ""10.54886/scire.v1i2.4446"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.jul.12"", ""10.6035/2174-0992.2017.13.1"", ""10.5209/hics.66267"", ""10.24137/raeic.6.12.5"", ""10.14198/medcom2020.11.2.4"", ""10.31009/hipertext.net.2018.i17.05"", ""10.4185/rlcs-2018-1312"", ""10.15847/obsobs12520181374"", ""10.20318/recs.2020.5446"", ""10.20318/recs.2020.5375"", ""10.7764/cdi.44.1418"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.06"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.14"", ""10.18566/comunica.n40.a05"", ""10.26441/rc19.1-2020-a14"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.may.15"", ""10.20318/recs.2020.5417"", ""10.36105/stx.2020n4.01"", ""10.33732/ixc/10/02Limite"", ""10.14198/medcom2020.11.2.3"", ""10.21134/mhcj.v0i9.267"", ""10.3145/epi.2018.jul.02"", ""10.3145/epi.2019.may.01"", ""10.15581/003.32.1.127-144""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

By surveying the range of social goods that appear to be missing from the lonely person's perspective, we see what it is that can make this emotional condition so subjectively awful for those who undergo it, including the profound sense of being unable to realize oneself, in collaboration with others.","[{""name"": ""Tom Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joel Krueger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7551/mitpress/6548.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s13164-016-0302-7"", ""10.1086/233824"", ""10.1080/09515089.2014.976334"", ""10.2307/2653403"", ""10.1177/0539018409106197"", ""10.4324/9780203721742"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-0045-y"", ""10.1007/s11097-017-9506-2"", ""10.1023/A:1021306500055"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9329.2011.00488.x"", ""10.5771/9781783488629"", ""10.2307/2215878"", ""10.1093/analys/ans105"", ""10.1093/mind/os-IX.34.188"", ""10.1086/233694"", ""10.1093/med:psych/9780195094862.001.0001"", ""10.1215/00318108-112-2-135"", ""10.1215/00318108-3601037"", ""10.1007/s11245-018-9547-3"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069945.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00422.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672783.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2010.00287.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840715"", ""10.1111/ejop.12077"", ""10.1080/09515089.2015.1115475"", ""10.1007/s11097-011-9215-1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610202"", ""10.1111/ejop.12375"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199692040.003.0012"", ""10.1111/rati.12272"", ""10.1111/papq.12168"", ""10.1353/ppp.2017.0058"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2009.00384.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1108/OTH-09-2020-0032,ON THE HORIZON,0101 Philosophy; 0401 Education,Evaluation of students' attitude toward distance learning during the pandemic (Covid-19): a case study of ELTE university,"PurposeCovid-19 has prompted higher institutions around the globe to relocate traditional classes to online classes. Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) was no exception. It had already drawn up limited strategies regarding distance education, but those Web-based platforms were provided only to students with special needs. Due to the pandemic, all ELTE students were compelled to use online platforms that the university provided, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, to resume their studies. This study aims to evaluate the initial experience of students in using these new platforms. It also explores the effects distance learning has on students’ satisfaction and attitudes toward their education.Design/methodology/approachBy using a quantitative approach, students’ attitudes toward e-learning and their access to tech-platforms, use of those platforms and satisfaction with online courses are processed and analyzed via a statistical package for the social sciences.FindingsThe results of this study show that distance learning is still in the development stage, and although traditional classrooms appeared to be indispensable, the positive attitudes and willingness of the majority of students to engage in distance learning classes in the post-COVID19 pandemic indicate that there is an immense potential future for e-learning platforms in higher education institutions.Originality/valueThe distance learning approach has been the only way for institutions worldwide to resume studies during the pandemic of Covid-19. Students faced mixed feelings of perplexity, loneliness, uncertainty over what is going to happen with classes, exams, graduation and other significant activities impacting their study path; irrespective of their daily struggles with the hard accessibility to means of e-learning and personal potential health problems. This evaluation is considered as a roadmap for institutions to follow-up and to improve the organizational and educational shortcomings they met.","[{""name"": ""Yassine Ismaili"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01142.x"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.02.044"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2020.102775"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.638"", ""10.1207/s15566935eed0801_6"", ""10.4135/9781452232447"", ""10.1016/0191-491X(80)90027-9"", ""10.28945/1987"", ""10.1080/02602930500099102"", ""10.1080/01587919.2019.1681893"", ""10.1016/j.aaen.2004.08.001""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1007/s11019-020-09986-9,MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Evaluating the effectiveness of clinical ethics committees: a systematic review,"AbstractClinical Ethics Committees (CECs), as distinct from Research Ethics Committees, were originally established with the aim of supporting healthcare professionals in managing controversial clinical ethical issues. However, it is still unclear whether they manage to accomplish this task and what is their impact on clinical practice. This systematic review aims to collect available assessments of CECs’ performance as reported in literature, in order to evaluate CECs’ effectiveness. We retrieved all literature published up to November 2019 in six databases (PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Philosopher’s Index, Embase and Web of Science), following PRISMA guidelines. We included only articles specifically addressing CECs and providing any form of CECs performance assessment. Twenty-nine articles were included. Ethics consultation was the most evaluated of CECs’ functions. We did not find standardized tools for measuring CECs’ efficacy, but 33% of studies considered “user satisfaction” as an indicator, with 94% of them reporting an average positive perception of CECs’ impact. Changes in patient treatment and a decrease of moral distress in health personnel were reported as additional outcomes of ethics consultation. The highly diverse ways by which CECs carry out their activities make CECs’ evaluation difficult. The adoption of shared criteria would be desirable to provide a reliable answer to the question about their effectiveness. Nonetheless, in general both users and providers consider CECs as helpful, relevant to their work, able to improve the quality of care. Their main function is ethics consultation, while less attention seems to be devoted to bioethics education and policy formation.","[{""name"": ""Chiara Crico"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Virginia Sanchini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paolo Giovanni Casali"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gabriella Pravettoni"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1378/chest.08-0136"", ""10.1007/s10730-015-9296-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-27690-8"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-15-1"", ""10.1097/00003246-198211000-00018"", ""10.1086/JCE2016274322"", ""10.1007/s11948-014-9609-x"", ""10.1007/bf01456252"", ""10.1258/CE.2011.012010"", ""10.1007/s10730-011-9160-y"", ""10.1136/jme.27.suppl_1.i44"", ""10.1136/jme.15.3.137"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-120-4-199402150-00012"", ""10.1258/ce.2012.012m03"", ""10.1007/s11019-007-9102-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-05544-2_89-1"", ""10.1080/15265160601109085"", ""10.1080/15265161.2012.719263"", ""10.1136/jme.2009.032607"", ""10.1111/jan.12284"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2753.2012.01831.x"", ""10.1007/BF00117612"", ""10.1136/jme.2005.015271"", ""10.1186/s12910-018-0325-y"", ""10.1177/0969733019878840"", ""10.1080/23294515.2017.1335808"", ""10.1177/0969733014539783"", ""10.1007/BF00115869"", ""10.1023/A:1008961801026"", ""10.1007/bf01127375"", ""10.2307/3350425"", ""10.1136/jme.2003.005835"", ""10.1007/s10728-007-0072-6"", ""10.1111/jpc.13933"", ""10.3329/bioethics.v5i2.19618"", ""10.1109/CBMS.2017.62"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-27690-8_1"", ""10.1080/15265161.2015.1134708"", ""10.1056/NEJM198707023170110"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-105190"", ""10.1162/152651601317139531"", ""10.1136/jme.2003.006924"", ""10.1017/s0963180100003170"", ""10.1007/s10730-011-9170-9"", ""10.1093/ptj/89.9.873"", ""10.1016/s0002-9343(96)80067-2"", ""10.1136/jme.2008.026393"", ""10.1016/s0002-9343(88)80017-2"", ""10.13153/diam.22.2009.365"", ""10.1007/s10730-017-9325-4"", ""10.1016/j.critrevonc.2015.12.010"", ""10.7861/clinmedicine.4-3-232"", ""10.1007/bf02217981"", ""10.1017/S0963180100004539"", ""10.1007/s11948-016-9805-y"", ""10.1258/ce.2012.012m05"", ""10.1136/bmj.321.7262.649"", ""10.1136/jme.27.suppl_1.i2"", ""10.1023/a:1020952813366"", ""10.1007/bf00057871"", ""10.1023/A:1025928617468"", ""10.1016/S0840-4704(10)61190-8"", ""10.1016/S0840-4704(10)61278-1"", ""10.1016/S0097-5990(16)30583-8"", ""10.1023/a:1008841004091"", ""10.1177/096853320700800302"", ""10.1007/BF01454915"", ""10.1136/jme.2008.028340""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Pharmacy', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/bioe.12780,BIOETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Does the heterogeneity of autism undermine the neurodiversity paradigm?,"AbstractThe neurodiversity paradigm is presented by its proponents as providing a philosophical foundation for the activism of the neurodiversity movement. Its central claims are that autism and other neurodivergent conditions are not disorders because they are not intrinsically harmful, and that they are valuable, natural and/or normal parts of human neurocognitive variation. This paper: (a) identifies the non‐disorder claim as the most central of these, based on its prominence in the literature and connections with the practical policy claims that the paradigm is supposed to support; (b) describes the heterogeneity of autism at the behavioural and causal levels, and argues that at the behavioural level this encompasses ways of being autistic that are harmful in ways that cannot be not wholly attributed to discrimination or unjust social arrangements, challenging the claim that autism is not a disorder; (c) considers and rejects responses to this challenge based on separation of high‐ and low‐functioning autism, separation of autism from co‐occurring conditions, and viewing autism as part of an individual’s identity. Two of these responses fail for reasons that are themselves connected with the behavioural and/or causal heterogeneity of autism.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan A.

Despite its significance for entrepreneurial finance, our knowledge of the occurrence, determinants, and consequences of fraud in this market, as well as the implications for the business ethics literature, remain limited. In this study, we conduct an exhaustive search of all media reports on Kickstarter campaign fraud allegations from 2010 through 2015. We then follow up until 2018 to assess the ultimate outcome of each allegedly fraudulent campaign. First, we construct a sample of 193 fraud cases, and categorize them into detected vs. suspected fraud, based on a set of well-defined criteria. Next, using multiple matched samples of non-fraudulent campaigns, we determine which features are associated with a higher probability of fraudulent behavior. Second, we document the short-term negative consequences of possible breaches of trust in the market, using a sample of more than 270,000 crowdfunding campaigns from 2010 through 2018 on Kickstarter. Our results show that crowdfunding projects launched around the public announcement of a late and significant misconduct detection (resulting in suspension) tend to have a lower probability of success, raise less funds, and attract fewer backers.","[{""name"": ""Douglas Cumming"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lars Hornuf"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Moein Karami"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Denis Schweizer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.09.011"", ""10.1111/etap.12157"", ""10.1561/114.00000007"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3652-x"", ""10.1525/cmr.2016.58.2.125"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2410-6"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2019.3482"", ""10.1080/13691066.2013.785151"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2013.07.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3932-0"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2011.03.008"", ""10.3390/jtaer16040045"", ""10.1561/114.00000008"", ""10.1111/etap.12118"", ""10.1111/fima.12262"", ""10.1007/s11187-019-00188-z"", ""10.2307/256506"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04428-1"", ""10.1086/261630"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04229-1"", ""10.1111/fima.12107"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3354-9"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02306.x"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.04.002"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2772-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66119-3_5"", ""10.1007/s11187-017-9839-9"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2017.08.009"", ""10.1111/corg.12260"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2013.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2007.06.003"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a004868"", ""10.1353/wp.2001.0018"", ""10.54648/EUCL2016009"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.im.2018.07.002"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1120.1560"", ""10.1177/0022022116648211"", ""10.1509/jmkr.45.6.633"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2013.06.005"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2015.2207"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2016.11.001"", ""10.2307/1229291"", ""10.1016/S1045-2354(03)00072-8"", ""10.1561/114.00000009"", ""10.1177/0963721414553264"", ""10.1080/07421222.2016.1205930"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2017.10.018"", ""10.1126/science.aaf6989"", ""10.2307/1882010"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2010.08.016"", ""10.1007/s11187-016-9710-4"", ""10.2189/asqu.52.1.70""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Computer Science']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Information Systems', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Multivariate regression analysis was used as a prime method to rigorously test the relationships of income and education with ICT diffusion across 191 countries. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (V. 22) was used to analyze and predict patterns in the data. Findings The results support the hypotheses that income and education are positively related to ICT diffusion. The findings statistically confirm that poverty is a leading cause of digital divide worldwide. Research limitations/implications Academic, policy and practice groups should work in collaboration to fight against digital divide. Present results also imply that digital divide shall never end but rather it can be controlled to an extent with multiple collaborative efforts. Originality/value Prior research assignments on the digital divide concentrate on exploring the links between few socio-economic and ICT variables in select few regions theoretically. The present work addresses this literature gap by developing and testing two hypotheses to statistically investigate the relationships between a broad set of socio-economic and ICT indicators.","[{""name"": ""Farooq Mubarak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Reima Suomi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Satu-Päivi Kantola"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/14779960910955864"", ""10.1016/S0167-6245(02)00093-8"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.013"", ""10.1080/00987913.2005.10765002"", ""10.1080/01972243.2010.534364"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9261-3"", ""10.1080/1097198X.2010.10856513"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2018.06.003"", ""10.1108/00012530810862473"", ""10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003"", ""10.17705/1jais.00074"", ""10.1080/01972240309487"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307"", ""10.1177/107769900007700306"", ""10.1177/0894439303021002002"", ""10.1016/j.infoecopol.2010.12.001"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1353640"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004"", ""10.1080/00420980220099050"", ""10.1007/s101100100096"", ""10.1111/0038-4941.00058"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012"", ""10.1108/03074800910954253"", ""10.1108/00012530610687669"", ""10.1016/S0167-6245(01)00070-1"", ""10.1108/EUM0000000007045"", ""10.1108/09593841011022528"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2014.10.167"", ""10.1007/s10676-009-9189-7"", ""10.1023/A:1019983909305"", ""10.1057/ejis.2013.19"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2015.01.050"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2013.06.017"", ""10.1108/17504970810883351"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2013.12.026"", ""10.1007/s10209-003-0061-y"", ""10.1108/17504970710832817"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000498"", ""10.1016/S0167-6245(01)00070-1"", ""10.1016/S1049-0078(02)00186-0"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2009.11.003"", ""10.1057/ejis.2010.64"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2011.10.003"", ""10.1080/715720560"", ""10.1108/14779960380000230"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7660.2008.00486.x"", ""10.1355/AE19-1F"", ""10.1002/poi3.171"", ""10.1177/1461444818797082"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013"", ""10.1007/s10708-007-9055-2"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.538"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500128""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Information Systems', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"
10.1108/JICES-02-2022-0016,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY,0101 Philosophy,Climate change disclosure and sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the 2030 agenda: the moderating role of corporate governance,"PurposeThis study is justified by the economic importance of information on greenhouse gases, as well as the interest in the question of governance structure after the adoption of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda. The problem is also explained by the lack of research that has investigated the relationship between the best governance structure that contributes to achieving sustainability goals, including climate actions (SDG13) and clean energy adoption (SDG7) as part of the 2030 Agenda.Design/methodology/approachThe level of disclosure is measured on the basis of the carbon disclosure score calculated by the carbon disclosure project (CDP). The study sample consists of 387 US companies that voluntarily participated in the CDP survey from 2011 to 2018. The authors use panel data analysis based on multiple regression models.FindingsThe results confirm the influential role of board size, director independence, the presence of women on the board and the presence of an environmental committee on carbon disclosure. In terms of carbon disclosure, the results suggest that a better governance structure is likely to reduce carbon emissions and improve carbon performance practices. Similarly, the analyses show a different representation of the role of corporate governance in high-carbon sectors compared to low-carbon sectors.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has some limitations. First, the sample is only interested in US companies that responded to the CDP questionnaire during the period 2011–2018. Thus, the results cannot be generalized to countries with different governance structures. Second, the data from this study on carbon disclosure, specifically focuses on CDP reporting to determine the carbon disclosure score. In this sense, the findings on information disclosed do not necessarily address disclosures through other media, such as a company’s website or a press release.Originality/valueSustainability and commitment to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) are more likely to exist in companies that have good governance and, in particular, a better board. The research is inspired by the SDGs. The study aims to examine the relationship between carbon disclosure and corporate governance in the context of SDGs. Indeed, this research work contributes to achieving sustainability goals, including climate actions (SDG13) and clean energy adoption (SDG7).","[{""name"": ""Mohamed Toukabri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Youssef"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jcae.2016.09.001"", ""10.1002/sd.539"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2013.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.accfor.2017.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.11.025"", ""10.1108/JICES-07-2017-0046"", ""10.1002/sd.1623"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0505-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2759-1"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.36461950"", ""10.22164/isea.v5i2.61"", ""10.2307/256390"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1887-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2528-6"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6281.2011.00330.x"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2006.08.008"", ""10.1016/j.adiac.2011.05.005"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(98)00058-0"", ""10.1080/0963818042000339617"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(87)90001-8"", ""10.2307/256801"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0681-0"", ""10.1177/0149206311411506"", ""10.1086/345586"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2008.04.009"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2432-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2664-7"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.8.1059.12030"", ""10.2307/2491297"", ""10.1108/MEQ-12-2017-0150"", ""10.1016/j.strueco.2004.04.004"", ""10.1108/SRJ-04-2020-0130/full/html"", ""10.1086/467037"", ""10.1002/csr.1294"", ""10.1177/0007650316647967"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.08.047"", ""10.1002/csr.1775"", ""10.3846/jbem.2019.10447"", ""10.1002/bse.1962"", ""10.1177/1086026615575542"", ""10.1016/j.bar.2017.01.001"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0772-6"", ""10.1002/bse.1960"", ""10.1111/acfi.12258"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3099-5"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2018.04.004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5957.1992.tb00652.x"", ""10.1177/1086026617705282"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1993.tb04022.x"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1929-2"", ""10.1016/j.adiac.2014.03.009"", ""10.1086/430806"", ""10.1002/smj.230"", ""10.1108/14720701211214052"", ""10.1007/s10640-009-9263-y"", ""10.1108/IJCCSM-07-2017-0144"", ""10.1111/j.1937-5956.2001.tb00373.x"", ""10.1002/bse.2176"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1015883"", ""10.1080/09638 180802489121"", ""10.1162/00346530151143815"", ""10.1016/j.bar.2014.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.06.018"", ""10.1111/j.1467-646X.2012.01055.x"", ""10.1108/ARJ-04-2012-0024"", ""10.1177/0007650312439701"", ""10.1002/sd.2068"", ""10.1002/bse.1741"", ""10.1086/467466"", ""10.1111/gove.12338"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490186"", ""10.1257/aer.20150781"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.07.009"", ""10.1007/s10997-010-9160-3"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00839.x"", ""10.1002/jsc.2000"", ""10.1002/bse.2351"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1576-z"", ""10.1002/bse.2727"", ""10.1007/s10997-007-9039-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0912-z"", ""10.1002/csr.1367"", ""10.1016/0361-3682(92)90042-Q"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1886-9"", ""10.1002/bse.2628"", ""10.1177/0007650310394642"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0515-0"", ""10.1108/00251740910978340"", ""10.1108/09513571111184751"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2613-5"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8683.2007.00570.x"", ""10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2012.09.002"", ""10.2307/257052"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60685-0"", ""10.1016/j.ibusrev.2016.01.002"", ""10.1002/sd.1623"", ""10.1080/10599231.2014.934637"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2007.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2020.102461"", ""10.1002/bse.1732"", ""10.1002/csr.175"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1885230"", ""10.1111/auar.12010"", ""10.1108/ARA-01-2015-0007"", ""10.1111/auar.12010"", ""10.1086/209602"", ""10.2307/258135"", ""10.1002/smj.1952"", ""10.1007/s10997-004-1107-0"", ""10.1111/1911-3838.12007"", ""10.1023/A:1021626024014"", ""10.1108/JICES-11-2017-0066"", ""10.1108/JFRA-11-2016-0092"", ""10.1108/MAJ-09-2014-1087"", ""10.1108/JICES-04-2017-0021""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1007/s10551-019-04192-x,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,An Updated Inquiry into the Study of Corporate Codes of Ethics: 2005-2016,"AbstractThis paper presents a review of 100 empirical papers studying corporate codes of ethics (CCEs) in business organizations from the time period mid-2005 until mid-2016, following approximately an 11-year time period after the previous review of the literature. The reviewed papers are broadly categorized as content-oriented, output-oriented, or transformation-oriented. The review sheds light on empirical focus, context, questions addressed, methods, findings and theory. The findings are discussed in terms of the three categories as well as the aggregate, stock of empirical CCE studies in comparison with previous reviews, answering the question “where are we now?” Content and output studies still stand for the majority of the studies, whereas the transformation studies are fewer. Within these areas, two new trends are found to have emerged: discursive analyses and a focus on labor conditions. The review finds that (a) the content of CCEs is still predominantly self-defensive, (b) that CCEs are insufficient in themselves in terms of protecting workers’ rights, (c) that CCEs are likely to encounter tensions when implemented across national and organizational boundaries, and (d) that while perception of CCEs is generally positive, CCEs may lead to both positive and negative outcomes. Based on these findings, potential areas for further exploration in the area of CCE research are suggested.","[{""name"": ""Maira Babri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bruce Davidson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sven Helin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10551-009-0192-z"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.09.007"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9113-6"", ""10.1108/02621710810883652"", ""10.1111/glob.12086"", ""10.1007/BF00381721"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8683.2007.00544.x"", ""10.1080/0376835X.2011.623923"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1481-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1966-x"", ""10.1111/j.0045-3609.2004.00205.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2011.01637.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9417-1"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.09.005"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0888-8"", ""10.1515/9783110879735"", ""10.2308/accr-50272"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9579-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9237-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1622-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9269-0"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.08.096"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0667-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0380-x"", ""10.1016/j.ibusrev.2010.07.008"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2012.01657.x"", ""10.1108/JBIM-02-2013-0042"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2300-y"", ""10.1007/s10657-011-9248-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1968-8"", ""10.1023/A:1012718103007"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2011.01.006"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0883-0"", ""10.1086/intejethi.35.1.2377652"", ""10.1177/0276146707302803"", ""10.1108/13632541011090455"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0198-6"", ""10.1080/10508422.2012.661311"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.08.056"", ""10.1016/j.scaman.2010.12.001"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9251-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9887-9"", ""10.1177/0170840610372292"", ""10.1177/1468018111431757"", ""10.1177/106939718301800403"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9508-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1060-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2255-z"", ""10.1177/027614678600600103"", ""10.1108/20412561011079407"", ""10.5840/bpej2015111836"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000021051.53460.da"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0652-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2296-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9305-0"", ""10.1023/A:1005792522046"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0080-6"", ""10.1177/0959680109339399"", ""10.1068/d243t"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2014.02.005"", ""10.1007/BF00872312"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9307-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9692-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2103-1"", ""10.1080/10548408.2014.861699"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0521-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9395-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-7100-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0280-0"", ""10.1108/EBR-04-2015-0039"", ""10.1111/beer.12017"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9844-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-3967-x"", ""10.1080/09537280903547785"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000385"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9785-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9978-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0277-8"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.05.007"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0035-y"", ""10.1177/0032329205275191"", ""10.1300/J066v18n04_02"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2064-4"", ""10.1515/9783110879735.69"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9252-9"", ""10.1023/A:1010787607771"", ""10.1023/A:1021393904930"", ""10.1177/1350508407080316"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0673-0"", ""10.1108/JMD-04-2011-0044"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-2408-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0727-3"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8594.2011.00385.x"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2004.10.007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2010.01612.x"", ""10.1007/BF00877156"", ""10.1177/002194369603300107"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9370-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0064-6"", ""10.1108/14720700710727140"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2004.00361.x"", ""10.1108/14720700610706054"", ""10.1108/09513550910961637"", ""10.1108/09513550910982869"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2009.01561.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2010.01585.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2011.01623.x"", ""10.1086/intejethi.42.3.2989578"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0199-5"", ""10.1080/02642060802116388"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9861-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-7057-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-4664-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9170-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1561-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0762-8"", ""10.1002/cjas.215"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2007.00513.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9521-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9815-z"", ""10.1177/1468018115569250""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Strategy and Management', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Critiques contend that without such an explicit commitment, VSD lacks a methodology for distinguishing genuine moral values from mere stakeholders-preferences and runs the risk of attending to a set of values that is unprincipled or unbounded. We argue that VSD practitioners need to complement it with an ethical theory. We argue in favour of a mid-level ethical theory to fulfil this role.","[{""name"": ""Naomi Jacobs"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alina Huldtgren"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10676-006-9129-8"", ""10.1145/2207676.2208560"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-7844-3_4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2009.01757.x"", ""10.1007/s11948-010-9198-2"", ""10.29173/irie87"", ""10.11647/OBP.0130"", ""10.5840/ijap200519219"", ""10.1002/9780470281819.ch3"", ""10.1007/s11948-013-9498-4""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Triage protocols have thus become necessary. Triage decisions in situations of scarce resources were not extraordinary in the pre-COVID-19 era; these protocols abounded in the context of organ transplantation. However, this prior experience was not considered during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. Lacking national guidance or public coordination, each hospital has been forced to put forth independent and autonomous triage protocols, most of which were, nonetheless, based on common ethical principles and clinical criteria. However, controversial, non-clinical criteria have also been defended by Spanish scientific societies and public institutions, including setting an age cut-off value for unilaterally withholding ALS, using ‘social utility’ criteria, prioritising healthcare professionals or using ‘first come, first served’ policies. This paper describes the most common triage criteria used in the Spanish context during the COVID-19 epidemic. We will highlight our missed opportunities by comparing these criteria to those used in organ transplantation protocols. The problems posed by subjective, non-clinical criteria will also be discussed. We hope that this critical review might be of use to countries at earlier stages of the epidemic while we learn from our mistakes.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Herreros"", ""affiliation"": [""Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario Fundacion Alcorcon Servicio de Medicina Interna, Alcorcón, Comunidad de Madrid, Spain"", ""Instituto de Ética Clínica Francisco Vallés, Universidad Europea de Madrid Campus de Villaviciosa de Odón, Villaviciosa de Odón, Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Pablo Gella"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto de Ética Clínica Francisco Vallés, Universidad Europea de Madrid Campus de Villaviciosa de Odón, Villaviciosa de Odón, Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Diego Real de Asua"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain"", ""Division of Medical Ethics, Cornell University Joan and Sanford I Weill Medical College, New York, New York, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/ajt.15253"", ""10.1111/dewb.12201"", ""10.1353/ken.0.0035"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114"", ""10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.05.019"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-150-2-200901200-00011"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2005689"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.6939), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6908)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

Many researchers have investigated measures to improve the quality of informed consent, but it is not clear which techniques work best and why. To address this problem, we propose developing a core outcome set (COS) to evaluate interventions designed to improve the consent process for surgery in adult patients with capacity. Part of this process involves reviewing existing research that has reported what is important to patients and doctors in the informed consent process. Methods This qualitative synthesis comprises four phases: identification of published papers and determining their relevance; appraisal of the quality of the papers; identification and summary of the key findings from each paper while determining the definitiveness of each finding against the primary data; comparison of key themes between papers such that findings are linked across studies. Results Searches of bibliographic databases returned 11,073 titles. Of these, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were published between 1996 and 2016 and included a total of 367 patients and 74 health care providers. Thirteen studies collected data using in-depth interviews and constant comparison was the most common means of qualitative analysis. A total of 94 findings were extracted from the primary papers and divided into 17 categories and ultimately 6 synthesised findings related to: patient characteristics, knowledge, communication, the model patient, trust and decision making. Conclusions This qualitative meta-aggregation is the first to examine the issue of informed consent for surgery. It has revealed several outcomes deemed important to capture by patients and clinicians when evaluating the quality of a consent process. Some of these outcomes have not been examined previously in research comparing methods for informed consent. This review is an important step in the development of a COS to evaluate interventions designed to improve the consent process for surgery. Registration The study protocol was registered on the international prospective register for systematic reviews (PROSPERO ID: CRD42017077101).","[{""name"": ""L. J.

In particular, we focus on the operationalization of the first of the two conditions (Santoni de Sio and Van den Hoven 2018) investigated: the so-called ‘tracking’ condition. Our investigation is led in relation to one specific subcase of automated system: dual-mode driving systems (e.g. Tesla ‘autopilot’). First, we connect and compare meaningful human control with a concept of control very popular in engineering and traffic psychology (Michon 1985), and we explain to what extent tracking resembles and differs from it. This will help clarifying the extent to which the idea of meaningful human control is connected to, but also goes beyond, current notions of control in engineering and psychology. Second, we take the systematic analysis of practical reasoning as traditionally presented in the philosophy of human action (Anscombe, Bratman, Mele) and we adapt it to offer a general framework where different types of reasons and agents are identified according to their relation to an automated system’s behaviour. This framework is meant to help explaining what reasons and what agents (should) play a role in controlling a given system, thereby enabling policy makers to produce usable guidelines and engineers to design systems that properly respond to selected human reasons. In the final part, we discuss a practical example of how our framework could be employed in designing automated driving systems.","[{""name"": ""Giulio Mecacci"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Filippo Santoni de Sio"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2184542"", ""10.2307/2184542"", ""10.1109/MITS.2019.2926278"", ""10.1093/0199246270.003.0001"", ""10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195071146.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-2173-6"", ""10.1093/mind/LXXXIV.1.481"", ""10.3389/frobt.2018.00015"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5930.2007.00346.x"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.04.014"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-7762-0"", ""10.1002/9781118551424.ch4""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1007/s11229-020-02868-w,SYNTHESE,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0101 Philosophy,Engineering what? On concepts in conceptual engineering,"AbstractConceptual engineers aim to revise rather than describe our concepts. But what are concepts? And how does one engineer them? Answering these questions is of central importance for implementing and theorizing about conceptual engineering. This paper discusses and criticizes two influential views of this issue: semanticism, according to which conceptual engineers aim to change linguistic meanings, and psychologism, according to which conceptual engineers aim to change psychological structures. I argue that neither of these accounts can give us the full story. Instead, I propose and defend the Dual Content View of Conceptual Engineering. On this view, conceptual engineering targets concepts, where concepts are understood as having two (interrelated) kinds of contents: referential content and cognitive content. I show that this view is independently plausible and that it gives us a comprehensive account of conceptual engineering that helps to make progress on some of the most difficult problems surrounding conceptual engineering.","[{""name"": ""Steffen Koch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0002"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/61.1.157"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.1979.tb00374.x"", ""10.2307/2185131"", ""10.1111/phc3.12086"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195367638.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-020-01416-z"", ""10.7312/devi90836"", ""10.1057/9781137344557_15"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/47.1.187"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2015.1083468"", ""10.1093/0198236360.001.0001"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00201"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2006.00139.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199892631.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1719881"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-02007-6"", ""10.1002/9780470693711"", ""10.1007/s11229-019-02237-2"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-1798-4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198712053.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195306880.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198807520.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-0017.00081"", ""10.1007/s11229-019-02096-x"", ""10.1093/mind/fzz069"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3169.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2017.1385522"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625251.014"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(83)90044-6"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2019.1675534"", ""10.1093/arisoc/aoy008"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0018"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1805708"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199653850.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199697908.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198801856.003.0021"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00269.x"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/66.1.145""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Most digital contact tracing projects in the United States and Europe have prioritized privacy protections in the form of local storage of data on smartphones and the deidentification of information. However, in the prioritization of privacy in this narrow form, there is not sufficient attention given to weighing ethical trade‐offs within the context of a public health pandemic or to the need to evaluate safety and effectiveness of software‐based technology applied to public health.","[{""name"": ""Nicole Martinez‐Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sarah Wieten"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Magnus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mildred K.

10.1007/s10551-023-05382-4,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Corporate Social Responsibility in Family Firms: Status and Future Directions of a Research Field,"AbstractThis systematic literature review contributes to the increasing interest regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) in family firms—a research field that has developed considerably in the last few years. It now provides the opportunity to take a holistic view on the relationship dynamics—i.e., drivers, activities, outcomes, and contextual influences—of family firms with CSR, thus enabling a more coherent organization of current research and a sounder understanding of the phenomenon. To conceptualize the research field, we analyzed 122 peer-reviewed articles published in highly ranked journals identifying the main issues examined. The results clearly show a lack of research regarding CSR outcomes in family firms. Although considered increasingly crucial in family firm research, a study investigating family outcomes (e.g., family community status, family emotional well-being), as opposed to firm outcomes, is missing. This literature review outlines the current state of research and contributes to the actual debate on CSR in family firms by discussing how family firms can use CSR activities as strategic management tools. Moreover, our analysis shows a black box indicating how CSR links different antecedents and outcomes. The black box is significant since firms generally need to know where to allocate their scarce resources to generate the best outcomes. We identify nine research questions based on these findings, which we hope will inspire future research.","[{""name"": ""Christoph Stock"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Pütz"",

Transgender (trans) youth experience barriers to needed gender-affirming care, often rooted in ethical and legal issues, such as healthcare provider concerns regarding youth capacity and rights to consent to hormone therapy. Even when decision-making capacity is present, youth may lack the legal authority to give consent. The aims of this paper are therefore to provide an empirical analysis of minor trans youth capacity to consent to hormone therapy and to address the normative question of whether there is ethical justification for granting trans youth the authority to consent to this care. Through qualitative content analysis of interviews with trans youth, parents, and healthcare providers, we found that trans youth demonstrated the understandings and abilities characteristic of the capacity to consent to hormone therapy and that they did consent to hormone therapy with positive outcomes. Employing deontological and consequentialist reasoning and drawing on a foundation of empirical evidence, human rights, and best interests we conclude that granting trans youth with decisional capacity both the right and the legal authority to consent to hormone therapy via the informed consent model of care is ethically justified.","[{""name"": ""Drew B.

This article identifies two ideal-typical versions of this narrative: the white Christian nation and the colorblind Judeo-Christian nation. The two narratives share a common declension structure, but differ in their framing of how religion and race intersect as markers of American belonging and power. Although participants in right-wing movements often slide back and forth between the two narratives in practice, distinguishing between them analytically enables us to better understand how the two renderings of American history carry different meanings and perform different kinds of political work for participants in these movements. Theoretically, the analysis extends the insights of a “complex religion” approach to sites beyond organized religion, while also demonstrating how scholarship on Christian nationalism and on right-wing movements’ use of national history could each be enhanced by greater attention to the other.","[{""name"": ""Ruth Braunstein"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, USA""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315659442"", ""10.1177/000312240807300103"", ""10.1353/book49832"", ""10.4159/9780674984943"", ""10.1086/231250"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102602"", ""10.1177/1948550617751583"", ""10.1177/0003122416663683"", ""10.1007/s11133-015-9314-3"", ""10.1057/s41290-017-0042-x"", ""10.1525/california/9780520293649.001.0001"", ""10.1093/socrel/sry013"", ""10.4324/9780429467769"", ""10.1093/socrel/srw056"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-115916"", ""10.3998/mpub.327258"", ""10.1093/sf/soy080"", ""10.1093/socrel/srw057"", ""10.1177/000312240607100203"", ""10.1093/sf/sow063"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226663999.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2095325"", ""10.1093/0195149181.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400885008"", ""10.1057/s41290-017-0043-9"", ""10.4324/9780429318146"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190230975.001.0001"", ""10.2307/800260"", ""10.7312/hawl18512"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674369399"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199913787.001.0001"", ""10.1080/17467586.2018.1563904"", ""10.7312/jack19344"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479835119.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400839810"", ""10.1177/0735275112437164"", ""10.1177/1065912908314197"", ""10.7312/mcve19006"", ""10.1515/9781400889181"", ""10.1515/9781400888931"", ""10.1177/0735275120926197"", ""10.1017/S1755048308000059"", ""10.1017/S1537592709090148"", ""10.1177/0956797612451466"", ""10.1093/sf/soaa029"", ""10.4324/9780203076804"", ""10.23943/princeton/9780691163611.001.0001"", ""10.1057/s41290-017-0037-7"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081309-150106"", ""10.1177/2050303217732130"", ""10.2307/2712839"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199832637.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226229225.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490347"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195368024.001.0001"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-24-2-137"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511750717"", ""10.12987/9780300252316"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190057886.001.0001"", ""10.1093/socrel/srx047"", ""10.1086/674007"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074420"", ""10.2307/3711806"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479838271.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400837243"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479838271.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226993058.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the themeTechnology, Megatrends and Work. Of all the profound changes in business, technology is perhaps the most ubiquitous. There is not a facet of our lives unaffected by internet technologies and artificial intelligence. The Journal of Business Ethics established a dedicated section that focuses on Technology and Business Ethics, yet issues related to this phenomenon run right through all the sections. Kirsten Martin, editor of the Technology and Business Ethics section, joins our interim social media editor, Hannah Trittin-UIbrich, to advance a human-centric approach to the development and application of digital technologies that places Business Ethics at centre of the analysis. For Shuili Du, technology is the defining condition for a new era of Corporate Social Responsibility—CSR 3.0—which she defines as “a company’s socially responsible strategies and practices that deal with key ethical and socio-technical issues associated with AI and related technologies on the one hand and leverage the power of AI and related technologies to tackle social and environmental problems on the other hand.” It is not just technologies that are a determining feature of our lives but technology companies, an argument made by Glen Whelan as he examines Big Business and the need for a Big Business Ethics as we try to understand the impact of Big Tech on our post-work world. Indeed, as noted by Ernesto Noronha and Premilla D’Cruz, megatrends in addition to advancement in technologies, namely globalization, the greening of economies, and changes in demographics and migration, are shaping the future for workers in ways previously unimaginable. Contributing to this important debate, Praveen Parboteeah considers the influence of another longstanding but oft overlooked megatrend, the role of religion in the workplace. Given the enormity of the influence of technology and other megatrends in our world, it is not surprising that this essay introduces ground-breaking ideas that speak to the future of business ethics research.","[{""name"": ""Premilla D’Cruz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shuili Du"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ernesto Noronha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K.

A citizens' jury study in the UK,"BackgroundUse of routinely collected patient data for research and service planning is an explicit policy of the UK National Health Service and UK government. Much clinical information is recorded in free-text letters, reports and notes. These text data are generally lost to research, due to the increased privacy risk compared with structured data. We conducted a citizens’ jury which asked members of the public whether their medical free-text data should be shared for research for public benefit, to inform an ethical policy.MethodsEighteen citizens took part over 3 days. Jurors heard a range of expert presentations as well as arguments for and against sharing free text, and then questioned presenters and deliberated together. They answered a questionnaire on whether and how free text should be shared for research, gave reasons for and against sharing and suggestions for alleviating their concerns.ResultsJurors were in favour of sharing medical data and agreed this would benefit health research, but were more cautious about sharing free-text than structured data. They preferred processing of free text where a computer extracted information at scale. Their concerns were lack of transparency in uses of data, and privacy risks. They suggested keeping patients informed about uses of their data, and giving clear pathways to opt out of data sharing.ConclusionsInformed citizens suggested a transparent culture of research for the public benefit, and continuous improvement of technology to protect patient privacy, to mitigate their concerns regarding privacy risks of using patient text data.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth Ford"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Malcolm Oswald"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lamiece Hassan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kyle Bozentko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Goran Nenadic"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jackie Cassell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.23889/ijpds.v3i4.918"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1714229"", ""10.12688/wellcomeopenres.13531.1"", ""10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x"", ""10.1136/bmj.h2135"", ""10.1007/s40264-017-0506-5"", ""10.1002/pds.4173"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17020-7"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-9-42"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2010-000025"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-13-105"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2011.05.001"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011664"", ""10.13063/2327-9214.1079"", ""10.1055/s-0038-1634239"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010393"", ""10.1145/2064747.2064757"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocv180"", ""10.1016/j.jbi.2018.10.005"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-10-70"", ""10.1097/MLR.0b013e3182585355"", ""10.1186/s12911-018-0623-9"", ""10.1016/j.jbi.2017.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.02.487"", ""10.1093/schbul/sbu120"", ""10.2147/JHL.S70021"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.03.024"", ""10.2196/jmir.7763"", ""10.1111/j.1747-4469.2004.tb00338.x"", ""10.1136/medethics-2014-102374"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00250"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-0131-8_9"", ""10.5840/enviroethics19901231"", ""10.1111/j.1369-7625.2006.00387.x"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2007.08.007"", ""10.1111/hex.12871"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.03.005"", ""10.1093/fampra/cms036"", ""10.2196/jmir.5011"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-13-72"", ""10.1093/ije/dyv098"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-10933-3"", ""10.1002/lrh2.10191""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Health Information Management', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7414), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7405)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Building on the emerging literature on the ethics of SEs, I conceptualise ethics as an engagement with power relations. I develop theoretical arguments to understand the interaction between ethical predispositions of a SE and the normative structure of the social system in which it operates. I applied this conceptualisation in a hierarchical and heterogeneous rural Indian context to provide insights into the moral ambiguity of ethical decision-making and suggest pathways for ethical actions. Taking a qualitative case study approach, I followed an exemplary SE’s implementation process in India. I observed ethical challenges in designing the implementation process (efficiency versus equality), selecting the beneficiaries (fairness versus power) and sustaining the programme (cooperation versus autonomy). I also identified three actions of the SE—the action of recognition, the action of reposition and the action of collaboration—and developed a transformative process model. I discuss the theoretical implications of this research for SEs and recommend a critical engagement with ethical theories to address systemic problems.","[{""name"": ""Babita Bhatt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0891243206289499"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3631-2"", ""10.1177/0018726714559433"", ""10.1177/0021886304266847"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2445-8"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01042.x"", ""10.22617/FLS189307"", ""10.1177/0899764008316054"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2446-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3998-8"", ""10.5465/annals.2018.0029"", ""10.1177/0149206320925881"", ""10.5465/19416520.2014.893615"", ""10.1177/0090591713499762"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3451-4"", ""10.1017/S1052150X00400060"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3902-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2934-4"", ""10.1111/roiw.12439"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2439-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3922-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0265-z"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.2006.00493.x"", ""10.5465/amr.2013.0451"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2008.03.002"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0292-9"", ""10.1287/orsc.1100.0620"", ""10.35188/UNU-WIDER/2018/617-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04344-z"", ""10.1177/0170840619867721"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3858-6"", ""10.1111/1467-9361.00112"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2450-y"", ""10.1177/0170840609334954"", ""10.1080/00220388.2015.1126249"", ""10.1080/14672715.2017.1295358"", ""10.5465/amj.2007.24160888"", ""10.1086/231294"", ""10.1177/02632760122051760"", ""10.17730/0018-7259.76.2.150"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.0628"", ""10.2307/2026720"", ""10.5465/amle.2005.16132558"", ""10.1177/1094428112452151"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.03.032"", ""10.1215/9780822374312-002"", ""10.1111/joms.12325"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2449-4"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.10.018"", ""10.1017/mor.2019.19"", ""10.1111/beer.12026"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1433-0"", ""10.3390/su10030829"", ""10.3102/0013189X025003017"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01076.x"", ""10.1177/0149206311398135"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2014.06.004"", ""10.1177/0007650309345457"", ""10.5465/amr.2017.0127"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3893-3"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3113-y"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.0627"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9238-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1814-z"", ""10.1017/S0026749X19000039"", ""10.1111/joms.12322"", ""10.1177/0950017007082886"", ""10.1007/s10796-020-09991-6"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102256"", ""10.5465/amr.2006.20208683"", ""10.1017/beq.2016.47"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7660.2004.00350.x"", ""10.1177/0170840615613372"", ""10.1177/0170840617727777"", ""10.1177/0003122418822335"", ""10.1287/orsc.2015.0968"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X20170000050012"", ""10.1177/0007650320928959"", ""10.1177/0149206318793196"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1413-4"", ""10.1057/9781403973665"", ""10.1177/0149206305279601"", ""10.1108/ejm-02-2020-0139"", ""10.1177/0170840615622066"", ""10.1177/0149206316633268"", ""10.1111/joms.12333"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.06.003"", ""10.5465/amj.2013.0483"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3855-9"", ""10.1080/19460171.2011.576529"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2756-4"", ""10.3390/su10020427"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9275-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2769-z"", ""10.1177/0170840612470256"", ""10.1287/orsc.1110.0663"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.04.010"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2049-3"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2008.04.007"", ""10.2189/asqu.2011.56.1.001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Demography', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"
10.1017/beq.2019.24,BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Breaking the Privacy Paradox: The Value of Privacy and Associated Duty of Firms,"ABSTRACT:The oft-cited privacy paradox is the perceived disconnect between individuals’ stated privacy expectations, as captured in surveys, and consumer market behavior in going online: individuals purport to value privacy yet still disclose information to firms. The goal of this paper is to empirically examine the conceptualization of privacy postdisclosure assumed in the privacy paradox. Contrary to the privacy paradox, the results here suggest consumers retain strong privacy expectations even after disclosing information. Privacy violations are valued akin to security violations in creating distrust in firms and in consumer (un)willingness to engage with firms. This paper broadens the scope of corporate responsibility to suggest firms have a positive obligation to identify reasonable expectations of privacy of consumers. In addition, research perpetuating the privacy paradox, through the mistaken framing of disclosure as proof of anti-privacy behavior, gives license to firms to act contrary to the interests of consumers.","[{""name"": ""Kirsten Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2753/MIS0742-1222260305"", ""10.2307/1321160"", ""10.1509/jmkg.68.1.1.24036"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1478214"", ""10.1016/j.ijindorg.2011.11.004"", ""10.1086/689933"", ""10.1007/s11747-016-0504-7"", ""10.1509/jmkg.66.1.15.18449"", ""10.1509/jppm.19.1.62.16949"", ""10.1509/jm.11.0316"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2017.02.003"", ""10.1037/a0034231"", ""10.1509/jppm.14.139"", ""10.1509/jm.15.0497"", ""10.1002/dir.20009"", ""10.1177/0270467607311484"", ""10.1126/science.aaa1465"", ""10.1287/isre.13.3.334.81"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2839-2"", ""10.1111/j.1741-3737.2006.00264.x"", ""10.1177/0149206305279602"", ""10.1016/j.joep.2011.05.007"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2049"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.08.034"", ""10.1287/isre.1060.0080"", ""10.2307/25148779"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2013.777757"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2004.03.001"", ""10.5840/beq201020327"", ""10.1006/game.1995.1027"", ""10.1509/jppm.19.1.54.16942"", ""10.5465/amr.1994.9410210749"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2017.04.013"", ""10.1016/S0167-2681(01)00216-5"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6606.2006.00070.x"", ""10.1016/S0963-8687(02)00018-5"", ""10.1111/1540-4560.00072"", ""10.5840/beq200616340"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2565-9"", ""10.1111/1540-4560.00067"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2015.10.002"", ""10.1145/2976749.2978313"", ""10.1177/0049124105283121"", ""10.1108/02635570610666403"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2951322"", ""10.1108/JCM-10-2013-0737"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2016.06.001"", ""10.1509/jmkg.68.2.1.27786"", ""10.1016/j.cose.2015.07.002"", ""10.1509/jmr.11.0503"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.03.004"", ""10.2307/3094850"", ""10.1002/asi.23500"", ""10.1111/jcom.12276"", ""10.1177/074391569101200206"", ""10.1007/BF00144949"", ""10.1093/0195104609.001.0001"", ""10.1287/isre.1040.0015""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

These policies or interventions, however, frequently fail to recognize how the beneficiaries have historically embodied the cumulative effects of marginalization, which undermines the effectiveness of the intended justice. These well-meaning attempts at justice are bounded by greater socio-historical constraints. Bounded justice suggests that it is impossible to attend to fairness, entitlement, and equity when the basic social and physical infrastructures underlying them have been eroded by racism and other historically entrenched isms. Using the case of Brazil’s National Health Policy for the Black Population, this paper proposes that bounded justice can contribute to justice discourses by serving as a concept, a proffering to a multi-disciplinary conceptual framework, and a potential analytic for those interested in the design of policy, technology, and programmatic interventions towards health equity.","[{""name"": ""Melissa S.

These restrictions were justified on the basis the health system may be overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and in order to prevent deaths. Governments are now considering how they may de-escalate these restrictions. This article argues that an appropriate approach may be to lift the general lockdown but implement selective isolation of the elderly. While this discriminates against the elderly, there is a morally relevant difference—the elderly are far more likely to require hospitalisation and die than the rest of the population. If the aim is to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed and to reduce the death rate, preventing the elderly from contracting the virus may be an effective means of achieving this. The alternative is to continue to keep everyone in lockdown. It is argued that this is levelling down equality and is unethical. It suggests that in order for the elderly to avoid contracting the virus, the whole population should have their liberty deprived, even though the same result could be achieved by only restricting the liberty of the elderly. Similar arguments may also be applied to all groups at increased risk of COVID-19, such as men and those with comorbidities, the obese and people from ethnic minorities or socially deprived groups. This utilitarian concern must be balanced against other considerations, such as equality and justice, and the benefits gained from discriminating in these ways must be proportionately greater than the negative consequences of doing so. Such selective discrimination will be most justified when the liberty restriction to a group promotes the well-being of that group (apart from its wider social benefits).","[{""name"": ""Julian Savulescu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Cameron"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30243-7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802058"", ""10.1017/S096318012000095X"", ""10.1093/ajj/56.1.17"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00577-8"", ""10.2307/j.ctv22d4zp9"", ""10.1111/1467-9329.00041"", ""10.1016/j.bja.2020.04.011"", ""10.1126/science.abc3517""]",['Health Professions'],"['Emergency Medical Services', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Quality Inferences for Core and Peripheral Attributes","AbstractSustainable products offered in today’s marketplace are labelled with product-related green attributes (i.e. green core attributes) or non-product-related green attributes (i.e. green peripheral attributes). The current research investigates consumers’ inferences about a product’s functional quality when its core attributes are green (e.g. the ingredients) and when its peripheral attributes are green (e.g. the product packaging). Four experimental studies and an internal meta-analysis show that there is a sustainability liability effect in strength-dependent categories (for both core and peripheral attributes), and a sustainability asset effect in gentleness-dependent categories (for core attributes only). Our research contributes to the current understanding of how consumers make inferences about product quality when contemplating different types of green attributes. The findings have implications for how strength-dependent and gentleness-dependent products should be labelled as green.","[{""name"": ""Siv Skard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sveinung Jørgensen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lars Jacob Tynes Pedersen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10551-006-9287-y"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucw044"", ""10.1509/jmkr.38.3.349.18865"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2080-4"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.01.050"", ""10.1086/208539"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2007.01.001"", ""10.1111/jeea.12019"", ""10.1509/jm.13.0303"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.60.4.509"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.733"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3512-8"", ""10.1037/a0017346"", ""10.1257/0022051043004577"", ""10.1177/002224299305700101"", ""10.1509/jm.11.0264"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5885.2012.00970.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2695-0"", ""10.1509/jmkg.74.5.18"", ""10.1037/met0000086"", ""10.1086/677841"", ""10.1509/jm.13.0387"", ""10.1007/s11747-012-0305-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2764-4"", ""10.3758/BRM.40.3.879"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.03.029"", ""10.1007/s11002-017-9420-y"", ""10.1007/s10603-010-9140-7"", ""10.2501/JAR-2018-025""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

Amidst a dearth of such data and guided by evidence that nurses in ICUs experience personal, professional and existential issues in similar conditions, a systematic scoping review (SSR) is proposed to evaluate prevailing accounts of physicians facing dying patients in ICUs through the lens of Personhood. Such data would enhance understanding and guide the provision of better support for ICU physicians. Methods An SSR adopts the Systematic Evidenced Based Approach (SEBA) to map prevailing accounts of caring for dying patients in ICUs. To enhance the transparency and reproducibility of this process, concurrent and independent use of tabulated summaries, thematic analysis and directed content analysis (Split Approach) is adopted. Results Eight thousand three hundred fifty-eight abstracts were reviewed from four databases, 474 full-text articles were evaluated, 58 articles were included, and the Split Approach revealed six categories/themes centered around the Innate, Individual, Relational and Societal Rings of Personhood, conflicts in providing end of life care and coping mechanisms employed. Conclusion This SSR suggests that caring for dying patients in ICU impacts how physicians view their personhood. To resolve conflicts within individual concepts of personhood, physicians use prioritization, reframing and rely on accessible, personalized support from colleagues to steer coping strategies. An adapted form of the Ring Theory of Personhood is proposed to direct timely personalized, appropriate and holistic support.","[{""name"": ""Joshua Tze Yin Kuek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lisa Xin Ling Ngiam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nur Haidah Ahmad Kamal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeng Long Chia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Natalie Pei Xin Chan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Bin Hanifah Marican Abdurrahman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chong Yao Ho"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lorraine Hui En Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jun Leng Goh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michelle Shi Qing Khoo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yun Ting Ong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Min Chiam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Annelissa Mien Chew Chin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephen Mason"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lalit Kumar Radha Krishna"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30161-2"", ""10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x"", ""10.1213/ANE.0000000000004866"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3976"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.3972"", ""10.1186/s13054-020-02926-2"", ""10.1186/s13054-020-2841-7"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8"", ""10.1176/appi.ps.55.9.1055"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2006.02.012"", ""10.1186/s13054-020-2814-x"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.00171"", ""10.1089/jpm.2011.0168"", ""10.3934/publichealth.2016.1.172"", ""10.1097/XEB.0000000000000050"", ""10.1007/s11606-009-1165-8"", ""10.1186/1741-7015-11-20"", ""10.1007/s11606-008-0664-3"", ""10.1093/intqhc/mzm042"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.1080/01421590310001608667"", ""10.1186/s12916-014-0143-0"", ""10.1111/bioe.12085"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.10.036"", ""10.1097/TA.0b013e3181f66878"", ""10.1089/jpm.2011.0307"", ""10.1016/j.jcrc.2014.10.011"", ""10.1007/s11019-007-9097-8"", ""10.1097/01.CCM.0000254722.50608.2D"", ""10.1191/0969733004ne723oa"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000002710"", ""10.1513/AnnalsATS.201702-105OC"", ""10.1177/1049909114565108"", ""10.1016/j.iccn.2010.06.005"", ""10.1186/s12904-016-0135-2"", ""10.1016/j.jcrc.2016.04.033"", ""10.1007/s00134-010-2124-x"", ""10.1093/qjmed/hcv059"", ""10.1177/1054773814533791"", ""10.1053/jcrc.2003.YJCRC4"", ""10.1136/medethics-2012-100619"", ""10.1016/j.aucc.2016.08.001"", ""10.1186/s13049-019-0648-9"", ""10.1177/0885066616678394"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000003138"", ""10.1016/S0964-3397(03)00055-7"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106330"", ""10.1136/jme.2006.017442"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-105250"", ""10.1136/jme.20.4.218"", ""10.1186/cc3486"", ""10.1177/1049909118771378"", ""10.1186/1472-684X-13-41"", ""10.4025/psicolestud.v21i1.28480"", ""10.4037/ajcc2017774"", ""10.1177/0885066610393465"", ""10.1097/00003246-199801000-00015"", ""10.1164/rccm.200207-752OC"", ""10.1016/j.jcrc.2004.09.006"", ""10.1007/s11673-012-9416-5"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2004.00816.x"", ""10.1097/CNQ.0b013e318268fe35"", ""10.1136/bmjspcare-2012-000208""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

We argue that relational valuing includes aspects of intrinsic and instrumental valuing. If relational values are attributed, objects are appreciated because the relationship with them contributes to the human flourishing component of well-being (instrumental aspect). At the same time, attributing relational value involves genuine esteem for the valued item (intrinsic aspect). We also introduce the notions of mediating and indirect relational environmental values, attributed in relationships involving people as well as environmental objects. We close by proposing how our analysis can be used in empirical research.","[{""name"": ""Anna Deplazes-Zemp"", ""affiliation"": [""Ethics Research Institute (ERI) University of Zurich Zurich, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Mollie Chapman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Geography University of Zurich Zurich, Switzerland""]}]","[""10.3197/096327118X15144698637513"", ""10.1007/s10806-019-09762-7"", ""10.1073/pnas.1525002113"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2018.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.11.011"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104900"", ""10.2307/2025709"", ""10.1007/s11625-019-00721-9"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2018.09.005"", ""10.5840/enviroethics20194112"", ""10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108325"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2018.10.009"", ""10.1023/A:1009782403793"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0183962"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2018.10.022"", ""10.2307/2184924"", ""10.1515/9783110802832"", ""10.1007/s10806-015-9584-5"", ""10.3197/096327111X13077055166063"", ""10.5840/bjp2016813"", ""10.4324/9780203416570"", ""10.4324/9780203495452"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-07058-1_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-476-05193-6"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2016.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.jnc.2017.02.007"", ""10.1111/j.0066-7372.2003.00002.x"", ""10.1007/s11299-005-0007-6"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2018.10.017"", ""10.1038/515027a"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195108651.001.0001"", ""10.5840/enviroethics199012221"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2018.10.008""]","['Environmental Science', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"
10.1111/phc3.12757,PHILOSOPHY COMPASS,0101 Philosophy,Structural injustice,"AbstractThe concept of “structural injustice” has a long intellectual lineage, but Iris Marion Young popularised the term in her late work in the 2000s. Young’s theory tapped into the zeitgeist of the time, providing a credible way of thinking about transnational and domestic injustices, illuminating the importance of political, economic and social structures in generating injustice, theorising the role of individuals in perpetuating structural injustice, and the responsibility of everyone to try to correct it. Young’s theory has inspired secondary and novel research. In this paper, I outline the main topics in this recent literature: what structural injustice is, responsibility for structural injustice, acting on responsibility, avoiding responsibility, and historical injustice. I conclude by noting how the influence of structural injustice theory is spreading beyond the confines of political theory. Any field that is concerned with structural inequalities, disadvantage, or oppression, can utilize structural injustice theory.","[{""name"": ""Maeve McKeown"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Philosophy University of Cambridge Cambridge UK""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780190662936.001.0001"", ""10.1111/josp.12251"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201942655"", ""10.1093/ijtj/iju004"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316104354.004"", ""10.1080/13698230.2020.1786307"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812507"", ""10.1093/sp/jxx022"", ""10.1093/phe/phs001"", ""10.1111/josp.12426"", ""10.1080/17496535.2012.667139"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16161-4"", ""10.1080/21550085.2017.1291828"", ""10.2307/2219309"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195389128.003.0016"", ""10.1080/17449620902765336"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199534777.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199892631.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0434-5"", ""10.1086/688355"", ""10.1111/josp.12268"", ""10.5040/9781350139084"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663758"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2011.00403.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781108329491"", ""10.1111/1468-2230.12530"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190498627.001.0001"", ""10.1111/josp.12253"", ""10.1057/s41296-020-00463-9"", ""10.5040/9781350195813"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929023.001.0001"", ""10.3138/ijfab.2.1.77"", ""10.1080/15265161.2012.756560"", ""10.1111/misp.12026"", ""10.1017/9781108325592"", ""10.1017/S089267941800031X"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2010.01159.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190053987.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674042605"", ""10.1017/S0265052500002454"", ""10.1111/josp.12250"", ""10.1177/0007650312449577"", ""10.1086/229967"", ""10.1080/03057920802351291"", ""10.1111/josp.12369"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2004.00205.x"", ""10.1353/dss.2006.0052"", ""10.1017/S0265052506060043"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195392388.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10677-018-9892-8"", ""10.1080/14409917.2019.1596202""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1093/jmp/jhab014,JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Statement in Support of Revising the Uniform Determination of Death Act and in Opposition to a Proposed Revision,"Abstract Discrepancies between the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) and the adult and pediatric diagnostic guidelines for brain death (BD) (the “Guidelines”) have motivated proposals to revise the UDDA. A revision proposed by Lewis, Bonnie and Pope (the RUDDA), has received particular attention, the three novelties of which would be: (1) to specify the Guidelines as the legally recognized “medical standard,” (2) to exclude hypothalamic function from the category of “brain function,” and (3) to authorize physicians to conduct an apnea test without consent and even over a proxy’s objection. One hundred seven experts in medicine, bioethics, philosophy, and law, spanning a wide variety of perspectives, have come together in agreement that while the UDDA needs revision, the RUDDA is not the way to do it. Specifically, (1) the Guidelines have a non-negligible risk of false-positive error, (2) hypothalamic function is more relevant to the organism as a whole than any brainstem reflex, and (3) the apnea test carries a risk of precipitating BD in a non-BD patient, provides no benefit to the patient, does not reliably accomplish its intended purpose, and is not even absolutely necessary for diagnosing BD according to the internal logic of the Guidelines; it should at the very least require informed consent, as do many procedures that are much more beneficial and less risky. Finally, objections to a neurologic criterion of death are not based only on religious belief or ignorance. People have a right to not have a concept of death that experts vigorously debate imposed upon them against their judgment and conscience; any revision of the UDDA should therefore contain an opt-out clause for those who accept only a circulatory-respiratory criterion.","[{""name"": ""D Alan Shewmon"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California Los Angeles , Los Angeles, California , USA""]}]","[""10.1212/WNL.45.5.1012"", ""10.1136/bmj.313.7048.13"", ""10.1086/JCE2018291031"", ""10.1097/ALN.0000000000000023"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2010.01839.x"", ""10.1542/peds.84.3.429"", ""10.1016/S0022-3476(77)81023-8"", ""10.1136/jme.2006.016014"", ""10.1001/jama.1968.03140320031009"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1754501"", ""10.1017/S0963180119000574"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1754512"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(76)90313-5"", ""10.1177/088307389501000320"", ""10.1097/00003246-200004000-00081"", ""10.1002/hast.957"", ""10.1007/s10730-016-9307-y"", ""10.1590/S0100-879X1999001200005"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhq009"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61224-5"", ""10.1177/0885066618784268"", ""10.1007/s12028-014-9958-y"", ""10.1001/archneur.1989.00520370016010"", ""10.1177/152692481102100211"", ""10.1038/s41582-020-00428-x"", ""10.1017/S026646230000667X"", ""10.1007/s10943-019-00874-y"", ""10.1212/WNL.0000000000005926"", ""10.1016/j.clinph.2011.03.022"", ""10.1136/jnnp.35.1.103"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.11586"", ""10.1177/0883073817701048"", ""10.1097/00003246-200002000-00019"", ""10.1111/j.1399-6576.1971.tb00668.x"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1754520"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1754504"", ""10.1001/archpedi.160.7.747"", ""10.1038/sc.2009.115"", ""10.1177/0883073810369380"", ""10.1186/2110-5820-2-4"", ""10.1227/01.neu.0000303200.84994.ae"", ""10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2009.05.007"", ""10.1007/s11673-015-9683-z"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1754508"", ""10.1038/sj.sc.3102107"", ""10.3325/cmj.2013.54.75"", ""10.1148/radiology.179.1.2006312"", ""10.1016/0887-8994(90)90078-F"", ""10.1007/s001340050430"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0404.2005.00527.x"", ""10.1001/archneur.1988.00520250026012"", ""10.1007/s12028-020-00934-2"", ""10.1186/1741-7015-8-68"", ""10.1007/s40124-019-00204-6"", ""10.1212/WNL.0000000000005033"", ""10.1212/WNL.0000000000006154"", ""10.7326/M19-2731"", ""10.7326/L20-0257"", ""10.1016/j.chest.2017.05.030"", ""10.1093/bja/aev034"", ""10.1007/s12028-010-9491-6"", ""10.1353/ken.0.0282"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhq019"", ""10.2307/3527955"", ""10.1186/s13010-016-0042-4"", ""10.2147/MB.S70369"", ""10.1017/S0963180119000598"", ""10.1177/0885066614527410"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e31821f0d4f"", ""10.1001/jama.288.17.2118"", ""10.1177/0024363920926018"", ""10.1542/peds.96.3.518"", ""10.1086/JCE200920213"", ""10.1097/00007890-199409000-00003"", ""10.1007/BF01711544"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1754523"", ""10.1007/BF01701482"", ""10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.09.004"", ""10.1016/S0022-3476(79)80307-8"", ""10.1007/s10943-017-0512-z"", ""10.1177/08830738060210070401"", ""10.1212/WNL.38.8.1275"", ""10.1212/WNL.0000000000008533"", ""10.1007/s12630-010-9359-4"", ""10.1002/hast.956"", ""10.1111/ene.12727"", ""10.1212/WNL.0000000000006750"", ""10.1111/ene.13903"", ""10.1093/jmp/17.4.445"", ""10.1016/j.tins.2009.11.002"", ""10.36646/mjlr.48.2.piercing"", ""10.1177/009885881003600402"", ""10.1136/jme.2011.045385"", ""10.1212/WNL.51.6.1538"", ""10.1076/jmep.26.5.457.3000"", ""10.1177/0883073817736961"", ""10.1002/hast.947"", ""10.1002/hast.962"", ""10.1007/s12028-018-0593-x"", ""10.1055/s-2008-1040938"", ""10.1097/01376517-198808000-00004"", ""10.1136/medethics-2015-103361"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.11665"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1307220"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.3593"", ""10.1016/j.chest.2017.05.032"", ""10.1016/j.chest.2017.05.033"", ""10.1097/00003246-199811000-00040"", ""10.1007/s10943-018-0654-7"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182186687"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182266025"", ""10.1212/WNL.45.5.1003"", ""10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181e62194"", ""10.1212/01.wnl.0000327612.69106.4c"", ""10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181e242a8"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e318222724e"", ""10.1007/s10943-016-0298-4"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1754509"", ""10.1007/BF03021855"", ""10.1001/jama.1989.03420150055037""]","['Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

Second, we discuss the issue of how artificial intelligent (AI) could replace the human cognitive labour of providing such second opinion and find that several AI reach the levels of accuracy and efficiency needed to clarify their use an urgent ethical issue. Third, we outline the normative conditions of how AI may be used as second opinion in clinical processes, weighing the benefits of its efficiency against concerns of responsibility attribution. Fourth, we provide a ‘rule of disagreement’ that fulfils these conditions while retaining some of the benefits of expanding the use of AI-based decision support systems (AI-DSS) in clinical contexts. This is because the rule of disagreement proposes to use AI as much as possible, but retain the ability to use human second opinions to resolve disagreements between AI and physician-in-charge.

Positive religious coping has been linked to better physical and mental health outcomes, while negative religious coping has been associated with increased stress and anxiety. The primary objective of this study was to examine individuals’ use of religious coping during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and religious coping in a national sample of 970 individuals located within the USA recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) between September 12, 2020, and September 25, 2020. Findings indicate negative religious coping is most strongly associated with COVID-19 anxiety, as higher levels of negative religious coping were positively related to COVID-19 anxiety. In a moderated multiple regression wherein positive religious coping and negative religious coping were included in an interaction term, only negative religious coping was significantly associated with COVID-19 anxiety. This may have been due, in part, because individual’s typical religious engagement was disrupted by social distancing and isolation measures. When accounting for participant age, sex, religious beliefs and behaviors, and negative religious coping, positive religious coping was negatively, although weakly, associated with COVID-19 anxiety. These findings suggest that negative religious coping has a stronger association with COVID-19 anxiety than positive religious coping.","[{""name"": ""Tommy DeRossett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Donna J.

Methods We evaluated 1491 sets of reviewer comments from the fields of “Ecology and Evolution” and “Behavioural Medicine,” of which 920 were retrieved from the online review repository Publons and 571 were obtained from six early career investigators. Comment sets were coded for the occurrence of “unprofessional comments” and “incomplete, inaccurate or unsubstantiated critiques” using an a-prior rubric based on our published research. Results are presented as absolute numbers and percentages. Results Overall, 12% (179) of comment sets included at least one unprofessional comment towards the author or their work, and 41% (611) contained incomplete, inaccurate of unsubstantiated critiques (IIUC). Conclusions The large number of unprofessional comments, and IIUCs observed could heighten psychological distress among investigators, particularly those at an early stage in their career. We suggest that development and adherence to a universally agreed upon reviewer code of conduct is necessary to improve the quality and professional experience of peer review.","[{""name"": ""Travis G.

10.1007/s11229-020-02864-0,SYNTHESE,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Meaningful affordances,"AbstractIt has been argued that affordances are not meaningful and are thus not useful to be applied in contexts where specifically meaningfulness of experience is at stake (e.g. clinical contexts or discussions of autonomous agency). This paper aims to reconceptualize affordances such as to make them relevant and applicable in such contexts. It starts by investigating the ‘ambiguity’ of (possibilities for) action. In both philosophy of action and affordance research, this ambiguity is typically resolved by adhering to the agents intentions and concerns. I discuss some recent accounts of affordances that highlight these concerns but argue that they tend to adopt an ‘atomistic’ approach where there is no acknowledgement of how these concerns are embedded in the agents wider concerns, values, projects and commitments. An holistic approach that does acknowledge this can be found in psychological research on agents having a sense of what they’re doing. I will discuss this research in the second part of the paper and argue that agents can analogously have a sense of what is afforded. This is deemed the entry point for understanding the meaningfulness of affordances. In the final part of the paper I apply this analysis to recent attempts which seek to make sense of authentic and autonomous agency in terms of affordances.","[{""name"": ""Roy Dings"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780429316128-2"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2020.102897"", ""10.1007/s11097-014-9369-8"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00599"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_5"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262019958.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0959354395054001"", ""10.1017/9781108685214"", ""10.1037/emo0000314"", ""10.1007/s11097-017-9534-y"", ""10.1080/09515089.2018.1548698"", ""10.17454/pam-1804"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511818172"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.03.003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794325.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s12152-018-9355-x"", ""10.11612/resphil.1723"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198846345.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X97000010"", ""10.1007/s12152-016-9297-0"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.1989.tb00133.x"", ""10.4324/9781410600479"", ""10.1080/15298860903557243"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00805.x"", ""10.1037/14040-000"", ""10.1007/s11097-007-9074-y"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_3"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01090"", ""10.1093/mind/fzn050"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-00610-3_3"", ""10.1080/10407413.2014.958035"", ""10.1521/978.14625/28806"", ""10.1177/1088868317734080"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173483"", ""10.1037/a0018963"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.94.1.3"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.4.660"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-02013-8"", ""10.1007/s11097-017-9548-5"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2018.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.12.003""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Developing cross-section-scale understanding of these systems necessitates structural interpretation. However, over the past several decades a false distinction has arisen between some forms of so-called fault-related folding and buckle folding. We investigate the origins of this confusion and seek to develop unified approaches for interpreting fold–thrust belts that incorporate deformation arising both from the amplification of buckling instabilities and from localized shear failures (thrust faults). Discussions are illustrated using short case studies from the Bolivian Subandean chain (Incahuasi anticline), the Canadian Cordillera (Livingstone anticlinorium) and Subalpine chains of France and Switzerland. Only fault–bend folding is purely fault-related and other forms, such as fault-propagation and detachment folds, all involve components of buckling. Better integration of understanding of buckling processes, the geometries and structural evolutions that they generate may help to understand how deformation is distributed within fold–thrust belts. It may also reduce the current biases engendered by adopting a narrow range of idealized geometries when constructing cross-sections and evaluating structural evolution in these systems.","[{""name"": ""Robert W.

The idea that AI might advance medicine’s understanding of biological categories of psychiatric disorders, as well as provide better treatments, is appealing given the historical challenges with prediction, diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry. Given the power of AI to analyse vast amounts of information, some clinicians may feel obligated to align their clinical judgements with the outputs of the AI system. However, a potential epistemic privileging of AI in clinical judgements may lead to unintended consequences that could negatively affect patient treatment, well-being and rights. The implications are also relevant to precision medicine, digital twin technologies and predictive analytics generally. We propose that a commitment to epistemic humility can help promote judicious clinical decision-making at the interface of big data and AI in psychiatry.","[{""name"": ""Melissa McCradden"", ""affiliation"": [""Joint Centre for Bioethics, University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""Bioethics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""Genetics & Genome Biology, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, Toronto, Ontario, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Katrina Hui"", ""affiliation"": [""Everyday Ethics Lab, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Z Buchman"", ""affiliation"": [""Joint Centre for Bioethics, University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""Everyday Ethics Lab, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada""]}]","[""10.1007/s11920-022-01378-5"", ""10.1007/s11920-019-1094-0"", ""10.1038/s41746-022-00558-0"", ""10.1007/s11013-021-09737-2"", ""10.1017/S0033291721001975"", ""10.1017/S2045796015000621"", ""10.1111/1467-9566.13044"", ""10.1080/13698575.2018.1442918"", ""10.1192/bjp.2022.37"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00391-6"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.28.3.w490"", ""10.1007/s40596-019-01170-3"", ""10.1038/s41746-021-00524-2"", ""10.1126/science.abg1834"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(21)00208-9"", ""10.1145/3531146.3533155"", ""10.4324/9781003016885-25"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.031"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2019.07.005"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61268-9"", ""10.1136/ebm.7.2.36"", ""10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.14020138"", ""10.1038/460202a"", ""10.1126/science.aaz3873"", ""10.1162/artl_a_00336"", ""10.1353/pbm.2019.0012"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0048"", ""10.1111/jep.12852"", ""10.1093/jmp/jhr054"", ""10.1080/15265161.2020.1820104"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2020.00117"", ""10.2196/36199"", ""10.1136/bmj.c5146"", ""10.1136/bmjqs-2016-005969"", ""10.1016/j.patter.2021.100205"", ""10.1192/bjp.2019.245"", ""10.1007/s00787-021-01836-0"", ""10.1186/s12911-020-01332-6"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1002/hast.973"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.11.001"", ""10.1080/15265161.2021.2013977"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i04.6064"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.1221"", ""10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000089"", ""10.1145/3411764.3445717"", ""10.1145/3377325.3377498"", ""10.1038/s41746-021-00385-9"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-0942-0"", ""10.1515/9781683925057"", ""10.1007/s11017-007-9029-x"", ""10.1007/s00464-015-4368-6"", ""10.1007/s13347-021-00450-x"", ""10.1038/s41398-021-01479-4"", ""10.1145/3411764.3445385"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315212043-33"", ""10.4324/9781315212043-34"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.10.003"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01423"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479833641.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114696"", ""10.1080/15265161.2018.1498936"", ""10.2307/2928741"", ""10.1007/s11019-014-9560-2"", ""10.1186/s12916-019-1426-2"", ""10.1001/archpsyc.60.6.637"", ""10.1111/jep.13485"", ""10.1515/9780228004615"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3458-05.2005"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2014.05.018"", ""10.1177/1039856217726224""]",['Medicine'],"['Family Practice', 'Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"
10.1017/beq.2021.42,BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Deep Learning Meets Deep Democracy: Deliberative Governance and Responsible Innovation in Artificial Intelligence,"Responsible innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) calls for public deliberation: well-informed “deep democratic” debate that involves actors from the public, private, and civil society sectors in joint efforts to critically address the goals and means of AI. Adopting such an approach constitutes a challenge, however, due to the opacity of AI and strong knowledge boundaries between experts and citizens. This undermines trust in AI and undercuts key conditions for deliberation. We approach this challenge as a problem of situating the knowledge of actors from the AI industry within a deliberative system. We develop a new framework of responsibilities for AI innovation as well as a deliberative governance approach for enacting these responsibilities. In elucidating this approach, we show how actors from the AI industry can most effectively engage with experts and nonexperts in different social venues to facilitate well-informed judgments on opaque AI systems and thus effectuate their democratic governance.","[{""name"": ""Alexander Buhmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Fieseler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2010.00836.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90869-4_7"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04226-4"", ""10.1007/s00146-021-01154-8"", ""10.1016/S0090-2616(01)00026-2"", ""10.1111/joms.12014"", ""10.1080/19460171.2016.1165126"", ""10.1002/isaf.1422"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375828"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198712220.003.0008"", ""10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110002"", ""10.1177/0162243915605575"", ""10.1093/bjc/azy060"", ""10.1111/npqu.11519"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139178914.006"", ""10.1111/joms.12203"", ""10.5840/beq201020219"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500118"", ""10.1177/0007650316659851"", ""10.1111/joms.12173"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00181"", ""10.1287/mksc.2019.1208"", ""10.3366/epi.2010.0203"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9482-5"", ""10.1177/2053951719860542"", ""10.1177/0162243907311265"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2014.10.004"", ""10.1287/orsc.14.2.209.14992"", ""10.1080/23299460.2019.1575681"", ""10.2307/25750707"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00165-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2769-z"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0337-z"", ""10.1002/csr.171"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101475"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.05.008"", ""10.1016/0016-3287(96)00017-1"", ""10.1017/epi.2013.11"", ""10.1007/s11920-014-0494-4"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2018.1477967"", ""10.1080/1523908X.2013.829750"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.081306.070555"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9478-1"", ""10.1007/s10676-019-09502-5"", ""10.1177/0007650319825876"", ""10.1023/A:1024834510939"", ""10.1177/2053951716679679"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287596"", ""10.5465/amp.2017.0175"", ""10.1111/jopp.12031"", ""10.1002/hast.188"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2014.08.001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198833635.001.0001"", ""10.1038/538311a"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09517-8"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9430-8"", ""10.5840/beq201222445"", ""10.1515/9789048531011-012"", ""10.1080/03071847.2019.1694260"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3921-3"", ""10.1093/019929111X.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118551424"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2161-4"", ""10.1609/aimag.v38i3.2741"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372840"", ""10.1068/c12s"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00355-w"", ""10.1177/0007650312446931"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00354-x"", ""10.1177/2053951717743530"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12137"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12049"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.08.002"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262013246.001.0001"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0320-3"", ""10.1098/rsta.2016.0112"", ""10.5840/schoolman199774428"", ""10.1177/0032329210395000"", ""10.5465/amr.2018.0139"", ""10.1007/s11023-021-09563-w"", ""10.1177/1461444816676645"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.09.011"", ""10.1177/0967010614544204"", ""10.5465/annals.2018.0174"", ""10.3390/su8080797"", ""10.4159/9780674239302"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.5771/2747-5182-2021-1-74"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674736061"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.26585837"", ""10.1109/TTS.2021.3052127"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00667.x"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2018.07.007"", ""10.1017/beq.2019.21"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00280.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00950.x"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9734-1"", ""10.1080/09505430120093586"", ""10.1146/annurev.polisci.6.121901.085538"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0048-x"", ""10.1007/s43681-021-00047-2"", ""10.1007/s00146-017-0760-1"", ""10.1332/030557316X14681503832036"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3027-8"", ""10.1068/cav6""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Self-fulfilling prophecy and responsible neuroprognostic innovation,"A self-fulfilling prophecy (SFP) in neuroprognostication occurs when a patient in coma is predicted to have a poor outcome, and life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn on the basis of that prediction, thus directly bringing about a poor outcome (viz. death) for that patient. In contrast to the predominant emphasis in the bioethics literature, we look beyond the moral issues raised by the possibility that an erroneous prediction might lead to the death of a patient who otherwise would have lived. Instead, we focus on the problematic epistemic consequences of neuroprognostic SFPs in settings where research and practice intersect. When this sort of SFP occurs, the problem is that physicians and researchers are never in a position to notice whether their original prognosis was correct or incorrect, since the patient dies anyway. Thus, SFPs keep us from discerning false positives from true positives, inhibiting proper assessment of novel prognostic tests. This epistemic problem of SFPs thus impedes learning, but ethical obligations of patient care make it difficult to avoid SFPs. We then show how the impediment to catching false positive indicators of poor outcome distorts research on novel techniques for neuroprognostication, allowing biases to persist in prognostic tests. We finally highlight a particular risk that a precautionary bias towards early withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment may be amplified. We conclude with guidelines about how researchers can mitigate the epistemic problems of SFPs, to achieve more responsible innovation of neuroprognostication for patients in coma.","[{""name"": ""Mayli Mertens"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Owen C.

In this paper, we explore the issue of staff safety in clinical work using the example of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the COVID-19 crisis. We articulate some of the specific ethical challenges around PPE currently being faced by front-line clinicians, and develop an approach to staff safety that involves balancing duty to care and personal well-being. We describe each of these values, and present a decision-making framework that integrates the two. The aim of the framework is to guide the process of balancing these two values when staff safety is at stake, by facilitating ethical reflection and/or decision-making that is systematic, specific and transparent. It provides a structure for individual reflection, collaborative staff discussion, and decision-making by those responsible for teams, departments and other groups of healthcare staff. Overall the framework guides the decision maker to characterise the degree of risk to staff, articulate feasible options for staff protection in that specific setting and identify the option that ensures any decrease in patient care is proportionate to the increase in staff well-being. It applies specifically to issues of PPE in COVID-19, and also has potential to assist decision makers in other situations involving protection of healthcare staff.","[{""name"": ""Rosalind J McDougall"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lynn Gillam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Danielle Ko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isabella Holmes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clare Delany"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/jme.2006.018978"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-139-7-200310070-00011"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106250"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106284"", ""10.1177/1477750919897377"", ""10.1080/15265160802317974"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-7-12"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-7-5"", ""10.1080/15265161.2017.1378760"", ""10.1542/peds.2014-1394C"", ""10.1542/peds.2014-1394E"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2015556"", ""10.1136/bmj.321.7272.1300"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.04.037"", ""10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee782""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['General Health Professions', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

This study considers the role of risk climate, sometimes referred to as risk culture, as well as ethical climate, for reducing UPB. The study investigates whether four risk climate factors (avoidance, valued, proactive and manager) can, by focusing on the long-term consequences of UPB to the organisation, and providing guidance on behavioural norms, reduce UPB misconduct. Surveying employees in three financial institutions we found that only one of the risk climate factors, avoidance, is consistently associated with UPB. On the other hand, a self-interested, (un)ethical climate significantly increases UPB in all samples. In multi-climate analysis, we found that risk climate factors interacted with ethical climate to predict UPB. That is, when employees perceive that the workplace ethos is not self-interested, three factors of risk climate—avoidance, proactive and manager—significantly predict UPB. UPB is least likely when self-interest is low, avoidance risk climate is low, proactive risk climate is high and manager risk climate is high.

In these contexts, substantial leverage effects for sustainability in supply chains (SCs) can be expected by reducing adverse impacts on society and minimising related risks. For this ethical end, an adequate understanding of the respective sourcing contexts is fundamental. This case study of South Africa’s (SA) mining sector uses institutional theory and the notion of institutional uncertainty to empirically analyse the challenges associated with establishing social sustainability. The case study research is informed by 39 semi-structured interviews with top management representatives and various state and non-state decision makers in SA. Our findings suggest that (social) sustainability in the institutional field is mainly shaped by the Social and Labour Plan institution, induced by state actors and mining companies’ practices. However, four weakening factors were identified that adversely affect this regulative institution, drive institutional uncertainty and allow for mining companies’ gradual decoupling. Contrastingly, complementing pressures of non-state actors limit institutional uncertainty and push toward mainstreaming the stipulations of the institution. This study contributes to the business ethics literature by providing an in-depth exploration of institutional uncertainty’s drivers and barriers within an upstream SC setting and shedding light on multiple actors’ interplay and relevance in sector-wide sustainability. The findings are condensed into three main propositions as well as an analytical framework as a basis for follow-up research.

In order to enhance their scientific power and scope, they are increasingly becoming part of national or international networks. Public trust is essential in fostering public engagement, encouraging donation to, and facilitating public funding for biobanks. Globalisation and networking of biobanking may challenge this trust.MethodsWe report the results of an Australian study examining public attitudes to the networking and globalisation of biobanks. The study used quantitative and qualitative methods in conjunction with bioethical analysis in order to determine factors that may contribute to, and threaten, trust.ResultsOur results indicate a generally high level of trust in biobanks and in medical research more broadly. Key factors that can reduce perceived trustworthiness of biobanks are commercialisation and involvement in global networking.ConclusionsWe conclude that robust ethical oversight and governance standards can both promote trust in global biobanking and ensure that this trust is warranted.","[{""name"": ""Lisa Dive"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christine Critchley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Margaret Otlowski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul Mason"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Miriam Wiersma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Edwina Light"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cameron Stewart"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ian Kerridge"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wendy Lipworth"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0963662515623925"", ""10.1159/000375441"", ""10.1177/0963662509346910"", ""10.1093/eurpub/ckq136"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2390636"", ""10.1126/science.aau4832"", ""10.1177/1556264617723137"", ""10.1111/bioe.12536"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.2000206"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.06.028"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511606250"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9573-9_2"", ""10.1186/1746-5354-3-1-31"", ""10.1111/bioe.12184"", ""10.1007/s11019-017-9795-9"", ""10.1111/j.1539-6924.1993.tb01329.x"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2018.0159""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

A Categorisation of Unfair, Misleading and Aggressive Monetisation Techniques in Digital Games from the Player Perspective","AbstractTechnological shifts within the video game industry have enabled many games to evolve into platforms for repeated expenditure, rather than a one-time purchase product. Monetising a game as a service is challenging, and there is concern that some monetisation strategies may constitute unfair or exploitative practices which are not adequately covered by existing law. We asked 1104 players of video games to describe a time when they had been exposed to transactions which were perceived to be misleading, aggressive or unfair. We found 35 separate techniques over eight domains: game dynamics designed to drive spending, product not meeting expectations, monetisation of basic quality of life, predatory advertising, in-game currency, pay to win, general presence of microtransactions and other. Notably, several of these reported practices seem to not align with existing UK consumer protection regulations. We discuss this potential misalignment, as well as the implications of identifying what players believe to be problematic monetisation techniques.","[{""name"": ""Elena Petrovskaya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Zendle"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3275116.3275133"", ""10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106851"", ""10.1007/BF03392349"", ""10.1080/14459795.2020.1768430"", ""10.1177/1555412016665067"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.045"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-00990-w"", ""10.1111/add.14286"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.07.017"", ""10.1177/1555412010364981"", ""10.11613/BM.2012.031"", ""10.1177/1555412019887658"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12843.001.0001"", ""10.1145/3311350.3347178"", ""10.4337/ielr.2018.01.02"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-40612-1_9"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0232780"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0206767""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Health Technology Assessment Policy Under the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 1999-2018","AbstractThe UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is responsible for conducting health technology assessment (HTA) on behalf of the National Health Service (NHS). In seeking to justify its recommendations to the NHS about which technologies to fund, NICE claims to adopt two complementary ethical frameworks, one procedural—accountability for reasonableness (AfR)—and one substantive—an ‘ethics of opportunity costs’ (EOC) that rests primarily on the notion of allocative efficiency. This study is the first to empirically examine normative changes to NICE’s approach and to analyse whether these enhance or diminish the fairness of its decision-making, as judged against these frameworks. It finds that increasing formalisation of NICE’s approach and a weakening of the burden of proof laid on technologies undergoing HTA have together undermined its commitment to EOC. This implies a loss of allocative efficiency and a shift in the balance of how the interests of different NHS users are served, in favour of those who benefit directly from NICE’s recommendations. These changes also weaken NICE’s commitment to AfR by diminishing the publicity of its decision-making and by encouraging the adoption of rationales that cannot easily be shown to meet the relevance condition. This signals a need for either substantial reform of NICE’s approach, or more accurate communication of the ethical reasoning on which it is based. The study also highlights the need for further empirical work to explore the impact of these policy changes on NICE’s practice of HTA and to better understand how and why they have come about.","[{""name"": ""Victoria Charlton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1200/JCO.2008.16.5456"", ""10.1353/pbm.0.0086"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1136/bmj.331.7514.446"", ""10.1002/9780470996379"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60563-1"", ""10.1017/S1744133112000205"", ""10.1007/s11211-019-00333-9"", ""10.1108/14777261211238954"", ""10.1002/hec.1081"", ""10.3310/hta19140"", ""10.1136/bmj.j4543"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.17.5.50"", ""10.1136/bmj.j4530"", ""10.1017/S0266462307051550"", ""10.1136/bmj.b344"", ""10.1002/hec.1168"", ""10.1001/jama.1992.03490170092032"", ""10.1056/NEJMp068070"", ""10.1002/hec.2872"", ""10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70077-4"", ""10.1016/j.jval.2013.02.014"", ""10.1007/s40273-014-0204-4"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.2829"", ""10.1016/j.jval.2013.03.001"", ""10.7861/clinmedicine.8-6-579"", ""10.1136/bmj.329.7459.224"", ""10.1136/jme.2008.024430"", ""10.1177/0141076815598877"", ""10.1353/ken.2017.0005"", ""10.1378/chest.95.2_Supplement.2S"", ""10.2165/00019053-200826090-00009"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.11.022"", ""10.1056/NEJMp0806862"", ""10.1215/03616878-28-4-715"", ""10.1017/S1744133110000228"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.1987.tb00700.x"", ""10.1056/NEJMsr077003"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2007.00106.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2753.2010.01400.x""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/jmp/jhab032,JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Mental Health Without Well-being,"AbstractWhat is it to be mentally healthy? In the ongoing movement to promote mental health, to reduce stigma, and to establish parity between mental and physical health, there is a clear enthusiasm about this concept and a recognition of its value in human life. However, it is often unclear what mental health means in all these efforts and whether there is a single concept underlying them. Sometimes, the initiatives for the sake of mental health are aimed just at reducing mental illness, thus implicitly identifying mental health with the absence of diagnosable psychiatric disease. More ambitiously, there are high-profile proposals to adopt a positive definition, identifying mental health with psychic or even overall well-being. We argue against both: a definition of mental health as mere absence of mental illness is too thin, too undemanding, and too closely linked to psychiatric value judgments, while the definition in terms of well-being is too demanding and potentially oppressive. As a compromise, we sketch out a middle position. On this view, mental health is a primary good, that is, the psychological preconditions of pursuing any conception of the good life, including well-being, without being identical to well-being.","[{""name"": ""Sam Wren-Lewis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Nottingham, Nottingham, England""]}, {""name"": ""Anna Alexandrova"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780199300518.001.0001"", ""10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596"", ""10.1038/4551057a"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.115.165530"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.1976.tb00359.x"", ""10.1086/288768"", ""10.1007/978-1-59259-451-1"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190867850.001.0001"", ""10.56021/9780801885846"", ""10.1016/S0039-3681(02)00018-3"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2014.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.shpsc.2009.06.005"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199579563.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203069882"", ""10.1093/bjps/axr008"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199977383.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199214570.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11205-011-9966-7"", ""10.1037/11258-000"", ""10.1016/j.cpr.2010.03.001"", ""10.1111/bioe.12702"", ""10.1017/S0033291710001844"", ""10.2307/3090197"", ""10.1093/analys/67.2.128"", ""10.1097/00000446-193005000-00065"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5664.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511841286"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9951-2"", ""10.11647/OBP.0130"", ""10.56021/9781421416014"", ""10.4324/9781315441924"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198809494.003.0002"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.47.3.373"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0780-1_3""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'General Health Professions', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

A good definition of lying should be able to draw the right distinctions between speech acts (like promises, assertions, and oaths) that can be lies and speech acts (like commands, suggestions, or assumptions) that under no circumstances are lies. This paper shows that no extant account of lying is able to draw the required distinctions. It argues that a definition of lying based on the notion of ‘assertoric commitment’ can succeed where other accounts have failed. Assertoric commitment is analysed in terms of two normative components: ‘accountability’ and ‘discursive responsibility’. The resulting definition of lying draws all the desired distinctions, providing an intensionally adequate analysis of the concept of lying.","[{""name"": ""Neri Marsili"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2564617"", ""10.1257/jep.31.2.211"", ""10.1080/09515089.2012.725977"", ""10.1007/BF00353970"", ""10.1086/704341"", ""10.1093/analys/13.2.25"", ""10.2307/2215086"", ""10.1016/S0378-2166(98)00098-8"", ""10.1007/BF00382597"", ""10.1111/j.0029-4624.2006.00610.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199577415.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00382801"", ""10.1017/S147717561600021X"", ""10.2307/2025605"", ""10.1111/j.1467-968X.1987.tb00714.x"", ""10.1093/0199246297.001.0001"", ""10.5840/philinquiry19992112"", ""10.5840/jphil200910612"", ""10.1111/1746-8361.12007"", ""10.1080/00048402.2012.688980"", ""10.1111/rati.12055"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198743965.003.0002"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00092.x"", ""10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee482"", ""10.5210/fm.v25i11.11431"", ""10.1163/9789004253247_003"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674332508"", ""10.1007/BF00126512"", ""10.1075/pc.7.1.05gre"", ""10.1023/A:1005642421177"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199283781.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0017.2008.01357.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935314.013.8"", ""10.1017/S0022226700005922"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198843900.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1755-2567.1963.tb01229.x"", ""10.1016/0378-2166(84)90028-6"", ""10.1093/mind/fzn002"", ""10.2307/2104756"", ""10.1007/s10988-007-9015-9"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0502-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-05086-7_4"", ""10.1111/rati.12184"", ""10.1111/papq.12241"", ""10.1093/analys/ant006"", ""10.1007/BF00413598"", ""10.1007/BF00258436"", ""10.1111/j.0066-7373.2004.00116.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199285891.003.0008"", ""10.5840/ijap200822216"", ""10.1080/00048406912341141"", ""10.1163/18773109-00802005"", ""10.1093/analys/any008"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2019.1667865"", ""10.1007/s10670-020-00368-4"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3711804"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2004.12.007"", ""10.1515/9781614510840"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198743965.003.0003"", ""10.3765/salt.v14i0.2907"", ""10.5840/intstudphil198416353"", ""10.1111/phc3.12045"", ""10.1007/BF00983301"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00268.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2008.555.x"", ""10.36446/af.2016.30"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199603688.001.0001"", ""10.1016/S0378-2166(00)00060-6"", ""10.1515/ip-2014-0021"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173438"", ""10.2307/468422"", ""10.1017/S0047404500006837"", ""10.2307/2108211"", ""10.1016/j.lingua.2006.05.006"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2007.00290.x"", ""10.1093/analys/anq072"", ""10.1023/A:1020867916902"", ""10.5840/jphil2013110144"", ""10.1111/phc3.12022"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198825968.001.0001"", ""10.1093/arisup/akw011"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2012.04.001"", ""10.31219/osf.io/jfyn8"", ""10.1023/B:PHIL.0000014525.93335.9e"", ""10.1080/02691728.2018.1440022"", ""10.1215/00318108-114-2-227"", ""10.1007/s10670-012-9383-6"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2016.01.017"", ""10.2307/2998423""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

One of the most prevalent claims made by advocates of AEL is that theory choice within logic is significantly similar to that within the sciences. This connection with scientific methodology highlights a considerable challenge for the anti-exceptionalist, as two uncontentious claims about scientific theories are that they attempt toexplaina target phenomenon and (at least partially) prove their worth through successfulpredictions. Thus, if this methodological AEL is to be viable, the anti-exceptionalist will need a reasonable account of what phenomena logics are attempting to explain, how they can explain, and in what sense they can be said to issue predictions. This paper makes sense of the anti-exceptionalist proposal with a new account of logical theory choice,logical predictivism, according to which logics are engaged in both a process of prediction and explanation.","[{""name"": ""Ben Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ole Hjortland"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2964210"", ""10.2307/2185445"", ""10.1093/0199241279.003.0010"", ""10.1126/science.246.4934.1124"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511619908"", ""10.1093/mind/111.442.225"", ""10.1007/BF00258440"", ""10.2307/2269292"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198505242.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315819631"", ""10.1093/bjps/55.1.1"", ""10.1007/s11098-016-0701-8"", ""10.1086/663238"", ""10.1093/mind/110.440.937"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804649"", ""10.2307/2184508"", ""10.5840/jphil2010107310"", ""10.2307/2024634"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226217239.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02618-y 10.1007/s11229-020-02618-y"", ""10.2307/2026276"", ""10.1080/00048402.2017.1342674"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263301.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511801174"", ""10.2307/2025901"", ""10.2307/2181906"", ""10.1007/BF00649991"", ""10.1007/BF00650498"", ""10.1007/s10992-015-9360-z"", ""10.1111/phis.12127"", ""10.1111/phpr.12498"", ""10.1017/9781108381352"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199280391.001.0001"", ""10.1093/mind/LIX.235.320"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199552078.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199896042.003.0013"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1054-2"", ""10.1007/s10992-012-9228-4"", ""10.1215/00294527-3429057""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7711), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7598)]]"

The results show that gender diversity in management teams is positively associated with performance in relation to labour and human rights, and that such a performance acts as a mediating factor by fostering a higher disclosure of information regarding these issues. The findings therefore seem to indicate that the presence of women in management teams acts as a driving force for enhanced social responsibility.","[{""name"": ""Albertina Paula Monteiro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isabel-María García-Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Beatriz Aibar-Guzmán"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1287/mnsc.1110.1452"", ""10.1016/j.jacceco.2018.09.004"", ""10.3390/admsci11010033"", ""10.1108/WJEMSD-01-2018-0010"", ""10.1016/j.wsif.2015.02.007"", ""10.1111/beer.12139"", ""10.1002/csr.1793"", ""10.1002/csr.2079"", ""10.1002/sd.1732"", ""10.1007/s11205-018-1997-x"", ""10.1002/csr.1936"", ""10.1002/csr.2082"", ""10.1080/135943299398410"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.1996.tb00847.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0505-2"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.01.040"", ""10.1002/csr.1762"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2014.03.008"", ""10.1108/JAEE-07-2016-0065"", ""10.1108/srj-10-2016-0171"", ""10.1108/SAMPJ-09-2014-0051"", ""10.1108/JAEE-04-2015-0032"", ""10.14207/ejsd.2018.v7n4p451"", ""10.1111/beer.12122"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.43.6.1195"", ""10.1002/csr.1874"", ""10.1002/csr.1733"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.07.011"", ""10.3390/su11143825"", ""10.1080/09585192.2015.1024157"", ""10.1002/csr.1512"", ""10.1002/csr.1329"", ""10.1002/csr.1294"", ""10.1002/csr.1657"", ""10.1002/csr.1905"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120194"", ""10.1108/SAMPJ-06-2020-0199"", ""10.1111/corg.12233"", ""10.1002/csr.1755"", ""10.1002/csr.1811"", ""10.1002/hrm.21838"", ""10.1002/bse.1879"", ""10.5465/amr.1984.4277628"", ""10.1111/ablj.12134"", ""10.3390/su8040300"", ""10.19030/jabr.v10i1.5961"", ""10.1111/auar.12108"", ""10.1108/02610151011024484"", ""10.1108/ARA-04-2014-0051"", ""10.1002/csr.1386"", ""10.1108/ARA-09-2014-0103"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-03-2013-1261"", ""10.1111/acfi.12153"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.04.011"", ""10.1111/beer.12081"", ""10.6001/fil-soc.v31i1.4175"", ""10.1177/2158244019899093"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0626-7"", ""10.3390/su12125107"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-3327-x"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.11.001"", ""10.1108/aaaj-09-2015-2241"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2006.00580.x"", ""10.3390/su13105342"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2015.11.007"", ""10.1002/csr.1915"", ""10.3390/admsci11010030"", ""10.1016/j.accfor.2018.01.001"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0515-0"", ""10.17576/ajag-2018-10-02"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8691.2008.00487.x"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.081"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.624"", ""10.1177/1742715015590468"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.06.015"", ""10.1002/csr.1440"", ""10.3390/su9122292"", ""10.1023/A:1021626024014"", ""10.1080/1540496X.2018.1453355""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1007/s10551-021-04840-1,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Human-Animal Relations in Business and Society: Advancing the Feminist Interpretation of Stakeholder Theory,"AbstractStakeholder theory has largely been anthropocentric in its focus on human actors and interests, failing to recognise the impact of nonhumans in business and organisations. This leads to an incomplete understanding of organisational contexts that include key relationships with nonhuman animals. In addition, the limited scholarly attention paid to nonhumans as stakeholders has mostly been conceptual to date. Therefore, we develop a stakeholder theory with animals illustrated through two ethnographic case studies: an animal shelter and Nordic husky businesses. We focus our feminist reading of Driscoll and Starik’s (J Bus Ethics 49:55–73, 2004) stakeholder attributes for nonhumans and extend this to include affective salience built on embodied affectivity and knowledge, memories, action and care. Findings reveal that nonhuman animals are important actors in practice, affecting organisational operations through human–animal care relationships. In addition to confirming animals are stakeholders, we further contribute to stakeholder theory by offering ways to better listen to nontraditional actors.","[{""name"": ""Linda Tallberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""José-Carlos García-Rosell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Minni Haanpää"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.33351/mt.88270"", ""10.1177/1350508416629456"", ""10.1177/0018726712438063"", ""10.1177/1357034X09354769"", ""10.2307/3857619"", ""10.1111/gwao.12244"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04666-3"", ""10.1177/1086026617712975"", ""10.4135/9781446282243.n6"", ""10.1057/9781137558800"", ""10.1177/0018726718780210"", ""10.1086/491750"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000013852.62017.0e"", ""10.1177/0007650318773750"", ""10.1515/9783110664058-007"", ""10.1080/0966369X.2013.832665"", ""10.1177/1350508416629448"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53933-5"", ""10.1177/1056492616655076"", ""10.4324/9780429203916-20"", ""10.1177/1086026619881145"", ""10.1177/0007650318816468"", ""10.1177/1350508420961533"", ""10.1111/ijcs.12230"", ""10.1177/1350508416629967"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3707-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0936-4"", ""10.1111/gwao.12247"", ""10.5840/pom20033221"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2741-y"", ""10.2307/259247"", ""10.4324/9780429029943-9"", ""10.1177/1350507620978860"", ""10.5465/19416520.2010.495581"", ""10.1023/A:1006041929249"", ""10.1177/1350508414558727"", ""10.1177/1350508416629449"", ""10.1111/joms.12587"", ""10.1111/gwao.12277"", ""10.5465/amj.2013.0665"", ""10.1007/BF00881435"", ""10.1177/09500170211008715"", ""10.1108/JOE-11-2012-0047"", ""10.23991/ef.v47i2.97592"", ""10.1177/1350508414558725"", ""10.1016/j.annals.2020.102945"", ""10.1177/1086026611413933"", ""10.4135/9781446282243.n32"", ""10.2307/3857345"", ""10.1177/1440783315607387""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Neuroscience']","['Genetics', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Our aim was twofold: (1) to determine the perception of the ethical climate, levels of moral distress, and intention to leave one's job among nurses and physicians, and between the different ICU types and (2) determine the association between the ethical climate, moral distress, and intention to leave.MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study between May 2021 and August 2021 involving 206 nurses and physicians in a large urban academic hospital. We used the validated Ethical Decision-Making Climate Questionnaire (EDMCQ) and the Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) tools and asked respondents their intention to leave their jobs. We also made comparisons between the different ICU types. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient to identify statistically significant associations between the Ethical Climate, Moral Distress, and Intention to Leave.ResultsNurses perceived the ethical climate for decision-making as less favorable than physicians (p &lt; 0.05). They also had significantly greater levels of moral distress and higher intention to leave their job rates than physicians. Regarding the ICU types, the Neonatal/Pediatric unit had a significantly higher overall ethical climate score than the Medical and Surgical units (3.54 ± 0.66 vs. 3.43 ± 0.81 vs. 3.30 ± 0.69; respectively; bothp ≤ 0.05) and also demonstrated lower moral distress scores (bothp &lt; 0.05) and lower “intention to leave” scores compared with both the Medical and Surgical units. The ethical climate and moral distress scores were negatively correlated (r = −0.58,p &lt; 0.001); moral distress and ""intention to leave"" was positively correlated (r = 0.52,p &lt; 0.001); and ethical climate and “intention to leave” were negatively correlated (r = −0.50,p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionsSignificant differences exist in the perception of the ethical climate, levels of moral distress, and intention to leave between nurses and physicians and between the different ICU types. Inspecting the individual factors of the ethical climate and moral distress tools can help hospital leadership target organizational factors that improve interprofessional collaboration, lessening moral distress, decreasing turnover, and improved patient care.","[{""name"": ""Henry Silverman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tracey Wilson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samuel Tisherman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raya Kheirbek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Trishna Mukherjee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Tabatabai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karen McQuillan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rachel Hausladen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Melissa Davis-Gilbert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eunsung Cho"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerri Bouchard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samantha Dove"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julie Landon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michele Zimmer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/bmjqs-2017-007390"", ""10.1007/s00134-018-5231-8"", ""10.1186/s12910-021-00641-3"", ""10.1007/s11606-015-3505-1"", ""10.1086/JCE201324203"", ""10.1080/23294515.2019.1586008"", ""10.1111/jonm.12046"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2012.06020.x"", ""10.1177/0969733012466002"", ""10.1177/0969733011436025"", ""10.1007/s00134-019-05829-1"", ""10.1097/01.CCM.0000254722.50608.2D"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000004017"", ""10.1136/bmjqs-2018-007905"", ""10.1164/rccm.202006-2568OC"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000004865"", ""10.1177/0969733013486797"", ""10.4037/ajcc2018252"", ""10.1002/pbc.27244"", ""10.1016/j.pedn.2015.03.001"", ""10.31478/201707b"", ""10.1097/DCC.0000000000000083"", ""10.1177/0969733014542674"", ""10.1186/s13613-017-0293-2"", ""10.1177/09697330211003217"", ""10.1016/j.ajem.2020.10.040"", ""10.1089/jpm.2011.0307"", ""10.1001/jamasurgery.2013.403"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e31826a4650"", ""10.1177/0969733009106649"", ""10.1164/rccm.200207-752OC"", ""10.1007/s00134-005-2864-1"", ""10.1007/s00134-011-2345-7"", ""10.1097/01.CCM.0000056183.89175.76"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000003067"", ""10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.10.043"", ""10.1007/s10730-016-9313-0"", ""10.1001/jama.2011.1888"", ""10.1378/chest.14-0256"", ""10.1164/rccm.200810-1614OC"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000003870"", ""10.1016/j.iccn.2007.03.011"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000002081"", ""10.1038/jp.2008.96"", ""10.2105/AJPH.85.3.367"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.0295"", ""10.1016/j.chest.2019.02.404"", ""10.1016/j.addbeh.2012.08.007""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

But, under what conditions, if any, is it morally justifiable? Our aim in this paper is systemically to investigate the morality of public shaming, so as to provide an answer to this neglected question.

In turn, our framework highlights several reasons to be concerned about the increasingly widespread phenomenon of online public shaming.","[{""name"": ""Paul Billingham"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Relations University of Oxford  Oxford UK""]}, {""name"": ""Tom Parr"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Politics and International Studies University of Warwick  Coventry UK""]}]","[""10.1111/hypa.12456"", ""10.1111/japp.12048"", ""10.1007/s10892-006-9007-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190622046.001.0001"", ""10.3138/cjcrim.42.3.281"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199654680.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2004.00194.x"", ""10.2307/1600299"", ""10.1007/s10982-016-9272-2"", ""10.2307/1600237"", ""10.1111/papa.12040"", ""10.1037/1076-8971.3.4.645"", ""10.1177/1464884911421696"", ""10.1111/jopp.12015"", ""10.5840/socphiltoday201762343"", ""10.4159/9780674042582"", ""10.1080/17512786.2013.813194"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199554423.001.0001"", ""10.1111/papa.12074"", ""10.1111/papa.12075"", ""10.2307/797205""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1007/s11019-020-09973-0,MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Embodiment and personal identity in dementia,"AbstractTheories of personal identity in the tradition of John Locke and Derek Parfit emphasize the importance of psychological continuity and the abilities to think, to remember and to make rational choices as a basic criterion for personhood. As a consequence, persons with severe dementia are threatened to lose the status of persons. Such concepts, however, are situated within a dualistic framework, in which the body is regarded as a mere vehicle of the person, or a carrier of the brain as the organ of mental faculties. Based on the phenomenology of embodiment, this paper elaborates a different approach to personal identity in dementia. In this perspective, selfhood is primarily constituted by pre-reflective self-awareness and the body memory of an individual, which consists in the embodiment and enactment of familiar habits, practices and preferences. After describing the different types of body memory, the paper develops a phenomenology of dementia as a loss of reflexivity and meta-perspective. This is contrasted with the preservation of individual forms of body memory even in the later stages of the illness. The ethical consequences of an embodied approach to dementia are outlined. A final look is given to narrativistic and constructionist concepts of the self in dementia.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Fuchs"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09658210244000423"", ""10.1007/s11065-009-9085-2"", ""10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.005"", ""10.1007/s00391-006-0408-0"", ""10.1136/jnnp-2014-309445"", ""10.1515/9781503621749"", ""10.1002/9781444316414.ch3"", ""10.1016/j.cpr.2009.10.003"", ""10.3233/JAD-131295"", ""10.1037/0735-7044.116.4.722"", ""10.1177/1471301208099044"", ""10.1017/S1041610206003322"", ""10.1093/brain/awh559"", ""10.1075/aicr.84.03fuc"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190210465.003.0001"", ""10.1007/s11097-015-9449-4"", ""10.4324/9781315411538-5"", ""10.1093/brain/awh400"", ""10.1093/brain/awf079"", ""10.1159/000229024"", ""10.1177/1533317507303761"", ""10.1016/S0890-4065(02)00041-5"", ""10.1007/978-94-015-3945-6_2"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD011022.pub2/full"", ""10.1007/s11673-008-9102-9"", ""10.1007/s11097-012-9285-8"", ""10.1016/S0890-4065(03)00006-9"", ""10.1017/S0144686X04002375"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9566.2009.01158.x"", ""10.1525/9780520353060-002"", ""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.08.009"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(96)10203-8"", ""10.1017/S1355617710001682"", ""10.1002/gps.705"", ""10.1177/147130120200100101"", ""10.1177/153331750602100113"", ""10.1017/S0144686X00005262"", ""10.1177/0164027598201005"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.47.4.559"", ""10.1016/j.nlm.2004.06.005"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199823)19:3<300::AID-IMHJ5>3.0.CO;2-P"", ""10.1007/s10743-011-9088-8"", ""10.1007/s11097-013-9313-3"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2005.01218.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.025"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-85694-5""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

We elaborate on the vision statement provided in the 2010 Institute of Medicine (National Academy of Medicine) “Summary of Guidance for Establishing Crisis Standards of Care for Use in Disaster Situations,” which emphasizes fairness; equitable processes; community and provider engagement, education, and communication; and the rule of law. We argue that interpreting these elements through disability justice entails a commitment to both distributive and recognitive justice. The disability rights movement's demand “Nothing about us, without us” requires substantive inclusion of disabled people in decision‐making related to their interests, including in crisis planning before, during, and after a pandemic like Covid‐19.","[{""name"": ""Laura Guidry‐Grimes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katie Savin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joseph A.

10.1111/jssr.12712,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology,Changes in Religious Doubt and Physical and Mental Health in Emerging Adulthood,"AbstractResearchers are increasingly identifying a number of elements of the “dark side” of religion that undermine its overall positive relationship with well‐being. This study assesses the impact of changes in religious doubt for physical health and depression in emerging adulthood, a life course stage when individuals begin to form their own religious identity. Using Waves 3 and 4 of the National Study of Youth and Religion, a latent class growth analysis was used to derive four trajectories of religious doubt (stable no doubt, stable doubt, increasing doubt, decreasing doubt). Regression results suggest that those in the increasing doubt class reported higher depression and worse self‐rated health than with stable no doubt. Causal mediation analyses revealed that a decreased sense of meaning in life was found to mediate this relationship. This study sets forth implications for future research centered on religion and health over the life course.","[{""name"": ""Laura Upenieks"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology Baylor University""]}]","[""10.1007/s11136-015-1163-8"", ""10.1002/9780470682203.ch22"", ""10.1080/13694670500040484"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.55.5.469"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929382.001.0001"", ""10.1037/rel0000059"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199959181.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00290.x"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2015.08.049"", ""10.1353/jhe.2008.0000"", ""10.1007/BF01246098"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195069853.003.0011"", ""10.1007/s10964-014-0157-0"", ""10.3390/rel8120274"", ""10.1016/0191-8869(93)90132-M"", ""10.1521/bumc.2013.77.3.201"", ""10.1525/sop.2010.53.2.247"", ""10.1525/9780520940031"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195392982.001.0001"", ""10.1093/sf/sow063"", ""10.1007/s11089-009-0239-1"", ""10.1007/s13644-011-0019-0"", ""10.1007/s11205-009-9553-3"", ""10.1177/002214650504600403"", ""10.1037/a0036465"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2016.01.007"", ""10.1037/rel0000088"", ""10.1207/S15327582IJPR1103_03"", ""10.1037/a0037887"", ""10.1007/s11089-005-4818-y"", ""10.1007/s10964-005-9018-1"", ""10.1037/rel0000283"", ""10.1037/rel0000051"", ""10.1037/rel0000231"", ""10.1177/0044118X13483777"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.06.010"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01587.x"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2010.01.008"", ""10.1080/10826084.2018.1480037"", ""10.1111/1468-5906.00115"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.50.4.409"", ""10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00194.x"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00054.x"", ""10.1016/j.adolescence.2010.03.003"", ""10.1037/rel0000049"", ""10.1007/s10964-019-01095-y"", ""10.1177/009164719902700103"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01448.x"", ""10.1093/geront/39.5.525"", ""10.2307/3712506"", ""10.1007/s10943-014-9983-3"", ""10.1037/rel0000116"", ""10.1093/biomet/88.3.767"", ""10.1177/2156869317748713"", ""10.1093/sf/90.1.181"", ""10.1207/s15327582ijpr0501_1"", ""10.1007/s10943-018-0711-2"", ""10.1037/rel0000104"", ""10.1037/a0025558"", ""10.1177/0898010118783502"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00428.x"", ""10.1007/s10865-011-9315-y"", ""10.1080/15528030.2014.971142"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199753895.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01465.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-31395-5_13"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2011.03.015"", ""10.1037/rel0000268"", ""10.1177/009164710803600403"", ""10.1093/socrel/srq049"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.02.004"", ""10.1002/jclp.20574"", ""10.1177/1536867X0500500204"", ""10.1177/0022146510378236"", ""10.1177/0049124114526376"", ""10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4"", ""10.3390/rel9080242"", ""10.2307/2580555"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2018.09.004"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195371796.001.0001"", ""10.1525/9780520929050"", ""10.1086/475470"", ""10.2307/2675572"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195187243.013.0064"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.52.4.574"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.2007.00484.x"", ""10.1089/jpm.2006.9.646"", ""10.1111/jssr.12319"", ""10.1177/2158244016638133"", ""10.1353/sof.2007.0083"", ""10.1037/a0031034"", ""10.1007/s00127-017-1434-5"", ""10.1093/socrel/srr044"", ""10.1086/684202"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9531.2007.00180.x"", ""10.1017/psrm.2017.4"", ""10.1080/10508619.2017.1362186"", ""10.1111/jssr.12653"", ""10.1007/s10964-018-0886-6"", ""10.1007/s10943-018-0598-y"", ""10.1007/s10865-006-9074-3""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Over the past decade, an artistic movement has emerged that draws on machine learning as both inspiration and medium. In this book, transdisciplinary artist-researcher Sofian Audry examines artistic practices at the intersection of machine learning and new media art, providing conceptual tools and historical perspectives for new media artists, musicians, composers, writers, curators, and theorists. Audry looks at works from a broad range of practices, including new media installation, robotic art, visual art, electronic music and sound, and electronic literature, connecting machine learning art to such earlier artistic practices as cybernetics art, artificial life art, and evolutionary art. Machine learning underlies computational systems that are biologically inspired, statistically driven, agent-based networked entities that program themselves. Audry explains the fundamental design of machine learning algorithmic structures in terms accessible to the nonspecialist while framing these technologies within larger historical and conceptual spaces. Audry debunks myths about machine learning art, including the ideas that machine learning can create art without artists and that machine learning will soon bring about superhuman intelligence and creativity. Audry considers learning procedures, describing how artists hijack the training process by playing with evaluative functions; discusses trainable machines and models, explaining how different types of machine learning systems enable different kinds of artistic practices; and reviews the role of data in machine learning art, showing how artists use data as a raw material to steer learning systems and arguing that machine learning allows for novel forms of algorithmic remixes.","[{""name"": ""Sofian Audry"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The Effect of Process and Outcomes on Perceptions of Legitimacy of AI Decisions,"AbstractFirms use algorithms to make important business decisions. To date, the algorithmic accountability literature has elided a fundamentally empirical question important to business ethics and management: Under what circumstances, if any, are algorithmic decision-making systems considered legitimate? The present study begins to answer this question. Using factorial vignette survey methodology, we explore the impact of decision importance, governance, outcomes, and data inputs on perceptions of the legitimacy of algorithmic decisions made by firms. We find that many of the procedural governance mechanisms in practice today, such as notices and impact statements, do not lead to algorithmic decisions being perceived as more legitimate in general, and, consistent with legitimacy theory, that algorithmic decisions with good outcomes are perceived as more legitimate than bad outcomes. Yet, robust governance, such as offering an appeal process, can create a legitimacy dividend for decisions with bad outcomes. However, when arbitrary or morally dubious factors are used to make decisions, most legitimacy dividends are erased. In other words, companies cannot overcome the legitimacy penalty of using arbitrary or morally dubious factors, such as race or the day of the week, with a good outcome or an appeal process for individuals. These findings add new perspectives to both the literature on legitimacy and policy discussions on algorithmic decision-making in firms.","[{""name"": ""Kirsten Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ari Waldman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10551-015-2819-6"", ""10.1007/s00146-019-00931-w"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04203-x"", ""10.1287/orsc.1.2.177"", ""10.1086/705385"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00616.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1065-9"", ""10.1207/S1532754XJPRR1204_3"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9795-z"", ""10.1177/2053951715622512"", ""10.1126/science.aal4230"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0770-8"", ""10.1111/ajps.12150"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2498-8"", ""10.1207/s1532754xjprr0402_03"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.10"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.05.001"", ""10.1177/2053951717726554"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2006.08.004"", ""10.2307/1388226"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aao5580"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1490-4"", ""10.1002/smj.536"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2757236"", ""10.2307/2393494"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-2031-5"", ""10.1007/s00146-020-00960-w"", ""10.2307/3857340"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9517-y"", ""10.1515/9781400830602"", ""10.1177/106591290505800201"", ""10.1111/lasr.12104"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04404-4"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5893.2008.00353.x"", ""10.5465/amd.2017.0002"", ""10.1177/0007650317717959"", ""10.1177/0049124105283121"", ""10.2139/ssrn.968350"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02696-y"", ""10.1177/0306312717699716"", ""10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00773.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3304-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04204-w"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139032490"", ""10.1007/s10676-020-09564-w"", ""10.1007/s00146-022-01412-3"", ""10.1086/208919"", ""10.17705/2msqe.00012"", ""10.1201/9781003278290"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04407-1"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2020.101536"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.03.008"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1pwt9w5"", ""10.1177/0007650316645337"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9044-2"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674736061"", ""10.1145/3241367"", ""10.2307/3857232"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2839-2"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9430-8"", ""10.2307/2393619"", ""10.1073/pnas.1915006117"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0966-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04371-w"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucx053"", ""10.1017/beq.2019.19"", ""10.2307/258788"", ""10.5465/annals.2015.0101"", ""10.1111/1540-5893.3703002"", ""10.1287/mksc.2014.0874"", ""10.1515/9781400828609"", ""10.2307/3053998"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.03.004"", ""10.2307/3857345"", ""10.1007/s10676-021-09599-7"", ""10.1177/2053951714559253""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s10551-020-04439-y,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,When the Law Distinguishes Between the Enterprise and the Corporation: The Case of the New French Law on Corporate Purpose,"AbstractA recent French reform has revised the legal definition of the corporation. In essence, the law stipulates that the corporation must be run with due regard to the social and environmental impacts of its activity. It also introduces the notion ofraison d’êtreand affords the possibility for any corporation to assign social or environmental purposes to itself, defined in its by-laws. This reform is similar to recent reforms in the UK and the US, but is based on an original and distinctive theoretical argument. The aim of our article is to analyze the fundamental tenets of this reform and their implications for the theory of the corporation. It shows that the new law is based on a new positive definition of the enterprise as not only an economic organization or a productive entity, but more fundamentally a space for innovative collective action. We argue that this view of the enterprise challenges our conceptualization of the corporation in two important ways. First, it shows that the traditional theories overlook the activities of the enterprise and their related impacts, and that the corporation is not necessarily the appropriate legal vehicle for the innovative enterprise. Second, it suggests that the stipulation of the enterprise’s purpose orraison d’êtrein the corporate by-laws can provide new promising legal foundations for corporate responsibility.","[{""name"": ""Blanche Segrestin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Armand Hatchuel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kevin Levillain"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5465/19416520.2015.1024503"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1254-1"", ""10.2307/1228806"", ""10.4159/9780674029385"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3894-2"", ""10.1093/ser/mwn019"", ""10.1093/cje/bex044"", ""10.1016/j.jce.2016.04.005"", ""10.1177/0170840613479223"", ""10.2307/1331697"", ""10.5465/amp.2014.0014"", ""10.1017/S174413741000007X"", ""10.1111/emre.12178"", ""10.1093/es/khm067"", ""10.1017/S0007680517000733"", ""10.1016/S0014-2921(00)00046-5"", ""10.1111/basr.12044"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1580-3"", ""10.1093/cje/ben040"", ""10.2139/ssrn.94043"", ""10.2307/3556659"", ""10.1111/joms.12150"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1201-1"", ""10.2307/1372611"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3887-1"", ""10.1525/cmr.2015.57.3.13"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0714-8"", ""10.1177/0007650312446931"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.26585837"", ""10.5465/amp.2017.0175"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.2011.00763.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2427-x"", ""10.5465/amp.2013.0109"", ""10.2307/840187""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

Evidence from Japan and Finland,"AbstractThis study investigated entrepreneurs’ motivations to implement circular economy (CE) practices and the ways in which their approaches to CE practices differed by their sociocultural context. The research aimed to contrast the contemporary instrumental perspective on CE through an ecologically dominant logic. The empirical analysis focused on Finland and Japan, two countries with distinct sociocultural contexts but similar regulatory environments regarding the CE. The study analysed entrepreneurs’ motivations towards the CE through self-determination theory that makes a distinction between different levels of internalization in motivations. The Finnish entrepreneurs were characterised by more frequent intertwined intrinsic/transcendent motivations and a vocal approach to CE. The Japanese entrepreneurs’ motivations were more varied; some were intrinsically interested in the CE, while some were even unaware of the CE concept despite operating CE businesses. The Japanese entrepreneurs resorted to masking their CE businesses to better relate with the surrounding linear system. The study shows how the individualistic Finnish culture fostered progress on the CE, while the collectivistic Japanese culture emphasised the need for relatedness and caused stagnation in the CE in its society.","[{""name"": ""Savu Rovanto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Max Finne"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/MD-11-2018-1178"", ""10.1016/1053-4822(93)90012-S"", ""10.2307/1556363"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497"", ""10.1080/21681015.2016.1172124"", ""10.4324/9780203109496-11"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04160-5"", ""10.2307/4131471"", ""10.1111/jiec.13187"", ""10.2307/3069284"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00797.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1834-8"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-02-2020-0083"", ""10.1002/job.322"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1245-2"", ""10.1177/1056492617706029"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.048"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.007"", ""10.1108/S1479-838720190000011004"", ""10.1177/1094428112452151"", ""10.1080/00207543.2017.1402141"", ""10.1037/0008-400X.29.3.157"", ""10.1038/495305a"", ""10.5465/amr.2018.0482"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.81.2.143"", ""10.1111/1468-5884.00043"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118528"", ""10.1177/0894486516673700"", ""10.1007/s11150-020-09511-0"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511571343"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.349"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120728"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.005"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-02-2016-0078"", ""10.1111/jscm.12157"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.08.018"", ""10.1177/014920630002600503"", ""10.1177/002224299105500403"", ""10.5465/amr.2011.0188"", ""10.1007/s40926-018-0098-x"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.063"", ""10.1111/jscm.12103"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-12-2018-0684"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1637-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2693-2"", ""10.5465/amj.2012.1049"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3044-7"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.072"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9341-9"", ""10.1002/bse.2677"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9736-x"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.65.3.586"", ""10.1111/1468-5922.12282"", ""10.1177/001391659803000503"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-02-2016-0058"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60281-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3926-y"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.70.4.767""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

At the same time, the increasing amount of research from a range of areas including psychology, economics, and sociology testify that in the real world, people’s understanding of risky and uncertain situations cannot be satisfactorily explained in probabilistic and decision-theoretical terms. In this article, we offer a theoretical overview of an alternative approach to uncertainty developed in the framework of the ecological rationality research program. We first trace the origins of the ecological approach to uncertainty in Simon’s bounded rationality and Brunswik’s lens model framework and then proceed by outlining a theoretical view of uncertainty that ensues from the ecological rationality approach. We argue that the ecological concept of uncertainty relies on a systemic view of uncertainty that features it as a property of the organism–environment system. We also show how simple heuristics can deal with unmeasurable uncertainty and in what cases ignoring probabilities emerges as a proper response to uncertainty.","[{""name"": ""Anastasia Kozyreva"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ralph Hertwig"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/dec0000043"", ""10.1177/0263276402019004003"", ""10.1515/9781400833092"", ""10.1023/A:1005228312224"", ""10.1007/s10670-013-9518-4"", ""10.1037/h0047470"", ""10.1525/9780520350519"", ""10.1515/9781400844227"", ""10.1037/h0030868"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.34.7.571"", ""10.1037/h0037613"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhm075"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.130.6.959"", ""10.1016/S0005-7967(97)00070-3"", ""10.1016/0030-5073(75)90044-6"", ""10.2307/1884324"", ""10.1177/1745691612460685"", ""10.1162/neco.1992.4.1.1"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195328981.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1756-8765.2008.01006.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120709-145346"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.103.4.650"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195130133.003.0025"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1654.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-011-0030-6"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511720482"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.109.1.75"", ""10.1038/nrn3524"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511817557"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511819766"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511801297"", ""10.1037/h0046845"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195130133.003.0047"", ""10.1037/h0040736"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511752896.006"", ""10.1007/s11229-011-0024-4"", ""10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00715.x"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.728"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2009.09.004"", ""10.1037/a0013025"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.03221-9"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2009.12.009"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11114.001.0001"", ""10.1002/047001332X.ch11"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11114.001.0001"", ""10.1287/deca.1060.0063"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.114.3.733"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199682737.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0195145399.003.0004"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.104.2.344"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.114.3.678"", ""10.1257/000282803322655392"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(72)90016-3"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(82)90023-3"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.134.3.404"", ""10.1016/j.jmp.2006.06.001"", ""10.1037/a0020418"", ""10.2307/1882087"", ""10.31234/osf.io/8vqhm"", ""10.1037/a0024143"", ""10.1023/A:1015516217425"", ""10.1037/11281-000"", ""10.1093/0195145399.003.0001"", ""10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01169-3"", ""10.1515/9781400820832"", ""10.1037/0278-7393.32.5.983"", ""10.1037/0278-7393.14.3.534"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173933"", ""10.1037/h0024722"", ""10.1515/9781400828678"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-5455-3_2"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.112.3.610"", ""10.1111/tops.12410"", ""10.1007/s11023-015-9369-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijar.2012.06.018"", ""10.2307/1884852"", ""10.1037/h0042769"", ""10.1146/annurev.ps.41.020190.000245"", ""10.1038/sj.embor.7401072"", ""10.1126/science.1192788"", ""10.1002/bs.3830250306"", ""10.1017/S0140525X01650088"", ""10.1002/9781118468333.ch3"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1037/xge0000202"", ""10.1515/semi.1992.89.4.319"", ""10.1076/iaij.4.1.5.16466"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-3472-7"", ""10.1037/bul0000115""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Decision Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'General Decision Sciences']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7409), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7377)]]"

10.3390/rel11100490,RELIGIONS,0101 Philosophy,Right-Wing Populism and Religion in Europe and the USA,"The aim of this paper is to examine comparatively the growth and political effectiveness of right-wing populism in Western Europe, Central Europe, and the USA since 9/11. The focus is on such politicians’ vilification of Islam as a faith and Muslims as a people. The paper examines the following research question: how and why do right-wing populists in the USA and Europe use an ideological form of “Christianity”, known variously as “Christianism” or “Christian civilizationism”, to vilify Muslims and Islam? The political purpose seems obvious: to influence public perceptions and to win votes by questioning the desirability of Muslims in both the USA and Europe, claiming that Muslims’ religious and cultural attributes make them unacceptable as neighbors. As Muslims are not capable, so the argument goes, of assimilating to European or American norms, values, and behavior, then they must be excluded or strongly controlled for the benefit of nativist communities. Right-wing populists in both the USA and Europe pursue this strategy because they see it as chiming well with public opinion at a time of great uncertainty, instability, and insecurity.","[{""name"": ""Jeffrey Haynes"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Social Sciences, London Metropolitan University, London N7 8DB, UK""]}]","[""10.4159/9780674984943"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41773-4"", ""10.1525/9780520970007"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1007/s11186-017-9301-7"", ""10.4324/9781315623016"", ""10.1177/1948550617750735"", ""10.1080/09637494.2018.1502911"", ""10.1515/9781438476957"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262035309.001.0001"", ""10.1080/15570274.2017.1354463"", ""10.1080/15570274.2019.1570756"", ""10.1080/15570274.2019.1570755"", ""10.1080/15570274.2019.1570755"", ""10.3390/rel11080385"", ""10.4324/9781351012478"", ""10.1111/1468-5965.00263"", ""10.1177/0037768618767962"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2018.1512467"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190226831.003.0017"", ""10.1080/15570274.2019.1570759"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1493051"", ""10.1080/15570274.2017.1354466"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1080/15570274.2019.1570761"", ""10.3390/rel4040443"", ""10.1075/jlac.5.2.08sub"", ""10.1353/jod.2013.0045"", ""10.1093/socrel/srx070"", ""10.1177/233150241700500111""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Therefore, turning to practice theories for the study of RM appears to hold great promise of conceptual and methodological contribution. We propose a posthumanist practice approach for studying RM-as-practice. Managerial practices are conceived as the agencement of heterogeneous elements (humans, nonhumans, more-than-humans, materials, and discourses) that achieve agency in their being interconnected. Thus, RM is understood as processual, relational, emergent, and sociomaterial. We contribute a framework for the empirical study of RM-as-practice on the basis of three sensitizing concepts: situatedness, sociomateriality, and textures. We further discuss the implications of understanding responsibility as response-ability, an engaged practice for relating to the other and the RM researcher’s role as internal to the practice agencement under study, thus, opening the debate on our own response-ability.","[{""name"": ""Silvia Gherardi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oliver Laasch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10551-006-9068-7"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.25275678"", ""10.1177/1476127013520265"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.1017/S0376892900011449"", ""10.1515/9781503621749"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3582-7"", ""10.4337/9781788971966.00050"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-G"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.2006.00493.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.2007.00711.x"", ""10.1177/1077800417725357"", ""10.1002/csr.132"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2504-1"", ""10.1002/bse.323"", ""10.1108/09534811111119744"", ""10.1177/1350508420970475"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9677-4"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.06.018"", ""10.1111/1467-954X.12200"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2017.02.003"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.0628"", ""10.1177/135050840072001"", ""10.1177/1350508415605174"", ""10.4337/9781788973564"", ""10.1111/gwao.12328"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3510-x"", ""10.2307/3178066"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11cw25q"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1993-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-3325-z"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.067"", ""10.5840/beq20132312"", ""10.5465/annals.2018.0174"", ""10.4337/9781788971966.00053"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12090"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04440-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04214-8"", ""10.4337/9781788971966.00006"", ""10.1080/09518398.2013.788752"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0041-0"", ""10.1017/beq.2017.28"", ""10.1177/1350508410388336"", ""10.1177/0170840609349860"", ""10.2307/259247"", ""10.1287/orsc.11.4.404.14600"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3798-1"", ""10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00026-5"", ""10.1177/1350507620978860"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511488641"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1175-4"", ""10.1016/0016-3287(88)90002-X"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1176-3"", ""10.1177/1350508414558726"", ""10.1086/230316"", ""10.1177/0306312710380301"", ""10.1177/1350508413484819"", ""10.1177/1742715019882831"", ""10.1177/1056492614567315"", ""10.1177/13684310222225432"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12142"", ""10.1177/0170840605050876"", ""10.4324/9780429032127"", ""10.9774/GLEAF.4700.2010.au.00004"", ""10.1177/0007650306297942"", ""10.1177/0149206314522300"", ""10.4135/9781446250655"", ""10.1177/1077800417732634"", ""10.1080/09518398.2017.1336806"", ""10.5465/19416520.2012.672039"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-2154-9"", ""10.1111/0045-3609.00120"", ""10.1111/j.0045-3609.2004.00002.x"", ""10.2307/41166285"", ""10.1177/0007650316680041"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199237715.003.0013""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

The effect of its hypothesized amalgamation is generally ignored in mantle convection models claiming the transition from Rodinia to Pangaea represents a single supercontinent cycle. We apply three geodynamic scenarios to Pannotia amalgamation that are tested using regional geology. Scenarios involving quasi-stationary mantle convection patterns are not supported by the geological record. A scenario involving feedback between the supercontinent cycle and global mantle convection patterns predicts upwellings beneath the Gondwanan portion of Pannotia and the arrival of plumes along the entire Gondwanan (but not Laurentian) margin beginning at c. 0.6 Ga. Such a scenario is compatible with regional geology, but the candidates for plume magmatism we propose require testing by detailed geochemical and isotopic studies. If verified, this scenario could provide geodynamic explanations for the origins of the late Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic Iapetus and Rheic oceans and the terranes that were repeatedly detached from their margins.","[{""name"": ""J.

I argue that since you should take peer disagreement seriously, evidence must have two features. (1) It must sometimes warrant beingmodest: uncertain what your evidence warrants, and (thus) uncertain whether you’re rational. (2) But it must always warrant beingguided: disposed to treat your evidence as a guide. It is surprisingly difficult to vindicate these dual constraints. But diagnosing why this is so leads to a proposal—Trust—that is weak enough to allow modesty but strong enough to yield many guiding features. In fact, I argue that Trust is theGoldilocks principle—for it is necessary and sufficient to vindicate the claim that you should always prefer to use free evidence. Upshot: Trust lays the foundations for a theory of disagreement and, more generally, an epistemology that permits self‐doubt—a modest epistemology.","[{""name"": ""Kevin Dorst"", ""affiliation"": [""Massachusetts Institute of Technology""]}]","[""10.1017/S1755020314000318"", ""10.1093/0199258872.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8284.00228"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2009.00713.x"", ""10.1215/00318108-2006-035"", ""10.2307/2185301"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00366.x"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2010.00187.x"", ""10.1017/epi.2016.20"", ""10.1007/s10992-012-9225-7"", ""10.1093/mind/fzx028"", ""10.1086/668879"", ""10.1093/mind/104.414.235"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00656.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0091-0"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2005.00055.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195173079.003.0016"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9198-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-2863-3_11"", ""10.1093/mind/fzl019"", ""10.1093/bjps/17.4.319"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-0085-3"", ""10.5840/jphil2014111411"", ""10.1093/mind/103.412.505"", ""10.1017/epi.2012.11"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0231-6"", ""10.1111/nous.12026"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00388.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0267-7"", ""10.1086/392661"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9198-8_11"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2010.00194.x"", ""10.1111/phpe.12022"", ""10.1007/s10988-015-9182-z"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2010.00183.x"", ""10.1111/nous.12050"", ""10.1111/phpr.12090"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198722762.003.0005"", ""10.1016/j.apal.2013.06.015"", ""10.1111/phpr.12225"", ""10.2307/2184045"", ""10.1525/9780520318328-009"", ""10.1093/analys/any051"", ""10.1007/s11229-010-9860-x"", ""10.1093/bjps/48.4.533"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717959.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12079"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732716.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00825.x"", ""10.3366/E1742360009000690"", ""10.1215/00318108-3516936"", ""10.1111/nous.12006"", ""10.1111/phpr.12125"", ""10.5840/jphil20151121242"", ""10.1007/s11098-007-9119-7"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0446-9"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00506.x"", ""10.1007/s11229-015-0735-z"", ""10.1086/288280"", ""10.1007/s11098-005-4062-y"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107478152.002"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00676.x"", ""10.1007/s10670-018-0042-4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198722762.003.0009"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-1853-1_10"", ""10.2307/2026388"", ""10.1007/s10670-013-9451-6"", ""10.1007/s11229-011-0012-8"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2005.00069.x"", ""10.3366/E1742360009000689"", ""10.1007/s10670-013-9590-9"", ""10.1111/phpr.12246""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Though the view that there are such norms seems intuitive, it has found surprisingly little defense. Rather, many philosophers have argued that norms on evidence-gathering can only be practical or moral. On a prominent evidentialist version of this position, epistemic norms only apply to responding to the evidence one already has. Here we challenge the orthodoxy. First, we argue that there is no significant normative difference between responding to evidence you have and gathering more evidence. Second, we argue that our practices of epistemically criticizing agents for their poor evidence-gathering indicate the existence of epistemic norms on evidence-gathering. Finally, we show that our thesis has important implications for recent debates about the relationship between epistemic norms and inquiry.","[{""name"": ""Carolina Flores"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elise Woodard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5840/philtopics2001291/21"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00255.x"", ""10.1017/epi.2018.22"", ""10.1163/18756735-073001008"", ""10.1111/phpr.12726"", ""10.1111/phc3.12762"", ""10.1111/nous.12270"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199596195.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2016.1208903"", ""10.1093/0199253722.001.0001"", ""10.1215/00318108-2366495"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199550623.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-2909-8_6"", ""10.2307/2653823"", ""10.1007/BF00372404"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95993-1_6"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674334236"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1111/nous.12137"", ""10.1215/00318108-8540918"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198249856.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-015-0662-z"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793670.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjps/17.4.319"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00028636"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199231188.003.0012"", ""10.5840/jphil20081051022"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732594.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199273317.003.0006"", ""10.1111/phpr.12849"", ""10.1086/293312"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2003.tb00281.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192896094.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phpr.12719"", ""10.1017/9781009036818"", ""10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60315-1"", ""10.1111/phpr.12563"", ""10.4324/9780429030215-22"", ""10.1093/bjps/41.1.103"", ""10.1111/mila.12205"", ""10.4324/9781315882390"", ""10.1017/epi.2019.34"", ""10.1007/s11229-010-9860-x"", ""10.1017/epi.2018.32"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175"", ""10.1093/mind/fzv153"", ""10.1093/bjps/52.1.95"", ""10.1215/00318108-2007-037"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8243.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198856467.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-013-0249-5"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2021.2004220"", ""10.1007/s11098-020-01592-y"", ""10.1007/s11229-022-03896-4"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2002.tb00206.x"", ""10.4324/9780203702444-14""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1007/s10551-019-04191-y,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Does an Asset Owner's Institutional Setting Influence Its Decision to Sign the Principles for Responsible Investment?,"AbstractFrom a simple idea to unite asset owners in their quest for responsible investment (RI) at its launch in April 2006, the United Nations supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) have grown in just one decade into an initiative with more than 1500 fee-paying signatories. Jointly, the PRI’s signatories hold assets worth more than $80 trillion, making it one of the more prevalent not-for-profit organizations worldwide. Furthermore, the PRI’s ambitious mission to transform the financial system at large into a more sustainable one makes it a worthwhile subject of inquiry from an institutional perspective. We undertake an empirical investigation of the adoption of the PRI by asset owners during five crucial years of the association’s emergence: 2007–2011. Following a tripartite view of institutional theory proposed by Scott (Institutions and organizations. Foundations for organizational science, A Sage Publication Series, London, 1995), we explore if regulative, normative, and cultural–cognitive factors influence an asset owner’s decision to subscribe to the PRI. Applying both parametric and non-parametric survival analysis, we find that asset owners are indeed significantly affected by normative, cultural–cognitive, and regulative aspects. In particular, (i) public service employee and labor union pension funds (ii) from social backgrounds more culturally aligned with values represented by the RI movement (iii) with historically more voluntary legislation on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are most likely to sign the PRI. In contrast, institutional environments with a higher number of pre-existing mandatory ESG regulation decrease the likelihood of signing the PRI. Our results indicate that normative and cultural–cognitive factors were crucial contributors to the PRI’s growth. With respect to the regulative environments, our results imply that some asset owners may use the PRI as a collective industry initiative to substitute for mandatory legislation. Conversely, a high level of historical mandatory legislation may constrain organizational resources that could otherwise be dedicated to voluntary initiatives such as PRI.

10.3390/rel12010061,RELIGIONS,0101 Philosophy,"Death Anxiety, Religiosity and Culture: Implications for Therapeutic Process and Future Research","Death anxiety is a common phenomenon that humans experience. It is multidimensional. There has been an upsurged interest around the discussion on death anxiety across the globe, however, much of the literature focuses on the concept of death anxiety, religiosity, and its role in mental health conditions. Further, studies on death anxiety are scattered and at times disconnected. It is important to review existing literature to get an overview of the current direction in research and understand its relevance to facilitate therapeutic processes. In this scoping review, literature was searched in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and PsychINFO using key words such as “death anxiety”, “fear of death”, religion”, “culture”, and “psychopathology” combined with Boolean operators to narrow down the search results. The initial search yielded 614 records, of which 546 records were removed based on title review (363), abstract review (94), and full-text review (89). Finally, 68 articles were appraised, narratively synthesized, and thematically presented. Major themes revealed in the literature were theoretical frameworks of death anxiety, religiosity, universality, psychological effects of death anxiety, psychopathology, and religious coping strategies. There is a need to assess client’s death anxiety and address them using religious rituals and coping mechanisms.","[{""name"": ""Apurva-kumar Pandya"", ""affiliation"": [""Regional Resource Center for Health Technology Assessment, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar 382042, Gujarat, India""]}, {""name"": ""Tripti Kathuria"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Researcher, Meerut 250002, Uttar Pradesh, India""]}]","[""10.2466/PR0.104.3.770-772"", ""10.1177/0033294118771705"", ""10.1002/1097-4679(199503)51:2<202::AID-JCLP2270510209>3.0.CO;2-M"", ""10.1037/h0021212"", ""10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596"", ""10.1177/0164027505284165"", ""10.1080/1364557032000119616"", ""10.1080/13674676.2018.1512564"", ""10.1007/s10943-019-00917-4"", ""10.1016/j.archger.2018.05.003"", ""10.1177/2156587217715927"", ""10.1258/135581902320432732"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2004.02.005"", ""10.1037/a0020179"", ""10.1002/nop2.484"", ""10.1155/2016/2906857"", ""10.1037/14046-000"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.48.2.400"", ""10.1080/13674676.2011.652606"", ""10.2190/OM.55.3.a"", ""10.1080/02699931.2015.1065794"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.725"", ""10.1007/s10804-007-9027-2"", ""10.2190/Y9Y8-RG8N-8EUH-VJV4"", ""10.1080/13674670412331304311"", ""10.4324/9780203809679"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.94.3.319"", ""10.1037/14046-000"", ""10.1080/00223980.1978.9921462"", ""10.2190/IL.18.1.c"", ""10.1080/07481180802494099"", ""10.1016/j.cpr.2014.09.002"", ""10.1080/03069885.2016.1153038"", ""10.1080/2153599X.2016.1238844"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2010.02.006"", ""10.2307/1384409"", ""10.5402/2012/278730"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00269"", ""10.1037/0736-9735.21.1.31"", ""10.1017/bec.2016.11"", ""10.1891/1541-6577.23.1.23"", ""10.2190/W644-8645-6685-358V"", ""10.1080/07481187.2012.753557"", ""10.1080/07481180701490743"", ""10.1177/008124638401400102"", ""10.1177/0030222817726266"", ""10.1177/1359105315600233"", ""10.1177/1542305019848656"", ""10.1037/abn0000263"", ""10.1017/S1754470X20000215"", ""10.1016/j.janxdis.2018.09.004"", ""10.1111/bjc.12229"", ""10.1080/07481180590932544"", ""10.1007/s10943-018-0679-y"", ""10.4135/9781412914291.n1"", ""10.2190/62JN-TB4X-1H5F-HBC0"", ""10.1002/jclp.20405"", ""10.1037/scp0000043"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.12.010"", ""10.1007/s10943-019-00783-0"", ""10.1016/j.jana.2009.07.007"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199729920.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0146167207303018"", ""10.19082/3980"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.38.11.1161"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.2.193"", ""10.1521/jscp.1989.8.2.114"", ""10.2466/pr0.1972.31.2.361"", ""10.1080/07481189608252787"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-2345-3_20"", ""10.1155/2013/274625"", ""10.3390/ijerph16193645"", ""10.1186/s12877-019-1316-7""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Applied Psychology', 'Health']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)]]"

Besides providing an overview of the state of the art in automatic software verification, the goal of the competition is to establish standards, provide a platform for exchange to developers of such tools, educate PhD students on reproducibility approaches and benchmarking, and provide computing resources to developers that do not have access to compute clusters. The competition consisted of 23 805 verification tasks for C programs and 586 verification tasks for Java programs. The specifications include reachability, memory safety, overflows, and termination. This year, the competition introduced a new competition track on witness validation, where validators for verification witnesses are evaluated with respect to their quality.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_27"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00121"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_25"", ""10.1134/S0361768820080022"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_38"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36742-7_43"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_55"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-54580-5_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-71500-7_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627787"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30826-0_17"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627783"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627791"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7627829"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99524-9_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7635975"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_16"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-22308-2_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-48288-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_22"", ""10.1145/2049697.2049700"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94111-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_15"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985839"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28756-5_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33826-7_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_32"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_41"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48869-1_5"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00619-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27940-9_13"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2010.05812"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_36"", ""10.1145/3519939.3523727"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_15"", ""10.1007/s10009-015-0407-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_19"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2303.06477"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66706-5_7"", ""10.1007/s10817-019-09535-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49052-6"", ""10.1007/s10009-021-00617-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_29"", ""10.1145/3478536"", ""10.1145/3332466.3374529"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41600-3_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_35"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02508-3_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-49674-9_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_31"", ""10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774672"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_42"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_37"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46681-0_44"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_24"", ""10.1145/1889997.1890000"", ""10.1007/s10515-013-0122-2"", ""10.1007/s10515-020-00270-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_34"", ""10.5281/zenodo.6147218"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72013-1_29"", ""10.1145/3368089.3409734"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-30820-8_38"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2017.8102257"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_23"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970337"", ""10.15514/ISPRAS-2017-29(4)-13"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7612021"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_36"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_34"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_3""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"
10.1093/pq/pqaa073,PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY,0101 Philosophy,WHAT IS WHITE IGNORANCE?,"AbstractIn this paper, I identify a theoretical and political role for ‘white ignorance’, present three alternative accounts of white ignorance, and assess how well each fulfils this role. On the Willful Ignorance View, white ignorance refers to white individuals’ willful ignorance about racial injustice. On the Cognitivist View, white ignorance refers to ignorance resulting from social practices that distribute faulty cognitive resources. On the Structuralist View, white ignorance refers to ignorance that (1) results as part of a social process that systematically gives rise to racial injustice, and (2) is an active player in the process. I argue that, because of its greater power and flexibility, the Structuralist View better explains the patterns of ignorance that we observe, better illuminates the connection to white racial domination, and is overall better suited to the project of ameliorating racial injustice. As such, the Structuralist View should be preferred.","[{""name"": ""Annette Martín"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Illinois at Chicago, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/hypa.12354"", ""10.1002/tht3.71"", ""10.1111/phc3.12086"", ""10.1111/phc3.12085"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198814719.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2024640"", ""10.1111/japp.12351"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184618"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01716.x"", ""10.1080/1460846032000164609"", ""10.1017/9780511820076.010"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9753-y"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198793670.001.0001"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00201"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2005.tb00533.x"", ""10.1111/j.1533-6077.2007.00123.x"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-3783-1_11"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199892631.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0434-5"", ""10.11612/resphil.1547"", ""10.1073/pnas.1707719114"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0504-3"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929023.001.0001"", ""10.1086/293601"", ""10.1016/j.tig.2009.09.012"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01222.x"", ""10.1038/538161a"", ""10.5840/jphil20081051023"", ""10.4159/9780674974647"", ""10.2307/2184880"", ""10.1111/hypa.12496"", ""10.1525/fsr.2018.30.3.212"", ""10.1007/s10677-016-9722-9"", ""10.1017/epi.2017.28"", ""10.1017/S0265052506060043"", ""10.1007/s10677-018-9892-8""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In this paper we argue that all three face what we callthe problem of modal epistemic friction(PMEF). One consequence of the problem is that for any of the three accounts to yieldmodal knowledge, the account must provide an epistemology of essence. We discuss an attempt to fend off the problem within the context of the internalism versus externalism debate about epistemic justification. We then investigate the effects that the PMEF has on reductive and non-reductive theories of the relation between essence and modality.","[{""name"": ""Anand Jayprakash Vaidya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Wallner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139149136.004"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198250890.003.0002"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195080414.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0327-7"", ""10.5840/jphil2010107932"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199565818.003.0008"", ""10.1093/0195115058.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-008-9396-5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199777860.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198250890.003.0004"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199683000.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00436.x"", ""10.2307/2214160"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.2007.01095.x"", ""10.1111/phib.12078"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2004.tb00397.x"", ""10.1111/1468-0068.36.s16.11"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669578.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11406-008-9168-y"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9520-5"", ""10.1002/tht3.135"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00811.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2008.579.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00377.x"", ""10.1093/philmat/nkr005"", ""10.1111/papq.12133"", ""10.1017/S1358246108000568"", ""10.1093/mind/fzs122"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-1828-2"", ""10.1007/s10670-006-9018-x"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.2010.01236.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00757.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198755722.003.0008"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199565818.003.0007"", ""10.2307/2185369"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199546046.003.0012"", ""10.7591/9781501746260"", ""10.1111/phpe.12069"", ""10.1093/analys/anx058"", ""10.1007/s11098-008-9230-4"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-0019-0"", ""10.1163/9789401209182_007"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-44309-6_3"", ""10.1111/sjp.12010"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2005.tb00509.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2nrzhj9.6"", ""10.1007/s10992-005-9009-4"", ""10.1007/s10670-007-9093-7"", ""10.1093/analys/anr077"", ""10.1002/9780470696675"", ""10.2307/2108052"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9784-4""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1007/s10551-020-04468-7,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,The Ethics of Entrepreneurial Philanthropy,"AbstractA salient if under researched feature of the new age of global inequalities is the rise to prominence of entrepreneurial philanthropy, the pursuit of transformational social goals through philanthropic investment in projects animated by entrepreneurial principles. Super-wealthy entrepreneurs in this way extend their suzerainty from the domain of the economic to the domains of the social and political. We explore the ethics and ethical implications ofentrepreneurialphilanthropythrough systematic comparison with what we callcustomaryphilanthropy, which preferences support for established institutions and social practices. We analyse the ethical statements made at interview by 24 elite UK philanthropists, 12 customary and 12 entrepreneurial, to reveal the co-existence of two ethically charged narratives of elite philanthropic motivations, each instrumental in maintaining the established socio-economic order. We conclude that entrepreneurial philanthropy, as an ostensibly efficacious instrument of social justice, is ethically flawed by its unremitting impulse toward ideological purity.","[{""name"": ""Charles Harvey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jillian Gordon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mairi Maclean"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/ser/mwq015"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199739073.003.0003"", ""10.4159/9780674287013"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195307955.003.0003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.2008.00722.x"", ""10.1177/0899764010380927"", ""10.1177/1350508411411759"", ""10.1007/s12115-011-9466-z"", ""10.1080/02773949609391066"", ""10.1525/9780520353237"", ""10.1111/0045-3609.00008"", ""10.1017/S1744137414000538"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3551-1"", ""10.1017/S1049096517001378"", ""10.1177/1476127012452820"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1969-7"", ""10.1177/1094428112452151"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9833.2007.00371.x"", ""10.2307/2392853"", ""10.1080/00076791.2011.565516"", ""10.1017/S0007680519000953"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11266-019-00136-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199739073.003.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195073720.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0018726711425616"", ""10.1177/0266242612443376"", ""10.1177/0018726714564199"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2012.02.006"", ""10.4135/9781849209830"", ""10.2307/2084524"", ""10.1177/0002764208327670"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511841286"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061200"", ""10.1515/9781400821853"", ""10.4159/9780674369542"", ""10.4159/9780674042582"", ""10.2307/j.ctv31xf5v0"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199739073.003.0010"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226335780.003.0003"", ""10.1093/0198287976.003.0003"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjnrv7n"", ""10.1177/0899764001301001"", ""10.1002/pf.95"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2442-y"", ""10.1177/0266242611429164"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511975950"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0183-0"", ""10.5465/amj.2006.22083020"", ""10.1108/03090560210422952"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-6944-x"", ""10.1007/BF00988249"", ""10.1177/0001699307080938"", ""10.1080/10848770.2017.1400258"", ""10.5465/amr.1982.4285349"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190648879.001.0001""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Finance', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

For example, it was central to critiques of the 2021 amendments made to Canada’s assisted dying law. The question of whether changes to a country’s assisted dying legislation lead to descents down slippery slopes has also come to the fore—as it does any time a jurisdiction changes its laws. We explore these two questions through the lens of Canada’s experience both to inform Canada’s ongoing discussions and because other countries will confront the same questions if they contemplate changing their assisted dying law. Canada’s Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) law has evolved through a journey from the courts to Parliament, back to the courts, and then back to Parliament. Along this journey the eligibility criteria, the procedural safeguards, and the monitoring regime have changed. In this article, we focus on the eligibility criteria. First, we explain the evolution of the law and what the eligibility criteria were at the various stops along the way. We then explore the ethical justifications for Canada’s new criteria by looking at two elements of the often-corrosive debate. First, we ask whether problems with the social determinants of health that might impact decision-making justify denying eligibility for assisted dying of decisionally capable people with mental illnesses and people with disabilities as their sole underlying medical conditions. Second, we ask whether Canada’s journey supports slippery slope arguments against permitting assisted dying.","[{""name"": ""Jocelyn Downie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Udo Schuklenk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/bioe.12372"", ""10.1007/s10728-017-0344-8"", ""10.1136/medethics-2015-102911"", ""10.2105/AJPH.89.11.1649"", ""10.1080/09638288.2016.1258090"", ""10.4324/9780429465352-20"", ""10.1089/jpm.2016.0290"", ""10.1177/0269216317727158"", ""10.1111/bioe.12353"", ""10.1002/hast.768"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01939.x"", ""10.1503/cmaj.200016"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043547""]","['Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

In the USA, such rationing has unique social justice dimensions. Structural elements of dominant allocation frameworks simultaneously advantage white communities, and disadvantage Black communities—who already experience a disproportionate burden of COVID-19-related job losses, hospitalisations and mortality. Using the example of New Jersey’s Crisis Standard of Care policy, we describe how dominant rationing guidance compounds for many Black patients prior unfair structural disadvantage, chiefly due to the way creatinine and life expectancy are typically considered.We outline six possible policy options towards a more just approach: improving diversity in decision processes, adjusting creatinine scores, replacing creatinine, dropping creatinine, finding alternative measures, adding equity weights and rejecting the dominant model altogether. We also contrast these options with making no changes, which is not a neutral default, but in separate need of justification, despite a prominent claim that it is simply based on ‘objective medical knowledge’. In the regrettable absence of fair federal guidance, hospital and state-level policymakers should reflect on which of these, or further options, seem feasible and justifiable.Irrespective of which approach is taken, all guidance should be supplemented with a monitoring and reporting requirement on possible disparate impacts. The hope that we will be able to continue to avoid rationing ventilators must not stand in the way of revising guidance in a way that better promotes health equity and racial justice, both to be prepared, and given the significant expressive value of ventilator guidance.","[{""name"": ""Harald Schmidt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dorothy E Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nwamaka D Eneanya"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1001/jama.2020.7197"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2011359"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.0918"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.11129"", ""10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.119.14492"", ""10.7326/M20-4186"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.5046"", ""10.7326/M20-1738"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.12606"", ""10.1007/BF01709751"", ""10.2215/CJN.00690120"", ""10.4324/9780203076804"", ""10.1126/science.aac4951"", ""10.1097/MNH.0000000000000587"", ""10.1016/j.semnephrol.2015.04.008"", ""10.2215/CJN.00690120"", ""10.1093/gerona/glz294"", ""10.1016/j.cgh.2017.09.041"", ""10.2307/2626958"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61791-2"", ""10.2190/XX9V-ACD4-KUXD-C0E5"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00183.x"", ""10.1001/jama.2019.5774"", ""10.1056/NEJMms2004740"", ""10.1186/1471-2369-15-9"", ""10.1053/j.ajkd.2007.11.018"", ""10.1002/hast.1113"", ""10.17226/25917"", ""10.3386/w26951"", ""10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.063"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106332"", ""10.1513/AnnalsATS.201310-379OC""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.6939), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6908)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"
10.3390/rel11090428,RELIGIONS,0101 Philosophy,Meanings and Interpretations of Spirituality in Nursing and Health,"Numerous spirituality models and tools have been developed in health education and research, but a gap still exists around the conceptual clarity and articulation of spirituality among nurses and healthcare providers. Nurses and healthcare providers still find it difficult to interpret and apply the concepts of spirituality in their practice settings. This paper provides a concept analysis of spirituality using the Walker and Avant method of conceptual analysis. Several databases including conceptual and empirical literature from various disciplines have been used. The defining attributes of spirituality included spirituality and religion as a separable or mutual construct, spirituality as a personal construct, wholeness and integration, meaning making and purpose, sense of connectedness and relationship, transcendence, inner source of power, energy, and strength. Major antecedents of spirituality found were faith, personal values, and belief systems, and life adversities. Consequences of spirituality included personal/spiritual growth and wellbeing, resilience, and religiousness. Spirituality is a unique and personal human experience, an individualised journey characterised by multiple experiential accounts such as meaning making, purpose, connectedness, wholeness and integration, energy, and transcendence. Spiritual experiences are often difficult to examine and measure using scientific tools and empirical language. Healthcare providers need to fully understand and apply spirituality and spiritual care aspects to provide holistic person-centred care.","[{""name"": ""Nasreen Lalani"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Nursing, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04869.x"", ""10.1007/s10943-010-9401-4"", ""10.1089/jpm.2009.0343"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95447-9_8"", ""10.1370/afm.864"", ""10.1007/s00520-012-1690-6"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2702.2003.00838.x"", ""10.1007/s10943-017-0543-5"", ""10.1097/00007611-200295120-00006"", ""10.1097/00004650-200611000-00006"", ""10.1097/00004650-198905000-00011"", ""10.1155/2014/682817"", ""10.1080/08854720802698491"", ""10.1177/0193945904263411"", ""10.1177/0193945912444321"", ""10.3109/01612849609049920"", ""10.3122/jabfm.17.5.370"", ""10.1370/afm.883"", ""10.2215/CJN.01890310"", ""10.1097/HNP.0b013e31822271db"", ""10.1097/HNP.0000000000000070"", ""10.1177/0894318405274828"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.1997.tb00811.x"", ""10.1080/13576275.2011.613267"", ""10.1080/19349631003730068"", ""10.1016/8755-7223(92)90116-G"", ""10.1089/jpm.2008.0008"", ""10.1080/13607863.2012.678481"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1611(199811/12)7:6<460::AID-PON328>3.0.CO;2-R"", ""10.1007/s10943-012-9615-8"", ""10.1186/1472-6963-9-116"", ""10.1177/070674370905400502"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195118667.001.0001"", ""10.12968/ijpn.2018.24.2.80"", ""10.1097/NJH.0000000000000584"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2015.01.011"", ""10.1037/rel0000163"", ""10.1177/089431802320559182"", ""10.12968/bjon.2013.22.Sup2.S22"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.1998.00519.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2004.01006.x"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.1998.00585.x"", ""10.1177/089801019901700103"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05193.x"", ""10.1016/S0020-7489(99)00007-3"", ""10.12968/bjon.2004.13.19.16322"", ""10.1097/00012272-200212000-00005"", ""10.1111/j.1466-769X.2008.00341.x"", ""10.1207/S15324796ABM2401_06"", ""10.2190/OM.56.1.d"", ""10.20452/pamw.1893"", ""10.1186/1472-6955-11-19"", ""10.1002/nur.4770150505"", ""10.1080/19349630903495475"", ""10.1177/0898010107303890"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05596.x"", ""10.1111/j.1466-769X.2010.00450.x"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02315.x"", ""10.1097/00002820-200308000-00002"", ""10.1016/j.soncn.2008.05.010"", ""10.1177/089801019601400306"", ""10.1111/nuf.12128"", ""10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080"", ""10.15344/2394-4978/2017/234"", ""10.1177/1062860606298872"", ""10.2307/1387689""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Religious studies', 'Health']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)]]"
10.1093/mind/fzz017,MIND,0101 Philosophy,Knowledge From Vice: Deeply Social Epistemology,"Abstract In the past two decades, epistemologists have significantly expanded the focus of their field. To the traditional question that has dominated the debate — under what conditions does belief amount to knowledge? — they have added questions about testimony, epistemic virtues and vices, epistemic trust, and more. This broadening of the range of epistemic concern has coincided with an expansion in conceptions of epistemic agency beyond the individualism characteristic of most earlier epistemology. We believe that these developments have not gone far enough. While the weak anti-individualism we see in contemporary epistemology may be adequate for the kinds of cases it tends to focus on, a great deal of human knowledge production and transmission does not conform to these models. Furthermore, the dispositions and norms that are knowledge-conducive in the familiar cases may not be knowledge-conducive generally. In fact, dispositions that, at an individual level, count as epistemic vices may be epistemic virtues in common social contexts. We argue that this overlooked feature of human social life means that epistemology must become more deeply and pervasively social.","[{""name"": ""Neil Levy"", ""affiliation"": [""Delft University of Technology and Australian Catholic University mark.alfano@gmail.com""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Alfano"", ""affiliation"": [""Delft University of Technology and Australian Catholic University mark.alfano@gmail.com""]}]","[""10.1007/s10539-015-9490-2"", ""10.1007/s10677-017-9809-y"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0182950"", ""10.1017/S135824611800053X"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195389364.003.0007"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4599-5"", ""10.1007/s10539-018-9637-z"", ""10.1073/pnas.1100290108"", ""10.1111/1467-9655.00012"", ""10.1021/tx8001252"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.1979.tb00374.x"", ""10.1007/s10539-015-9506-y"", ""10.1111/phis.12026"", ""10.1093/monist/onv034"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198826903.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.05.005"", ""10.1093/analys/58.1.7"", ""10.1093/0198238797.001.0001"", ""10.1016/0047-2484(92)90081-J"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198807957.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1111/mila.12178"", ""10.1038/415755a"", ""10.1093/analys/23.6.121"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199593248.001.0001"", ""10.3366/epi.2011.0010"", ""10.11612/resphil.2013.90.2.11"", ""10.1111/j.1533-6077.2007.00122.x"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065192"", ""10.1016/S1090-5138(98)00018-X"", ""10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00071-4"", ""10.1098/rspb.2010.1191"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2011.01417.x"", ""10.11612/resphil.2016.93.3.2"", ""10.1002/9780470776513"", ""10.1007/s11229-006-9044-x"", ""10.1215/00318108-3516946"", ""10.1007/s11229-015-0956-1"", ""10.1111/1467-9760.00128"", ""10.1073/pnas.0704452104"", ""10.1525/9780520945449"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2009.05.012"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.24.4.470"", ""10.1037/gpr0000111"", ""10.1017/S0140525X10000968"", ""10.4159/9780674977860"", ""10.1080/13546783.2014.981582"", ""10.1007/s10539-016-9516-4"", ""10.1037/0735-7036.107.2.174"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2008.02.014"", ""10.1007/s10670-015-9741-2"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2017.1355842"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625251.014"", ""10.1098/rstb.2009.0061"", ""10.1521/soco.2008.26.6.791"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625299"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297023.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0017.2010.01394.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199695362.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2678403"", ""10.1080/2153599X.2017.1323779"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262016797.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.shpsc.2016.12.005"", ""10.1111/phpr.12326"", ""10.11647/OBP.0083"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.92.5.821"", ""10.1111/phpr.12228"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139174763""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Starting from the assumption that human harm is unavoidable, many authors have developed differing accounts of what morality requires in these situations. In this article, a strategy for AV decision-making is proposed, the Ethical Valence Theory, which paints AV decision-making as a type of claim mitigation: different road users hold different moral claims on the vehicle’s behavior, and the vehicle must mitigate these claims as it makes decisions about its environment. Using the context of autonomous vehicles, the harm produced by an action and the uncertainties connected to it are quantified and accounted for through deliberation, resulting in an ethical implementation coherent with reality. The goal of this approach is not to define how moral theory requires vehicles to behave, but rather to provide a computational approach that is flexible enough to accommodate a number of ‘moral positions’ concerning what morality demands and what road users may expect, offering an evaluation tool for the social acceptability of an autonomous vehicle’s ethical decision making.","[{""name"": ""Katherine Evans"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nelson de Moura"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stéphane Chauvier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raja Chatila"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ebru Dogan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.61322/UBVW3929"", ""10.1201/9781420085952"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0637-6"", ""10.1080/15389588.2014.936011"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190652951.003.0001"", ""10.1126/science.aaf2654"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9444-x"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9448-6"", ""10.1007/s10506-017-9211-z"", ""10.1093/0195147790.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2015.03.009"", ""10.1007/s13347-015-0211-1"", ""10.1093/0199270023.001.0001"", ""10.1109/IV47402.2020.9304618"", ""10.1007/s10677-017-9780-7"", ""10.1080/09528130110100289"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30371-6"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0307-5"", ""10.1016/0001-4575(94)90022-1"", ""10.1002/9780470281819.ch4"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-45854-9_5"", ""10.2307/1416145"", ""10.3141/2424-07"", ""10.1109/MIS.2006.81"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.9804"", ""10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511498725.014"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.396"", ""10.1017/S0265052500001461"", ""10.1007/s10677-018-9887-5"", ""10.1007/s11948-019-00096-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22933-7_6"", ""10.1016/j.iatssr.2014.08.001"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9419-3"", ""10.4324/9781315197128"", ""10.5235/17579961.6.2.193"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190652951.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2019.105272"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0284-0"", ""10.1097/00005650-198506000-00008"", ""10.1080/15389588.2017.1332408"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190652951.003.0002"", ""10.1016/S0001-4575(98)00076-1"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107341050.005"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11512"", ""10.1007/s10677-016-9745-2"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199572816.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10506-017-9210-0"", ""10.1093/0199250197.001.0001"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795651"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66845-1_4"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2010.04.003"", ""10.1002/9781118557426"", ""10.1086/677022"", ""10.1177/0361198118758055"", ""10.1075/nlp.8""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Legacies of colonialism have generally been overlooked in theories of democracy. These omissions challenge several key assumptions of deliberative democracy. I argue that deliberative democracy does not travel well outside Western sites and its key assumptions begin to unravel in the ‘developing’ regions of the world. The context for a decolonial critique of deliberative democracy is the ongoing violent conflicts over resource extraction in the former colonies of Africa, Asia and Latin America. I argue that deliberative democracy cannot take into account the needs of marginalized stakeholders who are defending their lands and livelihoods. The paper contributes to the literature by (1) offering a critique of hegemonic models of democracy that cannot address issues of inequality and colonial difference and (2) offering possibilities to imagine counterhegemonic alternatives for a democratization of democracy from below.","[{""name"": ""Subhabrata Bobby Banerjee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0018726718760150"", ""10.1177/1350508411431910"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511614262"", ""10.1177/0007650319870825"", ""10.1177/1086026600131001"", ""10.1177/0170840607096386"", ""10.1177/0018726717726586"", ""10.1111/joms.12756"", ""10.1177/26317877211036714"", ""10.1177/135050840184006"", ""10.1177/1350508421995742"", ""10.1108/17422040810869963"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297276.003.0004"", ""10.1515/9781400881024"", ""10.1515/9780691186542"", ""10.1080/13688790.2014.966414"", ""10.1177/1350508419855700"", ""10.1177/0170840612443454"", ""10.1057/jibs.2014.25"", ""10.1017/beq.2019.21"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0332-5"", ""10.1038/s41893-019-0349-4"", ""10.1123/jsm.2018-0243"", ""10.4135/9780857021014"", ""10.1162/DAED_a_00444"", ""10.1177/0018726713479620"", ""10.1177/1350508420928521"", ""10.1017/beq.2015.2"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04352-z"", ""10.2307/j.ctvddzsf3"", ""10.1086/448714"", ""10.1177/0090591704268372"", ""10.1080/19460171.2016.1170620"", ""10.5070/T413012881"", ""10.1111/joms.12173"", ""10.1108/cpoib-01-2018-0016"", ""10.1177/1350508420963871"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.112"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.12.022"", ""10.1080/0143659042000185417"", ""10.1007/s11625-015-0297-5"", ""10.1215/9780822371816"", ""10.1108/17422041011049932"", ""10.2307/2567577"", ""10.1162/DAED_x_00442"", ""10.5325/goodsociety.19.2.0044"", ""10.1177/1350507611407139"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04398-z"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.34422002"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12049"", ""10.1080/09502380601162514"", ""10.1353/fem.2017.0037"", ""10.5325/goodsociety.19.2.0047"", ""10.1177/1473095203002001005"", ""10.3998/mpub.17774"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3027-8"", ""10.1177/1350508406065851"", ""10.1177/1350508411398996"", ""10.1177/0018726709359330"", ""10.1080/13510340701768075"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04320-7"", ""10.1111/joms.12144"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2010.01137.x"", ""10.1108/17422041011049978"", ""10.1177/1350507617745275"", ""10.1111/joms.12336"", ""10.1215/9780822371779"", ""10.1177/1350508411398730"", ""10.11144/Javeriana.cao32-58.caqed"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-2033-3"", ""10.5840/beq201222443"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3763-4"", ""10.1177/1350508411398731"", ""10.1177/02632760022051310"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.34422014"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3798-1"", ""10.1177/0950017016661269"", ""10.1177/0306396813497877"", ""10.1080/09502380601164353"", ""10.1177/1350508420928526"", ""10.1017/beq.2016.73"", ""10.1017/S0940739199770591"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00950.x"", ""10.1111/joms.12203"", ""10.1177/0170840612467151"", ""10.1177/0263775819855404"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.09.011"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511790737"", ""10.1177/0018726716628970"", ""10.1080/2201473X.2011.10648799"", ""10.1080/03086534.2013.768099"", ""10.5325/goodsociety.19.2.0053"", ""10.1177/1744935912444355"", ""10.1108/17422040610661280"", ""10.1108/17422040710775021"", ""10.5840/beq201222445"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9478-1"", ""10.1080/14623520601056240"", ""10.1177/0170840613499751""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Development', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7231), ('1403 设计学', 0.7203)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

By analyzing interview material from an ethnographic study, we centralize the relationship between feelings of being ‘different,’ vulnerability and the development of sensibilities, practices and imaginaries of care. We elaborate on how vulnerability serves as a ground for caring with rather than for others, and illustrate how it allowed individuals to challenge both organizational, normative diversity discourses and essentialization of differences. We contribute to the literature on critical diversity management by furthering problematizations of instrumental diversity management from the perspective of care, and to the organizational literature on feminist care ethics by empirically exploring how ethical agency emerges from tensions related to feeling ‘different.’ While previous studies have shown how marginalized individuals use their sense of ‘otherness’ to negotiate, conform to and resist organizational norms, practices and discourses, we provide further insights on how it also can drive concern and care for others, and thus serve as possible ground for ethical change initiatives within organizations.","[{""name"": ""Janet Johansson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alice Wickström"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1464700107078139"", ""10.1177/0018726713491772"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04316-3"", ""10.1080/20797222.2009.11433992"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8594.2007.00306.x"", ""10.1108/JOCM-11-2012-0183"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-9307-3"", ""10.1177/0170840608093545"", ""10.1108/EDI-12-2015-0107"", ""10.1108/EDI-08-2014-0061"", ""10.1016/j.scaman.2016.11.001"", ""10.1177/0018726715612901"", ""10.1177/1742715020987092"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2004.00017.x"", ""10.1080/13621020500301221"", ""10.5465/amr.2010.0466"", ""10.2307/3857622"", ""10.1111/1467-8551.11.s1.3"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9539-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3593-4"", ""10.1177/1350508420973319"", ""10.1111/gwao.12419"", ""10.1111/tran.12306"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04526-0"", ""10.1177/1350508413484819"", ""10.4324/9780203566848"", ""10.1177/1350508414558727"", ""10.1108/17542410810897544"", ""10.1177/1059601104273064"", ""10.5465/ame.1997.9709231661"", ""10.1177/1350508418812585"", ""10.4135/9781446220573"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2203-y"", ""10.1177/0018726718764264"", ""10.1177/1357034X05056189"", ""10.1177/1350508416664143"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract198612113"", ""10.1177/0170840604038180"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2007.00700.x"", ""10.1177/1350508409350344"", ""10.1177/1350508417690396""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

We first summarize the recent ‘Moral Machine’ study, which generated preference data from millions of people regarding how they think AVs should respond to emergency situations. We argue that while such preferences cannot be used to directly inform policy, they should not be disregarded. We defend an approach that we call ‘Collective Reflective Equilibrium in Practice’ (CREP). In CREP, data on public attitudes function as an input into a deliberative process that looks for coherence between attitudes, behaviours and competing ethical principles. We argue that in cases of reasonable moral disagreement, data on public attitudes should play a much greater role in shaping policies than in areas of ethical consensus. We apply CREP to some of the global preferences about AVs uncovered by the Moral Machines study. We intend this discussion both as a substantive contribution to the debate about the programming of ethical AVs, and as an illustration of how CREP works. We argue that CREP provides a principled way of using some public preferences as an input for policy, while justifiably disregarding others.","[{""name"": ""Julian Savulescu"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", ""Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", ""Biomedical Ethics Research Group Murdoch Children’s Research Institute Parkville Australia"", ""Melbourne Law School University of Melbourne Melbourne Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher Gyngell"", ""affiliation"": [""Biomedical Ethics Research Group Murdoch Children’s Research Institute Parkville Australia"", ""Melbourne Law School University of Melbourne Melbourne Australia"", ""Department of Paediatrics University of Melbourne Melbourne Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Guy Kahane"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", ""Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland""]}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Cognitive enhancement can be conceived as a benefit-seeking strategy used by healthy individuals to enhance cognitive abilities such as learning, memory, attention, or vigilance. This phenomenon is hotly debated in the public, professional, and scientific literature. Many of the statements favoring cognitive enhancement (e.g., related to greater productivity and autonomy) or opposing it (e.g., related to health-risks and social expectations) rely on claims about human welfare and human flourishing. But with real-world evidence from the social and psychological sciences often missing to support (or invalidate) these claims, the debate about cognitive enhancement is stalled. In this paper, we describe a set of crucial debated questions about psychological and social aspects of cognitive enhancement (e.g., intrinsic motivation, well-being) and explain why they are of fundamental importance to address in the cognitive enhancement debate and in future research. We propose studies targeting social and psychological outcomes associated with cognitive enhancers (e.g., stigmatization, burnout, mental well-being, work motivation). We also voice a call for scientific evidence, inclusive of but not limited to biological health outcomes, to thoroughly assess the impact of enhancement. This evidence is needed to engage in empirically informed policymaking, as well as to promote the mental and physical health of users and non-users of enhancement.","[{""name"": ""Eric Racine"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Sattler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wren Boehlen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.tics.2015.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.jsat.2016.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.07.028"", ""10.1038/s41562-019-0545-2"", ""10.1038/4551057a"", ""10.1007/s11948-009-9142-5"", ""10.1111/nyas.13040"", ""10.1353/ken.0.0003"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587810.001.0001"", ""10.5664/jcsm.27442"", ""10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.03.014"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.0010038"", ""10.1159/000336533"", ""10.1111/bph.13813"", ""10.1370/afm.1426"", ""10.1006/pmed.1998.0385"", ""10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00571"", ""10.1080/15265161.2013.794875"", ""10.1080/21507740.2014.939381"", ""10.2147/NAN.S61925"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0204631"", ""10.1177/1088868315609487"", ""10.1126/science.aad5893"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-04813-x"", ""10.1007/s12152-013-9190-z"", ""10.1007/s12152-015-9230-y"", ""10.1038/embor.2012.225"", ""10.1111/1467-6419.00150"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2013.301706"", ""10.1038/npp.2010.233"", ""10.1212/WNL.0b013e318289703b"", ""10.1038/456702a"", ""10.1016/j.intmar.2020.03.001"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00453.x"", ""10.1007/s41465-020-00190-4"", ""10.1080/02678371003683747"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3182-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190467036.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.12.002"", ""10.2147/NDT.S114185"", ""10.1097/JCP.0000000000001085"", ""10.1016/j.sleep.2011.03.010"", ""10.1016/j.neures.2012.02.010"", ""10.1007/s00213-008-1395-1"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0213619"", ""10.1016/j.brs.2018.09.014"", ""10.1073/pnas.0604475103"", ""10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02761.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0028416"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01907.x"", ""10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.06.016"", ""10.1002/per.1994"", ""10.1016/j.phrs.2010.04.002"", ""10.3109/10826084.2015.1110170"", ""10.1037/0893-164X.20.3.279"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68"", ""10.1159/000353263"", ""10.1098/rstb.2014.0214"", ""10.1088/1741-2552/ab39cd"", ""10.4159/9780674043060"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0071452"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0068821"", ""10.1080/15265161.2016.1170240"", ""10.1016/S1472-6483(10)62202-X"", ""10.1136/jme.2006.019646"", ""10.1080/01973533.2012.711692"", ""10.1037/a0023825"", ""10.1007/s12152-017-9340-9"", ""10.1073/pnas.1702996114"", ""10.3390/pharmacy6030058"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01093-5_12"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8295.1992.tb02429.x""]","['Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s10551-022-05071-8,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,"Biased Humans, (Un)Biased Algorithms?","AbstractPrevious research has shown that algorithmic decisions can reflect gender bias. The increasingly widespread utilization of algorithms in critical decision-making domains (e.g., healthcare or hiring) can thus lead to broad and structural disadvantages for women. However, women often experience bias and discrimination through human decisions and may turn to algorithms in the hope of receiving neutral and objective evaluations. Across three studies (N = 1107), we examine whether women’s receptivity to algorithms is affected by situations in which they believe that their gender identity might disadvantage them in an evaluation process. In Study 1, we establish, in an incentive-compatible online setting, that unemployed women are more likely to choose to have their employment chances evaluated by an algorithm if the alternative is an evaluation by a man rather than a woman. Study 2 generalizes this effect by placing it in a hypothetical hiring context, and Study 3 proposes that relative algorithmic objectivity, i.e., the perceived objectivity of an algorithmic evaluator over and against a human evaluator, is a driver of women’s preferences for evaluations by algorithms as opposed to men. Our work sheds light on how women make sense of algorithms in stereotype-relevant domains and exemplifies the need to provide education for those at risk of being adversely affected by algorithmic decisions. Our results have implications for the ethical management of algorithms in evaluation settings. We advocate for improving algorithmic literacy so that evaluators and evaluatees (e.g., hiring managers and job applicants) can acquire the abilities required to reflect critically on algorithmic decisions.","[{""name"": ""Florian Pethig"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julia Kroenung"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/pan/mpr057"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2018.08.003"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2015.2186"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04226-4"", ""10.1093/qje/qjz008"", ""10.1080/21670811.2019.1601577"", ""10.1177/0022243719851788"", ""10.1257/aer.99.1.431"", ""10.1145/2908216.2908220"", ""10.1017/psrm.2018.10"", ""10.1201/9781003278290-44"", ""10.2307/2928741"", ""10.17705/1jais.00514"", ""10.1037/xge0000033"", ""10.1037/cdp0000153"", ""10.1145/230538.230561"", ""10.1080/07421222.2018.1523534"", ""10.1007/s10699-021-09809-x"", ""10.1037/amp0000068"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00272"", ""10.1037/a0021956"", ""10.1007/BF01666535"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2018.3093"", ""10.1111/ijsa.12246"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04204-w"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-54024-5_1"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.363"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.12.005"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucz013"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070137"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3921-3"", ""10.1073/pnas.1211286109"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04407-1"", ""10.1287/mksc.2020.1266"", ""10.1257/aer.101.4.1410"", ""10.3758/s13428-013-0434-y"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071312-145702"", ""10.1080/13576500342000031"", ""10.1002/for.2464"", ""10.1002/bdm.542"", ""10.1007/s11747-019-00710-5"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00080"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3864-8"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(02)80009-0"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.07.001"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420220410"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032414-111322"", ""10.1002/bdm.2118""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

More specifically, we discuss responsible human-robot coordination within mixed traffic: i.e. traffic involving both automated cars and conventional human-driven cars. We do three main things. First, we explain key differences in robotic and human agency and expectation-forming mechanisms that are likely to give rise to compatibility-problems in mixed traffic, which may lead to crashes and accidents. Second, we identify three possible solution-strategies for achieving better human-robot coordination within mixed traffic. Third, we identify important ethical challenges raised by each of these three possible strategies for achieving optimized human-robot cordination in this domain. Among other things, we argue that we should not just explore ways of making robotic driving more like human driving. Rather, we ought also to take seriously potential ways (e.g. technological means) of making human driving more like robotic driving. Nor should we assume that complete automation is always the ideal to aim for; in some traffic-situations, the best results may be achieved through human-robot collaboration. Ultimately, our main aim in this paper is to argue that the new field of the ethics of automated driving needs take seriously the ethics of mixed traffic and responsible human-robot coordination.","[{""name"": ""Sven Nyholm"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jilles Smids"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/15027570.2010.536402"", ""10.1086/505233"", ""10.1109/MIS.2013.70"", ""10.1023/B:MIND.0000035461.63578.9d"", ""10.1007/s11948-016-9806-x"", ""10.3141/2424-07"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-05990-7_9"", ""10.1093/phe/phs015"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract200430317"", ""10.1023/A:1010087500508"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2011.04.011"", ""10.1177/1470594X07085153"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-45854-9_4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199591565.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10677-016-9745-2"", ""10.1007/s11948-017-9943-x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139017428"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674065512"", ""10.1111/japp.12168"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.401"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199915439.001.0001"", ""10.5235/175799611796399812""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

These include remains of organisms within the size range of pollen grains ( c. 10–250 µm), resistant to laboratory treatments used for the preparation of palynological samples. NPPs are a large and taxonomically heterogeneous group of remains of organisms living in diverse environments. Taxonomically, they belong to a wide variety of groups such as cyanobacteria, algae, vascular plants, invertebrates and fungi. The aim of this chapter is to provide a general overview of NPP groups observed in palynology slides. It includes more than 40 of the most common groups starting with acritarcha, cyanobacteria and algae, moving through transitional groups to animals and fungi and finishing with human-made objects such as textile fibres. Although far from complete, it provides an updated overview of taxonomical diversity of NPPs and their indicator values. Further works on NPP identifications are of great importance to improve our current knowledge. Since NPPs occur in all kinds of sediments, their analysis is a powerful tool for reconstructing environmental changes over time. Further detailed studies of specific NPP groups and their indicator values will open the way for new fields of study.","[{""name"": ""Lyudmila Shumilovskikh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Palynology and Climate Dynamics, Georg-August-University Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany"", ""Research Laboratory ‘Herbarium’, National Research Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia""]}, {""name"": ""Jennifer M.

10.1111/nous.12264,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,Why Maximize Expected Choice-Worthiness?1,"AbstractThis paper argues in favor of a particular account of decision‐making under normative uncertainty: that, when it is possible to do so, one shouldmaximize expected choice‐worthiness. Though this position has been often suggested in the literature and is often taken to be the ‘default’ view, it has so far received little in the way of positive argument in its favor. After dealing with some preliminaries and giving the basic motivation for taking normative uncertainty into account in our decision‐making, we consider and provide new arguments against two rival accounts that have been offered—the accounts that we call ‘My Favorite Theory’ and ‘My Favorite Option’. We then give a novel argument forcomparativism—the view that, under normative uncertainty, one should take into account both probabilities of different theories and magnitudes of choice‐worthiness. Finally, we further argue in favor of maximizing expected choice‐worthiness and consider and respond to five objections.","[{""name"": ""William MacAskill"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford""]}, {""name"": ""Toby Ord"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford""]}]","[""10.1080/00455091.2016.1198198"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672165.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511720185.012"", ""10.1215/00318108-2366479"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9973.1996.tb00212.x"", ""10.1086/656328"", ""10.1007/s11098-007-9143-7"", ""10.1111/papq.12022"", ""10.1215/00318108-112-1-27"", ""10.1023/B:SYNT.0000004904.91112.16"", ""10.1086/293312"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195126105.001.0001"", ""10.1086/669564"", ""10.1093/mind/fzv169"", ""10.5840/jphil2016113929"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198722274.001.0001"", ""10.1023/A:1005150001309"", ""10.1086/342859"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-4144-4_7"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198246091.001.0001"", ""10.1086/505234"", ""10.2307/2026054"", ""10.1093/mind/111.443.693"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0227-2"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199542680.003.0011"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511624681"", ""10.1017/S0953820806002159"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511481505""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The ethical literature has pinpointed several issues concerning safety, autonomy, responsibility and accountability, psychosocial identity, consent, privacy and data security. This study aims to assess BCI users’ experiences, self-observations and attitudes in their own right and looks for social and ethical implications.MethodsWe conducted nine semi-structured interviews with BCI users, who used the technology for medical reasons. The transcribed interviews were analyzed according to the Grounded Theory coding method.ResultsBCI users perceive themselves as active operators of a technology that offers them social participation and impacts their self-definition. Each of these aspects bears its own opportunities and risks. BCIs can contribute to retaining or regaining human capabilities. At the same time, BCI use contains elements that challenge common experiences, for example when the technology is in conflict with the affective side of BCI users. The potential benefits of BCIs are regarded as outweighing the risks in that BCI use is considered to promote valuable qualities and capabilities. BCI users appreciate the opportunity to regain lost capabilities as well as to gain new ones.ConclusionsBCI users appreciate the technology for various reasons. The technology is highly appreciated in cases where it is beneficial in terms of agency, participation and self-definitions. Rather than questioning human nature, the technology can retain and restore characteristics and abilities which enrich our lives.","[{""name"": ""Johannes Kögel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ralf J.

Yet, how “hype” is being conceived varies. I will argue that hype is best understood as a particular kind of exaggeration, one that explicitly or implicitly exaggerates various positive aspects of science in ways that undermine the goals of science communication in a particular context. This account also makes clear the ways that value judgments play a role in judgments of “hype,” which has implications for detecting and addressing this problem.","[{""name"": ""Kristen Intemann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/mt.2012.172"", ""10.1126/science.aaf4620"", ""10.2217/rme.09.20"", ""10.1080/08989621.2013.788384"", ""10.1159/000336533"", ""10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949"", ""10.1289/ehp.7713"", ""10.1111/j.1399-0004.2006.00693.x"", ""10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.03.014"", ""10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758"", ""10.1016/j.esp.2019.02.004"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(95)91429-3"", ""10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.012995"", ""10.1017/can.2020.41"", ""10.3732/ajb.0900041"", ""10.1093/humrep/den496"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wrc78"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1144182"", ""10.1093/bjps/axs007"", ""10.1007/s13181-020-00790-8"", ""10.1126/scitranslmed.3010496"", ""10.1080/15265160802109413"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21541-4_5"", ""10.1353/pbm.2018.0065"", ""10.1038/gim.2017.217"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0182496"", ""10.1093/ajcn/nqy337"", ""10.1503/cmaj.1030762"", ""10.2307/2027007"", ""10.1177/027046769201200203"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32116-1"", ""10.1080/00909889109365311"", ""10.1111/j.1748-720X.2010.00490.x"", ""10.22323/2.15050301"", ""10.1007/s11229-010-9789-0"", ""10.1017/can.2020.21"", ""10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15486.2"", ""10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/304"", ""10.1109/MC.2003.1198233"", ""10.1126/science.1198039"", ""10.1007/s11948-010-9210-x"", ""10.1007/s11948-011-9327-6"", ""10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.05.001"", ""10.1007/BF03351307"", ""10.1002/jssc.201900431"", ""10.1111/1467-954X.12099"", ""10.1177/1075547010386972"", ""10.1038/embor.2012.39"", ""10.1038/s41436-019-0482-5"", ""10.1002/hast.612"", ""10.1001/jamahealthforum.2020.0438"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0028416"", ""10.1038/nbt0609-514""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Availability of critical care beds has become a hot topic, and in many countries, we have seen a huge increase in the provision of temporary intensive care bed capacity. However, there is a limit where the hospitals may run out of resources to provide critical care, which is heavily dependent on trained staff, just-in-time supply chains for clinical consumables and drugs and advanced equipment. In the first (good) phase, we can still do clinical prioritisation and decision-making as usual, based on the need for intensive care and prognostication: what are the odds for a good result with regard to survival and quality of life. In the next (bad phase), the resources are mostly available, but the system is stressed by many patients arriving over a short time period and auxiliary beds in different places in the hospital being used. We may have to abandon admittance of patients with doubtful prognosis. In the last (ugly) phase, usual medical triage and priority setting may not be sufficient to decrease inflow and there may not be enough intensive care unit beds available. In this phase different criteria must be applied using a utilitarian approach for triage. We argue that this is an important transition where society, and not physicians, must provide guidance to support triage that is no longer based on medical priorities alone.","[{""name"": ""Hans Flaatten"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vernon Van Heerden"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Jung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Beil"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susannah Leaver"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrew Rhodes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bertrand Guidet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dylan W deLange"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/medethics-2020-106352"", ""10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8"", ""10.1007/s00134-017-4718-z"", ""10.1111/jgs.15888"", ""10.1007/s00134-019-05853-1"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e318205df9b"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e31822e5692"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114"", ""10.1016/j.chest.2017.08.001"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106227""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.6939), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6908)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

Combining elements from statistical learning, causal interventionism, and decision theory, we design an idealisedexplanation gamein which players collaborate to find the best explanation(s) for a given algorithmic prediction. Through an iterative procedure of questions and answers, the players establish a three-dimensional Pareto frontier that describes the optimal trade-offs between explanatory accuracy, simplicity, and relevance. Multiple rounds are played at different levels of abstraction, allowing the players to explore overlapping causal patterns of variable granularity and scope. We characterise the conditions under which such a game is almost surely guaranteed to converge on a (conditionally) optimal explanation surface in polynomial time, and highlight obstacles that will tend to prevent the players from advancing beyond certain explanatory thresholds. The game serves a descriptive and a normative function, establishing a conceptual space in which to analyse and compare existing proposals, as well as design new and improved solutions.","[{""name"": ""David S.

10.1111/nous.12332,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,The atoms of self-control,"AbstractPhilosophers routinely invoke self‐control in their theorizing, but major questions remain about what exactly self‐control is. I propose a componential account in which an exercise of self‐control is built out of something more fundamental: basic intrapsychic actions called cognitive control actions. Cognitive control regulates simple, brief states called response pulses that operate across diverse psychological systems (think of one's attention being grabbed by a salient object or one's mind being pulled to think about a certain topic). Self‐control ostensibly seems quite different because it regulates complex, temporally extended states such as emotions and cravings. But critically, these complex states also exhibit important componential structure: They rely on response pulses as a key means by which they bring about action. The overall picture is that self‐control consists of skilled sequences of cognitive control directed against extended streams of response pulses that arise from states such as emotions and cravings, thus preventing these states from being effective in action. The account clarifies the “atoms” of self‐control—the elemental units that get combined in complex ways to produce different kinds of self‐control actions. Surprisingly, the account, which is derived from research in cognitive science, aligns nicely with the commonsense conception of self‐control.","[{""name"": ""Chandra Sripada"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Michigan""]}]","[""10.1038/35066572"", ""10.1126/science.1089504"", ""10.1111/nyas.12360"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2004.02.010"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2013.12.003"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100422"", ""10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60452-1"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2457.003.0004"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.624"", ""10.1111/cogs.12126"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2004.10.003"", ""10.1080/00455091.2017.1285643"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198738824.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phpr.12395"", ""10.1038/nrn.2016.113"", ""10.1002/9781118920497.ch1"", ""10.1038/nrn755"", ""10.2307/2023177"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00139"", ""10.1016/0001-6918(69)90065-1"", ""10.1177/1745691615623247"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2011.02.004"", ""10.1038/nn1594"", ""10.1167/8.2.2"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2018.07.015"", ""10.1080/13546780601008825"", ""10.1177/1745691612460685"", ""10.1037/0021-843X.100.2.144"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033645"", ""10.1037/0894-4105.18.3.543"", ""10.1080/02699938708408043"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.212"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.970"", ""10.1080/09515080701874092"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00077"", ""10.1080/09515089.2017.1336528"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2012.01.006"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199214570.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199862580.003.0012"", ""10.1037/a0027205"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9504.003.0031"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199266302.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.0003-2638.1996.00063.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10480.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118920497.ch10"", ""10.1017/S0140525X12003196"", ""10.1016/0166-4328(93)90091-4"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00424.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199862580.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1355617710000895"", ""10.1006/obhd.1996.0028"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00199"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.99.3.440"", ""10.1111/1467-8284.00063"", ""10.1093/019515617X.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0224-5"", ""10.1093/cercor/bhr384"", ""10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.167"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-70967-8_22"", ""10.1007/BF01173652"", ""10.1038/nrn1345"", ""10.1037/bul0000093"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.07.066"", ""10.1037/0096-3445.130.3.466"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01701.x"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00244.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717812.003.0008"", ""10.1016/S0272-7358(05)80003-0"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195130072.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2013.07.007"", ""10.1038/nn.4384"", ""10.1146/annurev-neuro-072116-031526"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.11.024"", ""10.1037/a0014855"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2012.00870.x"", ""10.1037/h0054651"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093707"", ""10.2307/2183785"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.59"", ""10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.02.006""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Applied Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The leaders of rising powers such as China, India, Turkey, and Russia have stressed their civilizational identity in framing their domestic and foreign policy platforms. An emphasis on civilizational identity is also evident in U.S. president Donald Trump's domestic and foreign policy. Some analysts argue that the twenty-first century might belong to the civilization state, just as the past few centuries were dominated by the nation-state. But is the rise of civilization state inevitable? Will it further undermine the liberal international order and fuel a clash of civilizations, as predicted by the late Samuel Huntington? Or might ideas from East Asian and other non-Western civilizations contribute to greater pluralism in our thinking about world order and the study of international relations?","[{""name"": ""Amitav Acharya"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/20045621"", ""10.1017/S089267941700020X"", ""10.2307/20045708"", ""10.1177/0392192109102149"", ""10.1353/sais.2019.0001"", ""10.1017/S0892679418000072"", ""10.2307/20045711"", ""10.2307/20044496"", ""10.2307/20028844""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

There is little synthesis of the research on this topic so far. We identify 294 relevant research or discussion items in our literature review of this topic. There is widespread agreement among scholars that some artificial entities could warrant moral consideration in the future, if not also the present. The reasoning varies, such as concern for the effects on artificial entities and concern for the effects on human society. Beyond the conventional consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethicist ethical frameworks, some scholars encourage “information ethics” and “social-relational” approaches, though there are opportunities for more in-depth ethical research on the nuances of moral consideration of artificial entities. There is limited relevant empirical data collection, primarily in a few psychological studies on current moral and social attitudes of humans towards robots and other artificial entities. This suggests an important gap for psychological, sociological, economic, and organizational research on how artificial entities will be integrated into society and the factors that will determine how the interests of artificial entities are considered.","[{""name"": ""Jamie Harris"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jacy Reese Anthis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10676-008-9169-3"",

Important contributions have been made from each: the ethics, responsibility, and sustainability disciplines. However, we are yet to integrate these disciplinary contributions into a comprehensive interdisciplinary RM competence framework that corresponds to the interdisciplinary nature of RM challenges. We address this priority in this paper and report on the findings of an integrative structured literature review of 224 management competence articles across the ERS disciplines. Our thematic template analysis has produced an interdisciplinary RM competence framework of three layers of personal, behavioural, and intellectual competences and independent and interdependent competence dimensions. The resulting 3 × 2 competence matrix framework accommodates 33 interdisciplinary ERS competence themes and 90 subthemes in the six competence domains of being and becoming, acting and interacting, knowing and thinking. To the RM discussion, we contribute an interdisciplinary competence framework that enables the development of responsible managers who tackle the inherently interdisciplinary issues of RM. To the competence discussion, we contribute the interdependent competence dimension and future research directions through the lens of response-ability.JBE Section: Business Ethics Learning and Education","[{""name"": ""Oliver Laasch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dirk C.

We argue that social norms play a role of heuristics facilitating tax payers’ response to the instrumental incentives posed by the systemic parameters, such as tax rate and penalties for evasion, and thus moderate the effect of those parameters on willingness to evade taxes. Relying on a unique survey experiment conducted in fourteen countries of Central-Eastern Europe, we demonstrate two types of a conditioning effect of norms. First, the impact of tax rates on respondents’ propensity for tax evasion is moderated by the perceived norms of the society at large (descriptive norms). In particular, an increasing tax rate lowers the probability of evasion as long as one views “most others” as honest taxpayers, which highlights the importance of equitability (fairness) concerns for tax compliance decisions. In contrast, the impact of punishment is moderated by the perceived norms of one’s immediate reference group (subjective norms). Strong subjective compliance norms tend to effectively replace penalties as a mechanism discouraging tax evasion, suggesting that the deterrent effect of a penalty can be entirely suppressed when subjective norms are strong. These findings have important implications for the understanding of tax compliance decisions under different formal and informal regimes.","[{""name"": ""Maciej A.

10.1007/s10551-021-04791-7,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Power Imbalance and the Dark Side of the Captive Agri-food Supplier-Buyer Relationship,"AbstractThis paper highlights the dark side of power imbalance regarding its consequences in agri-food supplier–buyer relationships. We report on findings from two studies. The first study is based on a sample of 105 key informants, while study 2 is based on a sample of 444 key informants, all from the cocoa agri-food supply market of Ghana. While the first study focuses on the antecedents of power imbalance and its consequences, the second study explores the role of cooperatives/collective action in minimizing supplier exploitation. Data from these studies were analysed using the partial least squares technique (SmartPLS). Analysis of these findings shows switching costs’ impact on power imbalance to be curvilinear, while power imbalance has a curvilinear relationship with opportunism. The negative consequences of power imbalance are further exacerbated by dependency and the lack of joint action. Furthermore, we found the negative impact of power imbalance on financial performance to be stronger for non-cooperative members than for cooperative members, while, counterintuitively, we found the positive impact of economic satisfaction on financial performance to be stronger for non-cooperative members than for cooperative members.","[{""name"": ""Richard Glavee-Geo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Per Engelseth"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Arnt Buvik"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.indmarman.2016.02.008"", ""10.1287/mksc.8.4.310"", ""10.1362/146934709X479926"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2004.09.002"", ""10.1177/002224379202900106"", ""10.1504/IJPM.2015.070741"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2005.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.03.019"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2016.02.016"", ""10.1108/03090561211202503"", ""10.1177/002224299005400306"", ""10.1177/0092070394222003"", ""10.1108/JBIM-04-2017-0090"", ""10.1002/bs.3830020303"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.2006.00500.x"", ""10.1007/s11747-007-0059-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9597-8"", ""10.1287/mksc.13.1.83"", ""10.1177/002224298705100202"", ""10.1177/1470593111408181"", ""10.1108/01443571211208641"", ""10.2307/258191"", ""10.1177/002224377200900110"", ""10.1080/12507970.2018.1526655"", ""10.2307/2089716"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2015.04.034"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2011.02.003"", ""10.1108/JBIM-07-2013-0154"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2011.11.018"", ""10.1111/1477-9552.12060"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9052-2"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1108/IntR-12-2017-0515"", ""10.1177/002224298404800303"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2011.11.013"", ""10.1016/S0022-4359(99)00021-4"", ""10.1177/002224379903600207"", ""10.1016/S0167-8116(96)00006-7"", ""10.1016/j.pursup.2019.05.002"", ""10.1177/0276146719900370"", ""10.1108/03090560110388105"", ""10.1108/JBIM-04-2016-0066"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2005.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2007.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.05.022"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8"", ""10.1362/0267257053166758"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2005.03.008"", ""10.1108/08858620510576757"", ""10.1007/s11747-017-0532-y"", ""10.1177/002224298905300309"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(90)90004-U"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2006.05.004"", ""10.1177/002224378402100305"", ""10.1177/002224378201900412"", ""10.1080/10696679.1998.11501811"", ""10.1111/j.1936-4490.1999.tb00693.x"", ""10.1177/002224378602300409"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2006.05.007"", ""10.1177/002224379503200107"", ""10.1002/smj.667"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.08.010"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.03.014"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12134"", ""10.1177/030630709902500103"", ""10.1080/13545701.2015.1088960"", ""10.1111/jscm.12011"", ""10.1016/0019-8501(86)90026-X"", ""10.1177/002224378201900413"", ""10.1108/08876041011072546"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1177/014920638601200408"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2005.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.pursup.2003.09.004"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.2010.00305.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0432-2"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0418-1"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2012.10.002"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2681-6"", ""10.1108/JBIM-01-2018-0039"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8491043"", ""10.1362/026725708X306149"", ""10.1108/JBIM-10-2012-0193"", ""10.1108/08858621311295272"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0910-1"", ""10.1108/JBIM-01-2018-0046"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2005.10.001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"
10.1186/s12910-021-00682-8,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Patients' and professionals' views related to ethical issues in precision medicine: a mixed research synthesis,"Abstract Background Precision medicine development is driven by the possibilities of next generation sequencing, information technology and artificial intelligence and thus, raises a number of ethical questions. Empirical studies have investigated such issues from the perspectives of health care professionals, researchers and patients. We synthesize the results from these studies in this review. Methods We used a systematic strategy to search, screen and assess the literature for eligibility related to our research question. The initial search for empirical studies in five data bases provided 665 different records and we selected 92 of these publications for inclusion in this review. Data were extracted in a spreadsheet and categorized into different topics representing the views on ethical issues in precision medicine. Results Many patients and professionals expect high benefits from precision medicine and have a positive attitude towards it. However, patients and professionals also perceive some risks. Commonly perceived risks include: lack of evidence for accuracy of tests and efficacy of treatments; limited knowledge of patients, which makes informed consent more difficult; possible unavailability of access to precision medicine for underprivileged people and ethnic minorities; misuse of data by insurance companies and employers, potential of racial stigmatization due to genetic information; unwanted communication of incidental findings; changes in doctor-patient-relationship through focusing on data; and the problem that patients could feel under pressure to optimize their health. Conclusions National legislation and guidelines already minimize many risks associated with precision medicine. However, from our perspective some problems require more attention. Should hopes for precision medicine’s benefits be fulfilled, then the ethical principle of justice would require an unlimited access to precision medicine for all people. The potential for autonomous patients’ decisions must be greatly enhanced by improvements in patient education. Harm from test results must be avoided in any case by the highest possible data security level and communication guidelines. Changes in the doctor-patient relationship and the impact of precision medicine on the quality of life should be further investigated. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of precision medicine should be further examined, in order to avoid malinvestment.","[{""name"": ""Anke Erdmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christoph Rehmann-Sutter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claudia Bozzaro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/nrg.2016.86"", ""10.12688/f1000research.20928.1"", ""10.1186/s12967-019-02174-1"", ""10.1038/clpt.2013.101"", ""10.1007/s10441-018-9330-2"", ""10.1017/S0266462315000082"", ""10.1111/bioe.12285"", ""10.1097/CCO.0000000000000247"", ""10.1007/s11060-017-2502-0"", ""10.1111/j.0264-3758.2004.00260.x"", ""10.1159/000319473"", ""10.1007/s00481-009-0025-8"", ""10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0268"", ""10.3747/co.21.1782"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000110"", ""10.1177/1357034X19886925"", ""10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0279"", ""10.1007/s40271-020-00411-0"", ""10.3390/jpm10010009(9)"", ""10.2217/pme-2016-0074"", ""10.2217/pme.09.43"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-11-5"", ""10.1177/0162243919845049"", ""10.1136/gutjnl-2016-313316"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030505"", ""10.1080/14636778.2017.1351873"", ""10.1038/gim.2016.16"", ""10.1002/jgc4.1101"", ""10.1038/gim.2017.157"", ""10.1515/cclm-2015-0171"", ""10.1331/JAPhA.2014.13041"", ""10.2217/pme-2016-0063"", ""10.2217/pme.10.47"", ""10.3349/ymj.2020.61.2.192"", ""10.1177/2050312120901740"", ""10.1111/j.0009-9163.2004.00253.x"", ""10.1007/s12687-017-0349-x"", ""10.1093/milmed/usz419"", ""10.2217/pme.14.48"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-14-20"", ""10.1007/s00481-013-0263-7"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0207842"", ""10.1159/000368034"", ""10.1111/1467-9566.12457"", ""10.1007/s12687-015-0259-8"", ""10.1007/s12687-018-0365-5"", ""10.1097/PPO.0000000000000319"", ""10.1200/JOP.2012.000626"", ""10.1007/s12687-016-0260-x"", ""10.1007/s10897-014-9803-7"", ""10.2217/pme.13.17"", ""10.1038/ejhg.2013.158"", ""10.1016/S0923-7534(20)33930-2"", ""10.1080/00365521.2018.1555280"", ""10.3390/jpm8030021"", ""10.1159/000189629"", ""10.1016/j.drugpo.2014.06.013"", ""10.1007/s12687-018-0399-8"", ""10.1038/s41436-019-0533-y"", ""10.1038/s41436-019-0486-1"", ""10.1186/s12913-017-2205-4"", ""10.1158/1538-7445.SABCS15-P6-04-13"", ""10.3889/oamjms.2019.322"", ""10.2217/pme-2016-0067"", ""10.3389/fgene.2019.01189"", ""10.1002/jgc4.1144"", ""10.1007/s11013-012-9303-x"", ""10.3390/jpm6020015"", ""10.1038/s41436-019-0579-x"", ""10.1002/mgg3.636"", ""10.1001/jama.299.11.1320"", ""10.1089/jayao.2017.0102"", ""10.1159/000242199"", ""10.1186/s12910-016-0111-7"", ""10.1159/000354785"", ""10.1080/15265161.2018.1431322"", ""10.1007/s10897-018-0291-z"", ""10.1159/000362359"", ""10.5455/jcme.20150408050414"", ""10.4018/IJEHMC.2016040103"", ""10.1007/s00761-016-0119-0"", ""10.3389/fgene.2020.00151"", ""10.3389/fgene.2020.00059"", ""10.32745/9783954663354"", ""10.1080/10810730.2017.1417514"", ""10.1080/15265161.2018.1431322"", ""10.1038/s41436-018-0032-6"", ""10.1177/1073110519840493"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012443"", ""10.1159/000448277"", ""10.1007/s00481-013-0268-2"", ""10.1200/JOP.2011.000448"", ""10.1016/j.tips.2016.11.007"", ""10.11606/S1518-8787.2018052000209"", ""10.1007/s00038-019-01298-x"", ""10.4324/9780203526118"", ""10.3390/healthcare8020133""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Medicine']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Physiology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"
10.1093/jlb/lsab023,JOURNAL OF LAW AND THE BIOSCIENCES,0101 Philosophy; 0301 Law,Patient data ownership: who owns your health?,"Abstract This article answers two questions from the perspective of United Kingdom law and policy: (i) is health information property? and (ii) should it be? We argue that special features of health information make it unsuitable for conferral of property rights without an extensive system of data-specific rules, like those that govern intellectual property. Additionally, we argue that even if an extensive set of rules were developed, the advantages of a property framework to govern health information would be slight: propertization is unlikely to enhance patient self-determination, increase market efficiency, provide patients a foothold in the data economy, clarify legal uses of information, or encourage data-driven innovation. The better approach is to rely less, not more, on property. We recommend a regulatory model with four signature features: (i) substantial protection for personal health data similar to the GDPR with transparent limits on how, when, and by whom patient data can be accessed, used, and transmitted; (ii) input from relevant stakeholders; (iii) interoperability; and (iv) greater research into a health-data service, rather than goods, model.","[{""name"": ""Kathleen Liddell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David A Simon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anneke Lucassen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Medicine']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

It sets forth a dignity-based argument for affording older people access to sex robots as part of reasonable efforts to support their central human capabilities at a floor level. The argument develops stepwise: (1) first, I dispel ageism and negative stereotypes about later-life sexuality, showing their deep historical roots in medicine and science; (2) second, I set forth a positive argument, grounded in capability accounts of justice, for deploying sex robots for older people with disabilities; (3) finally, after responding to objections, I conclude that sex robots are a reasonable way to support later-life sexuality for persons with disabilities. While often depicted as a product for younger, able-bodied people, this paper is a bid for reimagining sex robots as a product for older, disabled people.","[{""name"": ""Nancy S Jecker"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Bioethics and Humanities, University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, USA""]}]","[""10.1056/NEJMoa067423"", ""10.1111/jgs.15511"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa067423"", ""10.1017/S0144686X15001105"", ""10.1023/A:1015487101438"", ""10.1007/s10728-014-0287-2"", ""10.1093/ageing/afr049"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa067423"", ""10.1080/00224499.2015.1015713"", ""10.1176/appi.books.9781615371501.lr27"", ""10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1984.38.2.164"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60093-7"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262036689.003.0003"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262036689.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-39741-2"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061200"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190949075.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199559978.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810916"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511810916.004"", ""10.1075/ni.12.1.18jon"", ""10.1080/00221309.1934.9917714"", ""10.1093/geront/gnw183"", ""10.1111/j.1743-6109.2004.10106.x"", ""10.1016/j.urology.2004.06.055"", ""10.1080/14681994.2017.1397950"", ""10.1111/sjp.12183"", ""10.5771/9780585118918-1"", ""10.1093/oseo/instance.00258595"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0339-x"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2004.835366"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190652951.003.0008"", ""10.2307/2024152"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139171946"", ""10.1136/medethics-2011-100453"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262036689.001.0001"", ""10.1145/2874239.2874281"", ""10.1007/s12369-017-0413-z""]","['Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Social Psychology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

In this article, I analyze conspirituality—that is, the relationships between New Age spirituality and conspiracy theories—in Italy during the COVID-19 lockdown. After distinguishing between conspiracy-believing and belief in conspiracies, I claim that conspiracy-believing could be understood as an aesthetic (sensory and artistic) practice. In doing so, I offer a novel interpretation on conspiracism that complements current scholarship while departing from the latter’s focus on the cognitive and emotional weaknesses of those who adopt conspiracy theories. By engaging with the thought of Jacques Rancière, in conversation with studies on contemporary Paganism and Western esotericism, I consider the adoption of conspiracy theories as an expression of dissensus by a community of sense that does not look only for visibility but, rather, wants to be fully acknowledged, recognized, and legitimized in their “participatory”—or “magical”—way of inhabiting the world.","[{""name"": ""Giovanna Parmigiani"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard Divinity School and the Center for the Study of World Religions, Harvard University, 45 Francis avenue, Cambridge MA 01238, USA""]}]","[""10.1525/nr.2020.23.4.15"", ""10.1080/13537903.2015.1081339"", ""10.1525/california/9780520238053.001.0001"", ""10.7312/beli17316"", ""10.2307/j.ctv7r41wn"", ""10.1525/nr.2020.23.4.69"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190844073.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9780230349216"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190844073.003.0006"", ""10.5749/culturalcritique.87.2014.0167"", ""10.1163/9789004292468_018"", ""10.30674/scripta.67326"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2006.00241.x"", ""10.1163/9789004493995"", ""10.1163/9789004378933"", ""10.1215/9780822390978"", ""10.1525/si.2007.30.2.127"", ""10.1057/9781137342386"", ""10.9783/9780812202700"", ""10.1515/9781503620056"", ""10.1177/1461444814520872"", ""10.1080/08913811.2016.1178894"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190844073.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822390817"", ""10.1558/pome.37787"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190844073.003.0011"", ""10.1353/sub.2004.0012"", ""10.1163/9789004382022_002"", ""10.1111/spsr.12270"", ""10.5040/9798400686818"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190844073.001.0001"", ""10.3917/espri.1810.0115"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190844073.003.0003"", ""10.1080/13537903.2011.539846""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Philosophy', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1108/OTH-11-2019-0077,ON THE HORIZON,0101 Philosophy; 0401 Education,Human capital and entrepreneurial intentions: do entrepreneurship education and training provided by universities add value?,"Purpose In the context of conflicting results in the existing literature on the effectiveness of entrepreneurial education and training, this study aims to examine the effect of entrepreneurial training on perceived human capital and entrepreneurial intention of students. A deeper understanding of the effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs assumes significance, given the substantial policy support and budgetary spending on entrepreneurship education across the world, especially in emerging economies like India. Furthermore, the authors seek to examine if human capital mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial training and entrepreneurial intention. Design/methodology/approach In total, 330 final-year students who had undergone a mandatory course on “entrepreneurship and new venture planning” in various disciplines in science, technology and management were randomly selected as sample respondents. A self-administered and structured questionnaire that measured the attitude toward perceived effectiveness of entrepreneurial education and training, perceived human capital and the entrepreneurial intention was used to elicit responses. Findings Results revealed that entrepreneurial training and education are effective in eliciting an important student-level outcome of entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, the study found that human capital significantly mediates the aforementioned relationship. Based on these findings, it is suggested to further the focus of entrepreneurial training programs conducted in universities and thus foster entrepreneurial outcomes among students. Originality/value This study adds to the body of knowledge, by examining if entrepreneurial education and training provided by universities indeed yield positive results in terms of higher intentions to engage in entrepreneurial activities, with emphasis on a large developing economy like India. Entrepreneurship development is widely recognized as an effective tool for the socio-economic development of societies in developing countries. This study, by establishing the efficacy of entrepreneurship education in creating entrepreneurial intention among young students, endorses the policy focus and resource spending on entrepreneurship training and education. Also, this study is pioneering in examining the mediating role of human capital in the aforementioned relationship.","[{""name"": ""Nimitha Aboobaker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Renjini D."", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijme.2016.03.001"", ""10.1002/1520-6874(200005/06)42:3<285::AID-TIE2>3.0.CO;2-5"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00300.x"", ""10.1108/OTH-02-2019-0009"", ""10.1111/etap.12095"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.44.9.1175"", ""10.1177/1745691617699280"", ""10.1016/j.iedeen.2017.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2018.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.brq.2016.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2016.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.11.024"", ""10.1007/s11365-016-0388-5"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2011.05.013"", ""10.1108/JSBED-05-2017-0178"", ""10.1016/0883-9026(94)00037-U"", ""10.1108/14626000810871691"", ""10.1080/09585192.2015.1060511"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2014.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2015.03.001"", ""10.7763/JOEBM.2016.V4.375"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9353.2006.00297.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00318.x"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2012.03.002"", ""10.1111/etap.12136"", ""10.5465/amle.2015.0026"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2009.08.002"", ""10.1108/JIC-04-2017-0056"", ""10.1046/j.1540-6520.2003.00035.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.08.028"", ""10.1080/13594320701595438"", ""10.2307/3439676"", ""10.1080/10669868.2017.1306821"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2006.05.002"", ""10.5465/amj.2005.17407911"", ""10.1108/03090590910939049"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2009.09.004"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2010.02.015"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2015.10.003"", ""10.1016/S0166-4972(02)00016-0"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.90.6.1265""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"

In this paper, I present and assess two sets of arguments advanced in favour of ectogenesis: arguments stressing ectogenesis’ equality-promoting potential and arguments stressing its freedom-promoting potential. I argue that although successfully grounding a positive case for ectogenesis, these arguments have limitations in terms of their reach and scope. Concerning their limited reach, I contend that ectogenesis will likely benefit a small subset of women and, arguably, not the group who most need to achieve equality and freedom. Concerning their limited scope, I contend that these defences do not pay sufficient attention to the context in which ectogenesis would be developed and that, as a result, they risk leaving the status quo unchanged. After providing examples of these limitations, I move to my proposal concerning the role of ectogenesis in promoting women’s equality and freedom. This proposal builds on Silvia Federici’s, Mariarosa Dalla Costa’s and Selma James’ readings of the international feminist campaign ‘Wages for Housework’. It maintains that the political perspective and provocation that ectogenesis can advance should be considered and defended.","[{""name"": ""Giulia Cavaliere"", ""affiliation"": [""Medical School, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK""]}]","[""10.1163/9789401203456_005"", ""10.1038/nature17948"", ""10.1038/ncb3347"", ""10.1038/533169a"", ""10.1038/ncomms15112"", ""10.1093/medlaw/fwn016"", ""10.1057/9781137549877"", ""10.1017/S0963180107070405"", ""10.1017/S0963180111000521"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-2475-6_15"", ""10.1007/s11019-006-0005-4"", ""10.1163/9789401203456_009"", ""10.1163/9789401203456_011"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.1989.tb00592.x"", ""10.1007/s00737-012-0301-3"", ""10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2013.09.002"", ""10.1089/jwh.2013.4617"", ""10.1016/j.ajog.2013.11.039"", ""10.1097/GCO.0b013e32835e0ef5"", ""10.1787/1f3fd03f-en"", ""10.1093/jmp/jht046"", ""10.1016/j.ajog.2009.10.864"", ""10.1053/j.semperi.2011.09.011"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2005.072975"", ""10.1093/eurpub/ckq046"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69380-X"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00838-7"", ""10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.066"", ""10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.01.031"", ""10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.02.021"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-2475-6_10"", ""10.1038/466029a"", ""10.1515/9780822373216"", ""10.1163/9789401203456_012"", ""10.1136/medethics-2013-101810"", ""10.2307/1600134"", ""10.1007/s10728-016-0329-z"", ""10.1080/08164649.2016.1224078"", ""10.1215/9780822394723"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-104910""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7075), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6848)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7036), ('1001 基础医学', 0.6984)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

A Theoretical Investigation of a Tool Useful for Finding the Meaning of Life,"AbstractFor years, spirituality and finding the meaning of life have been considered essential phenomena in the context of human existence. Zohar introduced the termspiritual intelligence(SI) in 1997, and since that time researchers have been seeking to clarify the concept. Emmons (The psychology of ultimate concerns. Guilford Press, New York, 1999) suggested that SI serves as a potentially significant construct to expand our understanding of the psychological determinants of human functioning. In recent years, several efforts to conceptualize and measure this construct have joined the body of related literature, of which King (Brighter paths to wellbeing: an integrative model of human intelligence and health. Trent University Centre for Health Studies Showcase, pp 12–13, 2008) serves as one notable example. Following, evaluating, and summarizing the theoretical debate regarding the validity of a concept, as it is presented in the literature, has long been understood as a helpful way of extending scholarly dialogue. In this project, I review psychological literature relevant to the debate on the validity of SI as a psychological construct. The literature offers many examples that demonstrate a relation between SI and other phenomena that are important for human functioning—well-being in this. Results of the analysis support theoretical considerations for viewing SI as facilitating the ability to search for the meaning of life and provide directions for future study.","[{""name"": ""Katarzyna Skrzypińska"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.03.149"", ""10.5539/res.v8n2p210"", ""10.1207/s15327752jpa4901_13"", ""10.1207/S15327582IJPR1001_2"", ""10.1207/S15327582IJPR1001_6"", ""10.1177/002216786600600201"", ""10.1207/S15327582IJPR1001_3"", ""10.2307/1385677"", ""10.1177/0269881108094300"", ""10.2307/1384454"", ""10.4236/jss.2014.28024"", ""10.24972/ijts.2009.28.1.68"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.06.558"", ""10.1515/ngoe-2016-0012"", ""10.1111/1467-6494.t01-1-00094"", ""10.1080/14766080903069364"", ""10.1207/S15327582IJPR1001_5"", ""10.1007/s10943-017-0360-x"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.46.3.598"", ""10.1111/1467-6494.00080"", ""10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00001-4"", ""10.1163/15736121-12341293"", ""10.1007/s10943-016-0334-4"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.53.1.80"", ""10.1108/02683940210423114""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Demography', 'Health']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)]]"
10.1093/jlb/lsaa075,JOURNAL OF LAW AND THE BIOSCIENCES,0101 Philosophy; 0301 Law,Data privacy considerations for telehealth consumers amid COVID-19,"Abstract The COVID-19 emergency poses particularly high infection risks in a clinical setting, where patients and health care providers are placed in the same room. Due to these risks, patients are encouraged to avoid clinics and instead use Telemedicine for safer consultations and diagnoses. In March, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a notice titled Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehealth Remote Communications During the COVID-19 Nationwide Public Health Emergency (the ‘Notification’). The Notification relaxes the enforcement of privacy and security safeguards established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) until further notice, in order to facilitate the transition to telehealth services for the broader purpose of promoting public health during the pandemic. Specifically, covered healthcare providers can use telehealth to provide all services that, in their professional judgment, they believe can be provided through telehealth. If providers make good faith efforts to provide the most timely and accessible care possible, they will not be subject to penalties for breaching the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. This paper examines the implications of the Notification on patients’ health information privacy. It recommends that patients should undertake a careful reading of provider privacy policies to make sure their protected health information (PHI) is not at risk before switching to telehealth consultation. Acknowledging the limitations of patient self-protection from bad privacy practices when in need for medical treatment during pandemic, the paper proposes that consumers’ data privacy should be protected through one of two alternative regulatory interventions: the FTC’s authority under §5, or HIPAA’s business associates agreements.","[{""name"": ""Sharon Bassan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Law, Depaul University, Chicago, IL, USA""]}]",[],['Health Professions'],['Pharmacy'],"[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)]]"

How can we make the predictions of complex statistical models more intelligible to end users? A subdiscipline of computer science known as interpretable machine learning (IML) has emerged to address this urgent question. Numerous influential methods have been proposed, from local linear approximations to rule lists and counterfactuals. In this article, I highlight three conceptual challenges that are largely overlooked by authors in this area. I argue that the vast majority of IML algorithms are plagued by (1) ambiguity with respect to their true target; (2) a disregard for error rates and severe testing; and (3) an emphasis on product over process. Each point is developed at length, drawing on relevant debates in epistemology and philosophy of science. Examples and counterexamples from IML are considered, demonstrating how failure to acknowledge these problems can result in counterintuitive and potentially misleading explanations. Without greater care for the conceptual foundations of IML, future work in this area is doomed to repeat the same mistakes.","[{""name"": ""David S.

Insights from Ethics and Economics,"AbstractIn recent years, business ethics and economic scholars have been paying greater attention to the development of commons organizing. The latter refers to the processes by which communities of people work in common in the pursuit of the common good. In turn, this promotes commons organizational designs based on collective forms of common goods production, distribution, management and ownership. In this paper, we build on two main literature streams: (1) the ethical approach based on the theory of the common good of the firm in virtue ethics and (2) the economic approach based on the theory of institutions for collective action developed by Ostrom’s research on common-pool resources to avert the tragedy of the commons. The latter expands to include the novel concepts of new commons, “commoning” and polycentric governance. Drawing on the analysis of what is new in these forms of organizing, we propose a comprehensive model, highlighting the integration of two sets of organizing principles—common good and collective action – and five problem-solving processes to explain the main dimensions of commons organizing. We contribute to business ethics literature by exploring the convergence between the ethical and economic approaches in the development of a commons organizing view.","[{""name"": ""Laura Albareda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alejo Jose G.

10.1111/phpr.12673,PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH,0101 Philosophy,Can Pragmatists Be Moderate?,"AbstractIn discussions of whether and how pragmatic considerations can make a difference to what one ought to believe, two sets of cases feature. The first set, which dominates the debate about pragmatic reasons for belief, is exemplified by cases of being financially bribed to believe (or withhold from believing) something. The second set, which dominates the debate about pragmatic encroachment on epistemic justification, is exemplified by cases where acting on a belief rashly risks some disastrous outcome if the belief turns out to be false. Call those who think that pragmatic considerations make a difference to what one ought to believe in the second kind of case, but not in the first, ‘moderate pragmatists’. Many philosophers – in particular, most advocates of pragmatic and moral encroachment – are moderate pragmatists. But moderate pragmatists owe us an explanation of exactly why the second kind of pragmatic consideration makes a difference, but the first kind doesn’t. I argue that the most promising of these explanations all fail: they are either theoretically undermotivated, or get key cases wrong, or both. Moderate pragmatism may be an unstable stopping point between a more extreme pragmatism, on one hand, and an uncompromising anti‐pragmatism on the other.","[{""name"": ""Alex Worsnip"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198833314.003.0010"", ""10.1111/phis.12137"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1137-0"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198798705.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phib.12140"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-1809-5"", ""10.1111/papa.12000"", ""10.1215/00318108-111-1-67"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199550623.001.0001"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674334236"", ""10.1111/papq.12203"", ""10.1007/s11098-019-01359-0"", ""10.1007/s11098-007-9133-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95993-1_11"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9801-7"", ""10.5840/jphil20081051022"", ""10.1002/tht3.193"", ""10.1002/tht3.7"", ""10.1093/pq/pqz006"", ""10.1086/700029"", ""10.1093/arisoc/aoy007"", ""10.1111/phis.12150"", ""10.4324/9780203464601"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00768.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-006-0007-3"", ""10.1007/s11098-008-9222-4"", ""10.1111/1468-0068.00442"", ""10.1111/phpr.12229"", ""10.1111/nous.12253"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00552.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9718-1"", ""10.1086/664753"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184617"", ""10.1111/nous.12254"", ""10.1093/0199288038.001.0001"", ""10.2307/1191633"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2005.00068.x"", ""10.5840/logos-episteme2011248"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199693702.003.0004"", ""10.1111/phpr.12088"", ""10.1111/papq.12075"", ""10.1080/00048402.2015.1084343""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended as the model for decision-making in such preference-sensitive decisions. The aim of SDM is to come to decisions that are consistent with the patient’s values and preferences and made by the patient and healthcare professional working together. In clinical practice, however, SDM appears to be not yet routine and needs further implementation. A shift from a biomedical to a person-centered conception might help to make the process more shared. Shared should, therefore, be interpreted as two persons bringing two perspectives to the table, that both need to be explored during the decision-making process. Starting from the patient’s perspective will enable to determine the mutual goals of care first and, subsequently, determine the best way for achieving those goals. To perform such SDM, the healthcare professional needs to become a skilled companion, being part of the patient’s relational context, and start asking the right questions about what matters to the patient as person.

10.1215/00318108-7890455,PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW,0101 Philosophy,An Epistemic Nonconsequentialism,"Despite the recent backlash against epistemic consequentialism, an explicit systematic alternative has yet to emerge. This article articulates and defends a novel alternative, Epistemic Kantianism, which rests on a requirement of respect for the truth. Section 1 tackles some preliminaries concerning the proper formulation of the epistemic consequentialism/nonconsequentialism divide, explains where Epistemic Kantianism falls in the dialectical landscape, and shows how it can capture what seems attractive about epistemic consequentialism while yielding predictions that are harder for the latter to secure in a principled way. Section 2 presents Epistemic Kantianism. Section 3 argues that it is uniquely poised to satisfy the desiderata set out in section 1 on an ideal theory of epistemic justification. Section 4 gives three further arguments, suggesting that it (1) best explains the normative significance of the subject's perspective in epistemology, (2) follows from the kind of axiology needed to solve the swamping problem together with modest assumptions about the relation between the evaluative and the deontic, and (3) illuminates certain asymmetries in epistemic value and obligation. Section 5 takes stock and reassesses the score in the debate.","[{""name"": ""Kurt L.

In this debate, there is, however, much confusion about the content of such values. This paper looks at a fundamental debate in ethics about a third category of reasons besides reasons from morality and self-interest, labelled as reasons of love, care or meaningfulness. This category allows us, first, to see the relation between relational and eudaimonic values, and, second, to make clear and applicable distinctions between the relational valuing of nature and moral or instrumental valuing.","[{""name"": ""Stijn Neuteleers"", ""affiliation"": [""BIOGOV, Centre for Philosophy of Law UCL – University of Louvain Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium""]}]","[""10.1017/S0266267100001218"", ""10.5751/ES-09812-220443"", ""10.1080/09640568.2017.1342612"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2005.12.005"", ""10.1073/pnas.1525002113"", ""10.1525/bio.2012.62.8.7"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2014.11.002"", ""10.1126/science.aap8826"", ""10.1007/BF00484902"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7rqh3"", ""10.1086/512172"", ""10.5040/9781474236607"", ""10.1163/15406253-03201002"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-2825-7_3"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.06.008"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0183962"", ""10.3197/096327111X13077055166063"", ""10.5840/bjp2016813"", ""10.5840/monist19927527"", ""10.1515/auk-2006-0203"", ""10.4324/9780203495452"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2016.12.006"", ""10.4159/9780674042582"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139165860"", ""10.2307/2026228""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

Some critics use the label “woke” when CSIs are perceived as inconsistent with the firm’s purpose. Other critics use the label “woke washing” when CSIs are perceived as inconsistent with the firm’s practices or values. I will argue that this derogatory use of woke is stigmatizing, leads to claims of hypocrisy, and can cause stakeholder backlash. I connect this process to our own field by considering inconsistencies in our organizations and in our teaching that could garner similar criticisms. After describing the stigmatization process, I consider the moral implications of inconsistencies for CSIs and draw parallels to our field. I end by suggesting next steps for our field in response to the stigmatization of CSIs and to guard against the stigmatization of our own work.","[{""name"": ""Danielle E.

They then describe what the current science—including genomewide association studies and polygenic indexes—can and cannot tell us, as well as its risks and potential benefits. They conclude with a discussion of responsible behavior in the context of SBG research. SBG research that compares individuals within a group according to a “sensitive” phenotype requires extra attention to responsible conduct and to responsible communication about the research and its findings. SBG research (1) on sensitive phenotypes that (2) compares two or more groups defined by (a) race, (b) ethnicity, or (c) genetic ancestry (where genetic ancestry could easily be misunderstood as race or ethnicity) requires a compelling justification to be conducted, funded, or published. All authors agree that this justification at least requires a convincing argument that a study's design could yield scientifically valid results; some authors would additionally require the study to have a socially favorable risk‐benefit profile.","[{""name"": ""Michelle N.

10.1017/beq.2021.3,BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Why a Right to an Explanation of Algorithmic Decision-Making Should Exist: A Trust-Based Approach,"Businesses increasingly rely on algorithms that are data-trained sets of decision rules (i.e., the output of the processes often called “machine learning”) and implement decisions with little or no human intermediation. In this article, we provide a philosophical foundation for the claim that algorithmic decision-making gives rise to a “right to explanation.” It is often said that, in the digital era, informed consent is dead. This negative view originates from a rigid understanding that presumes informed consent is a static and complete transaction. Such a view is insufficient, especially when data are used in a secondary, noncontextual, and unpredictable manner—which is the inescapable nature of advanced artificial intelligence systems. We submit that an alternative view of informed consent—as an assurance of trust for incomplete transactions—allows for an understanding of why the rationale of informed consent already entails a right to ex post explanation.","[{""name"": ""Tae Wan Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bryan R.

10.1111/phpr.12823,PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH,0101 Philosophy,Transparency is Surveillance,"AbstractIn herBBC Reith Lectures on Trust, Onora O’Neill offers a short, but biting, criticism of transparency. People think that trust and transparency go together but in reality, says O'Neill, they are deeply opposed. Transparency forces people to conceal their actual reasons for action and invent different ones for public consumption. Transparency forces deception. I work out the details of her argument and worsen her conclusion. I focus on public transparency – that is, transparency to the public over expert domains. I offer two versions of the criticism. First, theepistemic intrusionargument: The drive to transparency forces experts to explain their reasoning to non‐experts. But expert reasons are, by their nature, often inaccessible to non‐experts. So the demand for transparency can pressure experts to act only in those ways for which they can offer public justification. Second, theintimate reasonsargument: In many cases of practical deliberation, the relevant reasons are intimate to a community and not easily explicable to those who lack a particular shared background. The demand for transparency, then, pressures community members to abandon the special understanding and sensitivity that arises from their particular experiences. Transparency, it turns out, is a form of surveillance. By forcing reasoning into the explicit and public sphere, transparency roots out corruption — but it also inhibits the full application of expert skill, sensitivity, and subtle shared understandings. The difficulty here arises from the basic fact that human knowledge vastly outstrips any individual’s capacities. We all depend on experts, which makes us vulnerable to their biases and corruption. But if we try to wholly secure our trust — if we leash groups of experts to pursuing only the goals and taking only the actions that can be justified to the non‐expert public — then we will undermine their expertise. We need both trust and transparency, but they are in essential tension. This is a deep practical dilemma; it admits of no neat resolution, but only painful compromise.","[{""name"": ""C.

10.1186/s13010-022-00126-0,PHILOSOPHY ETHICS AND HUMANITIES IN MEDICINE,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0101 Philosophy,The severity of moral distress in nurses: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Moral distress is one of the most important problems that nurses face in their care of patients. Various studies have reported the frequency and severity of moral distress in nurses. However, to date, a comprehensive study that shows the results of these research across the world was not found, therefore due to the importance of this issue, its role in the health of nurses and patients, and the lack of general statistics about it worldwide, the present study was conducted to determine the frequency and severity of moral distress in nurses through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods In this review study, searching national and international databases of SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IranDoc, Google Scholar, Embase, ScienceDirect, Scopus, CINHAL, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS) between 2005 and February 2020 were extracted. The random-effects model was used for analysis, and the heterogeneity of studies with the I2 index was investigated. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Version 2). Results The frequency of moral distress in 9 articles with a sample size of 1576 persons was 1.7 ± 0.5 from (0–4), in 13 articles with a sample size of 1870 persons, 3.07 ± 0.1 from (0–5), in 6 articles with a sample size of 1316 persons, 3.2 ± 0.29 from (0–6), in 18 articles with a sample size of 1959 persons, 4.6 ± 0.518 from (1–7) and in 35 articles with a sample size of 3718 persons, 81.1 ± 4.6 from (216–30), and the severity of moral distress in 4 articles with a sample size of 1116 persons, 1.7 ± 0.37 from (0–4), in 5 articles with a sample size of 1282 persons, 2.6 ± 0.28 from (0–5), in 5 articles with a sample size of 944 persons, 3.9 ± 0.63 from (0–6) and in 8 articles with a sample size of 901 persons was 82.3 ± 5.4 (0–216). Conclusion The results of this study showed that the frequency and severity of moral distress in nurses are high and are a serious problem in nurses. Therefore, policymakers in this field should consider its role in the health of nurses and patients.","[{""name"": ""Nader Salari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shamarina Shohaimi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Behnam Khaledi-Paveh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohsen Kazeminia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammad-Rafi Bazrafshan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Masoud Mohammadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3912/OJIN.Vol16No02PPT03"", ""10.1207/s15327019eb1503_1"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2834.2007.00798.x"", ""10.1097/DCC.0b013e31822fab2a"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6198.1987.tb00794.x"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2001.01658.x"", ""10.1097/01.DCC.0000338871.77658.03"", ""10.1097/TME.0000000000000100"", ""10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181577511"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2001.01658.x"", ""10.1191/0969733005ne809oa"", ""10.4037/ajcc2015418"", ""10.1186/s12912-017-0270-y"", ""10.1177/0969733013513216"", ""10.1016/j.jen.2012.12.009"", ""10.1016/j.jamda.2010.12.014"", ""10.1177/0969733009106649"", ""10.1111/jnu.12536"", ""10.11111/jkana.2019.25.1.42"", ""10.1016/j.iccn.2016.04.003"", ""10.1111/inm.12000"", ""10.1177/0969733010379178"", ""10.1177/0969733007075870"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2015.10.007"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05897.x"", ""10.1097/DCC.0000000000000403"", ""10.1177/0969733018766576"", ""10.1590/S0080-623420140000300019"", ""10.1097/DCC.0000000000000056"", ""10.4037/ajcc2013437"", ""10.4037/ajcc2005.14.6.523"", ""10.12968/ijpn.2018.24.9.444"", ""10.1111/jonm.12699"", ""10.1177/0969733018779210"", ""10.1177/0969733017722824"", ""10.1177/0969733017712083"", ""10.1111/wvn.12213"", ""10.1177/0969733016650993"", ""10.1097/TME.0000000000000100"", ""10.1177/0969733015604700"", ""10.1177/0969733015593408"", ""10.1177/0969733014542679"", ""10.1177/0969733012452882"", ""10.4037/ajcc2012205"", ""10.1097/TME.0000000000000060"", ""10.1097/01.CCM.0000254722.50608.2D"", ""10.1177/0969733018806342"", ""10.1177/0969733014551595"", ""10.1097/ANC.0000000000000100"", ""10.5812/ijpbs.10606"", ""10.1097/BCR.0b013e31828c7397"", ""10.1177/0969733013505312"", ""10.1177/0969733014534874"", ""10.1590/0104-1169.3102.2393"", ""10.1590/S0080-62342013000200033"", ""10.1016/j.jcrc.2015.10.011"", ""10.12968/bjon.2016.25.3.156"", ""10.1007/s10730-005-4949-1"", ""10.1891/0730-0832.27.2.101"", ""10.1007/s11019-007-9083-1"", ""10.1111/nup.12104""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Pharmacy', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The womb was perceived as dangerous and an object which husbands, doctors and the state had a legitimate interest in controlling. In this article, we consider how notions of conflict surrounding the womb have endured over time. We demonstrate how concerns seemingly generated by the invisibility of reproduction and the inaccessibility of the womb have translated into similar arguments for controlling women, as technology increases the accessibility of the female body and the womb. Developments in reproductive medicine, from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to surrogacy, have enabled women and men who would otherwise have been childless to become parents. Uterus transplants and ‘artificial wombs’ could provide additional alternatives to natural gestation. An era of ‘womb technology’ dawns. Some argue that such technology providing an alternative to ‘natural’ gestation could be a source of liberation for female persons because reproduction will no longer be something necessarily confined to the female body. ‘Womb technology’, however, also has the potential to exacerbate the labelling of the female body as a source of danger and an ‘imperfect’ site of gestation, thus replaying rudimentary and regressive arguments about controlling female behaviour. We argue that pernicious narratives about control, conflict and the womb must be addressed in the face of these technological developments.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth Chloe Romanis"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Social Ethics and Policy, Department of Law, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Dunja Begović"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Social Ethics and Policy, Department of Law, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Margot R Brazier"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Social Ethics and Policy, Department of Law, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Alexandra Katherine Mullock"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Social Ethics and Policy, Department of Law, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK""]}]","[""10.11647/OBP.0048"", ""10.1080/17579961.2015.1106104"", ""10.9783/9780812202083"", ""10.1503/cmaj.131450"", ""10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2013.10.005"", ""10.1053/j.sempedsurg.2012.10.003"", ""10.1080/15265160802331678"", ""10.5040/9798216036593"", ""10.2307/3177802"", ""10.2307/3562716"", ""10.1002/pd.5267"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6661(199605/06)5:3<115::AID-MFM3>3.0.CO;2-P"", ""10.1016/S1084-2756(98)80078-X"", ""10.2307/3178404"", ""10.1007/BF02408388"", ""10.1186/s12884-019-2277-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511545566.017"", ""10.1002/9781444307818.ch15"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511544729.016"", ""10.1542/pir.33-1-33"", ""10.1007/s10728-018-0364-z"", ""10.1016/S0029-7844(00)01021-8"", ""10.1111/bioe.12238"", ""10.1007/s00432-002-0406-6"", ""10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70137-0"", ""10.1016/S0301-2115(99)00166-9"", ""10.1016/S0146-0005(98)80033-5"", ""10.1097/01.OGX.0000071485.75220.AE"", ""10.4172/2376-127X.1000251"", ""10.2307/1409958"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199545520.003.0017"", ""10.1136/bmj.4.5575.352-a"", ""10.1177/096466390000900401"", ""10.1007/s10728-019-00370-0"", ""10.1215/03616878-1966324"", ""10.1111/bioe.12717"", ""10.1093/mind/fzy087"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105592"", ""10.1186/1742-4755-8-7"", ""10.1155/2013/159542"", ""10.1177/1536504217714259"", ""10.1016/S0146-0005(05)80044-8"", ""10.1038/sj.jp.7210933"", ""10.1038/s41467-016-0009-6"", ""10.1016/j.ajog.2017.05.046"", ""10.1017/S0963180108090130"", ""10.1057/9781137549877"", ""10.1017/S0963180111000521"", ""10.1093/medlaw/fwz037"", ""10.1093/medlaw/fwn016"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105691"", ""10.1007/978-3-476-04967-4_6"", ""10.1080/08164649.2016.1224078"", ""10.1080/15265161.2012.673689"", ""10.1163/9789401203456_011"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105968"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105495"", ""10.1111/bioe.12512"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105676"", ""10.1163/9789401203456_009"", ""10.1007/s11948-004-0042-4"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-104910"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-2475-6_16"", ""10.1111/1471-0528.15438"", ""10.1163/9789401203456_010"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-42200-4_10"", ""10.1093/medlaw/fws041""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Transplantation', 'Reproductive Medicine', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1001 基础医学', 0.7017), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7007)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7036), ('1001 基础医学', 0.6984)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1017/can.2020.27,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy,"On Predicting Recidivism: Epistemic Risk, Tradeoffs, and Values in Machine Learning","AbstractRecent scholarship in philosophy of science and technology has shown that scientific and technological decision making are laden with values, including values of a social, political, and/or ethical character. This paper examines the role of value judgments in the design of machine-learning (ML) systems generally and in recidivism-prediction algorithms specifically. Drawing on work on inductive and epistemic risk, the paper argues that ML systems are value laden in ways similar to human decision making, because the development and design of ML systems requires human decisions that involve tradeoffs that reflect values. In many cases, these decisions have significant—and, in some cases, disparate—downstream impacts on human lives. After examining an influential court decision regarding the use of proprietary recidivism-prediction algorithms in criminal sentencing,Wisconsin v. Loomis, the paper provides three recommendations for the use of ML in penal systems.","[{""name"": ""Justin B.

Smart home health technologies (SHHTs) are promoted and implemented as a possible solution from an economic and practical perspective. However, ethical considerations are equally important and need to be investigated.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines to investigate if and how ethical questions are discussed in the field of SHHTs in caregiving for older persons.Results156 peer-reviewed articles published in English, German and French were retrieved and analyzed across 10 electronic databases. Using narrative analysis, 7 ethical categories were mapped: privacy, autonomy, responsibility, human vs. artificial interactions, trust, ageism and stigma, and other concerns.ConclusionThe findings of our systematic review show the (lack of) ethical consideration when it comes to the development and implementation of SHHTs for older persons. Our analysis is useful to promote careful ethical consideration when carrying out technology development, research and deployment to care for older persons.RegistrationWe registered our systematic review in the PROSPERO network under CRD42021248543.","[{""name"": ""Nadine Andrea Felber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yi Jiao Tian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Félix Pageau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernice Simone Elger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tenzin Wangmo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/ijerph17186451"", ""10.17011/ht/urn.201611174654"", ""10.1111/hsc.12647"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02060.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-33330-0_3"", ""10.1017/S0266462307080154"", ""10.1023/A:1011402102030"", ""10.1055/s-0038-1638580"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.04.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57348-9_22"", ""10.1186/s12889-017-4200-4"", ""10.1007/s10676-016-9413-1"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2017.04.008"", ""10.1186/1472-6947-13-42"", ""10.1177/1533317520906686"", ""10.3928/19404921-20081001-01"", ""10.1177/1533317514539724"", ""10.2196/24157"", ""10.1080/02763890802665049"", ""10.1186/s12877-020-01764-9"", ""10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02959.x"", ""10.1080/17483107.2020.1753831"", ""10.1007/s10111-018-0512-0"", ""10.1017/S1041610214000088"", ""10.1080/10400435.2017.1402390"", ""10.3928/02793695-20160620-02"", ""10.1111/opn.12127"", ""10.1007/s12369-019-00529-8"", ""10.3928/00989134-20200605-06"", ""10.1016/j.irbm.2018.04.002"", ""10.1155/2016/8569602"", ""10.1258/135763307782215325"", ""10.1007/s12126-010-9073-0"", ""10.1258/135763307780096195"", ""10.1017/S0144686X1700006X"", ""10.2174/1874434601711010054"", ""10.1038/s41582-019-0188-y"", ""10.1007/s10730-015-9278-4"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.03.005"", ""10.1136/medethics-2016-103603"", ""10.1024/1012-5302/a000709"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2017.2729594"", ""10.3928/00989134-20190531-01"", ""10.1177/1471301204045165"", ""10.1007/s00391-017-1346-8"", ""10.17011/ht/urn.201611174654"", ""10.4017/gt.2020.19.1.008.00"", ""10.1007/s00391-017-1345-9"", ""10.1007/s10676-019-09524-z"", ""10.1186/s12913-020-05191-9"", ""10.1007/s10514-016-9598-5"", ""10.2196/11516"", ""10.1080/15228835.2013.814557"", ""10.1177/153331750401900209"", ""10.1017/S1041610216001435"", ""10.1007/s12369-013-0218-7"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2019.101940"", ""10.1007/s12369-015-0322-y"", ""10.1016/j.alter.2009.01.004"", ""10.1007/s10846-019-01028-8"", ""10.1177/0164027511427546"", ""10.1109/MIC.2005.109"", ""10.2147/JMDH.S219458"", ""10.3233/THC-2009-0537"", ""10.1016/j.cogsys.2019.03.019"", ""10.1080/14473828.2017.1302156"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101318"", ""10.1007/s10728-011-0199-3"", ""10.3389/fneur.2017.00228"", ""10.1111/jgs.16217"", ""10.1258/jtt.2009.090107"", ""10.1007/s12193-013-0118-z"", ""10.2196/16854"", ""10.1089/tmj.2017.0322"", ""10.1080/14427591.2020.1758200"", ""10.1080/1683478X.2017.1406576"", ""10.1155/2012/401705"", ""10.1080/10447318.2020.1736809"", ""10.5898/JHRI.1.2.Torta"", ""10.1111/j.1440-1800.2011.00582.x"", ""10.1111/opn.12428"", ""10.1007/s11948-009-9189-3"", ""10.1016/j.jemep.2021.100635"", ""10.1007/s00134-020-06112-4"", ""10.1111/bioe.12350"", ""10.1055/s-0038-1641216"", ""10.4414/smw.2020.20332"", ""10.1038/s41591-018-0272-7"", ""10.1055/s-2004-815581"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9234-6"", ""10.1007/s11948-021-00286-w"", ""10.1093/gigascience/giz076"", ""10.4017/gt.2018.17.3.002.00"", ""10.1186/s12877-021-02338-z"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0437-z"", ""10.1186/s12877-018-0925-x"", ""10.1186/s12877-019-1169-0"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0242929"", ""10.3390/medicina56060257"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2702.2003.00754.x"", ""10.1159/000496063"", ""10.1007/s11019-021-10054-z"", ""10.1007/s11948-017-9976-1"", ""10.1111/jonm.13521"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30197-9"", ""10.1186/s12960-020-00469-9"", ""10.3109/17483107.2015.1087061"", ""10.2196/13216"", ""10.1177/1357633X16674087"", ""10.1093/geronb/gbaa043"", ""10.1080/110381202753505818"", ""10.1007/s10676-011-9276-4"", ""10.1080/13607863.2010.543662"", ""10.1080/10810730.2020.1846641"", ""10.1017/S1478951509990514"", ""10.1017/S1041610218000200"", ""10.3390/ijerph17082953"", ""10.1111/nin.12419"", ""10.1111/bioe.12891"", ""10.1177/0969733016664971"", ""10.2196/39335""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Demography', 'Applied Psychology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)]]"

We propose that this body greatly conditioned the structural domains of the Cantabrian–Pyrenean fold-and-thrust belt during their evolution from hyperextension in Early Cretaceous times to shortening and inversion during the Cenozoic. This may be seen as a new line for cross-section construction and balancing, because previous cross-sections do not incorporate comparable volumes of exhumed mantle. Five structural cross-sections, constrained by the results of 3D gravity inversion, feed our discussion of the complexities of the doubly vergent Pyrenean orogen in view of the inversion of a precursor hyperextended rifted margin. In all sections, crustal rocks underthrust the lithospheric mantle in the hyperextended region, supporting that the near-surface exhumed mantle lithosphere acts as a more rigid buttress, allowing weaker continental material to be expelled outwards and upwards by thrusting during the Alpine collision; thus giving rise to two uplifted crustal triangular zones at the boundaries with the exhumed mantle. Contractional slip is localized in lithospheric-scale thrusts, which in turn reactivate parts of the extensional system. The NE–SW transfer zones that offset the rift therefore behave as compartmental faults during the orogenic phase. The amount of shortening increases from 34 km in the Cantabrian Cordillera, where the Basque–Cantabrian Basin partially preserves its original extensional geometry, to 135 km in the nappe stack of the central Pyrenees.","[{""name"": ""Jesús García-Senz"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Antonio Pedrera"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Conxi Ayala"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain"", ""Present address: Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera (IJCJA-CSIC), Carrer Lluís Solé i Sabaris s/n, 08028 Barcelona, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Ana Ruiz-Constán"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Alejandro Robador"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Luis Roberto Rodríguez-Fernández"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511524851.031"", ""10.1002/2017TC004670"", ""10.1080/17445647.2015.1126538"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.S7-XVIII.6.1725"", ""10.1002/2015TC004019"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0675:MMFSCT>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1029/1999JB900390"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.251"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(86)90254-4"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(80)90166-1"", ""10.1306/M46497C23"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2004.02.013"", ""10.1111/bre.12187"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00019-7"", ""10.3989/egeol.85415-6720"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2012.04.018"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.07.009"", ""10.1007/s00531-015-1177-z"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00087-3"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(96)00123-9"", ""10.1130/GES01363.1"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-27889-x"", ""10.1146/annurev.ea.20.050192.001043"", ""10.1029/TC008i001p00023"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(73)90041-1"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2003.208.01.11"", ""10.1002/2013TC003471"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0715:LBACOS>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1029/TC008i005p01051"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-78849-9_15"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.273"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.287"", ""10.1002/2014TC003816"", ""10.1038/331508a0"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029<1023:SOSSPI>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1029/1999JB900321"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2010.06.020"", ""10.1016/B978-044452748-6/00097-3"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2015.10.020"", ""10.1029/2008TC002406"", ""10.1029/2010GC003218"", ""10.1306/12090909116"", ""10.1111/ter.12087"", ""10.1029/2009TC002588"", ""10.1144/jgs2016-002"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111<1808:COTGOF>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.06.017"", ""10.1007/s00531-002-0283-x"", ""10.1007/s00531-014-1023-8"", ""10.1130/G20565.1"", ""10.1111/ter.12104"", ""10.2973/dsdp.proc.48.154.1979"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_21"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(86)90058-1"", ""10.1111/ter.12240"", ""10.1029/2001JB000549"", ""10.1029/2001JB001667"", ""10.1029/2007JB005021"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.018"", ""10.1002/2017TC004716"", ""10.1029/2018TC005222"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.1995.tb06436.x"", ""10.1080/17445647.2015.1084545"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_22"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(96)00114-X"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.08.046"", ""10.1038/nature09520"", ""10.1029/2010TC002735"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2015.12.005"", ""10.1029/TC008i001p00041"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2017.07.008"", ""10.1029/2003JB002514"", ""10.1029/2005JB003856"", ""10.1144/0016-76492010-072"", ""10.1029/JZ064i001p00049"", ""10.1002/tect.20019"", ""10.1144/gsjgs.153.2.0301"", ""10.1029/98TC00561"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2015.10.010"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2018.01.009"", ""10.1016/0031-9201(90)90082-9"", ""10.1002/2014TC003529"", ""10.1046/j.0956-540x.2001.01393.x"", ""10.1016/0264-8172(95)98854-X"", ""10.1306/M46497C9"", ""10.4095/208180"", ""10.1130/G37812.1"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(75)90151-X"", ""10.1190/1.1442298"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00017-3""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

Non-planarity of faults can be caused by variations in failure modes, which in turn are dictated by mechanical stratigraphy interacting with the ambient stress field, as well as by linkage of fault segments. Different portions of a fault or fault zone may experience volume gain, volume conservation and volume loss simultaneously depending on the position along a fault's surface, the stresses resolved on the fault and the associated deformation mechanisms. This variation in deformation style and associated volume change has a profound effect on the ability of a fault to transmit (or impede) fluid both along and across the fault. In this paper we explore interrelated concepts of failure mode and resolved stress analysis, and provide examples of fault geometry in normal faulting and reverse faulting stress regimes that illustrate the effects of fault geometry on failure behaviour and related importance to fluid transmission.

Despite their success, the strategies upon which NNs make decisions are hard to decipher, which prevents scientists from interpreting and building trust in the NN predictions; a highly desired and necessary condition for the further use and exploitation of NNs’ potential. Thus, a variety of methods have been recently introduced with the aim of attributing the NN predictions to specific features in the input space and explaining their strategy. The so-called eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is already seeing great application in a plethora of fields, offering promising results and insights about the decision strategies of NNs. Here, we provide an overview of the most recent work from our group, applying XAI to meteorology and climate science. Specifically, we present results from satellite applications that include weather phenomena identification and image to image translation, applications to climate prediction at subseasonal to decadal timescales, and detection of forced climatic changes and anthropogenic footprint. We also summarize a recently introduced synthetic benchmark dataset that can be used to improve our understanding of different XAI methods and introduce objectivity into the assessment of their fidelity. With this overview, we aim to illustrate how gaining accurate insights about the NN decision strategy can help climate scientists and meteorologists improve practices in fine-tuning model architectures, calibrating trust in climate and weather prediction and attribution, and learning new science.","[{""name"": ""Antonios Mamalakis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Imme Ebert-Uphoff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth A.

10.1093/jlb/lsaa010,JOURNAL OF LAW AND THE BIOSCIENCES,0101 Philosophy; 0301 Law,Data protection and ethics requirements for multisite research with health data: a comparative examination of legislative governance frameworks and the role of data protection technologies,"Abstract Personalised medicine can improve both public and individual health by providing targeted preventative and therapeutic healthcare. However, patient health data must be shared between institutions and across jurisdictions for the benefits of personalised medicine to be realised. Whilst data protection, privacy, and research ethics laws protect patient confidentiality and safety they also may impede multisite research, particularly across jurisdictions. Accordingly, we compare the concept of data accessibility in data protection and research ethics laws across seven jurisdictions. These jurisdictions include Switzerland, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom (which have implemented the General Data Protection Regulation), the United States, Canada, and Australia. Our paper identifies the requirements for consent, the standards for anonymisation or pseudonymisation, and adequacy of protection between jurisdictions as barriers for sharing. We also identify differences between the European Union and other jurisdictions as a significant barrier for data accessibility in cross jurisdictional multisite research. Our paper concludes by considering solutions to overcome these legislative differences. These solutions include data transfer agreements and organisational collaborations designed to `front load' the process of ethics approval, so that subsequent research protocols are standardised. We also allude to technical solutions, such as distributed computing, secure multiparty computation and homomorphic encryption.","[{""name"": ""James Scheibner"", ""affiliation"": [""Health Ethics and Policy Laboratory, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Marcello Ienca"", ""affiliation"": [""Health Ethics and Policy Laboratory, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Sotiria Kechagia"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Digital Trust, School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Juan Ramon Troncoso-Pastoriza"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratory for Data Security, School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Jean Louis Raisaro"", ""affiliation"": [""Unité de Médecine de Précision, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Jean-Pierre Hubaux"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratory for Data Security, School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Jacques Fellay"", ""affiliation"": [""Unité de Médecine de Précision, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""School of Life Sciences, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""Host-Pathogen Genomics Laboratory, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Effy Vayena"", ""affiliation"": [""Health Ethics and Policy Laboratory, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland""]}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Physiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"

Meanwhile, although Constrained Horn Clauses ($$\mathrm {CHCs}$$ CHCs ) empower a wide range of verification techniques and tools, they lack the ability to express hyperproperties beyond k-safety such as generalized non-interference and co-termination.This paper describes a novel and fully automated constraint-based approach to relational verification. We first introduce a new class of predicate Constraint Satisfaction Problems called $$\mathrm {pfwCSP}$$ pfwCSP where constraints are represented as clauses modulo first-order theories over predicate variables of three kinds: ordinary, well-founded, or functional. This generalization over $$\mathrm {CHCs}$$ CHCs permits arbitrary (i.e., possibly non-Horn) clauses, well-foundedness constraints, functionality constraints, and is capable of expressing these relational verification problems. Our approach enables us to express and automatically verify problem instances that require non-trivial (i.e., non-sequential and non-lock-step) self-composition by automatically inferring appropriate schedulers (or alignment) that dictate when and which program copies move. To solve problems in this new language, we present a constraint solving method for $$\mathrm {pfwCSP}$$ pfwCSP based on stratified CounterExample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) of ordinary, well-founded, and functional predicates.We have implemented the proposed framework and obtained promising results on diverse relational verification problems that are beyond the scope of the previous verification frameworks.","[{""name"": ""Hiroshi Unno"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tachio Terauchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eric Koskinen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0956796819000145"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_8"", ""10.1145/3062341.3062378"", ""10.1145/2678015.2682546"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009889"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21437-0_17"", ""10.1145/964001.964003"", ""10.1109/CSF.2007.30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_61"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23534-9_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_20"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314596"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.1109/CSF.2008.7"", ""10.1145/3371070"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32004-3_20"", ""10.1145/3324783"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_5"", ""10.1145/2837614.2837664"", ""10.1145/2737924.2737976"", ""10.1145/2254064.2254112"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38574-2_20"", ""10.23919/FMCAD.2018.8603013"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_38"", ""10.1007/11691372_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_19"", ""10.1145/1993498.1993525"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08867-9_2"", ""10.2168/LMCS-11(1:16)2015"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/11863908_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61470-6_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_17"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908099"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-37036-6_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_9"", ""10.1145/1168857.1168907"", ""10.1145/2908080.2908092"", ""10.1145/1706299.1706315"", ""10.1007/11547662_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46669-8_25"", ""10.1145/1599410.1599445"", ""10.1145/1134744.1134750"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38856-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54833-8_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-68237-0_5"", ""10.1145/3192366.3192416"", ""10.1145/2784731.2784766""]","['Chemistry', 'Computer Science']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Organic Chemistry']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0703 化学', 0.7525), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7384)]]"

A growing body of scholarship considers how the ownership of such assets by individuals and households is reshaping patterns of class and inequality and accordingly requires the reconceptualisation of the latter phenomena. The significance of company-owned assets and corporate rents for class, inequality and their conceptualisation has not been considered, however. This article offers an exploratory investigation along these lines, highlighting the importance of employees’ working relationship to company-owned, rent-generating assets for their class position. The article further reflects on how developments in this regard might be approached from the perspective of Marx’s writing on value, labour and class, and the challenges that those developments potentially pose to Marxian concepts.","[{""name"": ""Brett Christophers"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social and Economic Geography, Uppsala University Uppsala Sweden""]}]","[""10.1257/aer.103.3.153"", ""10.1086/705396"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12238"", ""10.14318/hau5.1.027"", ""10.1057/jgm.2010.14"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.1978.tb00749.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.1984.tb00608.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t89fd6"", ""10.1086/210463""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Finance', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

An Empirical Exploration of the Dilemma of Care Allocation in the Workplace,"ABSTRACTOrganization and management researchers praise the value of care in the workplace. However, they overlook the conflict between caring for work and for coworkers, which resonates with the dilemma of care allocation highlighted by ethicists of care. Through an in-depth qualitative study of two organizations, we examine how this dilemma is confronted in everyday organizational life. We draw on the concept of boundary work to explain how employees negotiate the boundary of their caring responsibilities in ways that grants or denies care to coworkers. We argue that the possibility of an ethics of care for coworkers requires boundary work that suspends the separation of personal and professional selves and constitutes the worker as a whole person. We contribute to research on care in organizations by showing how care for coworkers may be enabled or undermined by maintaining or suppressing the care allocation dilemma.","[{""name"": ""Anne Antoni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juliane Reinecke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marianna Fotaki"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00213624.2017.1321438"", ""10.1177/0018726711423442"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3362-9"", ""10.1002/job.1874"", ""10.1080/17496535.2010.484259"", ""10.5465/amj.2014.0208"", ""10.5465/amr.2007.26585677"", ""10.5840/beq200515331"", ""10.1177/14647001030042006"", ""10.1177/026101830002000102"", ""10.5465/amr.2016.0309"", ""10.1017/beq.2015.33"", ""10.1177/0170840613517595"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1130-4"", ""10.5465/amr.2011.0235"", ""10.1353/jsp.2001.0021"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.05.001"", ""10.2307/3857233"", ""10.4135/9781446280669.n23"", ""10.1108/00483481311309384"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.43669916"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2262-0"", ""10.1007/BF00382910"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3040-y"", ""10.5465/amj.2013.0870"", ""10.1177/1094428114565028"", ""10.1177/0018726700536001"", ""10.5465/amr.2012.0074"", ""10.5465/annals.2017.0089"", ""10.1177/1350507609335846"", ""10.1108/PR-03-2015-0076"", ""10.1177/1368431004044196"", ""10.2307/3857622"", ""10.5465/amj.2014.0506"", ""10.1111/joms.12177"", ""10.2307/2392498"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141107"", ""10.15171/ijhpm.2015.66"", ""10.1287/orsc.2015.0968"", ""10.1002/jclp.10090"", ""10.2307/3857435"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1304-8"", ""10.1002/job.751"", ""10.2189/asqu.51.1.59"", ""10.5465/amle.2014.0182"", ""10.1037/0002-9432.76.1.103"", ""10.1177/0893318907310941"", ""10.1111/joop.12073"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226581477.001.0001"", ""10.4135/9781848607941.n13"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2445-8"", ""10.2189/asqu.2010.55.4.606"", ""10.1177/0001839214538636"", ""10.1080/10570319209374414"", ""10.1080/0966369032000114019"", ""10.1177/0038038511435058"", ""10.2307/3857619"", ""10.1177/0149206309344741"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04316-3"", ""10.1177/0018726710396250"", ""10.1057/ejis.2012.48"", ""10.1177/0018726714530012"", ""10.1177/0170840612470256"", ""10.4324/9780429029943"", ""10.5465/amj.2006.22798186"", ""10.1177/1742715014532482"", ""10.1093/bjsw/bch400"", ""10.1177/0170840617736932"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.0628"", ""10.5465/amr.2010.0438"", ""10.1177/0149206313490028"", ""10.1111/j.1754-9434.2010.01306.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9299.2010.01879.x"", ""10.1177/0002764203260211"", ""10.4135/9781412983709"", ""10.1177/0170840608100515"", ""10.5465/amr.2010.0437"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.83.4.919"", ""10.1080/14759551.2011.530745"", ""10.5465/amd.2014.0015"", ""10.1016/j.jen.2009.11.027"", ""10.1177/0038038518768175"", ""10.5465/amr.2010.0466"", ""10.1016/S0361-3682(96)00036-0""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"
10.1111/beer.12277,BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,An analysis of business ethics in the cultural contexts of different religions,"AbstractThe aim of our research is to analyze how different religions influence business ethics. We develop an index of practices in the field of business ethics, made up of 19 items containing practices related to workers, consumers, products, human rights, management of ethical conflicts, and crime prevention. Also, we consider a wide range of religion affiliations. To undertake this research, we use a panel data sample composed of 11,956 firm‐year observations from 18 countries. Drawing on stakeholder theory, we posit some hypotheses based on the religions considered. The results obtained show that a higher percentage of religious adherents in the country where a company does business usually involve the implementation of more ethical practices in the corporate field. These findings are obtained for Christian, Islamic, Jewish, and Hindu religions. In contrast, this does not stand for Buddhist and folk religions. Also, countries where there is no predominant religion do not show a confluence between religion and ethical corporate practices.","[{""name"": ""Isabel Gallego‐Alvarez"", ""affiliation"": [""Facultad de Economía y Empresa Department of Business Studies Instituto Multidisciplinar de Empresa Universidad de Salamanca Salamanca Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Luis Rodríguez‐Domínguez"", ""affiliation"": [""Facultad de Economía y Empresa Department of Business Studies Instituto Multidisciplinar de Empresa Universidad de Salamanca Salamanca Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Javier Martín Vallejo"", ""affiliation"": [""Facultad de Medicina Department of Statistics University of Salamanca Salamanca Spain""]}]","[""10.2307/3857935"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55562-5_5"", ""10.1057/9780230355453_9"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3719-8"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9704-7_12"", ""10.1108/IJSE-05-2013-0129"", ""10.1177/1084822307300883"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9136-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3701-5"", ""10.1023/A:1005989824688"", ""10.1163/15685357-02003004"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1518-9"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3127-5"", ""10.1111/beer.12219"", ""10.1111/j.1536-7150.1993.tb02524.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2007.00373.x"", ""10.1007/s10490-015-9441-0"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5957.2012.02295.x"", ""10.1108/MD-03-2017-0287"", ""10.22495/cocv12i3c5p1"", ""10.1556/SocEc.25.2003.2.11"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9677-4"", ""10.1287/orsc.1040.0066"", ""10.1057/palgrave.crr.1540226"", ""10.2307/3857340"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2006.00458.x"", ""10.1002/9780470998397.ch24"", ""10.1016/S0304-3932(02)00202-7"", ""10.2307/2053785"", ""10.1111/beer.12222"", ""10.1111/beer.12153"", ""10.1002/j.2325-8012.2007.tb00801.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9321-0"", ""10.1111/beer.12212"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3716-y"", ""10.1108/03068290710778606"", ""10.1007/BF00381858"", ""10.1023/A:1011490913223"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9430-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-3001-x"", ""10.1023/A:1006083612239"", ""10.1007/s10551-004-0990-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2874-z"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0150-9"", ""10.5465/ambpp.2008.33724521"", ""10.1111/beer.12248"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3323-3"", ""10.1007/BF00382609"", ""10.2307/259247"", ""10.3998/mpub.18465"", ""10.1080/10508422.2016.1158653"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-2929-7"", ""10.1023/A:1006023619939"", ""10.1108/00251740310488999"", ""10.1108/WJSTSD-05-2015-0023"", ""10.1007/BF00383050"", ""10.1007/BF00383391"", ""10.1111/beer.12181"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3963-6"", ""10.1023/A:1005711414306"", ""10.1111/beer.12164"", ""10.1111/beer.12145"", ""10.1007/s11336-008-9101-0"", ""10.1023/A:1006342224035"", ""10.1023/A:1006111004721"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1568-z"", ""10.1002/pa.355"", ""10.2307/2058743"", ""10.1111/1467-8608.00302"", ""10.1023/A:1005976531062"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1722-2"", ""10.1108/02621711111150218"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0382-8"", ""10.2307/4134370""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1093/socrel/srab050,SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology,A Theory of Political Backlash: Assessing the Religious Right's Effects on the Religious Field,"AbstractA growing body of evidence suggests that the rise in religious disaffiliation can be partly attributed to a political backlash against the Religious Right. Yet the concept of “political backlash” remains undertheorized, limiting our ability to evaluate how backlash against the Religious Right has impacted the religious field as a whole. This article develops a general account of how political backlash against a radical actor can impact participants within a given field, distinguishing between broad backlash, narrow backlash, and counter backlash. It then applies this framework to the case of the religious field. An analysis of available evidence suggests that backlash against the Religious Right has had ripple effects beyond the rise of the “nones,” including a rise in “spiritual” identification, positive attention to the “Religious Left,” depoliticization of liberal religion, and purification and radicalization within the Religious Right itself. This article encourages religion scholars to connect dots between trends that have not been understood as related, and deepens our understanding of the relational nature of religious change. More generally, it offers a framework for understanding how backlash against radical actors can shape entire fields.","[{""name"": ""Ruth Braunstein"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Connecticut , USA""]}]","[""10.1111/jssr.12024"", ""10.1086/709779"", ""10.1177/0003122412465743"", ""10.1093/socrel/sraa004"", ""10.1111/socf.12619"", ""10.1353/book45877"", ""10.1525/california/9780520293649.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780429467769-2"", ""10.1093/socrel/srw056"", ""10.1007/s13644-020-00400-7"", ""10.1215/10407391-2007-014"", ""10.1111/socf.12725"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-73120-9"", ""10.1093/sf/soy080"", ""10.1515/9781400828289"", ""10.1177/1065912918771526"", ""10.1111/ajps.12308"", ""10.1177/000312240607100203"", ""10.1093/sf/sow063"", ""10.1007/s11133-018-9373-3"", ""10.1016/S0163-786X(04)25004-2"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9558.2010.01385.x"", ""10.1177/0003122419871957"", ""10.1111/jssr.12250"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226663999.001.0001"", ""10.2307/800260"", ""10.1002/9780470674871.wbespm174"", ""10.2307/3088891"", ""10.15195/v1.a24"", ""10.5334/snr.al"", ""10.1111/jssr.12641"", ""10.1177/0735275112437164"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226555812.001.0001"", ""10.1093/socrel/srz045"", ""10.1017/ssh.2015.17"", ""10.17813/1086-671X-20-2-157"", ""10.1111/jssr.12618"", ""10.7312/mcve19006"", ""10.1093/sf/soaa029"", ""10.2307/2579672"", ""10.1007/s11109-008-9053-1"", ""10.2307/j.ctvc776b3"", ""10.1177/1086026617744278"", ""10.15195/v4.a28"", ""10.15195/v5.a30"", ""10.1515/9781400830107"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226229225.001.0001"", ""10.1111/socf.12684"", ""10.1093/socrel/srr044"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190057886.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780429494901"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226555331.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780691224213"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199988662.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Since hospitals in high-income countries contribute significantly to climate change through their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the medical ethics imperative of ‘do no harm’ imposes a responsibility on hospitals to decarbonise. We investigated hospital stakeholders’ perceptions of hospitals’ GHG emissions sources and the sense of responsibility for reducing GHG emissions in a hospital.MethodsWe conducted 29 semistructured qualitative expert interviews at one of Germany’s largest hospitals, Heidelberg University Hospital. Five patients, 12 clinical and 12 administrative employees on different levels were selected using purposive maximum variation sampling. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the framework approach.ResultsConcerning GHG emissions, hospital stakeholders perceived energy and waste as most relevant emission sources followed by mobility. Climate change mitigation in general was considered as important. However, in their role as patients or employees, hospital stakeholders felt less responsible for climate change mitigation. They saw providing best possible medical care to be the top priority in hospitals and were often concerned that patients’ health could be jeopardised by climate change mitigation measures.ConclusionPerceptions of most important emission sources did not coincide with those in literature, highlighting the need to inform stakeholders, for instance, about pharmaceuticals as important emission source. A frequently perceived conflict between reducing emissions and providing high-quality medical care could be eased, if reducing emissions would not only be justified as a contribution to mitigation, but also as a contribution to preventing ill health—a basic principle of medical ethics.","[{""name"": ""Claudia Quitmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rainer Sauerborn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ina Danquah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alina Herrmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1056/NEJMra1807873"", ""10.3390/su13031430"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/ab19e1"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2007.119362"", ""10.5430/jha.v7n5p56"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139192675"", ""10.1080/13504620220145401"", ""10.1071/AH11108"", ""10.1111/jan.12655"", ""10.1002/csr.1925"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2014.06.017"", ""10.1146/annurev.energy.30.050504.144444"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-91826-6_23"", ""10.1002/9781405165518.wbeoss012.pub2"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104862"", ""10.4135/9781412986274.n12"", ""10.1093/fampra/13.6.522"", ""10.1192/pb.bp.114.049080"", ""10.1177/1609406919874596"", ""10.3390/ijerph6031204"", ""10.1177/1355819617697353"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02099-0"", ""10.1007/s10464-008-9165-0"", ""10.1080/10872981.2017.1386042"", ""10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00113-3"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01247"", ""10.1213/ANE.0b013e31824d9cc3"", ""10.1111/ans.13856"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104560"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60854-6"", ""10.1177/0969733013502802"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.05.002"", ""10.1093/intqhc/mzw060""]","['Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['General Health Professions', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

While these technological innovations are bound to transform health care, they also bring new ethical concerns to the forefront. One particularly elusive challenge regards discriminatory algorithmic judgements based on biases inherent in the training data. A common line of reasoning distinguishes between justified differential treatments that mirror true disparities between socially salient groups, and unjustified biases which do not, leading to misdiagnosis and erroneous treatment. In the curation of training data this strategy runs into severe problems though, since distinguishing between the two can be next to impossible. We thus plead for a pragmatist dealing with algorithmic bias in healthcare environments. By recurring to a recent reformulation of William James’s pragmatist understanding of truth, we recommend that, instead of aiming at a supposedly objective truth, outcome-based therapeutic usefulness should serve as the guiding principle for assessing ML applications in medicine.","[{""name"": ""Georg Starke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eva De Clercq"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernice S.

10.1007/s10551-020-04541-1,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,To Formalize or Not to Formalize: Women Entrepreneurs' Sensemaking of Business Registration in the Context of Nepal,"AbstractDespite the depiction of decisions to formalize informal firms as rational and ethical, many entrepreneurs in developing countries continue to operate informally regardless of its perceived illicit status. While existing research on why entrepreneurs choose informality emphasizes the economic costs and benefits of such decisions, this often overlooks the realities of the informal economy and the constraints which marginal populations—particularly women—face. In this paper, we use institutional theory and sensemaking to understand the experiences of women in the informal economy and what formalization means to them. We use a qualitative approach to collect data from 90 women entrepreneurs in three different cities in Nepal. In our findings we identify three groups of women with distinctive understandings of formalization—business sustainability, livelihood sufficiency and strategic alignment. Their interpretation of formalization reveals the complex, dynamic, and cyclical nature of formalization decisions. Decisions are also guided by the optimization of social and emotional logics, whereby formalization is conceived differently depending on different life stages, experiences within the informal economy and wider socio-cultural contexts. Our findings highlight the ethical implications of formalization where being a ‘good citizen’, rather than complying with formal rules and regulations, is about attuning to and fitting in with socially prescribed roles. Our research provides a nuanced view of formalization decisions, challenging idealized and ethical notions of formalization as a desired end state.","[{""name"": ""Shova Thapa Karki"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mirela Xheneti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adrian Madden"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1596/978-0-8213-9465-6"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2006.00138.x"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.02.019"", ""10.1007/s11187-009-9194-6"", ""10.1093/wbro/lku002"", ""10.1108/09534810410538315"", ""10.1108/17566260910942318"", ""10.5465/amp.2012.0079"", ""10.1080/13552070802465441"", ""10.5422/fso/9780823225033.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2009.06.004"", ""10.1108/NEJE-18-01-2015-B002"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1975-9"", ""10.1002/sej.1172"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2013.07.009"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2007.00178.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2451.2005.00548.x"", ""10.2307/2393936"", ""10.1080/02723638.2013.778640"", ""10.1080/08985626.2017.1349190"", ""10.1002/sej.1173"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04339-w"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.01.008"", ""10.1108/13552551311299288"", ""10.1086/505725"", ""10.1177/0022002713498699"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3623-2"", ""10.1111/j.0012-155X.2005.00412.x"", ""10.1080/08959285.2017.1301454"", ""10.1017/S0001972011000763"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808678"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-7092-6"", ""10.2307/2667106"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-06-2013-0083"", ""10.1093/icc/12.4.879"", ""10.2307/256522"", ""10.1002/sej.1171"", ""10.1177/0276146714521635"", ""10.5465/amr.2009.40632826"", ""10.1177/0170840606068343"", ""10.1287/orsc.1050.0133"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00427.x"", ""10.1108/17566260910990900"", ""10.1142/S1084946710001683"", ""10.1108/JEPP-05-2012-0027"", ""10.1080/08985626.2014.963889"", ""10.1108/17566261111114953"", ""10.1111/etap.12238"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-0667-4"", ""10.1080/08985626.2018.1551792"", ""10.1111/ijmr.12172""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"
10.1111/beer.12242,BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,The moderating role of board monitoring power in the relationship between environmental conditions and corporate social responsibility,"AbstractIs the relationship between environmental munificence, dynamism, and corporate social responsibility contingent on board monitoring power? This is the research question examined in this study of an international sample of 956 listed firms from 2006 to 2014. After applying several regression models for panel data based on Tobit and generalized method of moments' (GMM) estimation, this paper supports the assertion that in munificent and dynamic environments, managers show a lower commitment to social and environmental issues. Proactive promotion of social and environmental concerns only occurs in firms with efficient internal corporate governance mechanisms, resulting in a moderating effect of board monitoring power—board independence and non‐duality of CEO—on the association between environmental conditions and corporate social responsibility. Theoretically, this moderating effect triggers managers to increase their socially responsible performance in munificent and dynamic environments because: (a) these boards reinforce the orientation of a firm towards the meeting of stakeholders' expectations; and (b) managers aim to protect themselves from the greater supervision and control exerted by the board in order to maintain their decision‐making freedom in environments of superior growth, resources, market uncertainty, and instability.","[{""name"": ""Isabel‐María García‐Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": [""IME‐Instituto Multidisciplinar de Empresa, Departamento de Administración y Economía de la Empresa Universidad de Salamanca Salamanca Spain""]}]","[""10.1111/1467-8551.12277"", ""10.3390/admsci8030050"", ""10.2307/30040690"", ""10.2307/2297968"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00843.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0496-z"", ""10.2307/257850"", ""10.1111/j.1530-9134.2007.00156.x"", ""10.1002/bse.1902"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.008"", ""10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01026.x"", ""10.1002/csr.1425"", ""10.2307/2393080"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.jbankfin.2011.02.007"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1864-2"", ""10.1086/467037"", ""10.2307/3069419"", ""10.1002/bse.729"", ""10.2307/257101"", ""10.1002/smj.2307"", ""10.6018/rc-sar.22.1.354321"", ""10.1002/csr.1481"", ""10.1002/smj.750"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000013862.14941.4e"", ""10.1002/smj.4250150305"", ""10.2307/256864"", ""10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2005.06.001"", ""10.2307/1912775"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0772-6"", ""10.1002/smj.801"", ""10.1057/jibs.2010.46"", ""10.5465/amr.2003.10196729"", ""10.1002/1097-0266(200101)22:2<125::AID-SMJ150>3.0.CO;2-H"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(83)90004-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1052-1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8683.2007.00554.x"", ""10.2307/256460"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8683.2009.00775.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8683.2009.00758.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-627X.2006.00151.x"", ""10.1002/smj.810"", ""10.2307/3069344"", ""10.2307/3556659"", ""10.1177/1086026615573082"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.133"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1615-9"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.31193458"", ""10.2307/259398"", ""10.1007/s10997-010-9160-3"", ""10.1177/0170840603024003910"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199911)20:11<1037::AID-SMJ67>3.0.CO;2-2"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.1992.tb00672.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8683.2008.00678.x"", ""10.1111/beer.12123"", ""10.1111/beer.12218"", ""10.1111/beer.12181"", ""10.1177/0149206311425612"", ""10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2012.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.jfbs.2017.11.004"", ""10.2307/4131474"", ""10.2307/1556361"", ""10.6018/rc-sar.22.1.354361"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5957.2008.02090.x"", ""10.1016/j.rcsar.2017.07.003"", ""10.1002/smj.1952"", ""10.1007/s10997-004-1107-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1745-8""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Accounting', 'Strategy and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

Previous studies have indicated that spirituality in these times of crisis serves as a source of hope and well-being that helps people get through the day. This study investigated the role of spirituality and religiosity in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. An integrative review of the scientific literature available on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and a review of the gray literature in the Information System on Gray Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) were carried out. From a total of 1,338 articles searched; 25 articles were included in this review (22 quantitative observational, 2 qualitative and one randomized controlled trial). Our findings revealed the importance of including spirituality in clinical practice for both health professionals and patients. On the one hand, spirituality can be considered a good coping strategy used by healthcare professionals to promote mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting in greater patient satisfaction with the care given. On the other hand, addressing spiritual needs of individuals leads to a reduction in stress, anxiety, depression, and an increase in resilience and hope among patients.","[{""name"": ""Rocío de Diego-Cordero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amanda Ávila-Mantilla"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juan Vega-Escaño"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Giancarlo Lucchetti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bárbara Badanta"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3233/wor-203392"", ""10.1111/jocn.15887"", ""10.1108/PR-08-2018-0305"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2020.574314"", ""10.1558/hscc.41973"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01036-1"", ""10.1111/jocn.14340"", ""10.1007/s10943-019-00780-3"", ""10.1007/s10943-021-01492-3"", ""10.1080/15528030.2021.1894627"", ""10.1177/0020764020984511"", ""10.1017/S0033291715001166"", ""10.1007/s13187-021-01974-8"", ""10.1002/jclp.20626"", ""10.1007/s10597-019-00486-6"", ""10.1002/nop2.697"", ""10.1007/s10943-021-01193-x"", ""10.1016/j.outlook.2021.01.001"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01088-3"", ""10.3390/jcm10235612"", ""10.1177/0020764020970996"", ""10.2190/PM.48.3.e"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01121-5"", ""10.1007/s10943-021-01218-5"", ""10.24083/APJHM.V15I3.433"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61082-0"", ""10.3389/fnbeh.2020.596919"", ""10.1590/1516-4446-2013-1255"", ""10.1007/s42399-020-00582-9"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01151-z"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000388"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.1007/s10943-021-01196-8"", ""10.3390/ijerph18010220"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567836"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01129-x"", ""10.1111/ppc.12651"", ""10.1111/jonm.13235"", ""10.18502/ijph.v50i3.5594"", ""10.3390/jcm9123798"", ""10.1080/07399332.2020.1832097"", ""10.1007/s10943-020-01089-2"", ""10.1080/09720510.2020.1833451"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2020.582352"", ""10.1136/bmj.c332"", ""10.1016/j.ajic.2008.08.007"", ""10.3390/rel11100498"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2010.11.010"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.07.013"", ""10.1111/jonm.12736"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03621.x"", ""10.1111/jonm.12994"", ""10.3928/00220124-20101201-04""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Health']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)]]"
10.3390/rel12110914,RELIGIONS,0101 Philosophy,"Spirituality and Well-Being: Theory, Science, and the Nature Connection","The links between spirituality and eudaimonic well-being are examined, beginning with a look at theoretical issues as to whether spirituality is best construed as part of well-being, or as a possible influence on well-being. A brief review of scientific findings from the MIDUS study linking religion and spirituality to well-being and other outcomes is then provided to show recent empirical work on these topics. Suggestions for future work are also provided. The third section is forward-thinking and addresses the power of nature to nurture spirituality and well-being, beginning with a look at how current research has linked nature to human flourishing. Issues of spirituality are rarely mentioned in this literature, despite evidence that nature has long been a source of inspiration in poetry, literature, art, and music. These works reveal that the natural world speaks to the human soul. To explore such ideas, parts of Jungian psychology are revisited: the soul’s longing for poetry, myth, and metaphor; the importance of animism, which sees nature as a field inhabited by spirit; and the devaluing of ancient cultures. The final section considers the wisdom of the indigenous peoples who saw spirit in everything. Their inputs, exemplified with “Two-Eyed Seeing”, offer new visions for thinking about the interplay of spirituality, well-being, and the natural world.","[{""name"": ""Carol D.

The capacities for artificial ventilation in intensive care units were too scarce to care for patients with acute respiratory disorder connected to the disease. Several professional associations published COVID‐19 triage recommendations in an extremely short time: in 21 days between March 6 and March 27. In this article, we compare recommendations from five European countries, which combine medical and ethical reflections on this situation in some detail. Our aim is to provide a detailed overview on the ethical elements of the recommendations, the differences between them and their coherence. In more general terms we want to identify shortcomings in regard to a common European response to the current situation.","[{""name"": ""Hans‐Jörg Ehni"", ""affiliation"": [""Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen Institut für Ethik und Geschichte der Medizin Tubingen, Baden‐Württemberg Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Urban Wiesing"", ""affiliation"": [""Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen Institut für Ethik und Geschichte der Medizin Tubingen, Baden‐Württemberg Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Robert Ranisch"", ""affiliation"": [""Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen Institut für Ethik und Geschichte der Medizin Tubingen, Baden‐Württemberg Germany""]}]",[],"['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.6939), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6908)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

Our article challenges how researchers now conceptualize moral disengagement. The current literature is overly liberal, in that it mixes two related but distinct constructs—process moral disengagement and the propensity to morally disengage—creating ambiguity in the findings. It is overly conservative, as it adopts a challengeable classification scheme of “four points in moral self-regulation” and perpetuates defining moral disengagement via a set of eight psychological mechanisms, narrowing our understanding of the phenomenon. To address these problems, we propose to define process moral disengagement intensionally (specifying the necessary and sufficient conditions for correct application of the term) as intrapsychic cognitive reasoning processes through which people selectively reconstrue a moral judgment “behavior B by actor A is morally wrong” and shift it toward becoming “behavior B is not morally wrong” or “actor A is not responsible for behavior B.” This definition achieves disambiguation and increased concept clarity. We leverage the definition to motivate a classification scheme for psychological mechanisms of moral disengagement along two dimensions—reconstruing morality and reconstruing agency—and to initiate an open inventory of psychological mechanisms that specify how process moral disengagement operates.","[{""name"": ""Ulf Schaefer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Onno Bouwmeester"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2753/MIS0742-1222270109"", ""10.1016/S0191-3085(03)25001-2"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00270.x"", ""10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3"", ""10.1080/0305724022014322"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-4163-6_3"", ""10.1177/1745691617699280"", ""10.5406/amerjpsyc.131.2.0246"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364"", ""10.1177/097168580000600106"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2078-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2107-x"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2004.05.007"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2366-6"", ""10.1037/apl0000111"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1631-4"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2013.11.005"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0680-1"", ""10.1037/a0037245"", ""10.1086/228750"", ""10.1027/1864-1105/a000138"", ""10.1515/9780748631971"", ""10.2753/MIS0742-1222310210"", ""10.5406/amerjpsyc.131.2.0240"", ""10.1037/apl0000233"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.374"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.0804"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2818-7"", ""10.1108/EBR-05-2015-0047"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2429-8"", ""10.1177/001872675400700202"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2209-5"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3373-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1250-5"", ""10.1007/s10802-014-9920-7"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.03.011"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02306.x"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814"", ""10.2307/1229350"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3550-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2911-y"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2011.00869.x"", ""10.1037/apl0000158"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.03.012"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04107-w"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2220-x"", ""10.1037/apl0000290"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00102.x"", ""10.1177/1742715015611205"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2016.11.003"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1909-6"", ""10.1111/jasp.12353"", ""10.1037/apl0000092"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3456-z"", ""10.1177/0146167210376391"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1554-5"", ""10.1007/s13520-015-0043-1"", ""10.1080/15614263.2013.770941"", ""10.5465/amr.2001.4845785"", ""10.1177/2041386613518576"", ""10.1177/0956797611412389"", ""10.5840/beq20102014"", ""10.13110/merrpalmquar1982.61.1.0124"", ""10.1002/ab.10060"", ""10.1002/j.2330-8516.1987.tb00244.x"", ""10.1037/h0040525"", ""10.1038/nrn1768"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9447-8"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.07.018"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2011.01237.x"", ""10.1037/apl0000341"", ""10.5465/amr.1999.1893935"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04173-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2545-0"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2013.08.026"", ""10.1002/per.1931"", ""10.1007/s10979-005-4930-1"", ""10.1016/j.avb.2015.01.004"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2694-1"", ""10.1177/1094428115624965"", ""10.1002/ab.21442"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2013.10.008"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1635-0"", ""10.1177/0146167211398138"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0963-1"", ""10.2307/2089195"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2800-4"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.6.1.25"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3576-5"", ""10.1037/a0036950"", ""10.1080/08989620802689847"", ""10.1007/s11205-007-9143-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3683-3""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1215/00318108-8311261,PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW,0101 Philosophy,Radical Externalism,"This article presents a novel challenge to epistemic internalism. The challenge rests on a set of cases which feature subjects forming beliefs under conditions of “bad ideology”—that is, conditions in which pervasively false beliefs have the function of sustaining, and are sustained by, systems of social oppression. In such cases, the article suggests, the externalistic view that justification is in part a matter of worldly relations, rather than the internalistic view that justification is solely a matter of how things stand from the agent’s individual perspective, becomes the more intuitively attractive theory. But these “bad ideology” cases do not merely yield intuitive verdicts that favor externalism over internalism. These cases are, moreover, analogous to precisely those canonical cases widely taken to be counterexamples to externalism: cases featuring brains-in-vats, clairvoyants, and dogmatists. That is, such “bad ideology” cases are, in all relevant respects, just like cases that are thought to count against externalism—except that they intuitively favor externalism. This, the author argues, is a serious worry for internalism. What is more, it bears on the debate over whether externalism is a genuinely “normative” epistemology.","[{""name"": ""Amia Srinivasan"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford""]}]","[""10.1007/BF00869630"", ""10.1093/aristotelian/57.1.1"", ""10.1007/s11031-009-9122-8"", ""10.1093/0199275742.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.1980.tb00396.x"", ""10.1007/BF00372907"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2024268"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-9493-5_1"", ""10.2307/2214068"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00013066"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00040395"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-0085-3"", ""10.1093/0198242522.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2004.tb01267.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9329.2011.00511.x"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00201"", ""10.1111/nous.12026"", ""10.1080/08935698808657785"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-19059-1_25"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2010.00183.x"", ""10.1111/phpr.12271"", ""10.1215/00318108-2009-037"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199567171.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929023.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2013.02.008"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1887.001.0001"", ""10.1093/019928038X.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0412-7"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0446-9"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7"", ""10.1111/j.1758-2237.2000.tb00002.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199217250.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phis.12059"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198829775.003.0011"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2002.tb00206.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195311952.003.0010"", ""10.1007/s10670-013-9590-9""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Some are linguistic: What are the linguistic conventions governing the slur post-reclamation and how are they related to the conventions governing it pre-reclamation? What mechanisms engender the shift? Others bend toward the social: Why do a slur’s targets have a special privilege in initiating its reclamation? Is there a systematic explanation why prohibitions on out-group use of reclaimed slurs vary from slur to slur? And how does reclamation contribute to shaping social identities and reversing oppressive social norms and stigma? Most analyses of slur reclamation advance a single model to answer these questions. The author argues that there are different varieties of reclamation. Two predominate, what she calls pride reclamation and insular reclamation. While many features unite pride and insular reclamation, they differ with respect to the purpose of the reclamatory act, the linguistic mechanisms reclaimers employ to execute the linguistic change, and the social and grammatical roles of the reclaimed slur. By distinguishing these two types of reclamation and offering a fine-grained characterization of their properties, the author argues that we gain deeper insight into the reasons why slurs may in principle only be ignited by the target group and why pride- but not insular-reclaimed slurs become available for use by out-group members.","[{""name"": ""Robin Jeshion"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Southern California, jeshion@usc.edu""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Linguistics and Language', 'Communication', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

In this study, we ask: what is the relationship between two economic stressors—job insecurity and financial strain—and depression? And how do changes in religious belief, indexed by the sense of divine control, moderate those relationships? We use two waves of the U.S. Work, Stress, and Health (US-WSH) project (2005–2007), which occurred on the eve of the Great Recession. Results suggest that increases in job insecurity and financial strain are associated with increased levels of depression. However, those associations are (1) buffered among individuals who simultaneously increased in the sense of divine control and (2) exacerbated among individuals who decreased in the sense of divine control. Moreover, the buffering and exacerbating effects of divine control are significantly stronger among workers with lower levels of education.","[{""name"": ""Laura Upenieks"", ""affiliation"": [""Baylor University""]}, {""name"": ""Scott Schieman"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Toronto""]}, {""name"": ""Alex Bierman"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Calgary""]}]","[""10.1207/S15327582IJPR1303_02"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.03.015"", ""10.1080/10508611003608049"", ""10.1177/0898264316688116"", ""10.1177/0002716213500212"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.06.029"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-073014-112204"", ""10.1353/eca.2004.0004"", ""10.1111/jssr.12576"", ""10.3390/rel8080133"", ""10.1111/jssr.12520"", ""10.1007/s13644-011-0023-4"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004205970.i-277.7"", ""10.1007/s11205-009-9553-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139226479.017"", ""10.1037/a0036465"", ""10.1111/tsq.12087"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0123117"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-9862-3_1"", ""10.5465/amr.1984.4279673"", ""10.1037/rel0000119"", ""10.1093/sf/soaa018"", ""10.1093/sf/soaa018"", ""10.2307/1912352"", ""10.3390/rel8080134"", ""10.1257/jep.26.3.27"", ""10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.00247.x"", ""10.3386/w16407"", ""10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00194.x"", ""10.1111/jssr.12170"", ""10.1177/002214650604700102"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139028547"", ""10.4284/0038-4038-78.3.999"", ""10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100521"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2007.00375.x"", ""10.1080/10508610902880204"", ""10.1080/13674676.2011.574272"", ""10.1080/10508619.2014.952588"", ""10.1111/jssr.12364"", ""10.1177/0093854816678647"", ""10.1080/15528030.2018.1461729"", ""10.3390/rel2010051"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200004)56:4<519::AID-JCLP6>3.0.CO;2-1"", ""10.2307/2136956"", ""10.2307/2136676"", ""10.2307/2136915"", ""10.1080/14766081003746430"", ""10.1177/014662167700100306"", ""10.1177/2378023119849807"", ""10.1093/socrel/68.4.361"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004205970.i-277.19"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2012.01682.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5906.2006.00326.x"", ""10.1111/tsq.12153"", ""10.1007/s10943-013-9712-3"", ""10.1007/s10834-012-9328-x"", ""10.1163/008467206777832562"", ""10.1017/psrm.2017.4"", ""10.1093/geronb/gbw001""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1007/s40592-020-00116-y,MONASH BIOETHICS REVIEW,0101 Philosophy,Human cerebral organoids and consciousness: a double-edged sword,"AbstractHuman cerebral organoids (HCOs) are three-dimensional in vitro cell cultures that mimic the developmental process and organization of the developing human brain. In just a few years this technique has produced brain models that are already being used to study diseases of the nervous system and to test treatments and drugs. Currently, HCOs consist of tens of millions of cells and have a size of a few millimeters. The greatest limitation to further development is due to their lack of vascularization. However, recent research has shown that human cerebral organoids can manifest the same electrical activity and connections between brain neurons and EEG patterns as those recorded in preterm babies. All this suggests that, in the future, HCOs may manifest an ability to experience basic sensations such as pain, therefore manifesting sentience, or even rudimentary forms of consciousness. This calls for consideration of whether cerebral organoids should be given a moral status and what limitations should be introduced to regulate research. In this article I focus particularly on the study of the emergence and mechanisms of human consciousness, i.e. one of the most complex scientific problems there are, by means of experiments on HCOs. This type of experiment raises relevant ethical issues and, as I will argue, should probably not be considered morally acceptable.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Lavazza"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.conb.2019.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.tins.2019.11.003"", ""10.1101/cshperspect.a035709"", ""10.1038/nature22330"", ""10.1101/692970"", ""10.1126/science.aaf9414"", ""10.1038/545039a"", ""10.1126/scitranslmed.3006294"", ""10.1002/ana.24779"", ""10.1007/s40778-018-0135-7"", ""10.1093/cercor/bhx122"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9973.2007.00476.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-18015-6_4"", ""10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00123-2"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2006.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2019.04.002"", ""10.1038/d41586-018-04813-x"", ""10.1038/s41593-019-0350-2"", ""10.1146/annurev-neuro-062012-170339"", ""10.1038/s41380-019-0500-7"", ""10.1016/j.stem.2012.12.015"", ""10.1016/j.reth.2019.02.003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190634384.003.0014"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003111"", ""10.1111/bioe.12656"", ""10.1038/nrn.2016.22"", ""10.1126/science.aaz5221"", ""10.1093/jlb/lsz005"", ""10.1093/analys/anz045"", ""10.1038/nprot.2014.158"", ""10.1038/nature12517"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-105268"", ""10.1093/jlb/lsaa005"", ""10.1136/medethics-2017-104555"", ""10.1136/medethics-2018-104976"", ""10.1016/j.stem.2016.04.017"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0345-2"", ""10.1038/nbt.4127"", ""10.2307/2026961"", ""10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17714-2"", ""10.1016/j.tcb.2019.11.004"", ""10.1242/dev.140111"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2009.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.07.013"", ""10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003588"", ""10.3389/fncel.2019.00129"", ""10.1038/nature25032"", ""10.1038/nmeth.3415"", ""10.1038/nmeth.3586"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625398"", ""10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.032"", ""10.1242/dev.140707"", ""10.1038/nature22047"", ""10.1126/science.aaz8800"", ""10.1111/j.1699-0463.1969.tb04520.x"", ""10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.05.029"", ""10.1177/1550059413513723"", ""10.1038/nature07935"", ""10.1016/j.stemcr.2019.08.003"", ""10.1073/pnas.1516645112"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5834.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.03.002"", ""10.5840/jpr_2007_7"", ""10.1126/science.aav5386"", ""10.2307/25470707"", ""10.1196/annals.1440.004"", ""10.1098/rstb.2014.0167"", ""10.1038/nrn.2016.44"", ""10.1186/1471-2202-4-31"", ""10.1016/j.stem.2019.08.002"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1289-x"", ""10.1016/j.stem.2015.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.stem.2018.12.015""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Molecular Biology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1017/hyp.2022.4,HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY,0101 Philosophy; 0303 Sociology,Hermeneutical Injustice: Distortion and Conceptual Aptness,"AbstractThis article develops a new approach for theorizing about hermeneutical injustice. According to a dominant view, hermeneutical injustice results from a hermeneutical gap: one lacks the conceptual tools needed to make sense of, or to communicate, important social experiences, where this lack is a result of an injustice in the background social methods used to determine hermeneutical resources. I argue that this approach is incomplete. It fails to capture an important species of hermeneutical injustice which doesn't result from a lack of hermeneutical resources, but from the overabundance of distorting and oppressive concepts which function to crowd-out, defeat, or pre-empt the application of a more accurate hermeneutical resource. I propose a broader analysis that better respects the dynamic relationship between hermeneutical resources and the social and political contexts in which they are implemented.","[{""name"": ""Arianna Falbo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/phpr.12654"", ""10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.1.0024"", ""10.1111/hypa.12251"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00064246.1973.11760854"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0434-5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001"", ""10.1080/02691728.2010.534568"", ""10.1080/02691728.2013.782585"", ""10.1111/japp.12174"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01222.x"", ""10.1177/0093854818794742"", ""10.1080/02691728.2011.652211"", ""10.1080/02691728.2018.1483879"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01175.x"", ""10.3366/epi.2006.3.1-2.96"", ""10.5840/jphil2017114828"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2011.00319.x"", ""10.1111/phpr.12330"", ""10.1111/hypa.12384"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00774"", ""10.1080/24740500.2019.1705229"", ""10.1111/hypa.12496"", ""10.1177/0963947012444217"", ""10.1086/697490"", ""10.1017/epi.2018.27"", ""10.1017/apa.2019.27"", ""10.1111/sjp.12298"", ""10.2307/800672"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732587.001.0001"", ""10.1017/epi.2020.40"", ""10.2307/796657"", ""10.5206/fpq/2017.4.1"", ""10.1111/phc3.12336""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Identifying such conventional patterns of reasoning is essential to the interpretation and evaluation of argumentation. Whether studying argumentation from a theory-driven or data-driven perspective, insight into the actual use of argumentation in communicative practice is essential. Large and reliably annotated corpora of argumentative discourse to quantitatively provide such insight are few and far between. This is all the more true for argument scheme corpora, which tend to suffer from a combination of limited size, poor validation, and the use of ad hoc restricted typologies. In the current paper, we describe the annotation of schemes on the basis of two distinct classifications: Walton’s taxonomy of argument schemes, and Wagemans’ Periodic Table of Arguments. We describe the annotation procedure for each, and the quantitative characteristics of the resulting annotated text corpora. In doing so, we extend the annotation of the preexisting US2016 corpus of televised election debates, resulting in, to the best of our knowledge, the two largest consistently annotated corpora of schemes in argumentative dialogue publicly available. Based on evaluation in terms of inter-annotator agreement, we propose further improvements to the guidelines for annotating schemes: the argument scheme key, and the Argument Type Identification Procedure.","[{""name"": ""Jacky Visser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Lawrence"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Reed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jean Wagemans"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Douglas Walton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10503-014-9335-1"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2017.09.002"", ""10.3115/v1/W15-0511"", ""10.1017/S0269888906001044"", ""10.1177/001316446002000104"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-6670-2_8"", ""10.18653/v1/D17-1245"", ""10.18653/v1/W16-2805"", ""10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/00719-7"", ""10.1037/h0031619"", ""10.1023/A:1007846431353"", ""10.3115/v1/W14-2106"", ""10.3115/v1/W15-0502"", ""10.1075/jaic.2.2.03han"", ""10.1145/2806416.2806652"", ""10.18653/v1/N18-5006"", ""10.1023/B:ARGU.0000024044.34360.82"", ""10.4324/9781315044859"", ""10.2307/2529310"", ""10.1162/COLI_a_00364"", ""10.18653/v1/W19-4012"", ""10.18653/v1/W19-4520"", ""10.18653/v1/N19-1177"", ""10.18653/v1/W16-2810"", ""10.18653/v1/W18-5509"", ""10.3115/v1/W14-2105"", ""10.1145/3132847.3133150"", ""10.4018/jcini.2013010101"", ""10.4135/9781412976046.n22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04568-5"", ""10.18653/v1/D15-1050"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9549-8"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173438"", ""10.18653/v1/W18-5218"", ""10.3115/v1/W14-2110"", ""10.2200/S00883ED1V01Y201811HLT040"", ""10.1075/aic.2"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-6244-5"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-9473-5_11"", ""10.3233/978-1-61499-906-5-313"", ""10.1007/s10579-019-09446-8"", ""10.2478/slgr-2018-0028"", ""10.2478/rela-2019-0005"", ""10.4018/jcini.2012070103"", ""10.1080/19462166.2015.1123772"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802034""]",['Computer Science'],['Artificial Intelligence'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/nous.12258,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,An Accuracy-Dominance Argument for Conditionalization,"AbstractEpistemic decision theorists aim to justify Bayesian norms by arguing that these norms further the goal of epistemic accuracy—having beliefs that are as close as possible to the truth. The standard defense of Probabilism appeals to accuracy dominance: for every belief state that violates the probability calculus, there is some probabilistic belief state that is more accurate, come what may. The standard defense of Conditionalization, on the other hand, appeals to expected accuracy: before the evidence is in, one should expect to do better by conditionalizing than by following any other rule. We present a new argument for Conditionalization that appeals to accuracy‐dominance, rather than expected accuracy. Our argument suggests that Conditionalization is a rule of coherence: plans that conflict with Conditionalization don't just prescribe bad responses to the evidence; they also give rise to inconsistent attitudes.","[{""name"": ""R.A.

However, the academic discourse barely reflects social entrepreneurship’s inherent normativity and often grounds it implicitly on the mission of a social enterprise. In this paper, we argue critically that it is insufficient to ground social entrepreneurship’s inherent normativity on a social mission. Instead, we will show how such a mission-centric conception of social entrepreneurship, when put into practice, is prone to enhance rather than diminish societal grievances. In order to give social entrepreneurship an explicit and sound ethical grounding, we draw on integrative economic ethics as a frame of reference. From this perspective, social entrepreneurship necessitates adherence to the discourse-ethically reasoned moral principle in order to live up to its inherent normative validity claim of good entrepreneurship. The consideration of social entrepreneurship practices is crucial to make this approach less vulnerable to ethical critique. The addition of a practice dimension overcomes the mission-centric view of social entrepreneurship and opens up a typology of enterprise forms, thereby enabling a more fine-grained distinction between social enterprises and other forms of organization.","[{""name"": ""Ignas Bruder"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0095399714555756"", ""10.1177/0021886304266847"", ""10.1007/s11266-014-9543-1"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2006.00107.x"", ""10.1002/ltl.100"", ""10.4337/9781781009055.00024"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2008.02.009"", ""10.1177/0266242607071779"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2007.06.004"", ""10.1108/SEJ-06-2015-0016"", ""10.1108/SEJ-09-2013-0036"", ""10.1177/1350508410364198"", ""10.1108/17508611211252828"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2450-y"", ""10.1177/0170840616634133"", ""10.1086/392855"", ""10.1016/j.riob.2014.09.001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00355.x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.521883"", ""10.1080/713701063"", ""10.2307/3857340"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1245-2"", ""10.1177/0002764214534674"", ""10.5465/amle.2005.16132558"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-16161-4"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3766-1"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3252-1"", ""10.1002/cb.6"", ""10.1515/kant.1971.62.1-4.55"", ""10.1057/9780230625655_10"", ""10.1007/s10551-007-9550-x"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1733-z"", ""10.4324/9780203981948"", ""10.1093/ser/mwr028"", ""10.1111/j.1744-1714.2003.tb00002.x"", ""10.1080/19420676.2013.777360"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qh7nh.7"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2005.09.002"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3824-3"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.05.003"", ""10.4324/9781315006512"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00397.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1002-y"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2005.10.007"", ""10.1057/9780230625655_5"", ""10.1002/sej.1204"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3671-7"", ""10.1086/287231"", ""10.1177/0149206318793196"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2004.12.007"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1413-4"", ""10.1515/9780271023717"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2004.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2005.09.004"", ""10.1108/13522750410540209"", ""10.1002/sej.69"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.12.006"", ""10.5771/9783845245034"", ""10.1108/03068290010306435"", ""10.1108/03068290610660643"", ""10.1108/09513550210435746"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2007.00194.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511488658"", ""10.5771/1439-880X-2008-3-331"", ""10.1007/BF00871669"", ""10.1177/000765039603500108"", ""10.1007/s11266-013-9396-z"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2009.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2008.04.007""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Demography']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)]]"

Existing studies, concentrated in business to consumer rather than inter-organisational contexts, have not undertaken the fine-grained assessments of statements needed to identify which aspects of reporting performance are particularly poor and the underlying reasons that need to be addressed by policy makers. In a novel design, this study utilises the ethical trade initiative assessment framework to evaluate the content of 95 UK government suppliers’ modern slavery statements. The findings suggest that in a modern slavery context, discovery challenges are more important than firms’ attitudes to disclosure. We contribute to the transparency literature through a model contrasting discovery costs and disclosure risks and by identifying the disclosure of unknowns as an additional relevant dimension of disclosure. We then discuss the model in relation to normativity theory to consider options through which the currently low legitimacy of the reporting governance regime can be enhanced and the intended norms established.","[{""name"": ""Bruce Pinnington"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amy Benstead"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joanne Meehan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0038038597031003015"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2012.01.001"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-10-2017-0611"", ""10.1080/09537287.2020.1795290"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3364-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2114-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3128-4"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.11.001"", ""10.1111/poms.12973"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-11-2017-3242"", ""10.1080/09537287.2019.1595208"", ""10.1017/bhj.2017.14"", ""10.5465/amr.2011.0145"", ""10.1111/rego.12162"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0882-1"", ""10.1108/SCM-10-2018-0369"", ""10.1108/EBR-05-2019-0092"", ""10.1177/0964663917746736"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-06-2015-2088"", ""10.1108/SCM-02-2015-0046"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.11.036"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.074"", ""10.1111/ablj.12134"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3951-x"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12512"", ""10.1111/1758-5899.12398"", ""10.1093/ser/mwx047"", ""10.1017/bhj.2017.35"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-05-2020-0292"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2014.10.003"", ""10.1177/0007650319898195"", ""10.1108/SCM-06-2015-0201"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-12-2019-4297"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2018.04.001"", ""10.1108/SCM-11-2017-0382"", ""10.1002/joom.1021"", ""10.5871/jba/007s1.061"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2015.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.08.006""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

We criticize recent attempts to identify the explanation of black box algorithms with making their decisions (post-hoc) interpretable, focusing our discussion on counterfactual explanations. These approaches to explanation simplify the real nature of the black boxes and risk misleading the public about the normative features of a model. We propose a new form of algorithmic transparency, that consists in explaining algorithms as an intentional product, that serves a particular goal, or multiple goals (Daniel Dennet’s design stance) in a given domain of applicability, and that provides a measure of the extent to which such a goal is achieved, and evidence about the way that measure has been reached. We call such idea of algorithmic transparency “design publicity.” We argue that design publicity can be more easily linked with the justification of the use and of the design of the algorithm, and of each individual decision following from it. In comparison to post-hoc explanations of individual algorithmic decisions, design publicity meets a different demand (the demand for impersonal justification) of the explainee. Finally, we argue that when models that pursue justifiable goals (which may include fairness as avoidance of bias towards specific groups) to a justifiable degree are used consistently, the resulting decisions are all justified even if some of them are (unavoidably) based on incorrect predictions. For this argument, we rely on John Rawls’s idea of procedural justice applied to algorithms conceived as institutions.","[{""name"": ""Michele Loi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Ferrario"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eleonora Viganò"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13869790410001694462"", ""10.1145/33510953372830"", ""10.1177/0049124118782533"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0263-5"", ""10.5840/philtopics19871523"", ""10.1023/B:MIND.0000035461.63578.9d"", ""10.1007/s10618-014-0393-7"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9233-7"", ""10.1098/rsta.2018.0084"", ""10.1145/3236386.3241340"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2018.07.007"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287574"", ""10.4159/9780674042582"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939778"", ""10.3389/frobt.2018.00015"", ""10.1145/3287560.3287566"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00355-w""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1186/s12910-022-00819-3,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,The concept of vulnerability in aged care: a systematic review of argument-based ethics literature,"AbstractBackgroundVulnerability is a key concept in traditional and contemporary bioethics. In the philosophical literature, vulnerability is understood not only to be an ontological condition of humanity, but also to be a consequence of contingent factors. Within bioethics debates, vulnerable populations are defined in relation to compromised capacity to consent, increased susceptibility to harm, and/or exploitation. Although vulnerability has historically been associated with older adults, to date, no comprehensive or systematic work exists on the meaning of their vulnerability. To fill this gap, we analysed the literature on aged care for the meaning, foundations, and uses of vulnerability as an ethical concept.MethodsUsing PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of argument-based ethics literature in four major databases: PubMed, Embase®, Web of Science™, and Philosopher’s Index. These covered biomedical, philosophy, bioethical, and anthropological literature. Titles, abstracts, and full texts of identified papers were screened for relevance. The snowball technique and citation tracking were used to identify relevant publications. Data analysis and synthesis followed the preparatory steps of the coding process detailed in the QUAGOL methodology.ResultsThirty-eight publications met our criteria and were included. Publication dates ranged from 1984 to 2020, with 17 publications appearing between 2015 and 2020. Publications originated from all five major continents, as indicated by the affiliation of the first author. Our analyses revealed that the concept of vulnerability could be distinguished in terms of basic human and situational vulnerability. Six dimensions of older adults’ vulnerability were identified: physical; psychological; relational/interpersonal; moral; sociocultural, political, and economic; and existential/spiritual. This analysis suggested three ways to relate to older adults’ vulnerability: understanding older adults’ vulnerability, taking care of vulnerable older adults, and intervening through socio-political-economic measures.ConclusionsThe way in which vulnerability was conceptualised in the included publications overlaps with distinctions used within contemporary bioethics literature. Dimensions of aged care vulnerability map onto defining features of humans, giving weight to the claim that vulnerability represents an inherent characteristic of humans. Vulnerability is mostly a value-laden concept, endowed with positive and negative connotations. Most publications focused on and promoted aged care, strengthening the idea that care is a defining practice of being human.","[{""name"": ""Virginia Sanchini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roberta Sala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Gastmans"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11673-015-9641-9"", ""10.4324/9781315624068"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00631.x"", ""10.1111/bioe.12144"", ""10.4324/9780203848531-26"", ""10.1017/S0963180109090203"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-8604-5"", ""10.1186/s12961-016-0164-6"", ""10.1086/292841"", ""10.1007/s10728-005-4477-9"", ""10.1111/j.1748-720X.2012.00640.x"", ""10.2307/3563498"", ""10.1136/jme.2008.025247"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31786-6"", ""10.1177/0164027595174005"", ""10.1016/j.eurger.2011.08.003"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62167-9"", ""10.1093/jmp/jht059"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0423-5"", ""10.1186/s12910-019-0417-3"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.09.012"", ""10.1177/1049732320966981"", ""10.1080/13607863.2017.1286455"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106102"", ""10.1177/2158244013491413"", ""10.4471/rasp.2013.01"", ""10.1111/bioe.12440"", ""10.12968/bjon.2008.17.21.31738"", ""10.1111/j.1440-1800.1995.tb00168.x"", ""10.1177/0969733012447015"", ""10.1002/hast.909"", ""10.1097/01.NOR.0000300951.73247.60"", ""10.1017/S0144686X05004484"", ""10.4037/ccn2015995"", ""10.1353/hcr.2006.0024"", ""10.1001/jama.1991.03470210080037"", ""10.17265/2159-5313/2014.04.004"", ""10.1007/s00391-016-1066-5"", ""10.1016/j.jaging.2017.08.001"", ""10.1093/geront/gnx037"", ""10.1017/S0144686X05004290"", ""10.1093/phe/phu012"", ""10.1177/1178224216684831"", ""10.1177/0969733017742960"", ""10.1037/amp0000104"", ""10.1017/S0144686X05004423"", ""10.2307/3561093"", ""10.1177/0969733014557138"", ""10.1017/S0144686X05004344"", ""10.7196/sajbl.374"", ""10.1007/s40520-016-0714-3"", ""10.1097/00004356-199506000-00001"", ""10.1093/geront/23.2.144"", ""10.1016/0890-4065(94)90018-3"", ""10.1111/jep.12985"", ""10.1093/ageing/afz032"", ""10.1016/j.gerinurse.2010.08.006"", ""10.12968/bjcn.2018.23.10.482"", ""10.1016/S0890-4065(02)00091-9"", ""10.1080/15265160490497083"", ""10.1007/s11017-006-9000-2"", ""10.1111/1467-8519.00362"", ""10.1023/A:1024646912928"", ""10.1097/00006199-199803000-00005"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511621239"", ""10.1111/bioe.12035"", ""10.1111/dewb.12206"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9760.2006.00259.x"", ""10.4324/9780203940266""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Medicine']","['Geriatrics and Gerontology', 'Demography', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.7101), ('0303 社会学', 0.7101)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1093/mind/fzaa011,MIND,0101 Philosophy,The Structure of Bias,"Abstract What is a bias? Standard philosophical views of both implicit and explicit bias focus this question on the representations one harbours, for example, stereotypes or implicit attitudes, rather than the ways in which those representations (or other mental states) are manipulated. I call this approach representationalism. In this paper, I argue that representationalism taken as a general theory of psychological social bias is a mistake, because it conceptualizes bias in ways that do not fully capture the phenomenon. Crucially, this view fails to capture a heretofore neglected possibility of bias, one that influences an individual’s beliefs about or actions toward others, but is, nevertheless, nowhere represented in that individual’s cognitive repertoire. In place of representationalism, I develop a functional account of psychological social bias which characterizes it as a mental entity that takes propositional mental states as inputs and returns propositional mental states as outputs in a way that instantiates social-kind inductions. This functional characterization leaves open which mental states and processes bridge the gap between the inputs and outputs, ultimately highlighting the diversity of candidates that can serve this role.","[{""name"": ""Gabbrielle M Johnson"", ""affiliation"": [""New York University""]}]","[""10.2307/3312397"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.59.3.384"", ""10.1515/9781400836826"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00346.x"", ""10.1027/1618-3169.56.5.329"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1137-0"", ""10.1111/hypa.12170"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00038188"", ""10.1080/05568640409485143"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9973.1993.tb00198.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199581405.001.0001"", ""10.2478/disp-2010-0009"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-72478-2_5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195367638.001.0001"", ""10.1093/mind/IV.14.278"", ""10.1007/s13164-017-0354-3"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314"", ""10.1026//1618-3169.50.2.77"", ""10.1111/spc3.12111"", ""10.1111/mila.12166"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1664.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199250960.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9780470773963"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145225"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1013"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5684.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781444310498"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.132.5.692"", ""10.1111/spc3.12124"", ""10.5840/jphil20081051025"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.102.1.4"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.109.1.3"", ""10.1017/S0140525X13000721"", ""10.1037/pspi0000155"", ""10.1037/a0035028"", ""10.1007/s11218-013-9219-5"", ""10.1093/arisoc/aow005"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0004"", ""10.1111/phc3.12437"", ""10.1007/s10677-007-9068-4"", ""10.1111/bjso.12168"", ""10.1177/1948550614561127"", ""10.5840/jphil2018115413"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199233151.003.0008"", ""10.1111/nous.12039"", ""10.5840/jphil2017114828"", ""10.1111/nous.12074"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.165"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0005"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2017.1373557"", ""10.1111/nous.12182"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9930-7"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262514620.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01587.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.ps.35.020184.000553"", ""10.1521/soco.19.4.395.20759"", ""10.1111/phpe.12105"", ""10.1111/phpr.12478"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00058763"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199640003.001.0001"", ""10.1521/soco.19.6.625.20886"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.277"", ""10.1093/nc/nix015"", ""10.1111/phpr.12224"", ""10.4324/9781315733029-17"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00002053"", ""10.1007/s11098-017-0962-x"", ""10.1080/00048402.2017.1358754"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(83)90044-6"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(85)90037-X"", ""10.1177/0146167218799307"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199325603.003.0003"", ""10.1111/1468-0068.00370"", ""10.1057/9781137026521_5"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674866270"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(84)90010-6"", ""10.1521/soco.1990.8.3.243"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.99.1.3"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00016678"", ""10.1111/mila.12225"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2005.tb00495.x"", ""10.1037/14646-000""]","['Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The tool has so far been translated into numerous languages and is widely used as a valid and reliable instrument to assess a wide range of spiritual needs of patients with chronic diseases, elderly, adolescents, and healthy persons. Its four main factors address Religious needs, Existential needs, Inner Peace needs, and Giving/Generativity needs. Here, the main findings are summarized and discussed.","[{""name"": ""Arndt Büssing"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-52140-0:10"", ""10.1515/spircare-2021-0041"", ""10.1080/14739879.2019.1600383"", ""10.1200/JCO.2006.07.9046"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_17"", ""10.3390/rel2010077"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_8"", ""10.3390/rel1010018"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_34"", ""10.1007/s10943-015-0073-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_25"", ""10.1007/s10943-006-9068-z"", ""10.1111/j.1526-4637.2009.00572.x"", ""10.1186/2047-783X-15-6-266"", ""10.1080/13644360903565524"", ""10.1111/pme.12198"", ""10.3736/jintegrmed2013020"", ""10.1007/s10943-014-9863-x"", ""10.1016/j.wombi.2017.08.002"", ""10.3390/rel9010013"", ""10.3390/rel9040117"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_18"", ""10.1055/a-1135-3566"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-21221-6_2"", ""10.1055/a-1393-9241"", ""10.1097/01.mlr.0000207434.12450.ef"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_20"", ""10.1207/S15327582IJPR1001_2"", ""10.1007/s10943-021-01401-8"", ""10.1515/spircare-2016-0116"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2354.2005.00646.x"", ""10.1515/spircare-2018-0066"", ""10.1097/00004650-200503000-00006"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_23"", ""10.24869/psyd.2017.282"", ""10.1017/s1478951504040490"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_14"", ""10.1097/01.SMJ.0000146490.49723.AE"", ""10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.989"", ""10.1188/06.ONF.737-744"", ""10.31603/nursing.v6i1.2053"", ""10.1111/ecc.12200"", ""10.3390/rel9050163"", ""10.1080/02699930302297"", ""10.1155/2013/280168"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_24"", ""10.1017/S1478951518000652"", ""10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2017.08.024"", ""10.3390/rel11050252"", ""10.1080/08854726.2019.1603916"", ""10.24198/jkp.v3n2.1"", ""10.1111/jocn.14648"", ""10.1155/2013/178547"", ""10.3390/rel11050234"", ""10.1007/s10943-021-01402-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_3"", ""10.1089/jpm.2009.0142"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_12"", ""10.3390/medicina55110738"", ""10.1016/j.ejon.2019.101681"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_9"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01617.x"", ""10.1177/1043659620908926"", ""10.17795/ijpbs-4011"", ""10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.07.008"", ""10.3390/rel9040135"", ""10.1089/jpm.2013.0569"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-70139-0_30"", ""10.1177/082585970802400403"", ""10.1016/j.ijnss.2019.03.010"", ""10.3390/rel2030345""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Demography', 'Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Scrutinizing share repurchases, we investigate a firm’s communicated sustainability orientation (i.e., its environmental and social value orientation) as well as its environmental and social sustainability performance. Our results are based on a large-scale panel dataset of 491 U.S. firms observed from 2004 to 2016. The dataset combines share buyback data with sustainability orientation scores from shareholder letters and sustainability performance ratings. The econometric models suggest no association between social value orientation and repurchase volumes, but a significantly negative relationship between environmental value orientation and buybacks in a cubic form. Executive stock options partially attenuate this relationship. Share repurchases in turn negatively affect future environmental and social performance. This study grasps the consequences of firms’ short-term shareholder satisfaction and discusses its ethical implications in the context of firms’ contribution to sustainable development, thereby providing important insights to the business ethics discourse.","[{""name"": ""Mario Vaupel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Bendig"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Denise Fischer-Kreer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Malte Brettel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/bse.2742"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1063-y"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.111"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1714-2"", ""10.1007/s10551-016-3225-4"", ""10.1002/smj.441"", ""10.2307/20159562"", ""10.1177/1476127013520265"", ""10.5465/annals.2015.0095"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2008.06.004"", ""10.1002/smj.1980"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.57318391"", ""10.1509/jm.16.0200"", ""10.1016/j.jacceco.2003.10.006"", ""10.1016/0165-4101(93)90017-A"", ""10.2307/2555842"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2004.07.004"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9795-z"", ""10.1093/rfs/hhw071"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1422-3"", ""10.1002/smj.2131"", ""10.1017/S0022109015000149"", ""10.1177/0149206309347958"", ""10.1111/jpim.12343"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2015.10.015"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01370.x"", ""10.1177/1042258718773181"", ""10.1093/hebz/9780198810070.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10551-018-3866-6"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-03-2017-0180"", ""10.1002/bse.1980"", ""10.2307/2393512"", ""10.1002/bse.676"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1864-2"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2013.10.004"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(01)00039-3"", ""10.1002/smj.2629"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2015.08.008"", ""10.1093/rcfs/cfy011"", ""10.1002/smj.3134"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1245-2"", ""10.1509/jm.14.0244"", ""10.4337/9781781006214"", ""10.1007/s10551-013-1731-1"", ""10.1111/1540-6261.00474"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00645.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0911-0"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3587-2"", ""10.5465/amr.2012.0341"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2047-5"", ""10.1287/mnsc.28.6.604"", ""10.2307/1913827"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2015.08.009"", ""10.1002/1097-0266(200101)22:2<125::AID-SMJ150>3.0.CO;2-H"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000033109.35980.16"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.10.016"", ""10.1016/j.jacceco.2005.10.002"", ""10.1093/rfs/hht043"", ""10.1016/S0304-405X(01)00095-2"", ""10.1002/smj.2783"", ""10.2308/accr-51383"", ""10.5465/amj.2015.1295"", ""10.2308/accr-51731"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00993.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1614-x"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2009.09.001"", ""10.1515/9781400829453"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9253-8"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1102-8"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2015.11.005"", ""10.1509/jmkg.70.4.001"", ""10.1509/jm.13.0312"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.02.003"", ""10.1287/orsc.2015.1039"", ""10.1007/s10551-019-04134-7"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3601-8"", ""10.1177/0149206316657594"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(200005)21:5<603::AID-SMJ101>3.0.CO;2-3"", ""10.1287/mksc.1060.0261"", ""10.1177/1086026614526413"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.12.004"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6261.1985.tb02395.x"", ""10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2015.08.003"", ""10.1509/jmkg.66.4.25.18513"", ""10.5465/amj.2010.54533188"", ""10.1002/smj.2410"", ""10.1177/1094428117745648"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-53469-5_18"", ""10.2308/jeta-51615"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1419-y"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1211-z"", ""10.2307/257100"", ""10.5465/amj.2007.27156438"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2323-4"", ""10.1177/1094428109335949"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2007.05.003"", ""10.2307/2171753"", ""10.2307/2937861"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2011.10.002"", ""10.1561/0500000007"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2020.10.008"", ""10.2307/1912526"", ""10.2307/259103"", ""10.1162/0034653053970320"", ""10.1002/smj"", ""10.5465/amj.2015.0718""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

Therefore, understanding landslide magnitude and distribution is central to marine and coastal hazard planning. We present the first submarine landslide database for the eastern margin of New Zealand comprising &gt;2200 landslides occurring in water depths from c. 300–4000 m. Landslides are more prevalent and, on average, larger on the active margin compared with the passive margin. We attribute higher concentrations of landslides on the active margin to tectonic processes including uplift and oversteepening, faulting and seamount subduction. Submarine landslide scars are concentrated around canyon systems and close to canyon thalwegs. This suggests that not only does mass wasting play a major role in canyon evolution, but also that canyon-forming processes may provide preconditioning factors for slope failure. Results of this study offer unique insights into the spatial distribution, magnitude and morphology of submarine landslides across different geological settings, providing a better understanding of the causative factors for mass wasting in New Zealand and around the world.","[{""name"": ""S.

Although these experiences are often labelled ‘‘bereavement hallucinations’’, it is unclear what they consist of. Some seem to involve sensory experiences in one or more modalities, while others involve a non-specificfeelingorsenseof presence. I focus on a puzzle concerning the latter: it is unclear how an experience of someone’s presence could arise without a more specific sensory content. I suggest that at least some of these experiences consist in a dynamic and non-localized experience of significant and salientpossibilities. This can amount to the sense of currentlyrelating toa particular individual and, by implication, a sense of that person’s presence. Where an experience of this kind also includes sensory qualities, they are inessential to the sense of relatedness and perhaps symptomatic of it.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Ratcliffe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/713686002"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.032"", ""10.1177/0898010105275928"", ""10.1080/074811897202047"", ""10.1007/s11097-017-9506-2"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199740192.003.0009"", ""10.1080/13674676.2012.678987"", ""10.1177/0022167808323577"", ""10.1007/s11097-020-09657-3"", ""10.1080/13576275.2019.1632277"", ""10.1177/104990918800500407"", ""10.4324/9780203720714"", ""10.1016/0037-7856(70)90115-0"", ""10.1093/med/9780199206469.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10594.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780429061158-6"", ""10.1136/bmj.4.5778.37"", ""10.1177/1363461520962887"", ""10.2190/OM.59.1.e"", ""10.1080/07481187.2011.584758""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

A multitasking care robot pursued for 25 years, available products offer simple entertainment and instrumental assistance","AbstractTwenty-five years ago, robotics guru Joseph Engelberger had a mission to motivate research teams all over the world to design the ‘Elderly Care Giver’, a multitasking personal robot assistant for everyday care needs in old age. In this article, we discuss how this vision of omnipotent care robots has influenced the design strategies of care robotics, the development of R&amp;D initiatives and ethics research on use of care robots. Despite the expectations of robots revolutionizing care of older people, the role of robots in human care has remained marginal. The value of world trade in service robots, including care robots, is rather small. We argue that the implementation of robots in care is not primarily due to negative user attitudes or ethical problems, but to problems in R&amp;D and manufacturing. The care robots currently available on the market are capable of simple, repetitive tasks or colloquial interaction. Thus far, also research on care robots is mostly conducted using imaginary scenarios or small-scale tests built up for research purposes. To develop useful and affordable robot solutions that are ethically, socially and ecologically sustainable, we suggest that robot initiatives should be evaluated within the framework of care ecosystems. This implies that attention has to be paid to the social, emotional and practical contexts in which care is given and received. Also, the political, economic and ecological realities of organizing care and producing technological commodities have to be acknowledged. It is time to openly discuss the drivers behind care robot initiatives to outline the bigger picture of organizing care under conditions of limited resources.","[{""name"": ""Lina Van Aerschot"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jaana Parviainen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4017/gt.2014.13.1.012.00"", ""10.1007/s00146-015-0624-5"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9236-4"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0182736"", ""10.1111/jnu.12435"", ""10.1007/s10677-009-9186-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66802-4_22"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2013.11.022"", ""10.1108/01439910010371588"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2014.09.005"", ""10.1080/10400435.2017.1396565"", ""10.1111/j.1471-6712.2004.00291.x"", ""10.1177/1745691614568352"", ""10.1891/0198-8794.33.313"", ""10.1080/10447318.2016.1275435"", ""10.1332/239788219X15641291564296"", ""10.1093/geront/9.3_Part_1.179"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2010.11.026"", ""10.4324/9780203927076"", ""10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.10.015"", ""10.1111/soc4.12585"", ""10.3389/fnagi.2015.00141"", ""10.1108/IR-04-2018-0060"", ""10.1111/jocn.14355"", ""10.1080/14672710701527378"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9715-4"", ""10.21427/D7472M"", ""10.1007/s10676-014-9338-5"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9234-6"", ""10.1016/j.smhl.2018.03.002"", ""10.1007/s12369-013-0220-0"", ""10.1007/s10676-014-9344-7"", ""10.1007/s11023-006-9030-6"", ""10.1007/s13347-011-0043-6"", ""10.1017/S0144686X17000150"", ""10.1017/S0144686X99007801"", ""10.1007/s13347-011-0015-x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190498511.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11948-011-9343-6"", ""10.1007/s12369-014-0229-z""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In MaxSAT the objective function to be optimized is specified by a set of weighted soft clauses: the objective value of a truth assignment is the sum of the weights of the soft clauses it satisfies. In addition, the MaxSAT problem can have hard clauses that the truth assignment must satisfy. Many optimization problems can be naturally encoded into MaxSAT and this, along with significant performance improvements in MaxSAT solvers, has led to MaxSAT being used in a number of different application areas. This chapter provides a detailed overview of the approaches to MaxSAT solving that have in recent years been most successful in solving real-world optimization problems. Further recent developments in MaxSAT research are also overviewed, including encodings, applications, preprocessing, incomplete solving, algorithm portfolios, partitioning-based solving, and parallel solving.","[{""name"": ""Fahiem Bacchus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matti Järvisalo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ruben Martins"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],['Computer Networks and Communications'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

10.1111/nous.12265,NOUS,0101 Philosophy,"If You Can't Change What You Believe, You Don't Believe It","AbstractI develop and defend the view that subjects are necessarily psychologically able to revise their beliefs in response to relevant counter‐evidence. Specifically, subjects can revise their beliefs in response to relevant counter‐evidence, given their current psychological mechanisms and skills. If a subject lacks this ability, then the mental state in question is not a belief, though it may be some other kind of cognitive attitude, such as a supposition, an entertained thought, or a pretense. The result is a moderately revisionary view of belief: while most mental states we thought were beliefs are beliefs, some mental states which we thought were beliefs are not beliefs. The argument for this view draws on two key claims: First, subjects are rationally obligated to revise their beliefs in response to relevant counter‐evidence. Second, if some subject is rationally obligated to revise one of her mental states, then that subject can revise that mental state, given her current psychological mechanisms and skills. Along the way to defending these claims, I argue that rational obligations can govern activities which reflect on one's rational character, whether or not those activities are under one's voluntary control. I also show how the relevant version of epistemic ‘ought’ implies ‘can’ survives an objection which plagues other variants of the principle.","[{""name"": ""Grace Helton"", ""affiliation"": [""Princeton University""]}]","[""10.2307/2184713"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1554.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0034412500018333"", ""10.2307/2214077"", ""10.1111/j.0268-1064.2005.00281.x"", ""10.1007/s12152-011-9122-8"", ""10.1080/09515089.2015.1110852"", ""10.1093/mind/fzm359"", ""10.1007/s13164-015-0287-7"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0017.2012.01450.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2009.00721.x"", ""10.1353/ppp.2001.0006"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198238089.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2024717"", ""10.1007/s12152-011-9123-7"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9753-y"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2007.00127.x"", ""10.5840/jphil20081051025"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199590728.003.0007"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199672134.003.0005"", ""10.1215/00318108-1263674"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511659904.008"", ""10.1024/0044-3514.38.1.7"", ""10.1111/phc3.12383"", ""10.1093/pq/pqx051"", ""10.1007/s11229-006-9089-x"", ""10.1111/papa.12024"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9714-5"", ""10.1111/j.1088-4963.1999.00105.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00039.x"", ""10.1111/rati.12043"", ""10.1093/mind/fzi509"", ""10.1111/nous.12074"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2017.01.012"", ""10.1007/s11406-012-9366-5"", ""10.1007/s11229-015-0874-2"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2014.858417"", ""10.1111/nous.12089"", ""10.1007/s10670-011-9299-6"", ""10.1111/phis.12007"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0643-7"", ""10.1007/s11406-012-9389-y"", ""10.1353/ppp.2014.0002"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0332-x"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175"", ""10.1353/ppp.2011.0032"", ""10.1007/s12152-016-9295-2"", ""10.4324/9780203846513"", ""10.1353/ppp.2014.0006"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195173079.003.0019"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2004.00030.x"", ""10.1023/A:1024409201289"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.003"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.00215"", ""10.1111/1468-0068.00370"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2010.01381.x"", ""10.1215/00318108-114-4-497"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195389197.001.0001"", ""10.1086/376718"", ""10.1086/659003"", ""10.1086/426957"", ""10.1007/s11098-006-9048-x"", ""10.1086/664752"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0527-9"", ""10.1080/09540260400003982"", ""10.1007/s11229-006-9090-4"", ""10.1086/288832"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2014.11.008"", ""10.1080/13546783.2013.869763"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2014.08.015"", ""10.1080/09515089.2016.1141400"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2017.03.021"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198238256.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-007-9071-6"", ""10.2307/2024703"", ""10.5840/philtopics199624222""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Other forms of harmful leader behavior such as excessively pressuring subordinates or acting in self-centered ways have received less attention, despite being harmful and potentially occurring more frequently. We propose a model of four types of harmful leader behavior (HLB) varying in intensity (high vs low) and orientation (people/relationships or tasks/goals): Intimidation, Lack of Care, Self-Centeredness, and Excessive Pressure for Results. We map out how these relate to other constructs in the unethical leader behavior field in order to integrate the existing work on how leaders can cause harm to followers. Next, in five studies (N = 35, N = 218, N = 352, N = 160, N = 1921 in 196 teams), we develop and test a new survey instrument measuring the four proposed types of perceived HLB. We provide initial validity evidence for this new measure, establish its psychometric properties, and examine its nomological network by linking the four types of HLB to related leadership constructs and soft and hard outcome correlates at the individual and team level. We find that HLB is negatively related to constructive forms of leadership (e.g., ethical and transformational) and positively to unethical ones (e.g., abusive supervision). HLB is also related in the expected direction to job satisfaction, engagement, psychological safety, knowledge sharing, knowledge hiding, deviance, and objectively recorded team-level stress-related absenteeism.","[{""name"": ""Juliana Guedes Almeida"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deanne N.

This quantity represented Gilead’s then full production capacity for July and 90% of its capacity for August and September. Similar deals are evident around access to proposed vaccines for COVID-19, and such deals are only likely to increase. These attempts to secure preferential access to medicines and vaccines, so-called vaccine/treatment nationalism, jeopardise supplies of life-saving treatments and vaccines available elsewhere, and jeopardise global equitable distribution of such vaccines/treatments more generally. Much of the focus to date has been on States’ role in negotiating such deals. However, such developments also demonstrate the power patent holders have in controlling access to life-saving healthcare, determining who obtains access first and at what price. This article argues that the extent of control currently given to patent holders for COVID-19 must be questioned. This article demonstrates that patents have significant implications for healthcare acting as private governance tools over patented inventions. It is only by greater probing of patent holders’ role in delivering access to medicines, diagnostics and vaccines for COVID-19 that equitable global equitable access can be achieved.","[{""name"": ""Aisling McMahon"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Law, National University of Ireland Maynooth, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland""]}]","[""10.1136/bmj.m4057"", ""10.64628/AA.thvgnxtpw"", ""10.64628/AB.jgekdxpdy"", ""10.64628/AAI.mmmfpcmej"", ""10.1016/S2055-6640(20)30018-2"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2014.302236"", ""10.1177/009885880903500202"", ""10.53386/nilq.v71i3.870"", ""10.2471/BLT.17.199364"", ""10.1111/jwip.12091"", ""10.2471/BLT.17.199364"", ""10.1038/s41587-020-0682-1""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management of Technology and Innovation']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)]]"
10.1007/s10676-021-09605-y,ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,0101 Philosophy; 1205 Library and Information Science & Archive Management,Ethical dilemmas are really important to potential adopters of autonomous vehicles,"AbstractThe ethical dilemma (ED) of whether autonomous vehicles (AVs) should protect the passengers or pedestrians when harm is unavoidable has been widely researched and debated. Several behavioral scientists have sought public opinion on this issue, based on the premise that EDs are critical to resolve for AV adoption. However, many scholars and industry participants have downplayed the importance of these edge cases. Policy makers also advocate a focus on higher level ethical principles rather than on a specific solution to EDs. But conspicuously absent from this debate is the view of the consumers or potential adopters, who will be instrumental to the success of AVs. The current research investigated this issue both from a theoretical standpoint and through empirical research. The literature on innovation adoption and risk perception suggests that EDs will be heavily weighted by potential adopters of AVs. Two studies conducted with a broad sample of consumers verified this assertion. The results from these studies showed that people associated EDs with the highest risk and considered EDs as the most important issue to address as compared to the other technical, legal and ethical issues facing AVs. As such, EDs need to be addressed to ensure robustness in the design of AVs and to assure consumers of the safety of this promising technology. Some preliminary evidence is provided about interventions to resolve the social dilemma in EDs and about the ethical preferences of prospective early adopters of AVs.","[{""name"": ""Tripat Gill"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1509/jmkr.45.3.307"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2010.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2020.103349"", ""10.1145/3339904"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0637-6"", ""10.1038/s41586-020-1987-4"", ""10.2777/035239"", ""10.1126/science.aaf2654"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2019.2897447"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190905033.003.0004"", ""10.1002/bdm.2155"", ""10.1038/s41567-020-0921-x"", ""10.1177/1745691620922201"", ""10.1073/pnas.2010202118"", ""10.1038/523024a"", ""10.1038/d41586-019-00766-x"", ""10.1037/xge0000033"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(200001/03)13:1<1::AID-BDM333>3.0.CO;2-S"", ""10.1007/BF00143739"", ""10.1093/jcr/ucaa018"", ""10.1037/a0017346"", ""10.1287/mksc.1050.0144"", ""10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4"", ""10.1509/jmkr.40.4.406.19394"", ""10.1126/science.1091721"", ""10.2307/1914185"", ""10.3390/en11051062"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.127.2.267"", ""10.1007/s13347-017-0284-0"", ""10.1007/s10677-016-9745-2"", ""10.1086/208587"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2017.01.006"", ""10.1007/s10676-017-9430-8"", ""10.1108/EUM0000000002542"", ""10.1086/208642"", ""10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094035"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00334"", ""10.1038/s41562-017-0202-6"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2021.103069"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511808098.025"", ""10.1108/03090569310026637"", ""10.1049/ic.2015.0064"", ""10.1023/A:1024111006336"", ""10.2307/796133"", ""10.1038/518020a"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9456-6""]","['Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

However there are also some potential harms, such as misuse of data and breach of participant confidentiality. One way to promote the benefits of sharing while ameliorating its potential harms is through the adoption of a managed access approach where data requests are channeled through a Data Access Committee (DAC), rather than making data openly available without restrictions. A DAC, whether a formal or informal group of individuals, has the responsibility of reviewing and assessing data access requests. Many individual groups, consortiums, institutional and independent DACs have been established but there is currently no widely accepted framework for their organization and function.Main textWe propose that DACs, should have the role of both promotion of data sharing and protection of data subjects, their communities, data producers, their institutions and the scientific enterprise. We suggest that data access should be granted by DACs as long as the data reuse has potential social value and provided there is low risk of foreseeable harms. To promote data sharing and to motivate data producers, DACs should encourage secondary uses that are consistent with the interests of data producers and their own institutions. Given the suggested roles of DACs, there should be transparent, simple and clear application procedures for data access. The approach to review of applications should be proportionate to the potential risks involved. DACs should be established within institutional and legal frameworks with clear lines of accountability, terms of reference and membership. We suggest that DACs should not be modelled after research ethics committees (RECs) because their functions and goals of review are different from those of RECs. DAC reviews should be guided by the principles of public health ethics instead of research ethics.ConclusionsIn this paper we have suggested a framework under which DACs should operate, how they should be organised, and how to constitute them.","[{""name"": ""Phaik Yeong Cheah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Piasecki"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31282-5"", ""10.1177/1556264615594606"", ""10.12688/f1000research.16523.2"", ""10.56759/rgxl7405"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.2420"", ""10.1177/1556264615592388"", ""10.1126/science.aap8395"", ""10.1002/hast.133"", ""10.1111/bioe.12571"", ""10.1111/bioe.12551"", ""10.1186/gm523"", ""10.2196/jmir.7108"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.8374"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.5630"", ""10.1038/d41586-019-00118-9"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0028071"", ""10.1080/15265161.2010.494215"", ""10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15425.1"", ""10.1525/jer.2013.8.4.1"", ""10.1016/j.inhe.2010.02.001"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-15-12"", ""10.1111/dewb.12031"", ""10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000143"", ""10.7326/M17-0863"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8519.1992.tb00189.x"", ""10.1525/jer.2012.7.3.38"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0028773"", ""10.1136/medethics-2015-102688"", ""10.1136/medethics-2015-103343"", ""10.1093/phe/phx016"", ""10.1002/hast.134"", ""10.1002/pds.3204"", ""10.1007/s11019-014-9586-5"", ""10.1056/NEJM198103053041010"", ""10.1111/j.1748-720X.2003.tb00129.x"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2012.300661"", ""10.1007/s41649-017-0029-5"", ""10.1186/s12910-018-0326-x"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31951-7""]",['Medicine'],"['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Physiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"
10.1017/beq.2020.12,BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY,0101 Philosophy; 1202 Business Administration,Creating Value by Sharing Values: Managing Stakeholder Value Conflict in the Face of Pluralism through Discursive Justification,"ABSTRACTThe question of how to engage with stakeholders in situations of value conflict to create value that includes a plurality of conflicting stakeholder value perspectives represents one of the crucial current challenges of stakeholder engagement as well as of value creation stakeholder theory. To address this challenge, we conceptualize a discursive sharing process between affected stakeholders that is oriented toward discursive justification involving multiple procedural steps. This sharing process provides procedural guidance for firms and stakeholders to create pluralistic stakeholder value through the discursive accommodation of diverging stakeholder value perspectives. The outcomes of such a discursive value-sharing process range from stakeholder value dissensus to low (agreement to disagree) and increasing levels of stakeholder value congruence (value compromise) to stakeholder value consensus (shared values). Hence, this article contributes to the emerging literature on integrative stakeholder engagement by conceptualizing a procedural framework that is neither overly oriented towards dissensus nor consensus.","[{""name"": ""Maximilian J.

Based on an analysis of fair equality of opportunity in sport, I take a critical look at the Semenya case and at IAAF’s DSD Regulations. I distinguish between what I call stable and dynamic inequalities between athletes. Stable inequalities are those that athletes cannot impact or control in any significant way such as inequalities in biological sex, body size and chronological age. Dynamic inequalities, such as inequalities in strength, speed and endurance, or in technical and tactical skills, can be impacted and to a certain extent controlled by athletes. If stable inequalities exert significant and systematic impact on performance, they provide a rationale for classification. If high testosterone level is an inborn, strong and systemic driver of performance development, inequalities in such levels can provide a rationale for classification. As is emphasised by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), this leads to a dilemma of rights: the right of Semenya to compete in sport according to her legal sex and gender identity, and the right of other athletes within the average female testosterone range to compete under fair conditions. I conclude with providing conditional support of the CAS decision in the Semenya case and of IAAF’s DSD Regulations.","[{""name"": ""Sigmund Loland"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/medethics-2019-105532"", ""10.1210/jc.2018-01676"", ""10.1210/er.2018-00020"", ""10.1016/j.csm.2015.10.003"", ""10.1007/s11673-018-9876-3"", ""10.1136/medethics-2019-105532"", ""10.1080/17511321.2013.856460"", ""10.1080/00948705.2016.1157485"", ""10.1177/0193723511426293"", ""10.1080/15265161.2012.680533"", ""10.1080/02640414.2018.1464620"", ""10.22456/1982-8918.46216"", ""10.1136/bjsm.2009.065060"", ""10.1086/233897"", ""10.1123/ssj.8.2.136"", ""10.1007/s40279-014-0249-8"", ""10.1136/bjsports-2017-098446"", ""10.1136/bjsports-2017-097792"", ""10.1007/s40318-019-00143-w"", ""10.1136/bjsports-2013-092400"", ""10.1080/00948705.1999.9714575"", ""10.1080/00948705.2007.9714706"", ""10.1080/00948705.2015.1119048"", ""10.1080/17511320801896091"", ""10.1080/00948705.2013.858394"", ""10.1136/bmj.g2926"", ""10.1080/00948705.2006.9714698""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Social Sciences']","['Genetics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Additionally, to specifically investigate whether the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) have been considered in these AI developments or not. We conducted a scoping review of the literature, which covered publications from March 2020 to April 2021. ​Studies mentioning biases on AI algorithms developed for contact tracing and medical triage or risk prediction regarding COVID-19 were included. From 1054 identified articles, 20 studies were finally included. We propose a typology of biases identified in the literature based on bias, limitations and other ethical issues in both areas of analysis. Results on health disparities and SDOH were classified into five categories: racial disparities, biased data, socio-economic disparities, unequal accessibility and workforce, and information communication. SDOH needs to be considered in the clinical context, where they still seem underestimated. Epidemiological conditions depend on geographic location, so the use of local data in studies to develop international solutions may increase some biases.

This paper systematically reviews the various aspects of the populist phenomenon. After a discussion on different definitions of populism, this paper looks at how the literature discusses the causes of populism, mainly socio-economic factors and emotive factors. Then it discusses how religion and populism interact and can be divided in two broad categories of religious populism and identitarian populism. While, on the surface, the two share similarities, this paper reviews populist manifestations across the world to draw the distinct features between the two forms. Lastly, while pointing out the salient features of religious populism and identitarian populism, this study points out gaps in the research on the relationship between religious populism and other phenomena such as transnational populism, the psychology of populism, the role of emotions in creating support for populism, and populism in Western and non-Western contexts for future areas of research in the field.","[{""name"": ""Ihsan Yilmaz"", ""affiliation"": [""Alfred Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalization, Deakin University, Melbourne 3125, Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Nicholas Morieson"", ""affiliation"": [""The Institute for Religion, Politics and Society, Australian Catholic University, Melbourne 3065, Australia""]}]","[""10.1080/01436590500336690"", ""10.1057/9780230592100"", ""10.1177/1354068808097890"", ""10.16993/ibero.31"", ""10.1073/pnas.1618923114"", ""10.1080/01419870.2017.1294700"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1177/0957926518754416"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330083"", ""10.1177/0032321719847576"", ""10.1177/0791603519827225"", ""10.1093/ia/iiaa220"", ""10.4324/9781351205474-3"", ""10.1108/S0895-993520140000022014"", ""10.1177/0306396818771235"", ""10.3898/SOUN.75.06.2020"", ""10.2307/j.ctvxrpzqv"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2459387"", ""10.1037/a0021847"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316402382"", ""10.1080/00472336.2018.1433225"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511730245"", ""10.1080/00107530.2018.1458347"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.013.34"", ""10.1080/10714839.2019.1650483"", ""10.1080/03057920701467834"", ""10.1080/13510347.2018.1551885"", ""10.1017/gov.2014.13"", ""10.1515/9780804799331"", ""10.1080/13183222.2017.1330086"", ""10.1080/20566093.2017.1292171"", ""10.1111/j.1477-7053.2004.00135.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511492037"", ""10.1080/01402382.2010.508901"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.013.34"", ""10.1355/cs40-2b"", ""10.1017/9781108595841"", ""10.33182/ijor.v1i1.1089"", ""10.4324/9781003007814"", ""10.1111/spsr.12261"", ""10.1007/s12290-015-0347-5"", ""10.1080/03932729.2013.759365"", ""10.1177/0539018417734419"", ""10.1177/0160597618802521"", ""10.1080/09637494.2019.1704611"", ""10.1177/1057567719833139"", ""10.1080/0031322X.2018.1495377"", ""10.1177/1065912916639138"", ""10.3817/0395103009"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2020.1735160"", ""10.1017/S1755048312000776"", ""10.2307/422412"", ""10.4324/9780429356636"", ""10.1215/10474552-7345451"", ""10.1017/9781108961295"", ""10.55271/lp0007"", ""10.55271/op0005"", ""10.1080/01436597.2018.1447371"", ""10.1080/01436597.2021.1896965"", ""10.55271/op0004"", ""10.55271/lp0006"", ""10.1515/jcgs-2017-0005"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198803560.013.34""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1186/s12910-021-00677-5,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,"The social licence for data-intensive health research: towards co-creation, public value and trust","AbstractBackgroundThe rise of Big Data-driven health research challenges the assumed contribution of medical research to the public good, raising questions about whether the status of such research as a common good should be taken for granted, and how public trust can be preserved. Scandals arising out of sharing data during medical research have pointed out that going beyond the requirements of law may be necessary for sustaining trust in data-intensive health research. We propose building upon the use of a social licence for achieving such ethical governance.Main textWe performed a narrative review of the social licence as presented in the biomedical literature. We used a systematic search and selection process, followed by a critical conceptual analysis. The systematic search resulted in nine publications. Our conceptual analysis aims to clarify how societal permission can be granted to health research projects which rely upon the reuse and/or linkage of health data. These activities may be morally demanding. For these types of activities, a moral legitimation, beyond the limits of law, may need to be sought in order to preserve trust. Our analysis indicates that a social licence encourages us to recognise a broad range of stakeholder interests and perspectives in data-intensive health research. This is especially true for patients contributing data. Incorporating such a practice paves the way towards an ethical governance, based upon trust. Public engagement that involves patients from the start is called for to strengthen this social licence.ConclusionsThere are several merits to using the concept of social licence as a guideline for ethical governance. Firstly, it fits the novel scale of data-related risks; secondly, it focuses attention on trustworthiness; and finally, it offers co-creation as a way forward. Greater trust can be achieved in the governance of data-intensive health research by highlighting strategic dialogue with both patients contributing the data, and the public in general. This should ultimately contribute to a more ethical practice of governance.","[{""name"": ""Sam H. A.

10.1111/phpr.12589,PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH,0101 Philosophy,The Two Faces of Mental Imagery,"Mental imagery has often been taken to be equivalent to “sensory imagination”, the perception‐like type of imagination at play when, for example, one visually imagines a flower when none is there, or auditorily imagines a music passage while wearing earplugs. I contend that the equation of mental imagery with sensory imagination stems from a confusion between two senses of mental imagery. In the first sense, mental imagery is used to refer to a psychological attitude, which is perception‐like in nature. In the second sense, mental imagery refers to a mental content, which can be grasped via different attitudes. I will show that failure to acknowledge the distinction between these senses of mental imagery has muddled philosophical discussion. This distinction brings much needed clarity to debates where sensory imagination and mental imagery are invoked, shedding light on issues such as the nature of imagistic mental states, and the representational powers and limits of mental imagery. I will conclude by sketching a general attitudinal account of imagination that does justice to both senses of mental imagery, outlining a promising framework for understanding imagination.","[{""name"": ""Margherita Arcangeli"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut Jean Nicod (CNRS‐EHESS‐ENS)""]}]","[""10.1080/095150899105675"", ""10.1007/s11406-014-9535-9"", ""10.4324/9781315405940"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716808.003.0002"", ""10.5840/philtopics20053311"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9508-1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613517.005"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198250890.003.0004"", ""10.4324/9780203426319"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199262618.003.0029"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198238089.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203721742"", ""10.1515/9783110325966"", ""10.1017/S0031819100059520"", ""10.1093/0195138929.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.644.x"", ""10.1002/9781444343915"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0017.2008.01355.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00042.x"", ""10.4324/9781315657905"", ""10.4324/9781315657905"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00377.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9696-3"", ""10.1111/phpr.12115"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-385522-0.00004-4"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00481.x"", ""10.1111/1468-0017.00205"", ""10.1007/s11098-009-9407-5"", ""10.1111/1468-0017.00206"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2015.08.003"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-37817-5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198798347.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00455091.2018.1442965"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2012.00508.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716808.003.0004"", ""10.1080/00048402.2015.1053953""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

We therefore explored the role of leader narcissism as an antecedent of abusive supervision, a form of unethical leadership. We based our study on the narcissistic admiration and rivalry concept (NARC) and proposed a direct positive effect of leaders’ narcissistic rivalry—the maladaptive narcissism dimension—on abusive supervision. In line with trait activation and threatened egotism theory, we also proposed a moderated mediation assuming that leaders high in narcissistic rivalry would be particularly prone to showing abusive supervision in reaction to followers’ supervisor-directed deviance, as this form of follower behavior would threaten their self-esteem. We conducted a field study with leader–follower dyads (Study 1) and an experimental vignette study with leaders (Study 2). Leaders’ narcissistic rivalry was positively related to abusive supervision (intentions) in both studies. This effect was independent of followers’ supervisor-directed deviance and leaders’ perceived self-esteem threat. We discuss our findings in light of the NARC, as well as threatened egotism theory, and offer directions for future research. Finally, we make practical recommendations for organizations.","[{""name"": ""Iris K.

Towards the end, I describe a way forward for sufficientarians and argue, in stark contrast to Frankfurt, that sufficientarian accounts of distributive justice should be pluralist and are more plausible when they accommodate, rather than reject, other distributive values, such as equality.","[{""name"": ""Liam Shields"", ""affiliation"": [""Politics Department University of Manchester  Manchester UK""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The aim of this paper is to contribute to this task by providing new descriptive tools. In social robotics and HRI it is commonly assumed that social interactions with robots are due to ‘anthropomorphizing’. We challenge this assumption and argue, on conceptual and empirical grounds, that social interactions with robots are not always the result of anthropomorphizing, i.e., the projection of imaginary or fictional human social capacities, but of sociomorphing, i.e., the perception of actual non-human social capacities. Sociomorphing can take many forms which phenomenally manifest themselves in various types of experienced sociality. We very briefly sketch core elements of the descriptive framework OASIS (the Ontology of Asymmetric Social Interactions) in order to show how one might develop a classificatory system for types of experienced sociality.","[{""name"": ""Johanna Seibt"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Unit for Robophilosophy and Integrative Social Robotics, Aarhus University, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Christina Vestergaard"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Unit for Robophilosophy and Integrative Social Robotics, Aarhus University, Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Malene F.

However, little is known about what constitutes a responsible research climate. We investigated academic researchers’ perceptions on this through focus group interviews. We recruited researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the Amsterdam University Medical Center to participate in focus group discussions that consisted of researchers from similar academic ranks and disciplinary fields. We asked participants to reflect on the characteristics of a responsible research climate, the barriers they perceived and which interventions they thought fruitful to improve the research climate. Discussions were recorded and transcribed at verbatim. We used inductive content analysis to analyse the focus group transcripts. We conducted 12 focus groups with 61 researchers in total. We identified fair evaluation, openness, sufficient time, integrity, trust and freedom to be mentioned as important characteristics of a responsible research climate. Main perceived barriers were lack of support, unfair evaluation policies, normalization of overwork and insufficient supervision of early career researchers. Possible interventions suggested by the participants centered around improving support, discussing expectations and improving the quality of supervision. Some of the elements of a responsible research climate identified by participants are reflected in national and international codes of conduct, such as trust and openness. Although it may seem hard to change the research climate, we believe that the realisation that the research climate is suboptimal should provide the impetus for change informed by researchers’ experiences and opinions.","[{""name"": ""Tamarinde Haven"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""H.

However, certain early investigations are marred by questionable research methods, abuses against research participants, and covert Central Intelligence Agency financial involvement. The purpose of this study was to understand how and to what extent people of colour and other vulnerable populations, specifically, individuals who were incarcerated or incapacitated due to mental health issues (inpatients with psychotic disorders), were exploited during the first wave of psychedelic research in the USA (1950–1980). To do so, we reviewed available empirical publications according to current ethical standards. Variables of interest included race and ethnicity of participants, population vulnerability, drug administration conditions, informed consent and undue influence. Our findings draw attention to the history of research abuses against people of colour in Western psychedelic research. In light of these findings, we urge a call-to-action to current psychedelic researchers to prioritise culturally inclusive and socially responsible research methods in current and future studies.","[{""name"": ""Dana Strauss"", ""affiliation"": [""Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Sara de la Salle"", ""affiliation"": [""Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Jordan Sloshower"", ""affiliation"": [""Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA"", ""Psychiatry, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Monnica T Williams"", ""affiliation"": [""Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada""]}]","[""10.1038/npp.2017.84"", ""10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.02.018"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00943"", ""10.1037/h0088594"", ""10.1037/a0038550"", ""10.1136/medhum-2018-011593"", ""10.31887/DCNS.2019.21.2/dnutt"", ""10.1093/jhmas/jrs050"", ""10.1007/s00213-017-4777-4"", ""10.1124/pr.115.011478"", ""10.1177/0269881112439253"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19010035"", ""10.1353/book.3470"", ""10.1056/NEJM199711133372006"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2125.2004.02103.x"", ""10.1136/bmj.2.5402.177"", ""10.1001/jama.2013.281053"", ""10.1016/B978-012655330-7/50008-3"", ""10.1093/shm/hkv031"", ""10.1556/2054.2019.015"", ""10.1186/s12888-018-1824-6"", ""10.1111/bioe.12367"", ""10.1556/2054.2019.032"", ""10.1111/j.1749-6632.1957.tb40738.x"", ""10.31887/DCNS.2001.3.4/fxvollenweider"", ""10.1016/bs.pbr.2018.09.013"", ""10.3389/fphar.2018.00897"", ""10.3389/fphar.2018.00172"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-2992-0"", ""10.21236/AD0351962"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0046608"", ""10.1177/0269881108093587"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.15288/qjsa.1970.31.932"", ""10.1556/2054.2019.022"", ""10.1177/2050324516683325"", ""10.1001/archpsyc.1959.03590010074009"", ""10.1556/2054.2020.00137"", ""10.1353/cpr.2020.0021"", ""10.1556/2054.2019.016"", ""10.2307/3561733"", ""10.1136/jme.17.Suppl.42""]","['Chemistry', 'Nursing', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Nutrition and Dietetics', 'Organic Chemistry']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('1011 护理学', 0.7465), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7157), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7101), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7061), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7035)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7392), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7295)], [('0703 化学', 0.7525), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7384)]]"
10.1007/s10677-021-10239-8,ETHICAL THEORY AND MORAL PRACTICE,0101 Philosophy,Realism and Political Normativity,"AbstractA prevailing understanding of realism, chiefly among its critics, casts realists as those who seek a ‘distinctively political normativity’, where this is interpreted as meaning nonmoral in kind. Moralists, on this account, are those who reject this and believe that political normativity remains moral. Critics have then focused much of their attention on demonstrating that the search for a nonmoral political normativity is doomed to fail which, if right, would then seem to fatally undermine the realist endeavour. This paper makes the case that casting the difference between realism and moralism in these terms is a mistake, one which overlooks the substantial body of realist work which is clear that it has no such aspirations to develop a nonmoral political normativity. The hope is that in drawing attention to this mistake a line can be drawn under these unhelpful debates, and we can move on to more fruitful constructive and critical discussions between realists and their critics.","[{""name"": ""Matt Sleat"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1474885113483284"", ""10.1017/S0003055418000527"", ""10.4159/9780674972728"", ""10.7312/slea17528-014"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511490187"", ""10.7312/slea17528-009"", ""10.1017/S0007123413000148"", ""10.1080/13698230.2017.1293353"", ""10.1177/1474885110374001"", ""10.7312/slea17528-006"", ""10.1515/9781400835515"", ""10.1515/9781400848485"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201440433"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12070"", ""10.1177/1474885115577820"", ""10.1177/1369148117744956"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226718453.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13698230.2017.1293343"", ""10.1086/681262"", ""10.1177/1478929919832251"", ""10.5840/jpr201511539"", ""10.1086/697449"", ""10.1177/1474885117718371"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511975325"", ""10.1080/13698230.2017.1293914"", ""10.7312/slea17528-012"", ""10.1177/1474885116664825"", ""10.1017/S0265052516000339"", ""10.1057/9780333977873"", ""10.1177/1474885110374007"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139628860"", ""10.7312/slea17528-005"", ""10.4159/9780674276802"", ""10.1177/1474885110374010"", ""10.1017/S0265052516000200"", ""10.7312/slea17528-010"", ""10.1177/0191453715583711"", ""10.1080/13698230.2017.1293908"", ""10.1111/ejop.12193"", ""10.1111/1467-8675.12446"", ""10.1111/phc3.12148"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12173"", ""10.1017/S0034670519000226"", ""10.1177/1474885110382689"", ""10.7228/manchester/9780719088902.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0090591714522250"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.12152"", ""10.1057/ip.2015.38"", ""10.1177/1755088216628323"", ""10.1017/S0265052516000285"", ""10.7312/slea17528"", ""10.4159/9780674970342"", ""10.4324/9780203828281"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226944685.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674981423""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Our purpose in this paper is to consider what posthuman affirmative business ethics would look like, and to reflect on the shift in thinking and practice this would involve. The need for a revised understanding of human–animal relations in business ethics is amplified by crises such as climate change and pandemics that are related to ecologically destructive business practices such as factory farming. In this analysis, we use feminist speculative fiction as a resource for reimagination and posthuman ethical thinking. By focusing on three ethical movements experienced by a central character named Toby in Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy, we show how she is continually becoming through affective, embodied encounters with human and nonhuman others. In the discussion, we consider the vulnerability that arises from openness to affect which engenders heightened response-ability to and with, rather than for, multiple others. This expanded concept of subjectivity enables a more relational understanding of equality that is urgently needed in order to respond affirmatively to posthuman futures.","[{""name"": ""Janet Sayers"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lydia Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emma Bell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/0013838X.2010.518042"", ""10.1108/09534810910967189"", ""10.1177/0021989410395430"", ""10.1177/0263276418771486"", ""10.1007/s11673-020-10017-8"", ""10.1080/10436928.2012.676914"", ""10.1215/00265667-2782351"", ""10.1007/s10551-020-04666-3"", ""10.4324/9781315599205"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-1072-x"", ""10.1023/A:1006039813148"", ""10.1108/09534810910967198"", ""10.1177/1350508419883377"", ""10.1177/1077800420943643"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8608.2010.01589.x"", ""10.1007/s10806-014-9522-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-56577-4_14"", ""10.22329/p.v8i2.4087"", ""10.1080/10848770.2011.575597"", ""10.1177/1350508416629448"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11cw25q"", ""10.1038/nature09575"", ""10.1177/1350508416629967"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.1996.tb00799.x"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9038-0"", ""10.7560/713062"", ""10.1002/sd.1619"", ""10.3390/ani5030376"", ""10.1111/gwao.12047"", ""10.1007/s10551-017-3589-0"", ""10.1111/1745-5871.12388"", ""10.1177/1350508416677176"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2639-8"", ""10.1111/gwao.12277"", ""10.1007/BF00382923"", ""10.1093/phe/phw003"", ""10.4135/9781446280171.n5"", ""10.1080/19460171.2014.883858"", ""10.1093/af/vfz014"", ""10.1023/A:1006419715108""]","['Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Geography, Planning and Development', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

So far, discussions about the ethics of this technology have focused on privacy concerns, efficacy, and uptake. However, important issues regarding power imbalances and vulnerability also warrant attention. As demonstrated in other forms of digital surveillance, vulnerable subpopulations pay a higher price for surveillance measures. There is reason to worry that some types of COVID-19 technology might lead to the employment of disproportionate profiling, policing, and criminalization of marginalized groups. It is, thus, of crucial importance to interrogate vulnerability in COVID-19 apps and ensure that the development, implementation, and data use of this surveillance technology avoids exacerbating vulnerability and the risk of harm to surveilled subpopulations, while maintaining the benefits of data collection across the whole population. This paper outlines the major challenges and a set of values that should be taken into account when implementing disease surveillance technology in the pandemic response.","[{""name"": ""Tereza Hendl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ryoa Chung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Verina Wild"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31102-8"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3588172"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2012910"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748646920.003.0012"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30792-3"", ""10.1093/jhuman/huw007"", ""10.1515/9781588269560"", ""10.1001/jamahealthforum.2020.0535"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30137-0"", ""10.1353/pbm.2018.0028"", ""10.3402/gha.v8.27969"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-0832-5"", ""10.5749/j.ctvz0h9s7"", ""10.1002/hast.490"", ""10.2190/M11W-VWXE-KQM9-G97Q"", ""10.1353/pbm.2018.0029"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3590788"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3582550"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-01009-0"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106314"", ""10.1215/9781478004493-009"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195375138.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.012"", ""10.3138/ijfab.5.2.11"", ""10.1215/9781478004493-007"", ""10.1007/s40592-015-0038-7"", ""10.1186/1472-6939-7-12"", ""10.1353/hcr.2007.0064"", ""10.2190/986L-LHQ6-2VTE-YRRN""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Mathematics']","['Epidemiology', 'Information Systems', 'Modeling and Simulation']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)]]"
10.1007/s11229-021-03355-6,SYNTHESE,0101 Philosophy; 0712 History of Science and Technology,Metastable attunement and real-life skilled behavior,"AbstractIn everyday situations, and particularly in some sport and working contexts, humans face an inherently unpredictable and uncertain environment. All sorts of unpredictable and unexpected things happen but typically people are able to skillfully adapt. In this paper, we address two key questions in cognitive science. First, how is an agent able to bring its previously learned skill to bear on a novel situation? Second, how can an agent be both sensitive to the particularity of a given situation, while remaining flexibly poised for many other possibilities for action? We will argue that both the sensitivity to novel situations and the sensitivity to a multiplicity of action possibilities are enabled by the property of skilled agency that we will callmetastable attunement. We characterize a skilled agent’s flexible interactions with a dynamically changing environment in terms of metastable dynamics in agent-environment systems. What we find in metastability is the realization of two competing tendencies: the tendency of the agent to express their intrinsic dynamics and the tendency to search for new possibilities. Metastably attuned agents are ready to engage with a multiplicity of affordances, allowing for a balance between stability and flexibility. On the one hand, agents are able to exploit affordances they are attuned to, while at the same time being ready to flexibly explore for other affordances. Metastable attunement allows agents to smoothly transition between these possible configurations so as to adapt their behaviour to what the particular situation requires. We go on to describe the role metastability plays in learning of new skills, and in skilful behaviour more generally. Finally, drawing upon work in art, architecture and sports science, we develop a number of perspectives on how to investigate metastable attunement in real life situations.","[{""name"": ""Jelle Bruineberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ludovic Seifert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erik Rietveld"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julian Kiverstein"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.psychsport.2004.12.003"", ""10.7551/mitpress/10764.003.0031"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2020.102897"", ""10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01564-3"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-1716-9"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00599"", ""10.1123/mcj.12.3.219"", ""10.1016/S0167-9457(96)00023-1"", ""10.3758/s13414-015-0872-y"", ""10.1080/09515080701239510"", ""10.1073/pnas.231499798"", ""10.1006/nimg.1997.0259"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00383"", ""10.4324/9781410600479"", ""10.1080/10407413.2018.1410045"", ""10.4324/9780203559055"", ""10.1080/10407410701432337"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2528.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10407410801949297"", ""10.1098/rstb.2011.0351"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1988.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-019-02123-x"", ""10.1007/s00221-005-0208-6"", ""10.4324/9780203994610"", ""10.1146/annurev.ps.42.020191.001241"", ""10.1016/j.humov.2017.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.jsams.2012.01.002"", ""10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01976-9"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02610-6"", ""10.1177/0959354308089789"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-00610-3_3"", ""10.1007/s40279-016-0520-2"", ""10.1007/s11097-016-9475-x"", ""10.1080/10407413.2014.958035"", ""10.1007/s10339-019-00921-2"", ""10.1016/j.humov.2017.05.001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01819"", ""10.1007/s40279-012-0011-z"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.jsams.2013.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.humov.2010.12.003"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0089865"", ""10.2307/1131321"", ""10.1016/j.humov.2007.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2013.12.022"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-3360-3"", ""10.1017/S0140525X01000097"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-02013-8"", ""10.1080/10407413.2003.9652753"", ""10.1037/0096-3445.132.3.331"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6730.001.0001"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.113.2.358"", ""10.1007/s40279-015-0448-y"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.humov.2009.09.003""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

From the perspective of these communities, this comes at considerable cost to the spiritual good that these religious services bring about. Empirical evidence also indicates that the suspension of these services will have costs concerning physical and mental health as well. However, in the case of a pandemic, because it is an infectious disease that is the concern, love of neighbor arguably does entail the suspension of services for the sake of the preservation of life for others. Religious communities and individuals can, and have, found ways to partially offset the losses from not being able to meet. These have included increased personal and family prayer and devotion, video-streaming of services, and online prayer and discussion meetings. While none of these fully compensates for the loss of in-person meetings, the sacrifice entailed may itself be seen as a means to greater love of God and love of neighbor.","[{""name"": ""Tyler J.

Since AMR has important similarities to climate change—both are common pool resource challenges that require massive, long-term political commitments—the first article in this special issue draws lessons from various climate agreements that could be applicable for developing a grand bargain on AMR. We consider the similarities and differences between the Paris Climate Agreement and current governance structures for AMR, and identify the merits and challenges associated with different international forums for developing a long-term international agreement on AMR. To be effective, fair, and feasible, an enduring legal agreement on AMR will require a combination of universal, differentiated, and individualized requirements, nationally determined contributions that are regularly reviewed and ratcheted up in level of ambition, a regular independent scientific stocktake to support evidence informed policymaking, and a concrete global goal to rally support.","[{""name"": ""Susan Rogers Van Katwyk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alberto Giubilini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claas Kirchhelle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isaac Weldon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Harrison"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Angela McLean"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julian Savulescu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Steven J.

10.1186/s12910-020-00524-z,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,0101 Philosophy; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Ethics parallel research: an approach for (early) ethical guidance of biomedical innovation,"AbstractBackgroundOur human societies and certainly also (bio) medicine are more and more permeated with technology. There seems to be an increasing awareness among bioethicists that an effective and comprehensive approach to ethically guide these emerging biomedical innovations into society is needed. Such an approach has not been spelled out yet for bioethics, while there are frequent calls for ethical guidance of biomedical innovation, also by biomedical researchers themselves. New and emerging biotechnologies require anticipation of possible effects and implications, meaning the scope is not evaluative after a technology has been fully developed or about hypothetical technologies, but real-time for a real biotechnology.Main textIn this paper we aim to substantiate and discuss six ingredients that we increasingly see adopted by ethicists and that together constitute “ethics parallel research”. This approach allows to fulfil two aims: guiding the development process of technologies in biomedicine and providing input for the normative evaluation of such technologies. The six ingredients of ethics parallel research are: (1) disentangling wicked problems, (2) upstream or midstream ethical analysis, (3) ethics from within, (4) inclusion of empirical research, (5) public participation and (6) mapping societal impacts, including hard and soft impacts. We will draw on gene editing, organoid technology and artificial intelligence as examples to illustrate these six ingredients.ConclusionEthics parallel research brings together these ingredients to ethically analyse and proactively or parallel guide technological development. It widens the roles and judgements from the ethicist to a more anticipatory and constructively guiding role. Ethics parallel research is characterised by a constructive, rather than a purely critical perspective, it focusses on developing best-practices rather than outlining worst practice, and draws on insights from social sciences and philosophy of technology.","[{""name"": ""Karin R.

But existing technological proposals risk addressing the wrong problem. The proper objective is notsolelyto maximise the ratio of people freed from quarantine but to also ensure that the composition of the freed group is fair. We identify several factors that pose a risk for fair group composition along with an analysis of general lessons for a philosophy of technology.

Although there are many unknowns surrounding COVID-19 vaccine development, vaccine demand will likely outstrip early supply, making prospective planning for vaccine allocation critical for ensuring the ethical distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we propose three central goals for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns: to reduce morbidity and mortality, to minimise additional economic and societal burdens related to the pandemic and to narrow unjust health inequalities. We evaluate five prioritisation approaches, assess their likely impact on advancing the three goals of vaccine allocation and identify open scientific questions that may alter their outcomes. We argue that no single prioritisation approach will advance all three goals. Instead, we propose a multipronged approach that considers the risk of serious COVID-19 illness, instrumental value and the risk of transmission, and is guided by future research on COVID-19-specific clinical and vaccine characteristics. While we focus this assessment on the USA, our analysis can inform allocation in other contexts.","[{""name"": ""Rohit Gupta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephanie R Morain"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1001/jama.2020.8711"", ""10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5"", ""10.1038/d41573-020-00151-8"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1679"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106516"", ""10.2105/AJPH.91.11.1776"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30893-X"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2005689"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.5046"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.1585"", ""10.2307/2626958"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa2021680"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-01354-0"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31200-9"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.05.057"", ""10.1353/hpu.2005.0054"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.01.089""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"
10.1007/s11229-023-04334-9,SYNTHESE,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0101 Philosophy,Beyond generalization: a theory of robustness in machine learning,"AbstractThe termrobustnessis ubiquitous in modern Machine Learning (ML). However, its meaning varies depending on context and community. Researchers either focus on narrow technical definitions, such as adversarial robustness, natural distribution shifts, and performativity, or they simply leave open what exactly they mean by robustness. In this paper, we provide a conceptual analysis of the termrobustness, with the aim to develop a common language, that allows us to weave together different strands of robustness research. We define robustness as the relative stability of a robustness target with respect to specific interventions on a modifier. Our account captures the various sub-types of robustness that are discussed in the research literature, including robustness to distribution shifts, prediction robustness, or the robustness of algorithmic explanations. Finally, we delineate robustness from adjacent key concepts in ML, such as extrapolation, generalization, and uncertainty, and establish it as an independent epistemic concept.","[{""name"": ""Timo Freiesleben"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Grote"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.inffus.2021.05.008"", ""10.3390/app11020796"", ""10.1109/37.158898"", ""10.1145/3313831.3376718"", ""10.1007/s13194-018-0232-6"", ""10.1086/716542"", ""10.1007/s11023-021-09569-4"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-01949-1"", ""10.1038/s42256-020-00266-y"", ""10.1086/709729"", ""10.1038/s42256-021-00338-7"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00040"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wrc78"", ""10.1109/MIS.2020.3000681"", ""10.1007/s11229-022-03975-6"", ""10.1007/s11023-018-9481-6"", ""10.1145/2090236.2090255"", ""10.1126/science.aaw4399"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2104626"", ""10.1007/s11023-021-09580-9"", ""10.1038/s42256-020-00257-z"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013681"", ""10.1080/10618600.2014.907095"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11296"", ""10.1086/710839"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.1992.227294"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1559-7"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372836"", ""10.1145/2840728.2840730"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2019.12.002"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00013"", ""10.1038/ncomms5914"", ""10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00823"", ""10.1098/rspa.2015.0142"", ""10.1145/2046684.2046692"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00928-1_17"", ""10.1007/s10994-021-05946-3"", ""10.1007/s13194-021-00350-z"", ""10.1093/bjps/axy031"", ""10.1080/1350178X.2021.1952290"", ""10.1038/s41746-020-00367-3"", ""10.1609/aaai.v37i10.26398"", ""10.1038/s41593-018-0210-5"", ""10.1093/bjps/axp049"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375833"", ""10.1145/3447548.3470799"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00727"", ""10.1145/3236386.3241340"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00036"", ""10.1086/657427"", ""10.1007/s10551-021-04939-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-43418-1_28"", ""10.1086/418301"", ""10.1086/661566"", ""10.1093/bjps/axv037"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803161"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262170055.001.0001"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00249"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-1796-6"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939778"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0048-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-43823-4_18"", ""10.1145/3501714.3501755"", ""10.1093/bjps/axw008"", ""10.1145/3531146.3534635"", ""10.1145/3398394"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107298019"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375865"", ""10.1016/0004-3702(95)00039-H"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375830"", ""10.1093/bjps/axx036"", ""10.1007/s11229-021-03233-1"", ""10.1093/bjps/axz035"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02080.x"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1390-1"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372876"", ""10.1111/jopp.12262"", ""10.1007/s11229-022-03456-w"", ""10.1086/518628"", ""10.1038/s41467-021-27699-2"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-0123-9_3"", ""10.1093/0195155270.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13501780600733376"", ""10.1109/ICCVW.2019.00401"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2886017"", ""10.1145/3128572.3140449"", ""10.1007/s13347-019-00382-7"", ""10.1145/3446776"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-9326-7""]",['Computer Science'],['Artificial Intelligence'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
