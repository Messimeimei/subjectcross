10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.17,JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS,0401 Education,Sample size determination and power analysis using the G*Power software,"Appropriate sample size calculation and power analysis have become major issues in research and publication processes. However, the complexity and difficulty of calculating sample size and power require broad statistical knowledge, there is a shortage of personnel with programming skills, and commercial programs are often too expensive to use in practice. The review article aimed to explain the basic concepts of sample size calculation and power analysis; the process of sample estimation; and how to calculate sample size using G*Power software (latest ver. 3.1.9.7; Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany) with 5 statistical examples. The null and alternative hypothesis, effect size, power, alpha, type I error, and type II error should be described when calculating the sample size or power. G*Power is recommended for sample size and power calculations for various statistical methods (F, t, χ2, Z, and exact tests), because it is easy to use and free. The process of sample estimation consists of establishing research goals and hypotheses, choosing appropriate statistical tests, choosing one of 5 possible power analysis methods, inputting the required variables for analysis, and selecting the “calculate” button. The G*Power software supports sample size and power calculation for various statistical methods (F, t, χ2, z, and exact tests). This software is helpful for researchers to estimate the sample size and to conduct power analysis.","[{""name"": ""Hyun Kang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4097/kja.19497"", ""10.17085/apm.2015.10.1.6"", ""10.1001/jama.1994.03520020048013"", ""10.1056/NEJM197809282991304"", ""10.1001/jama.288.3.358"", ""10.1016/s0140-6736(97)02290-3"", ""10.4097/kja.20662"", ""10.3344/kjp.2021.34.1.1"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.3000410"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-134-8-200104170-00012"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.0040296"", ""10.1592/phco.21.5.405.34503"", ""10.1198/000313001300339897"", ""10.3758/BRM.41.4.1149""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Mathematics']","['Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"

10.3102/0013189X20912798,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,Interpreting Effect Sizes of Education Interventions,"Researchers commonly interpret effect sizes by applying benchmarks proposed by Jacob Cohen over a half century ago. However, effects that are small by Cohen’s standards are large relative to the impacts of most field-based interventions. These benchmarks also fail to consider important differences in study features, program costs, and scalability. In this article, I present five broad guidelines for interpreting effect sizes that are applicable across the social sciences. I then propose a more structured schema with new empirical benchmarks for interpreting a specific class of studies: causal research on education interventions with standardized achievement outcomes. Together, these tools provide a practical approach for incorporating study features, costs, and scalability into the process of interpreting the policy importance of effect sizes.","[{""name"": ""Matthew A.

10.3390/educsci13040410,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature,"An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.","[{""name"": ""Chung Kwan Lo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Information Technology, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China""]}]","[""10.2196/27850"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1145/3448250"", ""10.1093/bmb/ldab016"", ""10.1037/a0034752"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4312418"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4335905"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4354422"", ""10.1101/2023.02.19.23286155"", ""10.1186/2046-4053-1-10"", ""10.1186/s12916-015-0465-6"", ""10.1093/ptj/89.9.873"", ""10.1007/s40593-023-00372-z"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4359407"", ""10.1371/journal.pdig.0000198"", ""10.2196/45312"", ""10.1016/j.resuscitation.2023.109732"", ""10.1101/2023.02.13.23285879"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4324310"", ""10.21203/rs.3.rs-2584079/v1"", ""10.56741/jpes.v2i01.302"", ""10.1002/ase.2261"", ""10.35542/osf.io/sytu3"", ""10.35542/osf.io/j3m9b"", ""10.1080/08982112.2023.2206479"", ""10.1109/ICSTW58534.2023.00078"", ""10.31219/osf.io/ks365"", ""10.1186/s40561-023-00237-x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4331313"", ""10.5038/2771-5957.2.1.1016"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.12669/pjms.39.2.7653"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4337484"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4338981"", ""10.20944/preprints202302.0400.v1"", ""10.35542/osf.io/mrz8h"", ""10.36227/techrxiv.21789434.v1"", ""10.1371/journal.pdig.0000205"", ""10.1007/s12195-022-00754-8"", ""10.35542/osf.io/n5m7s"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4361548"", ""10.35542/osf.io/fnh48"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4332664"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4334162"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2180191"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4360052"", ""10.1186/s41039-016-0044-2"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2021.100393"", ""10.1186/s12909-022-03782-0"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2184392"", ""10.1126/science.adg7879""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1073/pnas.1916903117,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,0401 Education,"Active learning narrows achievement gaps for underrepresented students in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math","We tested the hypothesis that underrepresented students in active-learning classrooms experience narrower achievement gaps than underrepresented students in traditional lecturing classrooms, averaged across all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and courses. We conducted a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished studies that compared the performance of underrepresented students to their overrepresented classmates in active-learning and traditional-lecturing treatments. This search resulted in data on student examination scores from 15 studies (9,238 total students) and data on student failure rates from 26 studies (44,606 total students). Bayesian regression analyses showed that on average, active learning reduced achievement gaps in examination scores by 33% and narrowed gaps in passing rates by 45%. The reported proportion of time that students spend on in-class activities was important, as only classes that implemented high-intensity active learning narrowed achievement gaps. Sensitivity analyses showed that the conclusions are robust to sampling bias and other issues. To explain the extensive variation in efficacy observed among studies, we propose the heads-and-hearts hypothesis, which holds that meaningful reductions in achievement gaps only occur when course designs combine deliberate practice with inclusive teaching. Our results support calls to replace traditional lecturing with evidence-based, active-learning course designs across the STEM disciplines and suggest that innovations in instructional strategies can increase equity in higher education.","[{""name"": ""Elli J.

The impacts of this on the academic community as frontline providers of higher education are profound. In this article, we report the findings from a survey ofn = 1148 academics working in universities in the United Kingdom (UK) and representing all the major disciplines and career hierarchy. Respondents report an abundance of what we call ‘afflictions’ exacted upon their role as educators and in far fewer yet no less visible ways ‘affordances’ derived from their rapid transition to online provision and early ‘entry-level’ use of digital pedagogies. Overall, they suggest that online migration is engendering significant dysfunctionality and disturbance to their pedagogical roles and their personal lives. They also signpost online migration as a major challenge for student recruitment, market sustainability, an academic labour-market, and local economies.","[{""name"": ""Richard Watermeyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tom Crick"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cathryn Knight"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Janet Goodall"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7551/mitpress/11456.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315715780"", ""10.1080/13596748.2011.626971"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-01144-8"", ""10.1007/s10699-015-9444-9"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2273.2012.00512.x"", ""10.1080/03075079.2015.1007946"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0084-y"", ""10.1126/science.abb5793"", ""10.1080/14767724.2018.1524287"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2273.2010.00467.x"", ""10.1080/17439884.2019.1656235"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-7620-6"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-01135-9"", ""10.1080/00131857.2017.1381472"", ""10.5040/9781474235952"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30757-1"", ""10.1080/13538322.2019.1603611"", ""10.1126/science.abc2255"", ""10.4337/9781788976138"", ""10.1080/17508487.2020.1737556""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

In this study, we produced a series of projections of COVID-19-related learning loss based on (a) estimates from absenteeism literature and (b) analyses of summer learning patterns of 5 million students. Under our projections, returning students are expected to start fall 2020 with approximately 63 to 68% of the learning gains in reading and 37 to 50% of the learning gains in mathematics relative to a typical school year. However, we project that losing ground during the school closures was not universal, with the top third of students potentially making gains in reading.","[{""name"": ""Megan Kuhfeld"", ""affiliation"": [""NWEA, Portland, OR""]}, {""name"": ""James Soland"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA""]}, {""name"": ""Beth Tarasawa"", ""affiliation"": [""NWEA, Portland, OR""]}, {""name"": ""Angela Johnson"", ""affiliation"": [""NWEA, Portland, OR""]}, {""name"": ""Erik Ruzek"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA""]}, {""name"": ""Jing Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Maryland, College Park, MD""]}]","[""10.3102/0013189X17692999"", ""10.3102/01623737023002171"", ""10.1093/qje/qjaa027"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2016.08.007"", ""10.1086/499195"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2354.2006.00408.x"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043237"", ""10.1177/003804070407700101"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01247.x"", ""10.3102/00346543066003227"", ""10.3102/00028312018002219"", ""10.3386/w21216"", ""10.1093/jeg/lbx014"", ""10.1162/EDFP_a_00207"", ""10.3386/w20221"", ""10.1177/2332858419832852"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2018.03.004"", ""10.1007/s13524-011-0086-4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00839.x"", ""10.1016/j.ssresearch.2007.08.007"", ""10.3102/0034654313483906"", ""10.1177/0031721719871560"", ""10.3102/0013189X20977854"", ""10.3102/0013189X20965918"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3457657"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2006.08.001"", ""10.1162/edfp.2008.3.3.316"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2008017"", ""10.1080/02732170701534267"", ""10.1257/app.4.1.109"", ""10.1007/s13524-016-0462-1"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2010.10.002"", ""10.15195/v6.a3"", ""10.1177/0038040718801760"", ""10.1177/2332858417703660"", ""10.1086/694111""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Education']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Wearable and stretchable strain sensors have received extensive research interest due to their applications in personalized healthcare, human motion detection, human–machine interfaces, soft robotics, and beyond. The disconnection of overlapped nanomaterials, reversible opening/closing of microcracks in sensing films, and alteration of the tunneling resistance have been successfully adopted to develop high‐performance resistive‐type sensors. On the other hand, the sensing behavior of capacitive‐type and optical strain sensors is largely governed by their geometrical changes under stretching/releasing cycles. The sensor design parameters, including stretchability, sensitivity, linearity, hysteresis, and dynamic durability, are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the promising applications of wearable strain sensors are highlighted in detail. Although considerable progress has been made so far, wearable strain sensors are still in their prototype stage, and several challenges in the manufacturing of integrated and multifunctional strain sensors should be yet tackled.","[{""name"": ""Hamid Souri"", ""affiliation"": [""Aroa Biosurgery Limited  Auckland 2022 New Zealand""]}, {""name"": ""Hritwick Banerjee"", ""affiliation"": [""Locomotion in Biorobotic and Somatic Systems Group Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems  Stuttgart 70569 Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Ardian Jusufi"", ""affiliation"": [""Locomotion in Biorobotic and Somatic Systems Group Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems  Stuttgart 70569 Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Norbert Radacsi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering Institute for Materials and Processes The University of Edinburgh  Robert Stevenson Road Edinburgh EH9 3FB UK""]}, {""name"": ""Adam A.

10.1007/s10956-023-10039-y,JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Examining Science Education in ChatGPT: An Exploratory Study of Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Abstract The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential in the field of education. The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT’s output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer. The intention of the paper is to act as a catalyst for a broader conversation about the use of generative AI in science education.","[{""name"": ""Grant Cooper"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/14681366.2012.748676"", ""10.2505/9780873552080"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2022.107468"", ""10.1080/00131857.2020.1728732"", ""10.1080/09500693.2019.1662135"", ""10.1080/03057260802681821"", ""10.1080/17425960801976321"", ""10.1007/s11165-016-9590-2"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1"", ""10.3390/info13010014"", ""10.1177/10776958221149577"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-43620-9_18"", ""10.1038/d41586-023-00107-z"", ""10.2478/jagi-2019-0002"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100061"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4312418""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1186/s41239-023-00411-8,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Students' voices on generative AI: perceptions, benefits, and challenges in higher education","AbstractThis study explores university students’ perceptions of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher education, focusing on familiarity, their willingness to engage, potential benefits and challenges, and effective integration. A survey of 399 undergraduate and postgraduate students from various disciplines in Hong Kong revealed a generally positive attitude towards GenAI in teaching and learning. Students recognized the potential for personalized learning support, writing and brainstorming assistance, and research and analysis capabilities. However, concerns about accuracy, privacy, ethical issues, and the impact on personal development, career prospects, and societal values were also expressed. According to John Biggs’ 3P model, student perceptions significantly influence learning approaches and outcomes. By understanding students’ perceptions, educators and policymakers can tailor GenAI technologies to address needs and concerns while promoting effective learning outcomes. Insights from this study can inform policy development around the integration of GenAI technologies into higher education.

10.1007/s40692-020-00169-2,JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION,0401 Education,Immersive virtual reality as a pedagogical tool in education: a systematic literature review of quantitative learning outcomes and experimental design,"AbstractThe adoption of immersive virtual reality (I-VR) as a pedagogical method in education has challenged the conceptual definition of what constitutes a learning environment. High fidelity graphics and immersive content using head-mounted-displays (HMD) have allowed students to explore complex subjects in a way that traditional teaching methods cannot. Despite this, research focusing on learning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with I-VR use has been sparse. To explore this, the current systematic review examined experimental studies published since 2013, where quantitative learning outcomes using HMD based I-VR were compared with less immersive pedagogical methods such as desktop computers and slideshows. A literature search yielded 29 publications that were deemed suitable for inclusion. Included papers were quality assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Most studies found a significant advantage of utilising I-VR in education, whilst a smaller number found no significant differences in attainment level regardless of whether I-VR or non-immersive methods were utilised. Only two studies found clear detrimental effects of using I-VR. However, most studies used short interventions, did not examine information retention, and were focused mainly on the teaching of scientific topics such as biology or physics. In addition, the MERSQI showed that the methods used to evaluate learning outcomes are often inadequate and this may affect the interpretation of I-VR’s utility. The review highlights that a rigorous methodological approach through the identification of appropriate assessment measures, intervention characteristics, and learning outcomes is essential to understanding the potential of I-VR as a pedagogical method.","[{""name"": ""D.

10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.32,JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS,0401 Education,Educational applications of metaverse: possibilities and limitations,"This review aims to define the 4 types of the metaverse and to explain the potential and limitations of its educational applications. The metaverse roadmap categorizes the metaverse into 4 types: augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror world, and virtual reality. An example of the application of augmented reality in medical education would be an augmented reality T-shirt that allows students to examine the inside of the human body as an anatomy lab. Furthermore, a research team in a hospital in Seoul developed a spinal surgery platform that applied augmented reality technology. The potential of the metaverse as a new educational environment is suggested to be as follows: a space for new social communication; a higher degree of freedom to create and share; and the provision of new experiences and high immersion through virtualization. Some of its limitations may be weaker social connections and the possibility of privacy impingement; the commission of various crimes due to the virtual space and anonymity of the metaverse; and maladaptation to the real world for students whose identity has not been established. The metaverse is predicted to change our daily life and economy beyond the realm of games and entertainment. The metaverse has infinite potential as a new social communication space. The following future tasks are suggested for the educational use of the metaverse: first, teachers should carefully analyze how students understand the metaverse; second, teachers should design classes for students to solve problems or perform projects cooperatively and creatively; third, educational metaverse platforms should be developed that prevent misuse of student data.","[{""name"": ""Bokyung Kye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nara Han"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eunji Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yeonjeong Park"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Soyoung Jo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.17232/KSET.36.3.505"", ""10.15833/KAFEIAM.27.1.079"", ""10.1038/nsmb.2119""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge. Biomarkers have always played an important role in clinical decision making in various infectious diseases. It is crucial to assess the role of biomarkers in evaluating severity of disease and appropriate allocation of resources.Design and settingSystematic review and meta-analysis. English full text observational studies describing the laboratory findings and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, medRxiv using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 following Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.ParticipantsStudies having biomarkers, including lymphocyte, platelets, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, procalcitonin (PCT) and creatine kinase (CK), and describing outcomes were selected with the consensus of three independent reviewers.Main outcome measuresComposite poor outcomes include intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation &lt;90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilisation, severe disease, in-hospital admission and mortality. The OR and 95% CI were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed by sensitivity analysis.Results32 studies with 10 491 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. We found that lymphopenia (pooled-OR: 3.33 (95% CI: 2.51–4.41); p&lt;0.00001), thrombocytopenia (2.36 (1.64–3.40); p&lt;0.00001), elevated D-dimer (3.39 (2.66–4.33); p&lt;0.00001), elevated CRP (4.37 (3.37–5.68); p&lt;0.00001), elevated PCT (6.33 (4.24–9.45); p&lt;0.00001), elevated CK (2.42 (1.35–4.32); p=0.003), elevated AST (2.75 (2.30–3.29); p&lt;0.00001), elevated ALT (1.71 (1.32–2.20); p&lt;0.00001), elevated creatinine (2.84 (1.80–4.46); p&lt;0.00001) and LDH (5.48 (3.89–7.71); p&lt;0.00001) were independently associated with higher risk of poor outcomes.ConclusionOur study found a significant association between lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of CRP, PCT, LDH, D-dimer and COVID-19 severity. The results have the potential to be used as an early biomarker to improve the management of COVID-19 patients, by identification of high-risk patients and appropriate allocation of healthcare resources in the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Preeti Malik"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Urvish Patel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deep Mehta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nidhi Patel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raveena Kelkar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Akrmah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Janice L Gabrilove"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry Sacks"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.46234/ccdcw2020.032"", ""10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100618"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa330"", ""10.14309/ajg.0000000000000620"", ""10.1007/s42399-020-00393-y"", ""10.33588/rn.7009.2020179"", ""10.1111/ane.13266"", ""10.1007/s00134-020-05991-x"", ""10.1183/13993003.00547-2020"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2010419"", ""10.1001/jama.283.15.2008"", ""10.1172/jci.insight.137799"", ""10.18632/aging.103255"", ""10.1186/s40560-020-00453-4"", ""10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.086"", ""10.7189/jogh.10.020506"", ""10.1038/s41368-020-0074-x"", ""10.4049/jimmunol.169.8.4288"", ""10.1186/1741-7015-9-107"", ""10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.004"", ""10.5492/wjccm.v8.i5.74"", ""10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104370"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa248"", ""10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106023"", ""10.1111/jth.13911"", ""10.1111/jth.14859"", ""10.12932/AP-200220-0772"", ""10.1002/hep.30203"", ""10.14218/JCTH.2020.00018"", ""10.1016/j.jhep.2020.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.002"", ""10.1016/s01406736(20)30211-7"", ""10.1016/S0146736(20)30183-5"", ""10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.073"", ""10.1101/2020.03.24.20040162"", ""10.1172/jci137244"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994"", ""10.1016/SO140-6736(20)30566-3"", ""10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.kint.2020.03.005"", ""10.1515/dx-2020-0058"", ""10.1515/cclm-2020-0369"", ""10.1080/10408363.2020.1770685"", ""10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117788"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.1585"", ""10.1111/all.14238"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa272"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3"", ""10.26355/eurrev_202003_20711"", ""10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.16.2000460"", ""10.1186/s12879-020-05010-w"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2010419"", ""10.1002/jmv.25783"", ""10.1016/j.cmi.2020.04.012"", ""10.1631/jzus.B2000174"", ""10.3349/ymj.2020.61.5.431"", ""10.1371/journal.pntd.0008280"", ""10.1183/13993003.00524-2020"", ""10.1002/oby.22943"", ""10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e209"", ""10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.002"", ""10.1186/s12879-020-05128-x"", ""10.1093/ofid/ofaa187"", ""10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104364"", ""10.18632/aging.103633"", ""10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.006"", ""10.1186/s12879-020-05252-8"", ""10.1186/s13054-020-03098-9"", ""10.1186/s40249-020-00710-6"", ""10.3201/eid2608.201776""]",['Medicine'],"['Neurology', 'Oncology', 'Infectious Diseases']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7465), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7432)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02208-z,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,The sudden transition to synchronized online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: a qualitative study exploring medical students' perspectives,"Abstract Background The closure of educational activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unplanned shift from traditional learning to a setup that exclusively involves digital teaching and learning. Within this context, the present study aimed to explore undergraduate medical students’ perceptions regarding the effectiveness of synchronized online learning at Unaizah College of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using virtual focus group discussions synchronously with the help of a discussion guide consisting of seven open-ended questions. Overall, 60 medical students were recruited using a maximum variation sampling technique; these students then participated in eight focus group discussions. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for thematic contents using the standard (Mayring, Kiger. M. E. and Braun.V) content analysis framework. Results A thematic content analysis yielded four core themes: (1) educational impact, (2) time management, (3) challenges encountered, and (4) preferences for the future. The online modality was well-received, and all participants agreed that online sessions were time saving and that their performance was improved due to enhanced utility of time; however, they indicated that they encountered some challenges, including methodological, content perception, technical, and behavioral challenges during sessions and online exams. Most of the preclinical students preferred online learning for the upcoming academic years. Conclusion Synchronized online classes were well-accepted by the medical students. This represents significant and promising potential for the future of medical education.

It has also been linked to an increase in behavioural, affective and cognitive student engagement, the facilitation of which is a central concern of educators. In order to delineate the complex nexus of technology and student engagement, this article systematically maps research from 243 studies published between 2007 and 2016. Research within the corpus was predominantly undertaken within the United States and the United Kingdom, with only limited research undertaken in the Global South, and largely focused on the fields of Arts &amp; Humanities, Education, and Natural Sciences, Mathematics &amp; Statistics. Studies most often used quantitative methods, followed by mixed methods, with little qualitative research methods employed. Few studies provided a definition of student engagement, and less than half were guided by a theoretical framework. The courses investigated used blended learning and text-based tools (e.g. discussion forums) most often, with undergraduate students as the primary target group. Stemming from the use of educational technology, behavioural engagement was by far the most often identified dimension, followed by affective and cognitive engagement. This mapping article provides the grounds for further exploration into discipline-specific use of technology to foster student engagement.","[{""name"": ""Melissa Bond"", ""affiliation"": []},

While some descriptions conflate value-based health care and cost reduction, quality improvement, or patient satisfaction, those efforts—while important—are not the same as value, which focuses primarily on improving patient health outcomes. A decade of research into organizations that have achieved better outcomes while often lowering costs suggests a strategic framework for value-based health care implementation that starts with identifying and understanding a segment of patients whose health and related circumstances create a consistent set of needs. An interdisciplinary team of caregivers then comes together to design and deliver comprehensive solutions to address those needs. The team measures the health outcomes and costs of its care for each patient and uses that information to drive ongoing improvements. Care provided in this way aligns delivery with how patients experience their health and reconnects clinicians to their purpose as healers. It also asks physicians to think differently about their role within the larger care team and about the services that team provides. The authors suggest medical schools should incorporate education on the principles and implementation of value-based health care throughout the undergraduate medical curriculum to prepare their graduates to lead the transformation to value-based health care as they enter the physician workforce.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth Teisberg"", ""affiliation"": [""is executive director, Value Institute for Health and Care, Cullen Trust for Higher Education Distinguished University Chair in Value-Based Care, Dell Medical School, and professor, McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.""]}, {""name"": ""Scott Wallace"", ""affiliation"": [""is managing director, Value Institute for Health and Care, and associate professor, Department of Education, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.""]}, {""name"": ""Sarah O’Hara"", ""affiliation"": [""is a course and content specialist, Value Institute for Health and Care, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.""]}]","[""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002534"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.27.3.759"", ""10.1370/afm.1713"", ""10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.02.010"", ""10.1053/j.semtcvs.2009.03.003"", ""10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002511""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/medu.14380,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Interpretive description: A flexible qualitative methodology for medical education research,"AbstractBackgroundQualitative research approaches are increasingly integrated into medical education research to answer relevant questions that quantitative methodologies cannot accommodate. However, researchers have found that traditional qualitative methodological approaches reflect the foundations and objectives of disciplines whose aims are recognizably different from the medical education domain of inquiry (Thorne, 2016, Interpretive description. New York, NY: Routledge). Interpretive description (ID), a widely used qualitative research method within nursing, offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data within medical education research. ID is an appropriate methodological alternative for medical education research, as it can address complex experiential questions while producing practical outcomes. It allows for the advancement of knowledge surrounding educational experience without sacrificing methodological integrity that long‐established qualitative approaches provide.PurposeIn this paper, we present interpretive description as a useful research methodology for qualitative approaches within medical education. We then provide a toolkit for medical education researchers interested in incorporating interpretive description into their study design. We propose a coherent set of strategies for identifying analytical frameworks, sampling, data collection, analysis, rigour and the limitations of ID for medical education research. We conclude by advocating for the interpretive description approach as a viable and flexible methodology for medical education research.","[{""name"": ""Julie Thompson Burdine"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Surgery Michigan Medicine Ann Arbor MI USA""]}, {""name"": ""Sally Thorne"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Nursing University of British Columbia Vancouver BC Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Gurjit Sandhu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Surgery Michigan Medicine Ann Arbor MI USA""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315426259"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-240X(199704)20:2<169::AID-NUR9>3.0.CO;2-I"", ""10.1097/00012272-198907000-00010"", ""10.1177/160940690400300101"", ""10.1007/s10964-010-9611-9"", ""10.1177/089431849200500205"", ""10.1177/1049732309344612"", ""10.1177/1049732303253488"", ""10.1177/160940690300200201"", ""10.1177/1049732304269888"", ""10.1016/j.surg.2016.06.026"", ""10.1186/1472-6963-12-433"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2005.02378.x"", ""10.1177/1468794103033004"", ""10.1177/104973239200200406"", ""10.1177/104973239500500108"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-13-52"", ""10.1007/s40037-017-0384-7"", ""10.1002/nur.21635"", ""10.1186/1471-2393-13-S1-S13"", ""10.1016/j.colegn.2018.07.005"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005653"", ""10.1186/s12912-015-0061-2"", ""10.1089/jpm.2017.0079"", ""10.1177/160940691101000301"", ""10.1177/1049732311421177"", ""10.3102/0013189X022002023"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511557842"", ""10.1093/fampra/13.6.522"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip3903_2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527937.005"", ""10.4135/9781446280119.n21"", ""10.1080/2159676X.2011.572180"", ""10.1177/1609406917733847"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02272.x"", ""10.1007/BF02765185"", ""10.1136/ebn.3.3.68"", ""10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosg070"", ""10.1023/A:1020909529486"", ""10.1080/0951839900030105a"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2354.2009.01125.x"", ""10.1080/14780887.2014.955224"", ""10.1080/09650799700200020"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1915891"", ""10.1111/medu.13124"", ""10.4324/9781315429250"", ""10.1177/160940690200100202""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02257-4,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Distance learning in clinical medical education amid COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan: current situation, challenges, and perspectives","Abstract Background As COVID-19 has been declared as a pandemic disease by the WHO on March 11th, 2020, the global incidence of COVID-19 disease increased dramatically. In response to the COVID-19 situation, Jordan announced the emergency state on the 19th of March, followed by the curfew on 21 March. All educational institutions have been closed as well as educational activities including clinical medical education have been suspended on the 15th of March. As a result, Distance E-learning emerged as a new method of teaching to maintain the continuity of medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic related closure of educational institutions. Distance E-Learning is defined as using computer technology to deliver training, including technology-supported learning either online, offline, or both. Before this period, distance learning was not considered in Jordanian universities as a modality for education. This study aims to explore the situation of distance E-learning among medical students during their clinical years and to identify possible challenges, limitations, satisfaction as well as perspectives for this approach to learning. Methods This cross-sectional study is based on a questionnaire that was designed and delivered to medical students in their clinical years. For this study, the estimated sample size (n = 588) is derived from the online Raosoft sample size calculator. Results A total of 652 students have completed the questionnaire, among them, 538 students (82.5%) have participated in distance learning in their medical schools amid COVID-19 pandemic. The overall satisfaction rate in medical distance learning was 26.8%, and it was significantly higher in students with previous experience in distance learning in their medical schools as well as when instructors were actively participating in learning sessions, using multimedia and devoting adequate time for their sessions. The delivery of educational material using synchronous live streaming sessions represented the major modality of teaching and Internet streaming quality and coverage was the main challenge that was reported by 69.1% of students. Conclusion With advances in technologies and social media, distance learning is a new and rapidly growing approach for undergraduate, postgraduate, and health care providers. It may represent an optimal solution to maintain learning processes in exceptional and emergency situations such as COVID-19 pandemic. Technical and infrastructural resources reported as a major challenge for implementing distance learning, so understanding technological, financial, institutional, educators, and student barriers are essential for the successful implementation of distance learning in medical education.","[{""name"": ""Mahmoud Al-Balas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hasan Ibrahim Al-Balas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hatim M.

10.1007/s11423-020-09767-4,ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,0401 Education,From digital literacy to digital competence: the teacher digital competency (TDC) framework,"AbstractOver the years, a variety of frameworks, models and literacies have been developed to guide teacher educators in their efforts to build digital capabilities in their students, that will support them to use new and emerging technologies in their future classrooms. Generally, these focus on advancing students’ skills in using ‘educational’ applications and digitally-sourced information, or understanding effective blends of pedagogical, content and technological knowledge seen as supporting the integration of digital resources into teaching, to enhance subject learning outcomes. Within teacher education institutions courses developing these capabilities are commonly delivered as standalone entities, or there is an assumption that they will be generated by technology’s integration in other disciplines or through mandated assessment. However, significant research exists suggesting the current narrow focus on subject-related technical and information skills does not prepare students adequately with the breadth of knowledge and capabilities needed in today’s classrooms, and beyond. This article presents a conceptual framework introducing an expanded view of teacher digital competence (TDC). It moves beyond prevailing technical and literacies conceptualisations, arguing for more holistic and broader-based understandings that recognise the increasingly complex knowledge and skills young people need to function ethically, safely and productively in diverse, digitally-mediated environments. The implications of the framework are discussed, with specific reference to its interdisciplinary nature and the requirement of all faculty to engage purposefully and deliberately in delivering its objectives. Practical suggestions on how the framework might be used by faculty, are presented.","[{""name"": ""Garry Falloon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/1475939X.2016.1163283"", ""10.1007/s11423-014-9363-4"", ""10.1111/mbe.12025"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9711-9"", ""10.1080/21532974.2017.1291249"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02733.x"", ""10.1080/09585176.2012.703492"", ""10.1080/21532974.2012.10784704"", ""10.1111/bjet.12381"", ""10.1007/s11528-017-0171-7"", ""10.11120/elss.2013.05010025"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2009.00322.x"", ""10.1080/15391523.2009.10782536"", ""10.1002/jaal.713"", ""10.1080/00220270500422665"", ""10.1080/00377996.2015.1124376"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.06.008"", ""10.1007/s11528-017-0227-8"", ""10.14221/ajte.2013v38n11.5"", ""10.1177/002205741319300303"", ""10.1080/09523987.2011.576512"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-044894-7.00493-0"", ""10.18261/ISSN1891-943X-2014-04-04"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00684.x"", ""10.4236/ce.2015.616171"", ""10.1177/0022487104272055"", ""10.18261/ISSN1891-943X-2014-04-02"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.026"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-25813-8_13"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2009.10.024"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.07.009"", ""10.1111/jpc.13023"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2009.00341.x"", ""10.1080/00098655.2019.1679070"", ""10.3102/0013189X015002004"", ""10.1080/21532974.2011.10784678"", ""10.1080/09523987.2019.1681110"", ""10.2190/9JW6-VV1P-FAX8-CGE0"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2016.1174730"", ""10.1177/016555150002600602""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1186/s41239-023-00392-8,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Artificial intelligence in higher education: the state of the field,"AbstractThis systematic review provides unique findings with an up-to-date examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022, publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE publications, new trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the US to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most studied students at 72%. Similar to the findings of other studies, language learning was the most common subject domain. This included writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the AIEd was intended for 72% of the studies focused on students, 17% instructors, and 11% managers. In answering the overarching question of how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools, such as Chat GPT.","[{""name"": ""Helen Crompton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diane Burke"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7575/aiac.alls.v.7n.1p.5"", ""10.1002/cae.21971"", ""10.1177/0049124118799372"", ""10.1007/s13369-021-05873-4"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988510"", ""10.14742/ajet.7526"", ""10.1016/S0262-4079(16)31992-3"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2020.04.011"", ""10.1007/s43545-022-00425-5"", ""10.1080/15391523.2022.2121344"", ""10.35575/rvuen.n62a1"", ""10.1007/s40593-020-00223-1"", ""10.1007/s40593-020-00215-1"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2020.05.078"", ""10.3390/educsci9010051"", ""10.1007/s42438-019-00046-x"", ""10.3390/math9060584"", ""10.1002/cae.22075"", ""10.1007/s11251-015-9366-5"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00317-3"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1958348"", ""10.1111/bjet.13147"", ""10.1111/bjet.12876"", ""10.1186/2046-4053-4-1"", ""10.1007/s40593-020-00210-6"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1558257"", ""10.20368/1971-8829/1135285"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-10925-9"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.1186/s41039-017-0062-8"", ""10.1002/cae.22452"", ""10.1186/S41239-022-00326-w"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2019.06.010"", ""10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9503-0"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2019.05.015"", ""10.1155/2022/2156111"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1155/2022/8503239"", ""10.1080/01434632.2022.2102175""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02007-6,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,A systematic review of the factors - enablers and barriers - affecting e-learning in health sciences education,"AbstractBackgroundRecently, much attention has been given to e-learning in higher education as it provides better access to learning resources online, utilising technology – regardless of learners’ geographical locations and timescale – to enhance learning. It has now become part of the mainstream in education in the health sciences, including medical, dental, public health, nursing, and other allied health professionals. Despite growing evidence claiming that e-learning is as effective as traditional means of learning, there is very limited evidence available about what works, and when and how e-learning enhances teaching and learning. This systematic review aimed to identify and synthesise the factors – enablers and barriers – affecting e-learning in health sciences education (el-HSE) that have been reported in the medical literature.MethodsA systemic review of articles published on e-learning in health sciences education (el-HSE) was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied &amp; Complementary Medicine, DH-DATA, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Global Health, from 1980 through 2019, using ‘Textword’ and ‘Thesaurus’ search terms. All original articles fulfilling the following criteria were included: (1) e-learning was implemented in health sciences education, and (2) the investigation of the factors – enablers and barriers – about el-HSE related to learning performance or outcomes. Following the PRISMA guidelines, both relevant published and unpublished papers were searched. Data were extracted and quality appraised using QualSyst tools, and synthesised performing thematic analysis.ResultsOut of 985 records identified, a total of 162 citations were screened, of which 57 were found to be of relevance to this study. The primary evidence base comprises 24 papers, with two broad categories identified, enablers and barriers, under eight separate themes: facilitate learning; learning in practice; systematic approach to learning; integration of e-learning into curricula; poor motivation and expectation; resource-intensive; not suitable for all disciplines or contents, and lack of IT skills.ConclusionsThis study has identified the factors which impact on e-learning: interaction and collaboration between learners and facilitators; considering learners’ motivation and expectations; utilising user-friendly technology; and putting learners at the centre of pedagogy. There is significant scope for better understanding of the issues related to enablers and facilitators associated with e-learning, and developing appropriate policies and initiatives to establish when, how and where they fit best, creating a broader framework for making e-learning effective.","[{""name"": ""Krishna Regmi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Linda Jones"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4135/9781446212585"", ""10.1001/jama.300.10.1181"", ""10.1097/00001888-200603000-00002"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2004.02.001"", ""10.1089/tmj.2012.0175"", ""10.1097/00001888-200506000-00005"", ""10.1111/j.1470-3327.2005.00614.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2005.02173.x"", ""10.1002/9781118308455"", ""10.1111/jan.12509"", ""10.1002/chp.1340240105"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2006.3.3"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d6c319"", ""10.1111/inr.12015"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2012.12.017"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD011736.pub2"", ""10.1097/00001888-200603000-00002"", ""10.1136/bmj.39057.406644.68"", ""10.1136/bmj.330.7495.829"", ""10.1007/s10278-015-9828-y"", ""10.1186/1478-4491-11-4"", ""10.1353/pbm.2008.0007"", ""10.1016/j.cppeds.2014.01.004"", ""10.4018/978-1-61692-843-8.ch015"", ""10.3102/00346543074003379"", ""10.1186/1865-1380-4-51"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed1000097"", ""10.1136/bmj.320.7227.114"", ""10.4324/9780203413081_chapter_9"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02200.x"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.675456"", ""10.1080/14739879.2006.11864084"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0593-5"", ""10.1080/13814780902864160"", ""10.1080/01421590802334317"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0738-6"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2015.12.33"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2008.07.056"", ""10.1093/occmed/kqn053"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.939579"", ""10.3402/meo.v21.29516"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2015.05.013"", ""10.1111/jocn.12450"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0716-z"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05453.x"", ""10.12669/pjms.35.4.12"", ""10.1097/CIN.0000000000000456"", ""10.1590/S0104-11692007000300006"", ""10.3108/beej.10.9"", ""10.1097/01.NEP.0000000000000490"", ""10.1002/9780470754887"", ""10.1111/j.1741-6612.2008.00298.x"", ""10.1186/s12904-016-0079-6"", ""10.4018/978-1-59140-726-3"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-08846-8_2"", ""10.1080/13562517.2010.522080"", ""10.1111/j.1473-6861.2008.00170.x"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.1998.t01-1-00580.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-08846-8_6"", ""10.1097/00001888-200210001-00028"", ""10.21125/edulearn.2017.0985"", ""10.1002/9780470712184""]","['Medicine', 'Dentistry', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Health', 'General Dentistry']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.78), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7342), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7246), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7141), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7138)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.7328), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6867)]]"

10.24059/olj.v24i2.2285,ONLINE LEARNING,0401 Education,U.S. Faculty and Administrators' Experiences and Approaches in the Early Weeks of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and rapid impact on higher education institutions across the world. In this study, we report the findings of a survey investigating the rapid transition to emergency remote teaching in the early weeks of the pandemic at public and private post-secondary institutions in the United States. Participants consisted of 897 faculty and administrators at 672 U.S. institutions. Findings reveal that with few exceptions nearly all reporting institutions transitioned to emergency teaching and learning approaches. Administrators reported that faculty with and without online teaching experience pivoted to online teaching, and nearly all administrators indicated that those who did not have online teaching experience were in the process of learning how to teach online. Regardless of whether faculty had previous experience teaching online or not, many faculty reported that they were using new teaching methods. A majority of faculty reported making changes to their assignments or exams as a result of transitioning to a new mode of delivery. Nearly half reported lowering the expected volume of work for students (including dropping assignments or exams) and/or shifting to a pass/fail model for this semester. The primary areas where faculty and administrators identified a need for assistance related to student support, greater access to online digital materials, and guidance for working from home. This study provides an early snapshot of efforts towards teaching and learning continuity at a large scale and provides some insights for future research and practice.","[{""name"": ""Nicole Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""George Veletsianos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeff Seaman"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

However, all too often, these words are used interchangeably or without a clear understanding of the differences between these concepts. Further problematizing this situation is the fact that theory, theoretical framework, and conceptual framework are terms that are used in different ways in different research approaches. In this article, the authors set out to clarify the meaning of these terms and to describe how they are used in 2 approaches to research commonly used in HPE: the objectivist deductive approach (from theory to data) and the subjectivist inductive approach (from data to theory). In addition to this, given that within subjectivist inductive research theory, theoretical framework, and conceptual framework can be used in different ways, they describe 3 uses that HPE researchers frequently rely on: fully inductive theory development, fully theory-informed inductive, and theory-informing inductive data analysis.","[{""name"": ""Lara Varpio"", ""affiliation"": [""L.

10.1111/jcal.12610,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,Chatbots for language learning-Are they really useful? A systematic review of chatbot-supported language learning,"AbstractBackgroundThe use of chatbots as learning assistants is receiving increasing attention in language learning due to their ability to converse with students using natural language. Previous reviews mainly focused on only one or two narrow aspects of chatbot use in language learning. This review goes beyond merely reporting the specific types of chatbot employed in past empirical studies and examines the usefulness of chatbots in language learning, including first language learning, second language learning, and foreign language learning.AimsThe primary purpose of this review is to discover the possible technological, pedagogical, and social affordances enabled by chatbots in language learning.Materials &amp; MethodsWe conducted a systematic search and identifies 25 empirical studies that examined the use of chatbots in language learning. We used the inductive grounded approach to identify the technological and pedagogical affordances, and the challenges of using chatbots for students’ language learning. We used Garrison's social presence framework to analyze the social affordances of using chatbots in language learningResultsOur findings revealed three technological affordances: timeliness, ease of use, and personalization; and five pedagogical uses: as interlocutors, as simulations, for transmission, as helplines, and for recommendations. Chatbots appeared to encourage students’ social presence by affective, open, and coherent communication. Several challenges in using chatbots were identified: technological limitations, the novelty effect, and cognitive load.Discussion and ConclusionA set of rudimentary design principles for chatbots are proposed for meaningfully implementing educational chatbots in language learning, and detailed suggestions for future research are presented.","[{""name"": ""Weijiao Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education The University of Hong Kong  Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Khe Foon Hew"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education The University of Hong Kong  Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Luke K.

10.1002/ase.1968,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,Forced Disruption of Anatomy Education in Australia and New Zealand: An Acute Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Australian and New Zealand universities commenced a new academic year in February/March 2020 largely with “business as usual.” The subsequent Covid‐19 pandemic imposed unexpected disruptions to anatomical educational practice. Rapid change occurred due to government‐imposed physical distancing regulations from March 2020 that increasingly restricted anatomy laboratory teaching practices. Anatomy educators in both these countries were mobilized to adjust their teaching approaches. This study on anatomy education disruption at pandemic onset within Australia and New Zealand adopts a social constructivist lens. The research question was “What are the perceived disruptions and changes made to anatomy education in Australia and New Zealand during the initial period of the Covid‐19 pandemic, as reflected on by anatomy educators?.” Thematic analysis to elucidate “the what and why” of anatomy education was applied to these reflections. About 18 anatomy academics from ten institutions participated in this exercise. The analysis revealed loss of integrated “hands‐on” experiences, and impacts on workload, traditional roles, students, pedagogy, and anatomists' personal educational philosophies. The key opportunities recognized for anatomy education included: enabling synchronous teaching across remote sites, expanding offerings into the remote learning space, and embracing new pedagogies. In managing anatomy education's transition in response to the pandemic, six critical elements were identified: community care, clear communications, clarified expectations, constructive alignment, community of practice, ability to compromise, and adapt and continuity planning. There is no doubt that anatomy education has stepped into a yet unknown future in the island countries of Australia and New Zealand.","[{""name"": ""Nalini Pather"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Anatomy Education School of Medical Sciences Faculty of Medicine University of New South Wales Sydney New South Wales Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Phil Blyth"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Anatomy School of Biomedical Sciences University of Otago Dunedin New Zealand""]}, {""name"": ""Jamie A.

10.1007/s10639-022-11177-3,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Interacting with educational chatbots: A systematic review,"AbstractChatbots hold the promise of revolutionizing education by engaging learners, personalizing learning activities, supporting educators, and developing deep insight into learners’ behavior. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the recent evidence-based chatbot-learner interaction design techniques applied in education. This study presents a systematic review of 36 papers to understand, compare, and reflect on recent attempts to utilize chatbots in education using seven dimensions: educational field, platform, design principles, the role of chatbots, interaction styles, evidence, and limitations. The results show that the chatbots were mainly designed on a web platform to teach computer science, language, general education, and a few other fields such as engineering and mathematics. Further, more than half of the chatbots were used as teaching agents, while more than a third were peer agents. Most of the chatbots used a predetermined conversational path, and more than a quarter utilized a personalized learning approach that catered to students’ learning needs, while other chatbots used experiential and collaborative learning besides other design principles. Moreover, more than a third of the chatbots were evaluated with experiments, and the results primarily point to improved learning and subjective satisfaction. Challenges and limitations include inadequate or insufficient dataset training and a lack of reliance on usability heuristics. Future studies should explore the effect of chatbot personality and localization on subjective satisfaction and learning effectiveness.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Amin Kuhail"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nazik Alturki"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Salwa Alramlawi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kholood Alhejori"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.13053/cys-19-4-2326"", ""10.1007/s11423-011-9196-3"", ""10.1109/TLT.2017.2682084"", ""10.1109/TLT.2017.2682084"", ""10.1145/2940325"", ""10.2196/17158"", ""10.1007/s10956-009-9180-4"", ""10.1080/10447318.2020.1841438"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00233-y"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2018.02.004"", ""10.1109/TE.2019.2924385"", ""10.1016/j.intcom.2008.02.004"", ""10.1006/ijhc.1999.0325"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.045"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.2009.00575.x"", ""10.1348/000709904X19254"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(02)00085-4"", ""10.3102/0034654315581420"", ""10.1109/TLT.2010.41"", ""10.9743/jeo.2019.16.1.8"", ""10.1037/a0031955"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.129"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.09.011"", ""10.1002/cae.22326"", ""10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.41"", ""10.1109/TLT.2017.2698471"", ""10.1080/01449290500260538"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2021.107007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103862"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3372.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.07.014"", ""10.1007/s40593-013-0007-3"", ""10.1080/03640210709336984"", ""10.3390/su12041500"", ""10.1007/s11412-011-9111-2"", ""10.1145/365153.365168"", ""10.1016/j.specom.2009.05.006"", ""10.1109/URC49805.2020.9099191"", ""10.1145/2702123.2702592"", ""10.1109/ECAI.2018.8678948"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61425-0_40"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29384-0_15"", ""10.1145/3272973.3273006"", ""10.1145/3236669"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01689-0_23"", ""10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028667"", ""10.4018/978-1-60960-495-0"", ""10.1145/1111449.1111488"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17705-8_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-07596-9_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19937-0_15"", ""10.4018/978-1-60960-617-6.ch006"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-30139-4_46"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1952615"", ""10.1109/ITNG.2012.134"", ""10.1109/IMITEC45504.2019.9015857"", ""10.14569/IJACSA.2020.0111238"", ""10.2478/manment-2019-0015"", ""10.1007/978-1-84628-666-7_14"", ""10.1007/978-1-84882-215-3_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-23974-8_2"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3051043"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22000-5_58"", ""10.1145/3334480.3382783"", ""10.1109/ISET49818.2020.00021"", ""10.1007/1-4020-5386-X_1"", ""10.1109/ISCMI47871.2019.9004411"", ""10.25046/aj050652"", ""10.28945/4579"", ""10.1145/191666.191703"", ""10.1109/NEXTCOMP.2019.8883563"", ""10.1109/MDM.2017.64"", ""10.1109/ICETA48886.2019.9040095"", ""10.4135/9781849209397"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-6544-6_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28509-7_13"", ""10.1145/3397481.3450648"", ""10.1145/3330430.3333643"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-7403-6_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17705-8_15"", ""10.1109/HSI.2017.8005002"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-49663-0_34"", ""10.1109/FIE.2018.8659282"", ""10.1145/3338286.3340114"", ""10.1145/3469595.3469633"", ""10.1145/3411764.3445781"", ""10.30844/wi_2020_k7-wambsganss"", ""10.1145/3334480.3382805"", ""10.1145/3313831.3376781"", ""10.5465/AMBPP.2018.15903abstract"", ""10.3389/frai.2021.654924"", ""10.1145/3025453.3025496"", ""10.1109/ISKO-Maghreb.2014.7033472""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1007/s10459-020-10000-3,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Gamification of health professions education: a systematic review,"AbstractGamification refers to using game attributes in a non-gaming context. Health professions educators increasingly turn to gamification to optimize students’ learning outcomes. However, little is known about the concept of gamification and its possible working mechanisms. This review focused on empirical evidence for the effectiveness of gamification approaches and theoretical rationales for applying the chosen game attributes. We systematically searched multiple databases, and included all empirical studies evaluating the use of game attributes in health professions education. Of 5044 articles initially identified, 44 met the inclusion criteria. Negative outcomes for using gamification were not reported. Almost all studies included assessment attributes (n = 40), mostly in combination with conflict/challenge attributes (n = 27). Eight studies revealed that this specific combination had increased the use of the learning material, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. A relatively small number of studies was performed to explain mechanisms underlying the use of game attributes (n = 7). Our findings suggest that it is possible to improve learning outcomes in health professions education by using gamification, especially when employing game attributes that improve learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning. However, most studies lacked well-defined control groups and did not apply and/or report theory to understand underlying processes. Future research should clarify mechanisms underlying gamified educational interventions and explore theories that could explain the effects of these interventions on learning outcomes, using well-defined control groups, in a longitudinal way. In doing so, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student.","[{""name"": ""A.

10.1002/ase.1967,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat (SWOT) Analysis of the Adaptations to Anatomical Education in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland in Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic","The Covid‐19 pandemic has driven the fastest changes to higher education across the globe, necessitated by social distancing measures preventing face‐to‐face teaching. This has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions. Anatomy faces some unique challenges. Intrinsically, anatomy is a three‐dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures, often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material, models, and virtual resources. This study sought to identify the approaches taken in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means. Data were collected from 14 different universities in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach. Once themes were generated, they were collectively brought together using a strength, weakness, opportunity, threat (SWOT) analysis. Key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations. Academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources was to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure. Comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveal the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand. Discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy.","[{""name"": ""Georga J.

Furthermore, miniature robots can access complex and narrow regions of the human body as well as manipulate down to subcellular entities; however, integrating onboard components is difficult due to their limited size. Combining these two technologies, magnetic miniature robots have undergone rapid development during the past two decades, mainly because of their high potential in medical and bioengineering applications. To improve the scientific and clinical outcomes of these tiny agents, developing suitable and reliable actuation systems is essential. As a newly emerging field that has progressed in recent years, magnetic actuation systems offer a harmless and effective approach for the remote control of miniature robots via a dynamic magnetic field. Herein, a review on the state‐of‐the‐art magnetic actuation systems for miniature robots is presented with the goal of providing readers with a better understanding of magnetic actuation and guidance for future system design.","[{""name"": ""Zhengxin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering The Chinese University of Hong Kong  Shatin NT Hong Kong China""]},

10.1111/bjet.13023,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Effectiveness of immersive virtual reality using head-mounted displays on learning performance: A meta-analysis,"AbstractWith the availability of low‐cost high‐quality head‐mounted displays (HMDs) since 2013, there is a growing body of literature investigating the impact of immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology on education. This meta‐analysis aims to synthesize the findings on the overall effects of IVR using HMDs compared to less immersive desktop virtual reality (DVR) and other traditional means of instruction. A systematic search was carried out on the literature published between 2013 and 2019. Thirty‐five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐experimental studies were identified. We conducted an analysis using the random effects model (REM) to calculate the pooled effect size. The studies were also coded to examine the moderating effects of their characteristics, such as learner stage, learning domain, learning application type, testing format, control group treatment and learning duration, on the outcome measure. The results showed that IVR using HMDs is more effective than non‐immersive learning approaches with a small effect size (ES = 0.24). The key findings of the moderator analysis were that HMDs have a greater impact (a) on K‐12 learners; (b) in the fields of science education and specific abilities development; (c) when offering simulation or virtual world representations; and (d) when compared with lectures or real‐world practices. The meta‐analysis also suggested that HMDs can improve both knowledge and skill development, and maintain the learning effect over time. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Head‐mounted displays (HMDs) have been widely applied in various disciplines across both K‐12 and post‐secondary education. HMDs have a positive impact on learning attitudes and perceptions. HMDs have produced mixed results on learning performance. What this paper adds Immersive virtual reality (IVR) using HMDs is more effective than non‐immersive learning approaches with a small effect size. The critical factors of learning implementation and research design moderate the impact of HMDs on learning performance. HMDs can improve both knowledge and skill development and maintain the learning effect over time. Implications for practice and/or policy HMD‐based immersive learning appears to be a better complement to non‐immersive learning approaches.

10.1007/s10639-022-11316-w,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Ethical principles for artificial intelligence in education,"AbstractThe advancement of artificial intelligence in education (AIED) has the potential to transform the educational landscape and influence the role of all involved stakeholders. In recent years, the applications of AIED have been gradually adopted to progress our understanding of students’ learning and enhance learning performance and experience. However, the adoption of AIED has led to increasing ethical risks and concerns regarding several aspects such as personal data and learner autonomy. Despite the recent announcement of guidelines for ethical and trustworthy AIED, the debate revolves around the key principles underpinning ethical AIED. This paper aims to explore whether there is a global consensus on ethical AIED by mapping and analyzing international organizations’ current policies and guidelines. In this paper, we first introduce the opportunities offered by AI in education and potential ethical issues. Then, thematic analysis was conducted to conceptualize and establish a set of ethical principles by examining and synthesizing relevant ethical policies and guidelines for AIED. We discuss each principle and associated implications for relevant educational stakeholders, including students, teachers, technology developers, policymakers, and institutional decision-makers. The proposed set of ethical principles is expected to serve as a framework to inform and guide educational stakeholders in the development and deployment of ethical and trustworthy AIED as well as catalyze future development of related impact studies in the field.","[{""name"": ""Andy Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ha Ngan Ngo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yvonne Hong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Belle Dang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bich-Phuong Thi Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s43681-021-00096-7"", ""10.4324/9781003163589"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102433"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1786399"", ""10.1007/s43681-020-00002-7"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139046855.020"", ""10.1037/13620-004"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-7725-9_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-50585-1_2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.010"", ""10.1163/25902539-00102009"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389299"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3362563"", ""10.5296/ijld.v8i4.14057"", ""10.1111/his.14304"", ""10.1007/s13347-018-0303-9"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-6419-8_22-1"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09517-8"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00239-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-23204-7_14"", ""10.3390/math9060584"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100001"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9477-y"", ""10.1177/0846537120918338"", ""10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621018"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2"", ""10.1111/bjet.12878"", ""10.1016/j.patter.2021.100314"", ""10.1111/bjet.12868"", ""10.14763/2020.2.1469"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3240529"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00254-2"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4609.2007.00143.x"", ""10.1038/s41562-016-0028"", ""10.36548/jaicn.2019.2.005"", ""10.1093/ojls/gqp029"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10597-x"", ""10.13140/RG.2.2.33598.31040"", ""10.1007/s40593-014-0028-6"", ""10.1002/rcs.1968"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-10925-9"", ""10.1007/s10489-021-02264-y"", ""10.1111/bjet.12152"", ""10.1109/ICECA49313.2020.9297643"", ""10.1093/jamia/ocz192"", ""10.14324/LRE.19.1.05"", ""10.3390/su13179564"", ""10.1145/3386392.3397603"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2837585"", ""10.1109/CCOMS.2019.8821783"", ""10.1177/0002764213479366"", ""10.1177/0008125619867910"", ""10.1007/s11423-021-09977-4"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101961"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100031"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10774-y"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

We examine the evolution of these tools, and highlight the potential ways that LLMs can support in the education of students in digital writing and beyond, including the teaching of writing and composition, the possibilities of co-creation between humans and AI, supporting EFL learners, and improving Automated Writing Evaluations (AWE). We describe and demonstrate the potential that these tools have in creating original, coherent text that can avoid detection by existing technological methods of detection and trained academic staff alike, demonstrating a major academic integrity concern related to the use of these tools by students. Analysing the various issues related to academic integrity that LLMs raise for both Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and students, we conclude that it is not the student use of any AI tools that defines whether plagiarism or a breach of academic integrity has occurred, but whether any use is made clear by the student. Deciding whether any particular use of LLMs by students can be defined as academic misconduct is determined by the academic integrity policies of any given HEI, which must be updated to consider how these tools will be used in future educational environments.","[{""name"": ""Mike Perkins"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Safety Research']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02117-1,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on final year medical students in the United Kingdom: a national survey,"Abstract Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in unprecedented public health measures. This has impacted the UK education sector with many universities halting campus-based teaching and examinations. The aim of this study is to identify the impact of COVID-19 on final year medical students’ examinations and placements in the United Kingdom (UK) and how it might impact their confidence and preparedness going into their first year of foundation training. Methods A 10-item online survey was distributed to final year medical students across 33 UK medical schools. The survey was designed by combining dichotomous, multiple choice and likert response scale questions. Participants were asked about the effect that the COVID-19 global pandemic had on final year medical written exams, electives, assistantships and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). The survey also explored the student’s confidence and preparedness going into their first year of training under these new unprecedented circumstances. Results Four hundred forty students from 32 UK medical schools responded. 38.4% (n = 169) of respondents had their final OSCEs cancelled while 43.0% (n = 189) had already completed their final OSCEs before restrictions. 43.0% (n = 189) of assistantship placements were postponed while 77.3% (n = 340) had electives cancelled. The impact of COVID-19 on OSCEs, written examinations and student assistantships significantly affected students’ preparedness (respectively p = 0.025, 0.008, 0.0005). In contrast, when measuring confidence, only changes to student assistantships had a significant effect (p = 0.0005). The majority of students feel that measures taken during this pandemic to amend their curricula was necessary. Respondents also agree that assisting in hospitals during the outbreak would be a valuable learning opportunity. Conclusions The impact on medical student education has been significant, particularly affecting the transition from student to doctor. This study showed the disruptions to student assistantships had the biggest effect on students’ confidence and preparedness. For those willing to assist in hospitals to join the front-line workforce, it is crucial to maintain their wellbeing with safeguards such as proper inductions, support and supervision.","[{""name"": ""Byung Choi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lavandan Jegatheeswaran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amal Minocha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michel Alhilani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria Nakhoul"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ernest Mutengesa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/1471-2334-14-480"", ""10.1093/jtm/taaa021"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1064"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.889814"", ""10.1111/j.1743-498X.2011.00482.x"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2001.01085.x"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.642826"", ""10.3399/bjgp18X695885"", ""10.1111/medu.13084"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2017.1245855"", ""10.1080/14739879.2018.1423643"", ""10.1080/14739879.2019.1653228"", ""10.4314/mmj.v27i2.8""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Oncology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.3102/0013189X20972718,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,Interrogating Structural Racism in STEM Higher Education,"The racialized structure of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) higher education maintains gross inequities that are illustrative of structural racism, which both informs and is reinforced by discriminatory beliefs, policies, values, and distribution of resources. Thus, an examination into structural racism in STEM is needed to expose the marginalization of underrepresented groups in STEM and to improve understanding of the STEM policies, practices, and procedures that allow the foundation of racism to remain intact. I argue that, even at the top of the education hierarchy, Black STEM doctorate students and PhD degree holders consistently endure the racist residue of higher education institutions and STEM employers. Thus, this manuscript also discusses how universities institutionalize diversity mentoring programs designed mostly to fix (read “assimilate”) underrepresented students of color while ignoring or minimizing the role of the STEM departments in creating racially hostile work and educational spaces. I argue that, without a critical examination of the structural racism omnipresent in the STEM, progress in racially diversifying STEM will continue at a snail’s pace.","[{""name"": ""Ebony Omotola McGee"", ""affiliation"": [""Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN""]}]","[""10.1080/13613324.2016.1260233"", ""10.1037/a0039705"", ""10.1080/15348431.2015.1045143"", ""10.1111/sipr.12042"", ""10.1353/rhe.2015.0004"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30569-X"", ""10.1002/sce.21156"", ""10.21423/jume-v9i2a294"", ""10.1080/01419870.2016.1202423"", ""10.1515/9781685850272"", ""10.1177/0002764215586826"", ""10.1177/0002716210389702"", ""10.4324/9781315389165"", ""10.1177/0896920516658940"", ""10.1002/tea.21249"", ""10.1177/0042085916661385"", ""10.1215/9780822375302"", ""10.1177/2332649216681565"", ""10.1080/00131946.2017.1369082"", ""10.3102/0002831218789595"", ""10.3102/0002831218763587"", ""10.1002/j.2161-0045.2014.00087.x"", ""10.5328/cter41.2.85"", ""10.1002/sce.21108"", ""10.1002/tea.20237"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03457-3_2"", ""10.1177/1932202X18757958"", ""10.1111/coep.12476"", ""10.1891/9780826178176"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2019.05.010"", ""10.1093/socpro/spz026"", ""10.1177/016146811711900504"", ""10.1002/he.20137"", ""10.1177/0095798414567757"", ""10.3102/0091732X18759072"", ""10.1002/tea.20411"", ""10.28945/2305"", ""10.7709/jnegroeducation.87.2.0125"", ""10.17763/haer.81.2.a84201x508406327"", ""10.1080/13613324.2019.1592833"", ""10.1187/cbe.16-01-0062"", ""10.1037/a0038676"", ""10.3102/0002831216676572"", ""10.1177/016146811912100407"", ""10.1111/edth.12129"", ""10.3102/0013189X20907396"", ""10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0166-4"", ""10.1177/0038038507080440"", ""10.1002/tea.21065"", ""10.17226/25257"", ""10.17226/25568"", ""10.21061/jte.v27i1.a.3"", ""10.1080/13504630.2015.1093470"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182351f79"", ""10.18574/nyu/9781479833641.001.0001"", ""10.1002/tea.21417"", ""10.1111/josi.12056"", ""10.1002/he.20131"", ""10.2307/2695870"", ""10.7709/jnegroeducation.87.2.0095"", ""10.1177/0002764218768847"", ""10.1037/pspi0000153"", ""10.1111/soin.12147""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Education', 'Safety Research']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1002/cae.22253,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Sentiment analysis on massive open online course evaluations: A text mining and deep learning approach,"AbstractMassive open online courses (MOOCs) are recent innovative approaches in distance education, which provide learning content to participants without age‐, gender‐, race‐, or geography‐related barriers. The purpose of our research is to present an efficient sentiment classification scheme with high predictive performance in MOOC reviews, by pursuing the paradigms of ensemble learning and deep learning. In this contribution, we seek to answer several research questions on sentiment analysis on educational data. First, the predictive performance of conventional supervised learning methods, ensemble learning methods and deep learning methods has been evaluated. Besides, the efficiency of text representation schemes and word‐embedding schemes has been evaluated for sentiment analysis on MOOC evaluations. For the evaluation task, we have analyzed a corpus containing 66,000 MOOC reviews, with the use of machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning methods. The empirical analysis indicate that deep learning‐based architectures outperform ensemble learning methods and supervised learning methods for the task of sentiment analysis on educational data mining.

Synaptic devices that mimic biological synapses are critical building blocks for neuromorphic computing. Inspired by recent progress in optogenetics and visual sensing, light has been increasingly incorporated into synaptic devices. This paves the way to optoelectronic synaptic devices with a series of advantages such as wide bandwidth, negligible resistance–capacitance (RC) delay and power loss, and global regulation of multiple synaptic devices. Herein, the basic functionalities of synaptic devices are introduced. All kinds of optoelectronic synaptic devices are then discussed by categorizing them into optically stimulated synaptic devices, optically assisted synaptic devices, and synaptic devices with optical output. Existing practical scenarios for the application of optoelectronic synaptic devices are also presented. Finally, perspectives on the development of optoelectronic synaptic devices in the future are outlined.","[{""name"": ""Yue Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials School

10.3390/educsci11010022,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Gamification in Science Education. A Systematic Review of the Literature,"The implementation of gamification in education has attracted many researchers to increase engagement and achieve learning more effectively. Implementing technology in science curricula has seen a massive influx over the past years to stop the decline in students’ motivation towards science learning and promote scientific thinking. This study’s objective is to present the empirical findings of the state-of-the-art literature on the use of gamification in science education. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of 24 empirical research papers published in various electronic databases and the web search engine for scholarly literature and academic resources, Google Scholar, between 2012 and 2020. This review reveals the latest emerging trends of gamification in science education while revealing the literature gap, challenges, impediments, and extending the possibilities for future research directions. It examines the conflicting findings of other studies and provides a framework and insight for future researchers regarding content areas, educational levels, theoretical models, outcomes, methodologies, game elements, and assessment tools.","[{""name"": ""Michail Kalogiannakis"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Preschool Education, Faculty of Education, University of Crete, 74100

10.3390/educsci10090216,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,E-Learning Critical Success Factors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comprehensive Analysis of E-Learning Managerial Perspectives,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions were shut down all over the world, which impacted over 60% of students and caused a massive disruption of the education system. The goal of this paper was to identify the critical success factors for E-learning during COVID-19 using the multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) techniques to enhance the educational process. Data were generated by interviewing 69 E-learning managers in educational institutions during COVID-19 based on defined evaluation criteria and E-learning approaches through several channels. We found that technology management, support from management, increased student awareness to use E-learning systems, and demanding a high level of information technology from instructors, students, and universities were the most influential factors for E-learning during COVID-19. Among the five learning systems, blended learning was the most suitable learning system to practice. These results demonstrated that, regardless of how extraordinary the technology is in an educational institution, the readiness of E-learning execution played a large role in boosting the educational process during the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Ammar Y.

Beyond the widespread concerns surrounding illness, loss of employment and social isolation, caregivers are responsible for overseeing their children's educational and therapeutic programmes at home often without the much needed support of professionals.MethodThe present study sought to examine the impact of COVID‐19 in 77 ethnically, linguistically and socioeconomically diverse families with young children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) in California and Oregon, who were participating in larger intervention studies. Parents responded to five interview questions about the impact of the pandemic, services for their child, silver linings or positive aspects, coping and their concerns about the long‐term impact of the pandemic.ResultsParents reported that their biggest challenge was being at home caring for their children with the loss of many essential services. Parents reported some positive aspects of the pandemic, especially being together as a family. Although there were positive aspects of the situation, many parents expressed concern about long‐term impacts of the pandemic on their children's development, given the loss of services, education and social engagement opportunities.ConclusionResults suggest that parents of young children with IDD report significant challenges at home during the pandemic. Professional support, especially during the reopening phases, will be critical to support family well‐being and child developmental outcomes.","[{""name"": ""C.

Hence, this study aimed to investigate the mediating effects of metacognitive learning strategies and learning-related emotions in the relationship between academic self-efficacy with academic performance in medical students.MethodsThe present study was carried out on 279 students of medicine studying at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The students filled out three questionnaires: academic emotions (AEQ), metacognitive learning strategies, and academic self-efficacy questionnaires. The data were analyzed using SPSS and Smart PLS3.ResultsThe results of structural equation modeling revealed that the students’ self-efficacy has an impact on their learning-related emotions and metacognitive learning strategies, and these, in turn, affect the students’ academic performance. Moreover, learning-related emotions influence the metacognitive learning strategies, which in turn mediate the effect of emotions on academic performance.DiscussionThe results of this study revealed that metacognitive strategies and learning-related emotions could play a mediating role in the relationship between students’ self-efficacy and academic performance.","[{""name"": ""Ali Asghar Hayat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karim Shateri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mitra Amini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nasrin Shokrpour"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/a0033546"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03712.x"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3702_4"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2010.10.002"", ""10.5455/jcme.20170412124640"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-13-87"", ""10.1023/A:1016282811724"", ""10.33225/jbse/13.12.21"", ""10.1037/a0013383"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2015.11.002"", ""10.1007/s10734-004-6664-2"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.652995"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.651515"", ""10.1080/15305050701808649"", ""10.1038/466029a"", ""10.1007/s10648-006-9029-9"", ""10.1007/s12646-013-0193-y"", ""10.1348/000709905X42860"", ""10.1080/02699930244000039"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2017.01.002"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50048-2"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.95.4.667"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.93.1.55"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2009.05.004"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.2012.02084.x"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01193"", ""10.12691/education-1-8-11"", ""10.3389/feduc.2018.00005"", ""10.33225/pec/16.71.62"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.1.33"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00259.x"", ""10.1016/B978-012372545-5/50003-4"", ""10.1007/BF01322178"", ""10.1177/0013164493053003024"", ""10.1080/00313830701356166"", ""10.1037/a0030160"", ""10.1007/BF03026784"", ""10.1017/prp.2014.3"", ""10.1080/10401330701542685"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411"", ""10.1016/S0883-0355(99)00015-4""]",['Psychology'],"['Clinical Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

10.1111/bjet.13030,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Immersive virtual reality in K-12 and higher education: A 10-year systematic review of empirical research,"AbstractImmersive Virtual Reality (IVR) systems offer several learning affordances, that is, characteristics that can elicit learning behaviors promoting learning outcomes in educational contexts. In particular, the immersive and interactive properties of these systems represent a strong opportunity to support the effective learning experiences. The present review aims at mapping IVR systems’ use in K‐12 and higher educational contexts and investigating their effectiveness in facilitating learning in terms of knowledge attainment and retention and motivational outcomes. The synthesis of the reviewed studies (n = 18) show that IVR can support a number of activities and experiences that in turn improve learning and motivate students to fulfill educational goals by eliciting their interest and engagement with the learning materials. The main advantage of IVR seems related to the possibility for users to have first‐hand experiences that would not be possible in the real world, simultaneously offering unique opportunities for experiential and situated learning, as well as promoting students’ motivation and engagement. Despite the promising findings, the reviewed studies present several methodological flaws: non‐randomized trials, small sample sizes, unbalanced samples and non‐validated measures. This in turn makes it difficult to generalize from these results. Future research is needed to investigate the unique opportunities of IVR in education. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic? There is an increasing use of immersive virtual reality (IVR) in different fields, including education. Experiences in IVR promote sense of presence, sense of embodiment, while supporting attentional and emotional engagement. What this paper adds? The paper outlines the learning affordances of IVR both at cognitive and affective level. The results of our systematic review show that IVR is a promising technology that can positively influence the students’ learning achievements and motivation to learn.

10.1186/s12909-020-1994-z,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,The effectiveness of virtual reality-based technology on anatomy teaching: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies,"AbstractBackgroundVirtual reality (VR) is an innovation that permits the individual to discover and operate within three-dimensional (3D) environment to gain practical understanding. This research aimed to examine the general efficiency of VR for teaching medical anatomy.MethodsWe executed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies of the performance of VR anatomy education. We browsed five databases from the year 1990 to 2019. Ultimately, 15 randomized controlled trials with a teaching outcome measure analysis were included. Two authors separately chose studies, extracted information, and examined the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were examination scores of the students. Secondary outcomes were the degrees of satisfaction of the students. Random-effects models were used for the pooled evaluations of scores and satisfaction degrees. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was applied to assess the systematic results. The heterogeneity was determined byI2statistics, and then was investigated by meta-regression and subgroup analyses.ResultsIn this review, we screened and included fifteen randomized controlled researches (816 students). The pooled analysis of primary outcomes showed that VR improves test scores moderately compared with other approaches (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.53; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.09–0.97,p &lt; 0.05;I2 = 87.8%). The high homogeneity indicated that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we carried out meta-regression as well as subgroup analyses using seven variables (year, country, learners, course, intervention, comparator, and duration). We found that VR improves post-intervention test score of anatomy compared with other types of teaching methods.ConclusionsThe finding confirms that VR may act as an efficient way to improve the learners’ level of anatomy knowledge. Future research should assess other factors like degree of satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and adverse reactions when evaluating the teaching effectiveness of VR in anatomy.","[{""name"": ""Jingjie Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xinliang Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hualin Jiang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yi Ding"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02401.x"", ""10.1111/medu.13683"", ""10.1007/s10459-015-9644-7"", ""10.1002/ase.139"", ""10.1504/IJIIE.2017.10012691"", ""10.1080/17453054.2019.1560929"", ""10.1002/ca.23292"", ""10.1002/ase.1510"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00135"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2016.09.003"", ""10.1002/9780470712184"", ""10.2307/2529310"", ""10.1136/bmj.327.7414.557"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.005"", ""10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00455.x"", ""10.1002/ase.214"", ""10.2196/ijmr.2172"", ""10.3171/2015.8.JNS141563"", ""10.1016/j.jmig.2018.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.ajog.2009.08.038"", ""10.1002/ase.212"", ""10.1002/ase.1355"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2015.05.006"", ""10.1002/ase.1696"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02611.x"", ""10.1089/end.2009.0556"", ""10.1016/j.amjsurg.2007.06.026"", ""10.1002/alr.21986"", ""10.1017/S0022215111002830"", ""10.1002/ase.1509"", ""10.2307/2533446"", ""10.1177/1536867X0800800102"", ""10.1002/ase.1623"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-5490-7_7"", ""10.1037/stl0000021"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2005.07.007"", ""10.2190/EC.44.1.a"", ""10.1007/s10055-016-0285-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-02487-5_9""]","['Engineering', 'Medicine']","['Surgery', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

In conclusion, ChatGPT’s knowledge and interpretation ability for this parasitology examination were not yet comparable to those of medical students in Korea.","[{""name"": ""Sun Huh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.nepr.2022.103537"", ""10.1038/d41586-022-04397-7"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2019.16.18"", ""10.1038/nature16961"", ""10.1038/s43856-022-00125-4""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1007/s10639-023-11816-3,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,"""Extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to Predict University Students' Intentions to Use Metaverse-Based Learning Platforms""","AbstractMetaverse, which combines a number of information technologies, is the Internet of the future. A media for immersive learning, metaverse could set future educational trends and lead to significant reform in education. Although the metaverse has the potential to improve the effectiveness of online learning experiences, metaverse-based educational implementations are still in their infancy. Additionally, what factors impact higher education students’ adoption of the educational metaverse remains unclear. Consequently, the aim of this study is to explore the main factors that affect higher education students’ behavioral intentions to adopt metaverse technology for education. This study has proposed an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to achieve this aim. The novelty of this study resides in its conceptual model, which incorporates both technological, personal, and inhibiting/enabling factors. The empirical data were collected via online questionnaires from 574 students in both private and public universities in Jordan. Based on the PLS-SEM analysis, the study identifies perceived usefulness, personal innovativeness in IT, and perceived enjoyment as key enablers of students’ behavioral intentions to adopt the metaverse. Additionally, perceived cyber risk is found as the main inhibitor of students’ metaverse adoption intentions. Surprisingly, the effect of perceived ease of use on metaverse adoption intentions is found to be insignificant. Furthermore, it is found that self-efficacy, personal innovativeness, and perceived cyber risk are the main determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. While the findings of this study contribute to the extension of the TAM model, the practical value of these findings is significant since they will help educational authorities understand each factor’s role and enable them to plan their future strategies.","[{""name"": ""Ahmad Samed Al-Adwan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Na Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amer Al-Adwan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ghazanfar Ali Abbasi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nour Awni Albelbisi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Akhmad Habibi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.036"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.014"", ""10.1287/isre.9.2.204"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102888"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100052"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10250-z"", ""10.1504/IJMC.2018.088271"", ""10.3390/su13169453"", ""10.1504/IJHTM.2015.074538"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.008"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-10934-8"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.889814"", ""10.9790/7388-05616670"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.181"", ""10.1177/135910457000100301"", ""10.1108/JRIT-12-2019-0079"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01597"", ""10.17705/1jais.00059"", ""10.1007/s12528-022-09327-0"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2012.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.chbr.2022.100237"", ""10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00945.x"", ""10.1109/TPSISA52974.2021.00032"", ""10.2196/mhealth.7886"", ""10.1111/jcal.12302"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2022.102542"", ""10.1080/10494820.2017.1421560"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00933"", ""10.1108/10650741211212368"", ""10.1109/MTS.2018.2826060"", ""10.1007/s10479-018-2818-y"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101787"", ""10.1108/TR-02-2017-0019"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1111/bjet.12864"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-80519-7"", ""10.1108/EBR-11-2018-0203"", ""10.4018/978-1-7998-3250-8.ch004"", ""10.1142/S0219649220500185"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8"", ""10.1108/S1474-7979(2009)0000020014"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9628-4"", ""10.14742/ajet.3330"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10707-9"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100082"", ""10.4314/jfas.v9i4S.50"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2022.880261"", ""10.1007/BF02313398"", ""10.1007/s12528-014-9081-2"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100017"", ""10.1155/2019/7208494"", ""10.2307/20650309"", ""10.17703/JCCT.2022.8.1.483"", ""10.1177/1745499918763420"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2018.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2018.12.006"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2110.05352"", ""10.1186/s40561-022-00203-z"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10557-5"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10653-6"", ""10.3991/ijet.v13i12.8864"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11052-1"", ""10.47263/JASEM.4(2)01"", ""10.1111/bjet.12644"", ""10.1007/s10488-013-0528-y"", ""10.3389/feduc.2021.652856"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1016/j.techum.2022.04.004"", ""10.28945/1744"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.016"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2018.02.005"", ""10.3390/fi11040089"", ""10.3390/su14063690"", ""10.3390/su14063690"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-64987-6_24"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2021.12.164"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2022.107183"", ""10.1002/mar.20920"", ""10.4018/IJSPPC.308785"", ""10.1145/3234253.3234292"", ""10.1016/j.jhlste.2022.100373"", ""10.1177/2158244019844084"", ""10.3390/jintelligence10010017"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2020.09.249"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2018.03.137"", ""10.1007/s10796-018-9864-5"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102294"", ""10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530195"", ""10.3390/app112311360"", ""10.1155/2022/5479215"", ""10.1080/14703297.2019.1585904"", ""10.1186/s40561-022-00205-x"", ""10.1109/TENCON50793.2020.9293710"", ""10.1108/AJEB-06-2020-0018"", ""10.2307/25148660"", ""10.1287/isre.11.4.342.11872"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.1996.tb00860.x"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2018.08.014"", ""10.1080/14703297.2022.2098512"", ""10.1109/COMST.2022.3202047"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2011.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10562"", ""10.1016/j.im.2005.08.006"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016300"", ""10.1016/j.visinf.2022.03.002"", ""10.1155/2022/1938329"", ""10.1177/21582440221085259""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In addition, artificial intelligence (AI) is also emerging and evolving by recent breakthroughs in computing power and software architectures. In this regard, the digital twin, analyzing various sensor data with the help of AI algorithms, has become a cutting‐edge technology that connects the physical and virtual worlds, in which the various sensors are highly desirable to collect environmental information. However, although existing sensor technologies, including cameras, microphones, inertial measurement units, etc., are widely used as sensing elements for various applications, high‐power consumption and battery replacement of them is still a problem. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as self‐powered sensors supply a feasible platform for realizing self‐sustainable and low‐power systems. Herein, the recent progress on TENG‐based intelligent systems, that is, wearable electronics, robot‐related systems, and smart homes, followed by prospective future development enabled by sensor fusion technology, is focused on. Finally, how to apply artificial intelligence to the design of intelligent sensor systems for the 5G and IoT era is discussed.","[{""name"": ""Zixuan Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of

10.53761/1.20.3.02,JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE,0401 Education,"Leadership is needed for ethical ChatGPT: Character, assessment, and learning using artifiicial intelligence (AI)","The OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3, or Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer was released in November 2022 without significant warning, and has taken higher education by storm since. The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot has caused alarm for practitioners seeking to detect authenticity of student work. Whereas some educational doomsayers predict the end of education in its current form, we propose an alternate early view. We identify in this commentary a position where educators can leverage AI like ChatGPT to build supportive learning environments for students who have cultivated good character. Such students know how to use ChatGPT for good, and can engage effectively with the ChatGPT application. In building our ChatGPT argument, we acknowledge the existing literature on plagiarism and academic integrity, and consider leadership as a root support mechanism, character development as an antidote, and authentic assessment as an enabler. In doing so, we highlight that while ChatGPT – like papermills, and degree factories before it – can be used to cheat on university exams, it can also be used to support deeper learning and better learning outcomes for students. In doing so, we offer a commentary that offers opportunities for practitioners, and research potential for scholars.","[{""name"": ""Joseph Crawford"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Cowling"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kelly-Ann Allen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Safety Research']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1111/edth.12411,EDUCATIONAL THEORY,0401 Education,"Risking Ourselves in Education: Qualification, Socialization, and Subjectification Revisited","AbstractIn previous publications, Gert Biesta has suggested that education should be oriented toward three domains of purpose that he calls qualification, socialization, and subjectification. Many educators, policymakers, and scholars have found this suggestion helpful. Nonetheless, the discussion about the exact nature of each domain and about their relationships to each other has been ongoing, particularly with regard to the domain of subjectification. In this article, Biesta revisits the three domains and tries to provide further clarification with regard to the idea of subjectification. He highlights that subjectification has to do with the existence of the child or student as subject of her or his own life, not as object of educational interventions. Subjectification thus has to do with the question of freedom. Biesta explains that this is not the freedom to do what one wants to do, but the freedom to act in and with the world in a “grown‐up” way.","[{""name"": ""Gert Biesta"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Public Education and Pedagogy Maynooth University""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"
10.1002/rrq.411,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,The Science of Reading Progresses: Communicating Advances Beyond the Simple View of Reading,"ABSTRACTThe simple view of reading is commonly presented to educators in professional development about the science of reading. The simple view is a useful tool for conveying the undeniable importance—in fact, the necessity—of both decoding and linguistic comprehension for reading. Research in the 35 years since the theory was proposed has revealed additional understandings about reading. In this article, we synthesize research documenting three of these advances: (1) Reading difficulties have a number of causes, not all of which fall under decoding and/or listening comprehension as posited in the simple view; (2) rather than influencing reading solely independently, as conceived in the simple view, decoding and listening comprehension (or in terms more commonly used in reference to the simple view today, word recognition and language comprehension) overlap in important ways; and (3) there are many contributors to reading not named in the simple view, such as active, self‐regulatory processes, that play a substantial role in reading. We point to research showing that instruction aligned with these advances can improve students’ reading. We present a theory, which we call the active view of reading, that is an expansion of the simple view and can be used to convey these important advances to current and future educators.

10.1007/s10639-022-11167-5,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis on virtual reality and education,"Abstract The objective of this study is to identify and analyze the scientific literature with a bibliometric analysis to find the main topics, authors, sources, most cited articles, and countries in the literature on virtual reality in education. Another aim is to understand the conceptual, intellectual, and social structure of the literature on the subject and identify the knowledge base of the use of VR in education and whether it is commonly used and integrated into teaching–learning processes. To do this, articles indexed in the Main Collections of the Web of Science, Scopus and Lens were analyzed for the period 2010 to 2021. The research results are presented in two parts: the first is a quantitative analysis that provides an overview of virtual reality (VR) technology used in the educational field, with tables, graphs, and maps, highlighting the main performance indicators for the production of articles and their citation. The results obtained found a total of 718 articles of which the following were analyzed 273 published articles. The second stage consisted of an inductive type of analysis that found six major groups in the cited articles, which are instruction and learning using VR, VR learning environments, use of VR in different fields of knowledge, learning processes using VR applications or games, learning processes employing simulation, and topics published during the Covid-19 pandemic. Another important aspect to mention is that VR is used in many different areas of education, but until the beginning of the pandemic the use of this so-called “disruptive process” came mainly from students, Institutions were reluctant and slow to accept and include VR in the teaching–learning processes.","[{""name"": ""Mario A.

10.1002/jee.20377,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education,Positionality practices and dimensions of impact on equity research: A collaborative inquiry and call to the community,"AbstractBackgroundMany engineering education researchers acknowledge that their positionality impacts their research. Practices for reporting positionality vary widely and rarely incorporate a nuanced discussion of the impact of demographic identities on research. Researchers holding marginalized or relatively hidden identities must navigate additional layers regarding transparency of their positionality.PurposeWe identify ways in which positionality impacts research, with a particular emphasis on demographic identity dimensions. We note that whether identities are relatively marginalized, privileged, hidden, or apparent in a research context creates complexities for conceptualizing, practicing, and disclosing one's positionality.MethodIn a collaborative inquiry informed by autoethnography, we assemble positionality reflections of current engineering education researchers to demonstrate the primary ways in which positionality impacts research.ResultsWe find that positionality impacts six fundamental aspects of research: research topic, epistemology, ontology, methodology, relation to participants, and communication. These aspects of research delve deeper than conceptions of positionality as a methodological limitation, a measure to prevent bias, or a requirement for research quality.ConclusionThe impact of positionality on research is complex, particularly when researchers occupy minoritized identities and for research topics that interrogate power relations between identity groups. By demonstrating the practices of interrogating and representing positionality, we hope to encourage more researchers to represent positionality transparently, thus making researchers' transparency safer for all.

10.1002/berj.3754,BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL,0401 Education,The effect of school closures on standardised student test outcomes,"The school closures owing to the 2020 COVID‐19 crisis resulted in a significant disruption of education provision, leading to fears of learning losses and of an increase in educational inequality. This article evaluates the effects of school closures based on standardised tests in the last year of primary school in the Dutch‐speaking Flemish region of Belgium. Using a 6‐year panel, we find that students of the 2020 cohort experienced significant learning losses in three out of five tested subjects, with a decrease in school averages of mathematics scores of 0.17 standard deviations and Dutch scores (reading, writing, language) of 0.19 standard deviations as compared to previous cohorts. This finding holds when accounting for school characteristics, standardised tests in Grade 4 and school fixed effects. Given the large observed effect sizes, the effect of school closures appears to be a combination of lost learning progress and learning loss. Moreover, we observe that inequality both within schools and across schools rises by 7% for mathematics and 8% for Dutch. The learning losses are correlated with observed school characteristics, as schools with a more disadvantaged student population experience larger learning losses.","[{""name"": ""Joana Elisa Maldonado"", ""affiliation"": [""KU Leuven Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Kristof De Witte"", ""affiliation"": [""KU Leuven Belgium"", ""UNU‐MERIT Maastricht the Netherlands""]}]","[""10.3102/0002831220937285"", ""10.1177/1536867X0900900402"", ""10.1080/19345740802400072"", ""10.1257/aer.104.9.2633"", ""10.3102/0013189X16656615"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2021.101629"", ""10.1016/S0147-9121(01)20039-9"", ""10.3138/cpp.2020-055"", ""10.1007/s11092-020-09322-y"", ""10.3102/0013189X20965918"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-9246""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

DL is based on computational models that are, to a certain extent, bio‐inspired, as they rely on networks of connected simple computing units operating in parallel. The success of DL is supported by three factors: availability of vast amounts of data, continuous growth in computing power, and algorithmic innovations. The approaching demise of Moore's law, and the consequent expected modest improvements in computing power that can be achieved by scaling, raises the question of whether the progress will be slowed or halted due to hardware limitations. This article reviews the case for a novel beyond‐complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology—memristors—as a potential solution for the implementation of power‐efficient in‐memory computing, DL accelerators, and spiking neural networks. Central themes are the reliance on non‐von‐Neumann computing architectures and the need for developing tailored learning and inference algorithms. To argue that lessons from biology can be useful in providing directions for further progress in AI, an example‐based reservoir computing is briefly discussed. At the end, speculation is given on the “big picture” view of future neuromorphic and brain‐inspired computing systems.","[{""name"": ""Adnan Mehonic"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronic &amp; Electrical Engineering UCL  Torrington Place London WC1E 7JE UK""]}, {""name"": ""Abu Sebastian"", ""affiliation"": [""IBM Research Europe  Rüschlikon Zurich 8803 Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Bipin Rajendran"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Engineering King's College London  London WC2R 2LS UK""]}, {""name"": ""Osvaldo Simeone"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Engineering King's College London  London WC2R 2LS UK""]}, {""name"": ""Eleni Vasilaki"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science University of Sheffield  Regent Court (DCS) 211 Portobello Sheffield S1 4DP South Yorkshire UK""]}, {""name"": ""Anthony J.

Recently, soft robots became one of the most attractive areas. The intrinsic compliance and adaptability of soft materials enable soft robots to achieve unexpected functions. Dielectric elastomers (DE) can exhibit large deformation, fast response, and high energy density under the action of external electrical stimuli, becoming one of the most promising materials in soft robots. Herein, the key points of DE actuators (DEAs) are first introduced, including the working principle, DE materials, compliant electrodes, and typical configurations. Then, the soft robots driven by DEAs are reviewed. Some recent highlights are described and discussed in detail. Finally, the main challenges are summarized for the real‐world application of soft robots based on DEAs.","[{""name"": ""Yaguang Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Astronautical Science and Mechanics Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)  P.O.

10.1111/ejed.12533,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION,0401 Education,State of the art and practice in AI in education,"AbstractRecent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have generated great expectations for the future impact of AI in education and learning (AIED). Often these expectations have been based on misunderstanding current technical possibilities, lack of knowledge about state‐of‐the‐art AI in education, and exceedingly narrow views on the functions of education in society. In this article, we provide a review of existing AI systems in education and their pedagogic and educational assumptions. We develop a typology of AIED systems and describe different ways of using AI in education and learning, show how these are grounded in different interpretations of what AI and education is or could be, and discuss some potential roadblocks on the AIED highway.","[{""name"": ""Wayne Holmes"", ""affiliation"": [""UCL Knowledge Lab, IOE, UCL's Faculty of Education and Society University College London (UCL)  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Ilkka Tuomi"", ""affiliation"": [""Meaning Processing Ltds.

10.1111/bjet.13112,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,An exploratory study on the emergency remote education experience of higher education students and teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"AbstractThe COVID‐19 pandemic situation has pushed many higher education institutions into a fast‐paced, and mostly unstructured, emergency remote education process. In such an unprecedented context, it is important to understand how technology is mediating the educational process and how teachers and students are experiencing the change brought by the pandemic. This research aims to understand how the learning was mediated by technology during the early stages of the pandemic and how students and teachers experienced this sudden change. Data were collected following a qualitative research design. Thirty in‐depth and semi‐structured interviews (20 students and 10 teachers) were obtained and analysed following a thematic analysis approach. Results provide evidence on the adoption of remote education technologies due to the pandemic with impacts on the education process, ICT platforms usage and personal adaptation. The emergency remote education context led to mixed outcomes regarding the education process. Simultaneously, ICT platforms usage was mostly a positive experience and personal adaptation was mostly a negative experience. These results bring new insights for higher education organizations on actions they could take, such as curating the learning experience with standard, institutional‐wide platforms, appropriate training for students and teachers, and suitable remote evaluation practices. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic The COVID‐19 pandemic has pushed the world's education environment into an unstructured, emergency remote education process. There is a lack of understanding of how ICT tools mediated learning during pandemic's early stages and how actors experienced this sudden change. In technology‐mediated learning contexts, participant beliefs, knowledge, practices and the environment mutually influence one another and affect the lived experience. What this paper adds The paper identifies and characterizes the educational process, the technological tools used in this new educational setting and personal adaptation of higher education students and teachers during these unprecedented times. The results show the following: an increase in teacher–student interaction (outside classes), new opportunities and content development; difficulties in control evaluation fraud, constraints in attaining the desired learning outcomes and lack of training; resilience to adapt and adopt the new technologies, despite the negative personal experience lived in terms of productivity, motivation, workload and mental health. Implications for practice and/or policy The paper makes evidence‐based recommendations on how higher education institutions can leverage this experience to prepare for future disruptions and increase the use of ICT tools in their regular learning environment.","[{""name"": ""Gabriella Oliveira"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Faculty of Engineering University of Porto Porto Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Jorge Grenha Teixeira"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Faculty of Engineering University of Porto Porto Portugal"", ""INESC TEC ‐ INESC Tecnologia e Ciência Porto Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Ana Torres"", ""affiliation"": [""INESC TEC ‐ INESC Tecnologia e Ciência Porto Portugal"", ""ISCA University of Aveiro Aveiro Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Carla Morais"", ""affiliation"": [""CIQUP, Science Teaching Unit, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Faculty of Sciences University of Porto Porto Portugal""]}]","[""10.1080/10494820.2020.1813180"", ""10.1111/j.1469‐7610.2011.02407.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2008.02.002"", ""10.1159/000235976"", ""10.1177/1049732316654870"", ""10.1111/bjet.12771"", ""10.1037/13620-004"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.05.001"", ""10.1080/03098265.2020.1807478"", ""10.3102/0034654316671594"", ""10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosg070.pub2"", ""10.4135/9781452230153"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1815702"", ""10.1177/0047239520934018"", ""10.2202/1949‐6605.1762"", ""10.1177/0092055x20954263"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177705148"", ""10.12973/eu‐jer.5.2.53"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.022"", ""10.3390/educsci10090232"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa2001316"", ""10.1007/s41062‐020‐00326‐7"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103701"", ""10.1353/csd.2007.0031"", ""10.1080/03050068.2017.1327570"", ""10.1007/s10734‐020‐00561‐y"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1761641"", ""10.1111/j.1469‐7610.2005.00416.x""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02312-0,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Student perspective of classroom and distance learning during COVID-19 pandemic in the undergraduate dental study program Universitas Indonesia,"Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health issue and has had a major impact on education. Consequently, half way through the second semester of the academic year 2019/2020, learning methods were delivered through distance learning (DL). We aimed to evaluate the student perspective of DL compared to classroom learning (CL) in the undergraduate dentistry study program at the Faculty of Dentistry Universitas Indonesia. Methods An online questionnaire was sent at the end of the semester. A total of 301 students participated in the study. Results Duration of study influenced student preference. Higher number of first-year students preferred DL compared to their seniors (p &lt; 0.001). Students preferred CL for group discussion, as DL resulted in more difficult communication and gave less learning satisfaction. Only 44.2% students preferred DL over CL, although they agreed that DL gave a more efficient learning method (52.6%), it provided more time to study (87.9%) and to review study materials (87.3%). Challenges during DL included external factors such as unstable internet connection, extra financial burden for the internet quota and internal factors such as time management and difficulty to focus while learning online for a longer period of time. Conclusion Despite some challenges, dental students could adapt to the new learning methods of full DL and the majorities agreed blended learning that combined classroom and distance learning can be implemented henceforth. This current COVID-19 pandemic, changes not only the utilization of technology in education but the pedagogy strategies in the future.","[{""name"": ""Lisa R.

10.1111/jir.12776,JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH,0401 Education; 1002 Clinical Medicine; 0710 Biology; 1001 Basic Medicine,Changes in access to educational and healthcare services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities during COVID-19 restrictions,"AbstractBackgroundCOVID‐19 restrictions have significantly limited access to in‐person educational and healthcare services for all, including individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). The objectives of this online survey that included both national and international families were to capture changes in access to healthcare and educational services for individuals with IDDs that occurred shortly after restrictions were initiated and to survey families on resources that could improve services for these individuals.MethodsThis was an online survey for caregivers of individuals with (1) a genetic diagnosis and (2) a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder or epilepsy. The survey assessed (1) demographics, (2) changes in access to educational and healthcare services and (3) available and preferred resources to help families navigate the changes in service allocation.ResultsOf the 818 responses (669 within the USA and 149 outside of the USA), most families reported a loss of at least some educational or healthcare services. Seventy‐four per cent of parents reported that their child lost access to at least one therapy or education service, and 36% of respondents lost access to a healthcare provider. Only 56% reported that their child received at least some continued services through tele‐education. Those that needed to access healthcare providers did so primarily through telemedicine. Telehealth (both tele‐education and telemedicine) was reported to be helpful when available, and caregivers most often endorsed a need for an augmentation of these remote delivery services, such as 1:1 videoconference sessions, as well as increased access to 1:1 aides in the home.ConclusionsCOVID‐19 restrictions have greatly affected access to services for individuals with syndromic IDDs. Telehealth may provide opportunities for delivery of care and education in a sustainable way, not only as restrictions endure but also after they have been lifted.","[{""name"": ""S.

10.1002/cae.22326,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Rediscovering the use of chatbots in education: A systematic literature review,"AbstractChatbots have been around for years and have been used in many areas such as medicine or commerce. Our focus is on the development and current uses of chatbots in the field of education, where they can function as service assistants or as educational agents. In this research paper, we attempt to make a systematic review of the literature on educational chatbots that address various issues. From 485 sources, 80 studies on chatbots and their application in education were selected through a step‐by‐step procedure based on the guidelines of the PRISMA framework, using a set of predefined criteria. The results obtained demonstrate the existence of different types of educational chatbots currently in use that affect student learning or improve services in various areas. This paper also examines the type of technology used to unravel the learning outcome that can be obtained from each type of chatbots. Finally, our results identify instances where a chatbot can assist in learning under conditions similar to those of a human tutor, while exploring other possibilities and techniques for assessing the quality of chatbots. Our analysis details these findings and can provide a solid framework for research and development of chatbots for the educational field.","[{""name"": ""José Quiroga Pérez"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications Open University of Catalonia Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Thanasis Daradoumis"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications Open University of Catalonia Barcelona Spain"", ""Department of Cultural Technology and Communication University of Aegean University Hill Mytilene Greece""]}, {""name"": ""Joan Manuel Marquès Puig"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications Open University of Catalonia Barcelona Spain""]}]","[""10.1016/j.eswa.2019.07.014"", ""10.1145/3301551.3301580"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852445"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.219"", ""10.1109/TLT.2017.2682084"", ""10.1145/1352322.1352287"", ""10.13189/ujer.2016.040502"", ""10.13189/ujer.2018.060719"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.future.2018.01.055"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.08.007"", ""10.5430/ijhe.v8n6p288"", ""10.1145/3278721.3278760"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.045"", ""10.1109/ICETA.2018.8572054"", ""10.1109/TALE.2018.8615175"", ""10.1109/TE.2005.856149"", ""10.1111/exsy.12156"", ""10.1145/3287921.3287937"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.08.086"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2008.09.001"", ""10.1145/3291280.3291787"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2006.11.014"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2007.11.015"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2007.275"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.1109/SISY.2018.8524609"", ""10.1109/ICWT.2018.8527810"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2019.00102"", ""10.3991/ijet.v14i24.12187"", ""10.1145/3350768.3352456"", ""10.1007/s10758-019-09414-9"", ""10.1145/3291078.3291115"", ""10.1109/ICUFN.2016.7536948"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74829-8_88"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2019.08.005"", ""10.1109/ICACCI.2017.8126057"", ""10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103305"", ""10.1145/3308560.3314191"", ""10.1145/3330430.3333643"", ""10.1007/s11219-011-9147-6"", ""10.1109/ISEMANTIC.2018.8549797"", ""10.1177/2042753015571835"", ""10.1111/bjet.12723"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.033"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.01.004"", ""10.3115/1556328.1556341"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103862"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.07.039"", ""10.1109/HSI.2017.8005002"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.05.033"", ""10.1007/s40593-016-0118-8"", ""10.1016/j.dib.2019.104001"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.08.226"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010"", ""10.1109/FIE.2018.8659282"", ""10.3390/su12041500"", ""10.1145/3195106.3195169"", ""10.1145/365153.365168"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.08.179"", ""10.1145/3287098.3287149"", ""10.1145/3301275.3302264"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-87881-0_46"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing frontline care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system’s full support is required to address the needs of its workforce. In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force—created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system—used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the rollout of support initiatives for each priority area. Attending to the emotional well-being of health care workers has emerged as a central element in the MSHS COVID-19 response, which continues to be committed to the physical and emotional needs of a workforce that courageously faces this crisis.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Ripp"", ""affiliation"": [""is senior associate dean for well-being and resilience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and chief wellness officer, Mount Sinai Health System, New York, New York.""]}, {""name"": ""Lauren Peccoralo"", ""affiliation"": [""is associate dean for faculty well-being and resilience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai Health System, New York, New York.""]}, {""name"": ""Dennis Charney"", ""affiliation"": [""is Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and president for academic affairs, Mount Sinai Health System, New York, New York.""]}]","[""10.1007/s10880-017-9514-y"", ""10.1186/cc6918""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1186/s41239-021-00292-9,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,The impact of artificial intelligence on learner-instructor interaction in online learning,"AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) systems offer effective support for online learning and teaching, including personalizing learning for students, automating instructors’ routine tasks, and powering adaptive assessments. However, while the opportunities for AI are promising, the impact of AI systems on the culture of, norms in, and expectations about interactions between students and instructors are still elusive. In online learning, learner–instructor interaction (inter alia, communication, support, and presence) has a profound impact on students’ satisfaction and learning outcomes. Thus, identifying how students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on their interaction is important to identify any gaps, challenges, or barriers preventing AI systems from achieving their intended potential and risking the safety of these interactions. To address this need for forward-looking decisions, we used Speed Dating with storyboards to analyze the authentic voices of 12 students and 11 instructors on diverse use cases of possible AI systems in online learning. Findings show that participants envision adopting AI systems in online learning can enable personalized learner–instructor interaction at scale but at the risk of violating social boundaries. Although AI systems have been positively recognized for improving the quantity and quality of communication, for providing just-in-time, personalized support for large-scale settings, and for improving the feeling of connection, there were concerns about responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues. These findings have implications for the design of AI systems to ensure explainability, human-in-the-loop, and careful data collection and presentation. Overall, contributions of this study include the design of AI system storyboards which are technically feasible and positively support learner–instructor interaction, capturing students’ and instructors’ concerns of AI systems through Speed Dating, and suggesting practical implications for maximizing the positive impact of AI systems while minimizing the negative ones.","[{""name"": ""Kyoungwon Seo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joice Tang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ido Roll"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sidney Fels"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dongwook Yoon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1126/science.228.4698.456"", ""10.1145/3290605.3300534"", ""10.1007/s40593-016-0105-0"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1038/538020a"", ""10.1038/538311a"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-21814-0_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74853-3_25"", ""10.1108/S2055-364120200000033003"", ""10.1145/3330430.3333618"", ""10.1007/s00146-017-0693-8"", ""10.1109/3DUI.2017.7893357"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170377"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-52237-7_20"", ""10.1080/10494820.2014.961485"", ""10.17232/KSET.26.2.187"", ""10.1111/jcal.12005"", ""10.1080/13644360903086554"", ""10.1007/978-0-85729-224-7_22"", ""10.1145/3301019.3320000"", ""10.1145/3313831.3376727"", ""10.1038/s41562-016-0028"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.08.006"", ""10.1145/3313831.3376311"", ""10.24059/olj.v22i1.1092"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2018.01.003"", ""10.1080/08923648909526659"", ""10.7249/PE315"", ""10.1080/00220671.2016.1220359"", ""10.1177/1609406917733847"", ""10.1007/s40593-016-0122-z"", ""10.1186/s41039-017-0062-8"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.001"", ""10.24059/olj.v21i4.1240"", ""10.18608/jla.2015.21.2"", ""10.1007/s40593-016-0110-3"", ""10.1007/s40593-018-0170-7"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0113-2"", ""10.1080/07370024.2020.1744145"", ""10.1145/3386527.3405937"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104132"", ""10.1145/3313129"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019795"", ""10.1145/1142405.1142410"", ""10.1145/3375462.3375536"", ""10.1080/00461520.2011.611369"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1798995"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-13388-6_37"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.4018/JGIM.2018070108"", ""10.1145/3311927.3323139""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

However, as schools return, these changes may disappear. Moreover, not all of the changes are necessarily the changes we want in education. In this paper, we argue that the pandemic has created a unique opportunity for educational changes that have been proposed before COVID-19 but were never fully realized. We identify three big changes that education should make post COVID: curriculum that is developmental, personalized, and evolving; pedagogy that is student-centered, inquiry-based, authentic, and purposeful; and delivery of instruction that capitalizes on the strengths of both synchronous and asynchronous learning.","[{""name"": ""Yong Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jim Watterston"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.17323/1814-9545-2012-4-109-185"", ""10.1177/0162643416660835"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2010.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2010.12.001"", ""10.3102/0013189X15584327"", ""10.1080/15391523.2020.1734508"", ""10.1111/cogs.12107"", ""10.1080/00461520.2016.1155457"", ""10.1177/016146811311500307"", ""10.7249/RR1365"", ""10.1038/s41563-020-0678-8"", ""10.1007/s10833-011-9159-9"", ""10.1177/003172171209400111"", ""10.1080/0161956X.2018.1449896"", ""10.1080/00228958.2018.1481645"", ""10.4135/9781506316079"", ""10.1177/2096531120928082"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9620.2005.00544.x"", ""10.1177/2096531119878965""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13370,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Practical and ethical challenges of large language models in education: A systematic scoping review,"AbstractEducational technology innovations leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to automate the laborious process of generating and analysing textual content. While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (eg, question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs‐based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer‐reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state‐of‐the‐art models (eg, GPT‐3/4), embracing the initiative of open‐sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human‐centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the intersection of AI and education is continuously evolving, the findings of this study can serve as an essential reference point for researchers, allowing them to leverage the strengths, learn from the limitations, and uncover potential research opportunities enabled by ChatGPT and other generative AI models.Practitioner notesWhat is currently known about this topicGenerating and analysing text‐based content are time‐consuming and laborious tasks.Large language models are capable of efficiently analysing an unprecedented amount of textual content and completing complex natural language processing and generation tasks.Large language models have been increasingly used to develop educational technologies that aim to automate the generation and analysis of textual content, such as automated question generation and essay scoring.What this paper addsA comprehensive list of different educational tasks that could potentially benefit from LLMs‐based innovations through automation.A structured assessment of the practicality and ethicality of existing LLMs‐based innovations from seven important aspects using established frameworks.Three recommendations that could potentially support future studies to develop LLMs‐based innovations that are practical and ethical to implement in authentic educational contexts.Implications for practice and/or policyUpdating existing innovations with state‐of‐the‐art models may further reduce the amount of manual effort required for adapting existing models to different educational tasks.The reporting standards of empirical research that aims to develop educational technologies using large language models need to be improved.Adopting a human‐centred approach throughout the developmental process could contribute to resolving the practical and ethical challenges of large language models in education.","[{""name"": ""Lixiang Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Learning Analytics at Monash, Faculty of Information

10.1186/s12909-020-02286-z,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Interprofessional education: tips for design and implementation,"AbstractInterprofessional education (IPE) is a critical approach for preparing students to enter the health workforce, where teamwork and collaboration are important competencies. IPE has been promoted by a number of international health organisations, as part of a redesign of healthcare systems to promote interprofessional teamwork, to enhance the quality of patient care, and improve health outcomes. In response, universities are beginning to create and sustain authentic and inclusive IPE activities, with which students can engage. A growing number of health professionals are expected to support and facilitate interprofessional student groups. Designing interprofessional learning activities, and facilitating interprofessional groups of students requires an additional layer of skills compared with uniprofessional student groups.

10.1186/s41239-023-00426-1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Role of AI chatbots in education: systematic literature review,"AbstractAI chatbots shook the world not long ago with their potential to revolutionize education systems in a myriad of ways. AI chatbots can provide immediate support by answering questions, offering explanations, and providing additional resources. Chatbots can also act as virtual teaching assistants, supporting educators through various means. In this paper, we try to understand the full benefits of AI chatbots in education, their opportunities, challenges, potential limitations, concerns, and prospects of using AI chatbots in educational settings. We conducted an extensive search across various academic databases, and after applying specific predefined criteria, we selected a final set of 67 relevant studies for review. The research findings emphasize the numerous benefits of integrating AI chatbots in education, as seen from both students' and educators' perspectives. We found that students primarily gain from AI-powered chatbots in three key areas: homework and study assistance, a personalized learning experience, and the development of various skills. For educators, the main advantages are the time-saving assistance and improved pedagogy. However, our research also emphasizes significant challenges and critical factors that educators need to handle diligently. These include concerns related to AI applications such as reliability, accuracy, and ethical considerations.","[{""name"": ""Lasha Labadze"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maya Grigolia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lela Machaidze"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijin.2023.03.002"", ""10.14569/IJACSA.2023.0140602"", ""10.47852/bonviewAIA3202820"", ""10.1016/S0262-4079(11)62647-X"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4337484"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2023.107903"", ""10.1007/s11528-022-00715-y"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.08.233"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988510"", ""10.1007/s10796-022-10291-4"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4335905"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00000224"", ""10.1007/s10956-023-10039-y"", ""10.53761/1.20.3.02"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00392-8"", ""10.3390/su15042940"", ""10.5114/biolsport.2023.125623"", ""10.1109/MC.2018.3620971"", ""10.1186/s41239-022-00362-6"", ""10.2196/46885"", ""10.1007/s10758-022-09628-4"", ""10.31004/joe.v5i4.2563"", ""10.21744/lingcure.v5n1.1555"", ""10.1109/ICAICT.2010.5612054"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.12669/pjms.39.2.7653"", ""10.2501/JAR-2018-035"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2220401"", ""10.5220/0012039700003470"", ""10.46793/TIE22.223K"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11177-3"", ""10.1371/journal.pdig.0000198"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-12256-9"", ""10.3390/educsci13040410"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2023.2186203"", ""10.2196/48136"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2022.107600"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.05.013"", ""10.1002/cae.22326"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4351785"", ""10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.23"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103854"", ""10.23919/CISTI52073.2021.9476400"", ""10.1007/s00146-020-01033-8"", ""10.1007/s10439-023-03287-x"", ""10.1007/s10143-023-01998-2"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268224"", ""10.4018/JCIT.2021010101"", ""10.35542/osf.io/4mec3"", ""10.3390/educsci13020150"", ""10.1145/3334480.3382878"", ""10.1145/365153.365168"", ""10.3389/frai.2021.654924"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2022.258"", ""10.4018/IJTEE.326127""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The strong nonlinearities and complex geometries of soft actuators hinder the development of analytical models to describe their motion. Finite element modeling provides an effective solution to this issue and allows the user to predict performance and optimize soft actuator designs. Herein, the literature on a finite element analysis of soft actuators is reviewed. First, the required nonlinear elasticity concepts are introduced with a focus on the relevant models for soft robotics. In particular, the procedure for determining material constants for the hyperelastic models from material testing and curve fitting is explored. Then, a comprehensive review of constitutive model parameters for the most widely used silicone rubbers in the literature is provided. An overview of the procedure is provided for three commercially available software packages (Abaqus, Ansys, and COMSOL). The combination of modeling procedures, material properties, and design guidelines presented in this article can be used as a starting point for soft robotic actuator design.","[{""name"": ""Matheus S.

10.3102/0091732X20903304,EMERGENT APPROACHES FOR EDUCATION RESEARCH: WHAT COUNTS AS INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND WHAT EDUCATION RESEARCH COUNTS?,0401 Education; 0303 Sociology; 1204 Public Administration,Mining Big Data in Education: Affordances and Challenges,"The emergence of big data in educational contexts has led to new data-driven approaches to support informed decision making and efforts to improve educational effectiveness. Digital traces of student behavior promise more scalable and finer-grained understanding and support of learning processes, which were previously too costly to obtain with traditional data sources and methodologies. This synthetic review describes the affordances and applications of microlevel (e.g., clickstream data), mesolevel (e.g., text data), and macrolevel (e.g., institutional data) big data. For instance, clickstream data are often used to operationalize and understand knowledge, cognitive strategies, and behavioral processes in order to personalize and enhance instruction and learning. Corpora of student writing are often analyzed with natural language processing techniques to relate linguistic features to cognitive, social, behavioral, and affective processes. Institutional data are often used to improve student and administrational decision making through course guidance systems and early-warning systems. Furthermore, this chapter outlines current challenges of accessing, analyzing, and using big data. Such challenges include balancing data privacy and protection with data sharing and research, training researchers in educational data science methodologies, and navigating the tensions between explanation and prediction. We argue that addressing these challenges is worthwhile given the potential benefits of mining big data in education.","[{""name"": ""Christian Fischer"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tübingen""]}, {""name"": ""Zachary A.

10.3390/educsci10060165,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,COVID-19 School Closure-Related Changes to the Professional Life of a K-12 Teacher,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced K–12 school closures in spring 2020 to protect the well-being of society. The unplanned and unprecedented disruption to education changed the work of many teachers suddenly, and in many aspects. This case study examines the COVID-19 school closure-related changes to the professional life of a secondary school teacher in rural Alaska (United States), who had to teach his students online. A descriptive and explanatory single case study methodology was used to describe subsequent impacts on instructional practices and workload. Qualitative and quantitative data sources include participant observations, semi-structured interviews, artifacts (e.g., lesson plans, schedules, online time), and open-ended conversations. The results of this study demonstrate an increase and change in workload for the teacher and that online education can support learning for many students but needs to be carefully designed and individualized to not deepen inequality and social divides. The forced move to online learning may have been the catalyst to create a new, more effective hybrid model of educating students in the future. Not one single model for online learning will provide equitable educational opportunities for all and virtual learning cannot be seen as a cheap fix for the ongoing financial crisis in funding education.","[{""name"": ""Ute Kaden"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK 99775, USA""]}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8"", ""10.35542/osf.io/437e2"", ""10.1177/1090198120922942"", ""10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30084-0"", ""10.1126/science.367.6484.1287"", ""10.1177/2096531120922244"", ""10.1177/0022487119861582"", ""10.1080/08923647.2019.1554984"", ""10.3102/0091732X16667700"", ""10.4324/9781315223971"", ""10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30095-X"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30547-X"", ""10.1177/0013161X07309470"", ""10.4324/9780203858059""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

Understanding paradigm-specific assumptions helps illuminate the quality of findings that support scientific studies and identify gaps in generating sound evidence. This article focuses on the research paradigm of positivism, examining its definition, history, and assumptions (ontology, epistemology, axiology, methodology, and rigor). Positivism is aligned with the hypothetico-deductive model of science that builds on verifying a priori hypotheses and experimentation by operationalizing variables and measures; results from hypothesis testing are used to inform and advance science. Studies aligned with positivism generally focus on identifying explanatory associations or causal relationships through quantitative approaches, where empirically based findings from large sample sizes are favored—in this regard, generalizable inferences, replication of findings, and controlled experimentation have been principles guiding positivist science. Criteria for evaluating the quality of positivist research are discussed. An example from health professions education is provided to guide positivist thinking in study design and implementation.","[{""name"": ""Yoon Soo Park"", ""affiliation"": [""is associate professor and associate head, Department of Medical Education, and director of research, Office of Educational Affairs, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Lars Konge"", ""affiliation"": [""is professor, Copenhagen Academy for Medical Education and Simulation, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Anthony R.

Proponents argue that IVR could improve learning by increasing positive affective and cognitive processing, thereby supporting improved performance on tests of learning outcome, whereas opponents of IVR contend that it could hurt learning by increasing distraction, thereby disrupting cognitive learning processes and leading to poorer learning outcomes. In a media comparison study, students viewed a biology lesson either as an interactive animated journey in IVR or as a slideshow on a desktop monitor. Those who viewed the IVR lesson performed significantly worse on transfer tests, reported higher emotional arousal, reported more extraneous cognitive load and showed less engagement based on EEG measures than those who viewed the slideshow lesson, with or without practice questions added to the lessons. Mediational analyses showed that the lower retention scores for the IVR lesson were related to an increase in self‐reported extraneous cognitive load and emotional arousal. These results support the notion that immersive environments create high affective and cognitive distraction, which leads to poorer learning outcomes than desktop environments.","[{""name"": ""Jocelyn Parong"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences University of California, Santa Barbara  Santa Barbara California USA"", ""Department of Psychology University of Wisconsin–Madison  Madison Wisconsin USA""]}, {""name"": ""Richard E.

10.1186/s12909-022-03446-z,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Is YouTube a reliable source of health-related information? A systematic review,"Abstract Background YouTube is a valuable source of health-related educational material which can have a profound impact on people’s behaviors and decisions. However, YouTube contains a wide variety of unverified content that may promote unhealthy behaviors and activities. We aim in this systematic review to provide insight into the published literature concerning the quality of health information and educational videos found on YouTube. Methods We searched Google Scholar, Medline (through PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus, Direct Science, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases to find all papers on the analysis of medical and health-related content published in English up to August 2020. Based on eligibility criteria, 202 papers were included in our study. We reviewed every article and extracted relevant data such as the number of videos and assessors, the number and type of quality categories, and the recommendations made by the authors. The extracted data from the papers were aggregated using different methods to compile the results. Results The total number of videos assessed in the selected articles is 22,300 (median = 94, interquartile range = 50.5–133). The videos were evaluated by one or multiple assessors (median = 2, interquartile range = 1–3). The video quality was assessed by scoring, categorization, or based on creators’ bias. Researchers commonly employed scoring systems that are either standardized (e.g., GQS, DISCERN, and JAMA) or based upon the guidelines and recommendations of professional associations. Results from the aggregation of scoring or categorization data indicate that health-related content on YouTube is of average to below-average quality. The compiled results from bias-based classification show that only 32% of the videos appear neutral toward the health content. Furthermore, the majority of the studies confirmed either negative or no correlation between the quality and popularity of the assessed videos. Conclusions YouTube is not a reliable source of medical and health-related information. YouTube’s popularity-driven metrics such as the number of views and likes should not be considered quality indicators. YouTube should improve its ranking and recommender system to promote higher-quality content. One way is to consider expert reviews of medical and health-related videos and to include their assessment data in the ranking algorithm.","[{""name"": ""Wael Osman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fatma Mohamed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Elhassan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdulhadi Shoufan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2196/jmir.2237"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.09.027"", ""10.1016/j.amjms.2015.10.015"", ""10.1176/appi.ps.201500541"", ""10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002604"", ""10.5070/D32211033142"", ""10.2196/ijmr.2465"", ""10.1177/1460458213512220"", ""10.1016/j.euf.2019.09.017"", ""10.7759/cureus.10795"", ""10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101636"", ""10.1097/EDE.0b013e3181fe7825"", ""10.1007/s11845-019-02119-z"", ""10.3748/wjg.v20.i14.4066"", ""10.1308/003588414X13814021676396"", ""10.1016/j.auec.2020.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105309"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.03.074"", ""10.1080/09546634.2019.1605144"", ""10.1111/odi.12434"", ""10.1016/j.arthro.2014.06.009"", ""10.1016/j.eururo.2018.10.056"", ""10.1097/BRS.0000000000002691"", ""10.1111/odi.13161"", ""10.1007/s11845-018-1902-2"", ""10.1055/s-0039-1694786"", ""10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.08.066"", ""10.1186/1939-4551-8-S1-A221"", ""10.1002/clc.21981"", ""10.2196/ijmr.2669"", ""10.1007/s13187-020-01710-8"", ""10.3121/cmr.2013.1194"", ""10.1007/s00192-015-2908-1"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2012.12.013"", ""10.1007/s10067-015-2910-5"", ""10.33962/roneuro-2019-050"", ""10.1080/20477724.2018.1507784"", ""10.1016/j.jvsv.2016.10.078"", ""10.1111/ipd.12277"", ""10.31616/asj.2018.12.6.987"", ""10.1007/s00261-021-03154-0"", ""10.1016/j.arthro.2019.07.033"", ""10.1097/DSS.0000000000001242"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2017.05.006"", ""10.1007/s10067-020-05377-w"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2009.11.007"", ""10.1080/09273972.2020.1836002"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35063-4_40"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10414-x"", ""10.1145/3125659.3125692"", ""10.4166/kjg.2018.72.6.295"", ""10.5070/D3231033669"", ""10.5430/jnep.v6n10p116""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.3390/educsci10100291,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Online Delivery of Teaching and Laboratory Practices: Continuity of University Programmes during COVID-19 Pandemic,"A great number of universities worldwide are having their education interrupted, partially or fully, by the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Consequently, an increasing number of universities have taken the steps necessary to transform their teaching, including laboratory workshops into an online or blended mode of delivery. Irrespective of the measures taken, universities must continue to maintain their high academic standards and provide a high-quality student experience as required for delivery of learning outcomes associated with each degree programme. This has created a challenge across the higher education landscape, where academics had to switch to remote teaching and different approaches to achieving laboratory delivery. As a result, students have not been receiving face-to-face teaching, and access to laboratory facilities has been limited or nearly impossible. This paper reviews numerous approaches taken by universities to deliver teaching and laboratory practices remotely, in consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst also considering the potential impacts on the student learning experience. This review is primarily focused on the fields of engineering, science and technology, based on published literature including books, reviewing web-based provision of selected universities, institutional and national policy documents.","[{""name"": ""Kelum A.

10.1111/jar.12811,JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology; 1002 Clinical Medicine,Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of carers of people with intellectual disabilities,"AbstractIntroductionThe measures implemented to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic have been shown to impair mental health. This problem is likely to be exacerbated for carers.MethodInformal carers (mainly parents) of children and adults with intellectual disabilities, and a comparison group of parents of children without disabilities, completed an online questionnaire. Almost all the data were collected while strict lockdown conditions were in place.ResultsRelative to carers of children without intellectual disability, carers of both children and adults with intellectual disability had significantly greater levels of a wish fulfilment coping style, defeat/entrapment, anxiety, and depression. Differences were 2–3 times greater than reported in earlier pre‐pandemic studies. Positive correlations were found between objective stress scores and all mental health outcomes. Despite their greater mental health needs, carers of those with intellectual disability received less social support from a variety of sources.ConclusionsThe greater mental health needs of carers in the context of lesser social support raises serious concerns. We consider the policy implications of these findings.","[{""name"": ""Paul Willner"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Psychology Swansea University Swansea UK""]}, {""name"": ""John Rose"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Psychology University of Birmingham Birmingham UK""]}, {""name"": ""Biza Stenfert Kroese"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Psychology University of Birmingham Birmingham UK""]}, {""name"": ""Glynis H Murphy"", ""affiliation"": [""Tizard Centre University of Kent Canterbury UK""]}, {""name"": ""Peter E Langdon"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research University of Warwick Coventry UK"", ""Coventry and Warwichshire Partnership NHS Trust Coventry UK""]}, {""name"": ""Claire Clifford"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Researcher Solihull UK""]}, {""name"": ""Hayley Hutchings"", ""affiliation"": [""Swansea University Medical School Swansea UK""]}, {""name"": ""Alan Watkins"", ""affiliation"": [""Swansea University Medical School Swansea UK""]}, {""name"": ""Steve Hiles"", ""affiliation"": [""Swansea University Medical School Swansea UK""]}, {""name"": ""Vivien Cooper"", ""affiliation"": [""The Challenging Behaviour Foundation Chatham UK""]}]","[""10.1111/jppi.12352"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8"", ""10.1016/j.yebeh.2017.01.013"", ""10.1002/gps.2660"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310"", ""10.1017/ipm.2020.45"", ""10.1111/jir.12739"", ""10.1097/00005053-197712000-00006"", ""10.1002/mrdd.20144"", ""10.3109/13668250.2010.518562"", ""10.1186/s12877-016-0280-8"", ""10.1037/pas0000110"", ""10.1352/0047-6765(2002)040<0148:CSATIO>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30168-1"", ""10.1080/20473869.2020.1773711"", ""10.1177/1744629512472610"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x"", ""10.1097/PSY.0000000000000322"", ""10.2466/12.02.09.PR0.111.5.498-501"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.02.002"", ""10.5817/CP2017-1-1"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00600.x"", ""10.1111/jir.12170"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2788.2001.00372.x"", ""10.1097/NMD.0b013e3182613f91"", ""10.1111/jar.12496"", ""10.1111/jar.12292"", ""10.31234/osf.io/uvc78"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01634"", ""10.1097/YCO.0b013e3283476b0b"", ""10.1046/j.1468-3148.2003.00168.x"", ""10.1080/20473869.2020.1764257"", ""10.1352/0895-8017(2006)111[155:MOCSOD]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092"", ""10.1037/0021-843X.113.1.155"", ""10.1016/j.brat.2011.02.009"", ""10.1177/0020764015583921"", ""10.1177/0020764020915212"", ""10.1046/j.1440-172X.2001.00257.x"", ""10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.100942"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.04006.x"", ""10.1348/000711201161127"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2788.2009.01163.x""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"

The volatile memristors, which feature spontaneous decay of device conductance, own the distinct combination of high similarity to the biological neurons and synapses and unique physical mechanisms. They are excellent candidates for mimicking the synaptic functions and ideal randomness source of the entropy for hardware‐based security. Herein, the recent advances of volatile memristors in devices, mechanisms, and application aspects are summarized. First, a brief introduction is presented to describe the switching type, materials, and temporal response of volatile memristors. Second, the volatile switching mechanisms are discussed and grouped into ion effects, thermal effects, and electrical effects. Third, attention is focused on the applications of volatile memristors for access devices, neuromorphic computing (artificial neurons and synapses), and hardware security (true random number generators and physical unclonable functions). Finally, major challenges and future outlook of volatile memristors for neuromorphic computing and hardware security are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Ruopeng Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Electronics and Information Engineering Shenzhen University  Shenzhen 518060 P.

10.1111/bjet.13190,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Student engagement in online learning in Latin American higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review,"AbstractThe COVID‐19 pandemic has forced higher education institutions to implement online learning activities based on virtual platforms, allowing little time to prepare and train faculty members to familiarize students with digital technologies. While previous studies have looked at how students engaged with digital technologies in their learning activities, the characteristics of the student engagement in online learning remain underexplored. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on student engagement in online learning in higher education is much needed. This article synthesizes the findings on student engagement in Latin American higher education institutions during the COVID‐19 pandemic. After reviewing the studies on online learning activities, this review examines student engagement from behavioural, cognitive and affective dimensions and identifies the main characteristics of student engagement from these tripartite dimensions. The implications of the findings for online learning in Latin American higher education are as follows: (a) to transform higher education, (b) to provide adequate professional training, (c) to improve Internet connectivity, (d) to ensure quality online learning in higher education and (e) to provide emotional support. These findings will provide valuable guidance for teachers, educational authorities and policy makers and help them make informed decisions to use effective strategies to support online learning in higher education institutions. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic The COVID‐19 pandemic has disrupted the normal operation of higher education institutions across Latin America, impelling a shift from face‐to‐face instruction to online teaching and learning. Research on online learning in Latin American higher education has been conducted, but the findings and their implications are yet to be widely disseminated among researchers, practitioners and decision‐makers. What this paper adds Providing a systematic review of research on student engagement in online learning in Latin American higher education institutions. Analyzing the construct of student engagement in online learning from tripartite dimensions—behavioral, cognitive and affective—in the Latin American higher education context. Identifying the characteristics associated to each dimension of student engagement in online learning. Implications for practice and/or policy The need to transform the higher education system in Latin America and beyond, at two levels: to improve Internet connectivity at the technological level and to ensure the quality of online education at the pedagogical level. The urgency to offer an adequate professional training regarding the use of new technologies in online learning environments. The significance for higher education institutions to provide emotional support for students during the COVID‐10 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Sdenka Zobeida Salas‐Pilco"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education Central China Normal University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuqin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education Hubei Research Center for Educational Informatization Central China Normal University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhe Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong  Hong Kong Hong Kong S.

10.1111/modl.12693,MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL,0401 Education,A Control-Value Theory Approach to Boredom in English Classes Among University Students in China,"AbstractThere is a growing research interest in a variety of emotions in foreign and second language (L2) classrooms, especially since the introduction of positive psychology. However, research on the ubiquitous emotional experience of boredom is scant. Building on its prevalence and documented deleterious effects, I argue that research on the antecedents for the instigation of boredom is needed. Based on the control–value theory (CVT) of achievement emotions in educational psychology, this study took a mixed methods approach to examine control–value appraisals as antecedents of boredom in English‐as‐a‐foreign‐language learning among Chinese university students. In line with CVT assumptions, Pearson correlation analyses and regression analyses (N = 2,002) showed that different control–value appraisals predicted boredom uniquely or interactively. Qualitative data from interviews with 11 students and 11 English teachers expanded the quantitative results by including more complexities in the associations between control–value appraisals and boredom. These findings provide further support for the CVT and help to elucidate the instigation of boredom in the L2 learning context. Directions for future research and implications for L2 educational practice are discussed.","[{""name"": ""CHENGCHEN LI"", ""affiliation"": [""Huazhong University of Science and Technology School of Foreign Languages  1037 Luoyu Road Wuhan 430074 China""]}]","[""10.1111/modl.12569"", ""10.1037/a0016096"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2005.00311.x"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2014.4.2.5"", ""10.1511/2003.4.330"", ""10.1037/a0014695"", ""10.1007/BF03173468"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2009.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2006.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.jeap.2018.12.003"", ""10.1126/science.1177067"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2018.10.004"", ""10.4995/eurocall.2016.5693"", ""10.1080/09588221.2019.1677722"", ""10.1111/modl.12574"", ""10.1080/01434632.2019.1614187"", ""10.1515/applirev-2020-0124"", ""10.1515/applirev-2018-0043"", ""10.1177/1470785317744856"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2012.2.2.4"", ""10.1111/modl.12544"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2017.7.1.4"", ""10.1177/1362168820914004"", ""10.1016/j.system.2020.102259"", ""10.1007/s10648-006-9029-9"", ""10.1037/a0019243"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2010.10.002"", ""10.1037/a0036006"", ""10.4324/9780203148211"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00259.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-56892-8_7"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2018.8.1.6"", ""10.1111/lang.12079"", ""10.1111/modl.12573"", ""10.3102/0002831218786689"", ""10.1017/S0261444811000486"", ""10.1111/modl.12511"", ""10.1007/s10648-015-9301-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-75438-3_2""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This essay presents a rightful presence framework to guide the study of teaching and learning in justice-oriented ways. This framework highlights the limitations of equity as inclusion, which does not adequately address the ways in which systemic injustices manifest in local classroom practice. Rightful presence orients the field towards the importance of political struggles to make present the lives of those made missing by schooling and discipline-specific norms.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003473,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Decolonizing Global Health Education: Rethinking Institutional Partnerships and Approaches,"Global health often entails partnerships between institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that were previously colonized and high-income countries (HICs) that were colonizers. Little attention has been paid to the legacy of former colonial relationships and the influence they have on global health initiatives. There have been recent calls for the decolonization of global health education and the reexamination of assumptions and practices under pinning global health partnerships. Medicine’s role in colonialism cannot be ignored and requires critical review. There is a growing awareness of how knowledge generated in HICs defines practices and informs thinking to the detriment of knowledge systems in LMICs. Additionally, research partnerships often benefit the better-resourced partner. In this article, the authors offer a brief analysis of the intersections between colonialism, medicine, and global health education and explore the lingering impact of colonialist legacies on current global health programs and partnerships. They describe how “decolonized” perspectives have not gained sufficient traction and how inequitable power dynamics and neocolonialist assumptions continue to dominate. They discuss 5 approaches, and highlight resources, that challenge colonial paradigms in the global health arena. Furthermore, they argue for the inclusion of more transfor mative learning approaches to promote change in attitudes and practice. They call for critical reflection and concomitant action to shift colonial paradigms toward more equitable partnerships in global education.","[{""name"": ""Quentin G.

Although most models and frameworks focus on the pre-university level, there is a growing interest in knowing the state of digital competencies of university teachers, that is, the set of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for a teacher to make effective use of technologies. The aim of this research is to present a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus, to identify, analyze and classify the published articles between 2000 and 2021 on digital competences, and thus find and improve the research being done on digital skills and future avenues of teachers in the university context. The SciMAT software is used in the analysis. The initial search reveals more than 343 articles in English, of which 152 are duplicates and 135 are not related to the topic of study. After this filtering, 56 articles are obtained and analyzed in depth. The results reveal a predominance of research that focuses on analyzing teachers' self-assessment and reflection of their digital competencies. Teachers recognize that they have a low or medium–low digital competence, as well as the absence of certain competencies, especially those related to the evaluation of educational practice. Despite the multiple studies that address this issue, it is necessary to continue improving research in this area, deepening the assessment of teachers' digital competencies and design, on this basis, more practical and personalized training programs that respond to the needs of teachers in the digital era.","[{""name"": ""Verónica Basilotta-Gómez-Pablos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""María Matarranz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luis-Alberto Casado-Aranda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ana Otto"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/21532974.2019.1646169"", ""10.18517/ijaseit.10.1.10806"", ""10.5209/rced.65835"", ""10.3402/rlt.v22.21453"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2017.1391871"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0130-1"", ""10.15359/ree.24-s.2"", ""10.1016/j.edumed.2020.11.014"", ""10.6018/reifop.413601"", ""10.21071/edmetic.v9i1.12462"", ""10.1111/ejed.12345"", ""10.3390/math9172164"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2020.110416"", ""10.6018/red/56/6"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2010.10.002"", ""10.7195/ri14.v18i1.1519"", ""10.30557/QW000025"", ""10.6018/rie.34055"", ""10.1109/RITA.2020.3033225"", ""10.1108/OTH-03-2019-0014"", ""10.18848/2327-7955/CGP/v26i02/107-117"", ""10.3390/educsci10100276"", ""10.30935/cedtech/8707"", ""10.30827/publicaciones.v48i1.7327"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2021.100379"", ""10.1177/0033688220907401"", ""10.3233/EFI-190284"", ""10.3402/rlt.v23.28451"", ""10.15804/tner.2015.42.4.02"", ""10.18848/2327-0144/CGP/v19i02/59007"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10451-0"", ""10.53761/1.16.4.3"", ""10.3390/su122310128"", ""10.31992/0869-3617-2021-30-11-125-131"", ""10.12795/pixelbit.2019.i54.04"", ""10.1080/11356405.2019.1597564"", ""10.12795/pixelbit.74676"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.jul.23"", ""10.25029/od.2021.311.21"", ""10.30827/profesorado.v22i1.9917"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.01.005"", ""10.1111/bjet.13108""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13334,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Do AI chatbots improve students learning outcomes? Evidence from a meta-analysis,"AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are gaining increasing popularity in education. Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta‐analysis of the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study performed a meta‐analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to meta‐analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in primary education and secondary education. In addition, short interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions. Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students' learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human‐like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have been gaining increasing popularity in education. Studies undertaken so far have provided conflicting evidence concerning the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. There has remained a paucity of meta‐analyses synthesizing the contradictory findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. What this paper adds This study, through meta‐analysis, synthesized these recent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. This study found that AI chatbots could have a large effect on students' learning outcomes. This study found that the effects of AI chatbots were moderated by educational levels and intervention duration. Implications for practice and/or policy AI chatbot designers could make AI chatbots better by equipping AI chatbots with human‐like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence Practitioners and/or teachers should draw attention to the positive and negative effects of AI chatbots on students. Considering the importance of ChatGPT, more research is required to develop a better understanding of the effects of ChatGPT in education. More research is needed to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Rong Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Foreign Studies Beijing Language and Culture University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhonggen Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Foreign Studies Beijing Language and Culture University  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.mlwa.2020.100006"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100322"", ""10.1007/s10257‐020‐00471‐7"", ""10.1111/bjet.13158"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2022.785752"", ""10.1037/h0026256"", ""10.1007/s10639‐021‐10627‐8"", ""10.1111/j.0006‐341X.2000.00455.x"", ""10.1080/10494820.2022.2096638"", ""10.1186/s41239‐022‐00362‐6"", ""10.1177/07356331221077901"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.045"", ""10.1111/raq.12142"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.04.001"", ""10.47116/apjcri.2020.07.07"", ""10.1186/s12909‐022‐03898‐3"", ""10.1088/1742‐6596/1387/1/012020"", ""10.1136/bmj.d5928"", ""10.1002/sim.1186"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1960864"", ""10.1111/jcal.12610"", ""10.1080/09588221.2022.2095406"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.10.008"", ""10.1080/09588221.2021.1987272"", ""10.1080/09588221.2021.2021241"", ""10.1007/s10639‐018‐9777‐4"", ""10.15738/KJELL.21.202108.712"", ""10.1177/00222437211050351"", ""10.14400/JDC.2018.16.8.019"", ""10.14400/JDC.2018.16.2.001"", ""10.14400/JDC.2019.17.8.037"", ""10.2196/20678"", ""10.1007/s10639‐022‐11177‐3"", ""10.1186/s41239‐021‐00302‐w"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2021.100819"", ""10.1007/s11423‐022‐10142‐8"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1541359"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104576"", ""10.1016/j.invent.2022.100495"", ""10.1002/widm.1434"", ""10.3390/app12073239"", ""10.1002/ase.2261"", ""10.1177/2055207619871808"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2021.107093"", ""10.1186/s13643‐021‐01626‐4"", ""10.1177/10776958221149577"", ""10.1002/cae.22326"", ""10.1080/07294360.2013.841651"", ""10.1111/jcal.12611"", ""10.1145/3397481.3450648"", ""10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.9"", ""10.1111/bjet.12984"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106627"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.118"", ""10.24384/5cgf‐ab69"", ""10.1080/17439760.2013.837499"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.02.011"", ""10.1038/d41586‐023‐00288‐7"", ""10.1186/s41239‐021‐00269‐8"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2022.100434"", ""10.1145/3411764.3445781"", ""10.3389/frai.2021.654924"", ""10.1111/bjet.13023"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988252"", ""10.1007/s10956‐022‐09982‐z"", ""10.1177/0735633120952067"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1989466"", ""10.2196/22845"", ""10.1038/s41746‐022‐00589‐7""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1186/s40594-023-00418-7,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,AI literacy in K-12: a systematic literature review,"AbstractThe successful irruption of AI-based technology in our daily lives has led to a growing educational, social, and political interest in training citizens in AI. Education systems now need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12 education worldwide. We conducted a search process following the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179 documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning experience and theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular, personalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools. Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is co-designed with teachers.","[{""name"": ""Lorena Casal-Otero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alejandro Catala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carmen Fernández-Morante"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria Taboada"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Beatriz Cebreiro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Senén Barro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/CSCI.2016.0067"", ""10.1007/s13218-021-00725-7"", ""10.1145/3411764.3445226"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100040"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11286-z"", ""10.1111/jcal.12706"", ""10.1109/ICMCCE48743.2019.00192"", ""10.4324/9780429321191-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-63212-0_9"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.9864"", ""10.1109/ISET49818.2020.00040"", ""10.3390/math8112089"", ""10.1115/DETC2017-68368"", ""10.1109/EITT50754.2020.00021"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-0008-0"", ""10.1145/3368308.3415360"", ""10.1007/s11528-021-00637-1"", ""10.3390/su12145568"", ""10.1109/TE.2021.3085878"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00243-5"", ""10.1080/15391523.2022.2121344"", ""10.1145/3408877.3432452"", ""10.1002/jee.20503"", ""10.1109/CISTI.2015.7170616"", ""10.1109/MIS.2016.93"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-77022-8"", ""10.1145/3173386.3177038"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-18141-3_10"", ""10.1007/s13218-021-00737-3"", ""10.1109/WEEF-GEDC.2018.8629750"", ""10.1109/ICCSE.2019.8845429"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-6747-6_7"", ""10.18260/1-2--32050"", ""10.1007/s40593-017-0144-1"", ""10.1016/j.ijis.2020.09.001"", ""10.12802/relime.20.2322"", ""10.1109/CAC.2018.8623310"", ""10.1109/ICMCCE51767.2020.00469"", ""10.1007/s13218-021-00730-w"", ""10.1007/s13218-021-00733-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-57799-5_8"", ""10.1007/978-981-16-6955-2_9"", ""10.16920/jeet/2019/v33i1/149003"", ""10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637132"", ""10.1145/3328778.3366990"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98572-5"", ""10.1109/FIE.2016.7757570"", ""10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028537"", ""10.1007/s13218-021-00715-9"", ""10.1007/s13218-021-00716-8"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2022.100539"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-11600-3"", ""10.1007/s13218-021-00731-9"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100026"", ""10.1145/3341525.3393981"", ""10.1145/3408877.3432513"", ""10.4236/ce.2016.716233"", ""10.1145/3411764.3445377"", ""10.3390/su14137811"", ""10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274136"", ""10.1145/3313831.3376727"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-40271-6_27"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59847-1_1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00684.x"", ""10.1145/3283254.3283270"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11491-w"", ""10.3938/NPSM.70.660"", ""10.1145/3481312.3481351"", ""10.1145/3408877.3439642"", ""10.1109/VL/HCC51201.2021.9576163"", ""10.1007/11590361_29"", ""10.1109/ISEC49744.2020.9280629"", ""10.1145/3434780.3436705"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grab013"", ""10.1145/3341525.3387364"", ""10.1109/TALE.2018.8615249"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11416-7"", ""10.18178/ijiet.2021.11.9.1540"", ""10.1007/s11423-022-10111-1"", ""10.1109/PCTDDE.2018.8624771"", ""10.1145/2325296.2325354"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100065"", ""10.1177/21582440221100463"", ""10.1109/FIE.1995.483030"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097962"", ""10.18260/1-2--21624"", ""10.1109/ICALT49669.2020.00099"", ""10.1609/aimag.v40i4.5289"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019795"", ""10.1145/2839509.2844620"", ""10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17844"", ""10.1145/3459990.3460730"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2020.100182"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2021.100281"", ""10.3390/robotics10010013"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10570-8"", ""10.1145/3392063.3394440"", ""10.1109/ICAIE50891.2020.00022"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-62743-0_16"", ""10.1109/ICCSE49874.2020.9201652"", ""10.1145/3381884"", ""10.18517/ijaseit.10.4.12787"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-51968-1"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11547-x"", ""10.18178/IJLT.6.3.186-190"", ""10.1145/3465631.3465980"", ""10.1109/ISET55194.2022.00020"", ""10.3390/su142315620"", ""10.1155/2021/8812542"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-52237-7_48""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

10.3991/ijet.v16i03.18851,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING,0401 Education,A Review of Content-Based and Context-Based Recommendation Systems,"In our work, we have presented two widely used recommendation systems. We have presented a context-aware recommender system to filter the items associated with user’s interests coupled with a context-based recommender system to prescribe those items. In this study, context-aware recommender systems perceive the user’s location, time, and company. The context-based recommender system retrieves patterns from World Wide Web-based on the user’s past interactions and provides future news recommendations. We have presented different techniques to support media recommendations for smartphones, to create a framework for context-aware, to filter E-learning content, and to deliver convenient news to the user. To achieve this goal, we have used content-based, collaborative filtering, a hybrid recommender system, and implemented a Web ontology language (OWL). We have also used the Resource Description Framework (RDF), JAVA, machine learning, semantic mapping rules, and natural ontology languages that suggest user items related to the search. In our work, we have used E-paper to provide users with the required news. After applying the semantic reasoning approach, we have concluded that by some means, this approach works similarly as a content-based recommender system since by taking the gain of a semantic approach, we can also recommend items according to the user’s interests. In a content-based recommender system, the system provides additional options or results that rely on the user’s ratings, appraisals, and interests.","[{""name"": ""Umair Javed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kamran Shaukat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ibrahim A.

Central to this characterization is the presumption that teachers embrace racial equity and teaching about this topic. In contrast, others have documented the ongoing role of teachers in perpetuating racial inequality in schools. In this article, we employ data from two national data sets to investigate teachers’ explicit and implicit racial bias, comparing them to adults with similar characteristics. We find that both teachers and nonteachers hold pro-White explicit and implicit racial biases. Furthermore, differences between teachers and nonteachers were negligible or insignificant. The findings suggest that if schools are to effectively promote racial equity, teachers should be provided with training to either shift or mitigate the effects of their own racial biases.","[{""name"": ""Jordan G.

10.1186/s12909-020-02462-1,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students: a multicenter quantitative study,"Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the United States (US) medical education system with the necessary, yet unprecedented Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) national recommendation to pause all student clinical rotations with in-person patient care. This study is a quantitative analysis investigating the educational and psychological effects of the pandemic on US medical students and their reactions to the AAMC recommendation in order to inform medical education policy. Methods The authors sent a cross-sectional survey via email to medical students in their clinical training years at six medical schools during the initial peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey questions aimed to evaluate students’ perceptions of COVID-19’s impact on medical education; ethical obligations during a pandemic; infection risk; anxiety and burnout; willingness and needed preparations to return to clinical rotations. Results Seven hundred forty-one (29.5%) students responded. Nearly all students (93.7%) were not involved in clinical rotations with in-person patient contact at the time the study was conducted. Reactions to being removed were mixed, with 75.8% feeling this was appropriate, 34.7% guilty, 33.5% disappointed, and 27.0% relieved. Most students (74.7%) agreed the pandemic had significantly disrupted their medical education, and believed they should continue with normal clinical rotations during this pandemic (61.3%). When asked if they would accept the risk of infection with COVID-19 if they returned to the clinical setting, 83.4% agreed. Students reported the pandemic had moderate effects on their stress and anxiety levels with 84.1% of respondents feeling at least somewhat anxious. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (53.5%) was the most important factor to feel safe returning to clinical rotations, followed by adequate testing for infection (19.3%) and antibody testing (16.2%). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the education of US medical students in their clinical training years. The majority of students wanted to return to clinical rotations and were willing to accept the risk of COVID-19 infection. Students were most concerned with having enough PPE if allowed to return to clinical activities.","[{""name"": ""Aaron J.

La educación ha sido uno de los más afectados debido a la imposición administrativa del cierre total de los centros educativos en gran parte de los países del mundo. La modalidad de educación a distancia, fundamentalmente en soporte digital, vino a ofrecer soluciones de emergencia a dicha crisis. En este trabajo se lleva a cabo una reflexión sobre las percepciones previas al COVID-19 relativas a esta modalidad educativa. Posteriormente se aportan ideas sobre la forma en que se acometió mayoritariamente la respuesta educativa al confinamiento a través de una educación de emergencia en remoto que se alejaba considerablemente de lo apropiado en diseños y desarrollos de una educación a distancia de calidad. Fueron muchos los errores cometidos y, por tanto, demasiadas las percepciones negativas por parte de muchos estudiantes, familias y docentes, bastantes de estos últimos ya reacios previamente a estos formatos más novedosos. Finalmente se aborda en el artículo la problemática más reciente, relativa a los tiempos de posconfinamiento, en los que no se prevé que en los centros presenciales todos los estudiantes puedan acudir a las aulas físicas en el mismo espacio y tiempo. Se ofrecen sugerencias sobre cómo abordar esta problemática a través de soluciones de hibridación, de una enseñanza y aprendizaje mixtos, combinados o, mejor, integrados y flexibles.","[{""name"": ""Lorenzo García Aretio"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

10.1007/s11423-020-09788-z,ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,0401 Education,Utilising learning analytics to support study success in higher education: a systematic review,"AbstractStudy success includes the successful completion of a first degree in higher education to the largest extent, and the successful completion of individual learning tasks to the smallest extent. Factors affecting study success range from individual dispositions (e.g., motivation, prior academic performance) to characteristics of the educational environment (e.g., attendance, active learning, social embeddedness). Recent developments in learning analytics, which are a socio-technical data mining and analytic practice in educational contexts, show promise in enhancing study success in higher education, through the collection and analysis of data from learners, learning processes, and learning environments in order to provide meaningful feedback and scaffolds when needed. This research reports a systematic review focusing on empirical evidence, demonstrating how learning analytics have been successful in facilitating study success in continuation and completion of students’ university courses. Using standardised steps of conducting a systematic review, an initial set of 6220 articles was identified. The final sample includes 46 key publications. The findings obtained in this systematic review suggest that there are a considerable number of learning analytics approaches which utilise effective techniques in supporting study success and students at risk of dropping out. However, rigorous, large-scale evidence of the effectiveness of learning analytics in supporting study success is still lacking. The tested variables, algorithms, and methods collected in this systematic review can be used as a guide in helping researchers and educators to further improve the design and implementation of learning analytics systems.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Ifenthaler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jane Yin-Kim Yau"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.18608/jla.2014.13.3"", ""10.1145/2330601.2330666"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64792-0_13"", ""10.1353/jhe.2006.0037"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-5716-0_11"", ""10.3102/00346543055004485"", ""10.1007/s10758-014-9223-7"", ""10.1007/s10734-018-0243-4"", ""10.18608/jla.2016.32.11"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0095-8"", ""10.1145/2628194.2628199"", ""10.1287/ited.2016.0169"", ""10.1145/2787622.2787710"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0044-3"", ""10.1007/s11423-017-9524-3"", ""10.1109/TLT.2016.2616312"", ""10.1111/jcal.12270"", ""10.1145/3041021.3054164"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027405"", ""10.1109/FIE.2018.8659196"", ""10.1145/2723576.2723590"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.10.002"", ""10.1007/s11528-014-0822-x"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.003"", ""10.1145/3291533.3291551"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64792-0_14"", ""10.1145/3241748.3241760"", ""10.1145/3284179.3284235"", ""10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9471"", ""10.1111/ejed.12097"", ""10.1007/s10758-017-9329-9"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.002"", ""10.1007/s11528-016-0154-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41099-5_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64792-0_2"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9477-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-15130-0_1"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9480-3"", ""10.3217/zfhe-8-02/11"", ""10.1007/s10758-015-9260-x"", ""10.1007/s12564-015-9403-8"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2018.1485053"", ""10.1111/bjet.12720"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64792-0_6"", ""10.1038/s41539-017-0006-5"", ""10.1080/10494820.2016.1278391"", ""10.1007/s10758-016-9286-8"", ""10.1145/3303772.3303800"", ""10.14742/ajet.3058"", ""10.1080/07294360.2010.487200"", ""10.1145/2808580.2808621"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.028"", ""10.1002/cae.22155"", ""10.17705/1CAIS.03743"", ""10.1145/3027385.3029479"", ""10.1515/jsarp-2013-0011"", ""10.1111/bjet.12152"", ""10.1002/abc.20025"", ""10.14742/ajet.4314"", ""10.1145/2723576.2723585"", ""10.1177/1469787408095846"", ""10.1007/s10758-017-9316-1"", ""10.1145/2567574.2567629"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(02)00158-6"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2017.1309376"", ""10.3217/zfhe-10-04/09"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9458-1"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.06.030"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-30295-9_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52977-6_2"", ""10.1007/s10758-019-09399-5"", ""10.1177/0002764213479366"", ""10.1109/T4E.2016.048"", ""10.5120/19502-1097"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2013.07.046"", ""10.1080/02680930210140257"", ""10.2307/1981525"", ""10.1177/1521025115621917"", ""10.18608/jla.2018.53.2"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-5546-3_11"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.027"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9464-3"", ""10.1145/3051457.3053974"", ""10.1080/03075070903581533"", ""10.1145/2460296.2460324"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64792-0_1"", ""10.24059/olj.v21i3.1017""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1186/s12909-022-03154-8,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Effectiveness of problem-based learning methodology in undergraduate medical education: a scoping review,"Abstract Background Problem-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogical approach that shifts the role of the teacher to the student (student-centered) and is based on self-directed learning. Although PBL has been adopted in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education, the effectiveness of the method is still under discussion. The author’s purpose was to appraise available international evidence concerning to the effectiveness and usefulness of PBL methodology in undergraduate medical teaching programs. Methods The authors applied the Arksey and O’Malley framework to undertake a scoping review. The search was carried out in February 2021 in PubMed and Web of Science including all publications in English and Spanish with no limits on publication date, study design or country of origin. Results The literature search identified one hundred and twenty-four publications eligible for this review. Despite the fact that this review included many studies, their design was heterogeneous and only a few provided a high scientific evidence methodology (randomized design and/or systematic reviews with meta-analysis). Furthermore, most were single-center experiences with small sample size and there were no large multi-center studies. PBL methodology obtained a high level of satisfaction, especially among students. It was more effective than other more traditional (or lecture-based methods) at improving social and communication skills, problem-solving and self-learning skills. Knowledge retention and academic performance weren’t worse (and in many studies were better) than with traditional methods. PBL was not universally widespread, probably because requires greater human resources and continuous training for its implementation. Conclusion PBL is an effective and satisfactory methodology for medical education. It is likely that through PBL medical students will not only acquire knowledge but also other competencies that are needed in medical professionalism.","[{""name"": ""Joan Carles Trullàs"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carles Blay"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elisabet Sarri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ramon Pujol"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/00001888-199009000-00045"", ""10.12968/hmed.2017.78.11.C167"", ""10.1186/s12909-021-02638-3"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.948828"", ""10.1080/1364557032000119616"", ""10.1186/1748-5908-5-69"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1123"", ""10.7326/M18-0850"", ""10.1097/00001888-199602000-00028"", ""10.1080/10401339609539776"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.1998.00152.x"", ""10.1207/S15328015TLM1002\\_3"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls0702\\_2"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.1999.00347.x"", ""10.1007/s00282-999-0137-0"", ""10.1017/S0317167100000287"", ""10.1001/archopht.117.9.1223"", ""10.1367/1539-4409(2001)001<0132:suopbl>2.0.co;2"", ""10.1016/s0749-3797(01)00395-6"", ""10.1002/sim.1132"", ""10.1207/S15328015TLM1404\\_2"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2004.01818.x"", ""10.1016/j.ajog.2005.07.061"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-5-7"", ""10.1136/bmj.38636.582546.7C"", ""10.1007/s00276-004-0293-4"", ""10.1097/00001888-200503000-00020"", ""10.1097/01.ACM.0000232411.97399.c6"", ""10.1001/archophthalmol.2009.110"", ""10.1016/S1607-551X(09)70075-0"", ""10.1002/ase.151"", ""10.1017/S0022215110001702"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2011.531169"", ""10.1007/s10900-011-9495-y"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.719651"", ""10.1038/srep05126"", ""10.5812/ircmj.5186"", ""10.15537/smj.2015.3.10216"", ""10.1016/j.jtumed.2014.01.008"", ""10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2015.06.001"", ""10.1080/02701960.2016.1152268"", ""10.14260/jemds/2017/22"", ""10.1016/j.tjog.2017.04.011"", ""10.4103/1357-6283.210512"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000010069"", ""10.5209/RCED.53581"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000014052"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1626-7"", ""10.5281/zenodo.2562660"", ""10.1016/j.cca.2020.08.037"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02306"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000019687"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2020.1762031"", ""10.1097/00001888-199210000-00016"", ""10.1097/00001888-199308000-00012"", ""10.1097/00001888-199811000-00022"", ""10.1023/A:1009829831978"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.1999.00289.x"", ""10.1097/00001888-200104000-00016"", ""10.1152/advances.2001.25.4.249"", ""10.1080/01421590220125286"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03131.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2007.02959.x"", ""10.1007/s10459-008-9098-2"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03410.x"", ""10.1111/medu.12047"", ""10.12669/pjms.341.13485"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1714-8"", ""10.1002/ase.1891"", ""10.1097/00001888-199611000-00020"", ""10.1097/01.CCM.0000190619.42013.94"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-9-63"", ""10.3109/01421599109089907"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.1991.tb00090.x"", ""10.1097/00001888-199503000-00019"", ""10.1097/00001888-199610000-00018"", ""10.1097/00001888-199604000-00019"", ""10.1097/00001888-199708000-00015"", ""10.1152/advances.2000.24.1.8"", ""10.1152/advances.2001.25.4.225"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2001.1077d.x"", ""10.1207/s15328015tlm1603\\_15"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.07.014"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.737965"", ""10.4137/JMECDECDECD.S29926"", ""10.11604/pamj.2017.27.13.10623"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S160814"", ""10.33844/ijol.2019.60392"", ""10.1016/j.jmir.2020.06.009"", ""10.14235/bas.galenos.2019.3471"", ""10.1136/emj.17.5.320"", ""10.1016/S1076-6332(03)80693-1"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03406.x"", ""10.1177/1010539512436875"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2019.16.20"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S189062"", ""10.1016/0738-0593(96)00001-6"", ""10.1152/advan.90214.2008"", ""10.15537/smj.2015.11.12263"", ""10.1111/j.0004-8461.2004.01317.x"", ""10.1016/j.amsu.2016.11.011"", ""10.3109/01421599609034147"", ""10.4067/S0034-98872014000800006"", ""10.3402/meo.v21.30049"", ""10.1023/A:1014516206120"", ""10.1080/01421590220134105"", ""10.1080/01421590078797"", ""10.1080/10245330512331390267"", ""10.1016/S1607-551X(09)70072-5"", ""10.1016/s0210-4806(05)73193-4"", ""10.1186/s12909-015-0501-4"", ""10.1097/00001888-200308000-00010"", ""10.1097/00001888-199307000-00015"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e31803eac4c"", ""10.1503/cmaj.070565"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2018.1465179""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Family Practice', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

This article explores instructional techniques used in the transition, student perceptions of effectiveness/enjoyment/accessibility of those techniques, barriers that students faced due to the transition, and race/class/gender inequality in experiencing those barriers. We used surveys in introductory courses by two instructors (the authors) to compare students’ reactions to our transitions and the transitions in their other courses. We found that which instructional technique instructors use is less important than how well they implement it for student learning. Although there is a tradeoff between enjoyment and accessibility, instructors can use techniques to increase accessibility of interactive formats. Internet and technology barriers were extremely common, even for students who did not anticipate problems. Most students experienced barriers to their learning due to the pandemic, including distractions, increased anxiety, and feeling less motivated, especially for nonwhite, female, and first-generation college students.","[{""name"": ""Alanna Gillis"", ""affiliation"": [""St. Lawrence University, Canton, NY, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Laura M.

Data‐driven methods such as machine learning are especially suited to systems with governing functions that are unknown, impractical or impossible to represent analytically, or computationally intractable to integrate into real‐world solutions. Function approximation with careful formulation of the machine learning architecture enables the encoding of dynamic behavior and nonlinearities, with the added potential to address hysteresis and nonstationary behavior. Supervised learning and reinforcement learning in simulation and on a wide variety of physical robotic systems have shown promising results for the use of empirical data‐driven methods as a solution to contemporary soft robotics problems.","[{""name"": ""Keene Chin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Carnegie Mellon University  Pittsburgh PA 15213 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Tess Hellebrekers"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Carnegie Mellon University  Pittsburgh PA 15213 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Carmel Majidi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Carnegie Mellon University  Pittsburgh PA 15213 USA""]}]","[""10.1080/11762320802557865"", ""10.1002/anie.201800907"", ""10.1002/admt.201800477"", ""10.1038/nature14543"", ""10.1089/soro.2013.0001"", ""10.1038/s42256-019-0103-7"", ""10.1038/s42256-018-0009-9"", ""10.1089/soro.2017.0075"", ""10.1109/TRO.2017.2765684"", ""10.1016/j.eml.2016.02.007"", ""10.1080/01691864.2017.1395362"", ""10.1089/soro.2016.0010"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-45528-0"", ""10.1109/LRA.2018.2792684"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aav1488"", ""10.1002/aisy.201900025"", ""10.1109/LRA.2019.2950118"", ""10.1089/soro.2018.0086"", ""10.26599/TST.2019.9010009"", ""10.1109/LRA.2018.2810544"", ""10.1109/LRA.2019.2926959"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2018.2874647"", ""10.1080/01691864.2015.1037793"", ""10.1088/1748-3190/aa839f"", ""10.1089/soro.2016.0065"", ""10.1109/LRA.2017.2734247"", ""10.1089/soro.2016.0051"", ""10.1109/ICCAR.2016.7486707"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989079"", ""10.1109/MRA.2016.2636360"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2016.08.003"", ""10.1109/LRA.2018.2797241"", ""10.1089/soro.2015.0013"", ""10.1007/s12555-016-0462-3"", ""10.1089/soro.2017.0007"", ""10.1109/MRA.2016.2636366"", ""10.1145/2661735.2661737"", ""10.1098/rsif.2017.0937""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Condensed Matter Physics', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.731), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7181)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

10.1108/ITSE-06-2020-0087,INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION,0401 Education,Impact of coronavirus pandemic on the Indian education sector: perspectives of teachers on online teaching and assessments,"Purpose In India, the COVID-19 outbreak has been declared an epidemic in all its states and union territories. To combat COVID-19, lockdown was imposed on March 25, 2020 which has adversely affected the education system in the country. It has changed the traditional education system to the educational technologies (EdTechs) model, where teaching and assessments are conducted online. This paper aims to identify the barriers faced by teachers during online teaching and assessment in different home environment settings in India. Design/methodology/approach Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of qualitative research methodology has been used in this research. The study was conducted among the teachers working in the government and private universities of Uttarakhand, India. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted among 19 teachers to collect data regarding the barriers faced by them during online teaching and assessment. ATLAS.ti, version 8 was used to analyze the interview data. Findings The findings revealed four categories of barriers that are faced by teachers during online teaching and assessments. Under home environment settings, a lack of basic facilities, external distraction and family interruption during teaching and conducting assessments were major issues reported. Institutional support barriers such as the budget for purchasing advanced technologies, a lack of training, a lack of technical support and a lack of clarity and direction were also reported. Teachers also faced technical difficulties. The difficulties were grouped under a lack of technical support, it included a lack of technical infrastructure, limited awareness of online teaching platforms and security concerns. Teachers’ personal problems including a lack of technical knowledge, negative attitude, course integration with technology and a lack of motivation are identified as the fourth category to damper their engagement in online teaching and assessments. Practical implications The findings of the study can be helpful to the regulatory authorities and employers of higher education institutions who are planning to adopt online teaching as a regular activity in the future. The insights gained from the findings can help them to revisit their existing policy frameworks by designing new strategies and technical structures to assist their teachers in successfully embracing the EdTech to deal with any crisis in the future. Originality/value Many authors have conducted research to address the problems faced by students related to online teaching and learning during COVID-19 in India. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that addresses the challenges faced by teachers during the online teaching and assessment in the home environment settings by using qualitative analysis (IPA) techniques. The current study replenishes the gap by contributing to the literature of online teaching and assessment under the home environment settings during the pandemic situation.","[{""name"": ""Amit Joshi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muddu Vinay"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Preeti Bhaskar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7575/aiac.ijels.v.5n.2p.9"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.03.015"", ""10.17010/pijom/2020/v13i4/151825"", ""10.3109/09593985.2010.488278"", ""10.1504/IJLC.2019.101662"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.11.015"", ""10.1080/15538605.2015.1103679"", ""10.1108/S1746-979120150000011003"", ""10.4018/IJOPCD.2020010101"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2017.11.337"", ""10.1080/10668920701884505"", ""10.4103/ijo.IJO_1241_20"", ""10.1080/08870449608400256"", ""10.1080/17437199.2010.510659"", ""10.4135/9781446207536.d10"", ""10.1080/02667360701661165"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.06.030"", ""10.1080/13598660802232779""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.3102/0013189X19890600,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,Identifying Critical 21st-Century Skills for Workplace Success: A Content Analysis of Job Advertisements,"This article extends the literature on 21st-century learning skills needed for workplace success by providing an empirical examination of employers’ direct communication to potential employees via job advertisements. Our descriptive analysis of 142,000 job advertisements provides two contributions. First, this is one of the first studies to empirically rank-order skill demand. In doing so, it is clear that oral and written communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills are in high demand by employers, with particular emphasis on the pairing of oral and written communication. Furthermore, it is apparent that many of the skills suggested in the literature as being critical for workplace success are in very low demand by employers, and some were not found to be mentioned at all (e.g., social responsibility). Second, this study explicitly examined whether 21st-century skill demand varied by job characteristics, which was found to be the case, with differences being noted for both education level and degree field requirements. Results were replicated with a sample of roughly 120,000 job advertisements collected 1 year from the initial data collection. Implications for developing educational standards around 21st-century skill development are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Joseph A.

A total of 149 articles were selected from three major academic databases using search strings and manual screening protocols. The literature analysis emphasized four interrelated aspects of VR‐based instruction: instructional context, instructional design, technological affordances, and research findings. The results revealed evolving trends in the VR literature in terms of publication patterns, pedagogical assumptions, equipment usage, and research methodologies, as well as the contextual factors behind VR adoption in education. Additionally, a meta‐analysis was conducted to examine the efficacy of VR‐based instruction, with results indicating an overall medium effect and several moderating factors. Finally, practical implications and a future research agenda for VR‐based instruction are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Heng Luo"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education Central China Normal University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Gege Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education Central China Normal University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Qinna Feng"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education Central China Normal University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuqin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education Central China Normal University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Mingzhang Zuo"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education Central China Normal University  Wuhan China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.11.002"", ""10.3102/0034654319854352"", ""10.1046/j.0266-4909.2001.00167.x"", ""10.1080/09500690305027"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_39"", ""10.1007/s11528-016-0102-z"", ""10.1162/105474603322955950"", ""10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943058"", ""10.1177/1046878106293677"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.01.014"", ""10.3102/00346543053004445"", ""10.1111/1467-8721.ep10768783"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.01038.x"", ""10.1177/0273475311420236"", ""10.3928/01484834-20120409-02"", ""10.1111/bjet.12028"", ""10.1111/bjet.12135"", ""10.3102/10769986006002107"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00900.x"", ""10.1002/trtr.1720"", ""10.1007/s10339-018-0897-y"", ""10.1034/j.1600-0579.2003.00299.x"", ""10.1007/s12528-020-09249-9"", ""10.1080/10494820600697687"", ""10.1007/s11423-007-9037-6"", ""10.3102/0013189X20912798"", ""10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.apmr.2014.10.019"", ""10.1080/15389588.2019.1694667"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2020.1737210"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.02.002"", ""10.1111/jcal.12335"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02364"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09812-2"", ""10.1089/109493102760147150"", ""10.4018/jwltt.2012010102"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.10.020"", ""10.1007/s10956-012-9431-7"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.94.3.598"", ""10.14742/ajet.3840"", ""10.1027/2192-0923/a000134"", ""10.1093/jpepsy/jsj030"", ""10.5012/jkcs.2002.46.5.450"", ""10.1007/s10639-007-9031-y"", ""10.1007/s11528-019-00401-6"", ""10.1007/s10639-016-9537-2"", ""10.1111/1467-8535.00321"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103778"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09811-3"", ""10.1093/jpepsy/jsx147"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2017.05.013"", ""10.1002/cae.10014"", ""10.1080/09500693.2011.605182"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.10.002"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09736-x"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00812.x"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.019"", ""10.1037/1076-898X.11.3.175"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-0618-5_10"", ""10.1002/dei.162"", ""10.2190/FLHV-K4WA-WPVQ-H0YM"", ""10.1111/j.1469-7610.1976.tb00381.x"", ""10.1111/bjet.13023"", ""10.1007/s11528-019-00389-z"", ""10.23919/iLRN47897.2020.9155137"", ""10.3991/ijet.v14i13.10710""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Information Systems', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

The introduction of AI into education marks a significant departure from conventional teaching methods, offering personalized learning and support for diverse educational requirements, including students with special needs. However, this integration presents challenges, including the need for comprehensive educator training and curriculum adaptation to align with societal structures. AI literacy is identified as crucial, encompassing an understanding of AI technologies and their broader societal impacts. Prompt engineering is highlighted as a key skill for eliciting specific responses from AI systems, thereby enriching educational experiences and promoting critical thinking. There is detailed analysis of strategies for embedding these skills within educational curricula and pedagogical practices. This is discussed through a case-study based on a Swiss university and a narrative literature review, followed by practical suggestions of how to implement AI in the classroom.","[{""name"": ""Yoshija Walter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/bdcc7030124"", ""10.30935/cedtech/13152"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-12-2018-0136"", ""10.1007/s43681-021-00096-7"", ""10.28945/2258"", ""10.7759/cureus.35179"", ""10.36841/consilium.v3i2.3437"", ""10.1111/ajag.12572"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2010.10.020"", ""10.1007/s11023-012-9281-3"", ""10.1186/s40594-023-00418-7"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.00280"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.01185"", ""10.1007/s11423-023-10244-x"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2253861"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100118"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2304.14997"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2209.01390"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2206.00169"", ""10.53761/1.20.5.02"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100180"", ""10.1080/15228053.2023.2233814"", ""10.1080/13632434.2023.2246856"", ""10.18178/ijiet.2020.10.7.1418"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2310.06856"", ""10.1007/s00146-017-0693-8"", ""10.1080/02642069.2023.2258799"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2101.06484"", ""10.5662/wjm.v13.i4.170"", ""10.1080/15391523.2022.2142873"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100026"", ""10.12681/jpentai.34616"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100101"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-12249-8"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2206.02336"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2110.08387"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2307.03172"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2107.13586"", ""10.1016/j.colegn.2021.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijedro.2023.100296"", ""10.1177/20539517231206804"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100050"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2309.02029"", ""10.1155/2022/6468995"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2301.05217"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11491-w"", ""10.1007/s11423-023-10203-6"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100041"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2255228"", ""10.1109/ICALT58122.2023.00074"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11316-w"", ""10.1007/s40593-022-00304-3"", ""10.1177/01626434231211295"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4599104"", ""10.1007/s40593-016-0110-3"", ""10.1007/s00146-016-0667-2"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100127"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100160"", ""10.1007/s10643-019-00989-7"", ""10.17352/tcsit.000024"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-47546-7_33"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2309.12337"", ""10.3390/educsci13100998"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2209.12687"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2203.11171"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2201.11903"", ""10.1145/3408877.3439690"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.14688"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.10601"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1111/jcal.12722"", ""10.1007/s40593-022-00293-3"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2211.01910"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2307.05471"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2307.15043""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02266-3,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Students' and lecturers' perspective on the implementation of online learning in dental education due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): a cross-sectional study,"Abstract Background On account of physical distancing measures, universities worldwide are strongly affected by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Thus, the dental school of Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany) transferred the established “face-to-face” learning to online learning in the spring term 2020. The aim of this study was to assess the students’ and lecturers’ perspectives on the implementation of online learning due to COVID-19, using a questionnaire survey. Methods After the online period, all students and lecturers were asked to fill out an online questionnaire containing evaluative statements regarding handling, didactic benefit, motivation, and overall assessment. Furthermore, the questionnaire for lecturers contained additional aspects regarding knowledge gain in terms of providing online learning. Besides that, students and lecturers were asked for the amount of online learning in the future curriculum (independent of COVID-19). Data were subjected to regression analysis and T-test (p &lt; .05). Results 36.8% of students preferred “face-to-face” learning instead of sole online learning. An increase of know how concerning online teaching was observable for lecturers. Both, students and lecturers, want to keep up with online courses in the future curriculum. However, in terms of the optimal amount of online learning a significant difference between students’ and lecturers’ perspective was observed. While students suggested 53.2% (24.9) (mean (standard deviation)) lecturers only stated 38.6% (21.5). Conclusions Within the limitation of this study, students’ and lecturers’ showed a predominantly positive perspective on the implementation of online learning, providing the chance to use online learning even beyond COVID-19 in the future curriculum.","[{""name"": ""Maximiliane Amelie Schlenz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander Schmidt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernd Wöstmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nobert Krämer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nelly Schulz-Weidner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1056/NEJMoa2001316"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.02.034"", ""10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.14.2000550"", ""10.1620/tjem.250.271"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1924"", ""10.3390/dj8020053"", ""10.1080/10872981.2020.1771245"", ""10.1002/jdd.12163"", ""10.1002/jdd.12162"", ""10.1038/sj.bdj.4810723"", ""10.1038/sj.bdj.4810819"", ""10.1177/0022034520914246"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0579.2006.00413.x"", ""10.3390/fi12060094"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2007.71.2.tb04275.x"", ""10.1186/s12903-020-01071-0"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2014.78.10.tb05816.x"", ""10.21815/JDE.016.015"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2014.78.3.tb05684.x"", ""10.1080/00224545.1963.9919489"", ""10.1080/01421590601039893"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.09.004"", ""10.1080/10872981.2019.1583969"", ""10.1016/j.sdentj.2017.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.zefq.2017.07.007""]","['Dentistry', 'Medicine']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Infectious Diseases', 'General Dentistry']","[[('1003 口腔医学', 0.78), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7342), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7246), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7141), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7138)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.7328), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6867)]]"

A plethora of primary studies began investigating a range of topics exploring teaching and learning in higher education, particularly during the initial semester. In order to provide an overview and initial understanding of this emerging research field, a systematic mapping review was conducted that collates and describes the characteristics of 282 primary empirical studies. Findings reveal that research was carried out mostly descriptively and cross-sectionally, focusing predominantly on undergraduate students and their perceptions of teaching and learning during the pandemic. Studies originate from a broad range of countries, are overwhelmingly published open access, and largely focused on the fields ofHealth &amp; WelfareandNatural Sciences, Mathematics &amp; Statistics. Educational technology used for emergency remote teaching are most oftensynchronous collaborative tools, used in combination withtext-based tools. The findings are discussed against pre-pandemic research on educational technology use in higher education teaching and learning, and perspectives for further research are provided.","[{""name"": ""Melissa Bond"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Svenja Bedenlier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victoria I.

Using nationwide data from Project Implicit, we found that teachers’ implicit White/Black biases (as measured by the implicit association test) vary by teacher gender and race. Teachers’ adjusted bias levels are lower in counties with larger shares of Black students. In the aggregate, counties in which teachers hold higher levels of implicit and explicit racial bias have larger adjusted White/Black test score inequalities and White/Black suspension disparities.","[{""name"": ""Mark J.

Their property of providing semantically structured information has brought important possible solutions for many tasks including question answering, recommendation and information retrieval, and is considered to offer great promise for building more intelligent machines by many researchers. Although knowledge graphs have already supported multiple “Big Data” applications in all sorts of commercial and scientific domains since Google coined this term in 2012, there was no previous study give a systemically review of the application of knowledge graphs. Therefore, unlike other related work which focuses on the construction techniques of knowledge graphs, this present paper aims at providing a first survey on these applications stemming from different domains. This paper also points out that while important advancements of applying knowledge graphs’ great ability of providing semantically structured information into specific domains have been made in recent years, several aspects still remain to be explored.","[{""name"": ""Xiaohan Zou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2009.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2008.06.001"", ""10.1609/aimag.v31i3.2303"", ""10.1145/3269206.3271739"", ""10.1007/s10791-015-9267-x"", ""10.18653/v1/P18-1223"", ""10.1155/2017/2858423"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-05778-z"", ""10.1016/j.eng.2018.01.004"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2019.153"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2015.12.004"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0128193"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2839607"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912627"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12048"", ""10.1155/2017/5072427"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2018.07.001""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

FOS technologies hold great promise to form the backbone for next‐generation intelligent sensing platforms that offer long‐distance, high‐accuracy, distributed measurement capabilities and multiparametric monitoring with resilience to harsh environmental conditions. The major limitations posed by FOS are 1) cross‐sensitivity, 2) enormous volume and large data generation, 3) low data processing speed, 4) degradation of signal‐to‐noise ratio over the fiber length, and 5) overall cost of sensor and interrogator systems. These challenges can be overcome by building advanced data analytics engines enabled by recent breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). This article presents a comprehensive review of recent studies that integrate ML and AI algorithms with FOS technologies. This review also highlights several FOS technology development directions that promise a significant impact on widespread use for several industrial applications, with an emphasis on energy systems monitoring.

Students still prefer classroom classes over online classes due to many problems they face when taking online classes, such as lack of motivation, understanding of the material, decrease in communication levels between the students and their instructors and their feeling of isolation caused by online classes.Research limitations/implicationsThis research studied the impact from students' perspective only as the sample was selected only from students.Originality/valueThis research reached the students’ point of view in a broader way which will help understanding the issues and provide effective solutions. This research suggested that instructors must communicate with their students and vice versa in more informal channels (instant messages online chat groups, audio calls, private video calls …) in parallel with the formal channels (online platforms, email …). Finally, instructors should encourage students to participate and study more by providing different kind of incentives.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Alawamleh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lana Mohannad Al-Twait"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gharam Raafat Al-Saht"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.53841/bpsicpr.2007.2.1.78"", ""10.1007/BF03032699"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.11.006"", ""10.1257/000282802320191778"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-0939-6.ch002"", ""10.1177/002224377901600110"", ""10.1177/002194369303000101"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2013.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.064"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-0700-2_2"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v12i6.1030"", ""10.19030/cier.v6i4.8102"", ""10.1145/1089107.1089139"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.01.014"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2014.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2011.04.019"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.12.034"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000552"", ""10.1177/0021943607309351"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.10.075"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.09.004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2000.tb00199.x"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.1.128"", ""10.4324/9780203831076"", ""10.1002/sres.2285"", ""10.28945/160"", ""10.1080/00461520802178441"", ""10.1016/j.jsp.2006.04.003"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(02)00164-1"", ""10.1108/13563280710744847"", ""10.2190/7BAK-EGAH-3MH1-K7C6"", ""10.1080/13538322.2012.667263"", ""10.19030/cier.v8i4.9433""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13232,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Teachers' trust in AI-powered educational technology and a professional development program to improve it,"AbstractEvidence from various domains underlines the critical role that human factors, and especially trust, play in adopting technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI‐specific misconceptions, myths and fears (e.g., mass unemployment and privacy violations). In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K‐12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K‐12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI‐powered Educational Technology (AI‐EdTech). This paper sheds light on teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech and presents effective professional development strategies to increase teachers' trust and willingness to apply AI‐EdTech in their classrooms. Our experiments with K‐12 science teachers were conducted around their interactions with a specific AI‐powered assessment tool (termed AI‐Grader) using both synthetic and real data. The results indicate that presenting teachers with some explanations of (i) how AI makes decisions, particularly compared to the human experts, and (ii) how AI can complement and give additional strengths to teachers, rather than replacing them, can reduce teachers' concerns and improve their trust in AI‐EdTech. The contribution of this research is threefold. First, it emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI‐EdTech in K‐12 education. Second, it presents a teacher professional development program (PDP), as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it. Third, based on the results observed, it presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming to improve teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Human factors, and especially trust, play a critical role in practitioners' adoption of technology. In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K‐12 education. Little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K‐12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI‐powered Educational Technology. What this paper adds This research emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI‐EdTech in K‐12 education. It presents a teacher professional development program (PDP) to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech, as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it. It presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming at improving teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech. Implications for practice and/or policy Pre‐ and in‐service teacher education programs that aim to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech should include a section providing teachers with a basic understanding of AI. PDPs aimed to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech should focus on concrete pedagogical tasks and specific AI‐powered tools that are considered by teachers as helpful and worth the effort to learn. AI‐EdTech should not restrict teachers to follow specific pedagogical scenarios, but rather provide teachers with the freedom to design and implement various types of pedagogies that meet their preferences, students' needs, and classroom reality. Teacher agency is key to gaining their trust. AI‐EdTech should allow teachers to review, modify, and if necessary, override AI‐based recommendations before they are sent to students.","[{""name"": ""Tanya Nazaretsky"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Science Teaching Weizmann Institute of Science  Rehovot Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Moriah Ariely"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Science Teaching Weizmann Institute of Science  Rehovot Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Mutlu Cukurova"", ""affiliation"": [""UCL Institute of Education University College London  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Giora Alexandron"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Science Teaching Weizmann Institute of Science  Rehovot Israel""]}]","[""10.1007/s40593‐021‐00283‐x"", ""10.1145/2567574.2567593"", ""10.18608/jla.2019.62.1"", ""10.1002/9780470519851"", ""10.1007/s40593-019-00188-w"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1037/xge0000033"", ""10.1177/23821205211036836"", ""10.1145/2858036.2858402"", ""10.1518/hfes.46.1.50.30392"", ""10.2307/2578601"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-2115-4"", ""10.1038/s41746-020-0294-7"", ""10.1177/2372732215600886"", ""10.1145/3506860.3506866"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-26068-2_3"", ""10.1111/bjet.12152"", ""10.2307/259206"", ""10.1080/02602938.2014.880777"", ""10.1177/0956797619861429"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027400"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124"", ""10.1145/3476068"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002044"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883864"", ""10.1145/3290605.3300509""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003401,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Medical Student Mobilization During a Crisis: Lessons From a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team,"Problem On March 17, 2020, the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended the suspension of all direct patient contact responsibilities for medical students because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this change, medical students nationwide had to grapple with how and where they could fill the evolving needs of their schools’ affiliated clinical sites, physicians, patients, and the community. Approach At Harvard Medical School (HMS), student leaders created a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team to: (1) develop a student-led organizational structure that would optimize students’ ability to efficiently mobilize interested peers in the COVID-19 response, both clinically and in the community, in a strategic, safe, smart, and resource-conscious way; and (2) serve as a liaison with the administration and hospital leaders to identify evolving needs and rapidly engage students in those efforts. Outcomes Within a week of its inception, the COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team had more than 500 medical student volunteers from HMS and had shared the organizational framework of the response team with multiple medical schools across the country. The HMS student volunteers joined any of the 4 virtual committees to complete this work: Education for the Medical Community, Education for the Broader Community, Activism for Clinical Support, and Community Activism. Next Steps The COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team helped to quickly mobilize hundreds of students and has been integrated into HMS’s daily workflow. It may serve as a useful model for other schools and hospitals seeking medical student assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps include expanding the initiative further, working with the leaders of response teams at other medical schools to coordinate efforts, and identifying new areas of need at local hospitals and within nearby communities that might benefit from medical student involvement as the pandemic evolves.","[{""name"": ""Derek Soled"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""Shivangi Goel"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""Danika Barry"", ""affiliation"": [""is a fourth-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""Parsa Erfani"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""Nicholos Joseph"", ""affiliation"": [""is a second-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""Michael Kochis"", ""affiliation"": [""is a fourth-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""Nishant Uppal"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""David Velasquez"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""Kruti Vora"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}, {""name"": ""Kirstin Woody Scott"", ""affiliation"": [""is a fourth-year student, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]}]","[""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002726"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1803771""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Emergency Medical Services', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public’s health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans. Advancing the COVID-19 response, saving lives and restarting the economy necessitate rapidly addressing these inequities rather than ignoring and even reinforcing them.","[{""name"": ""Nneoma E Okonkwo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ugochi T Aguwa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Minyoung Jang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iman A Barré"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kathleen R Page"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patrick S Sullivan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Beyrer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stefan Baral"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/DMP.0b013e31818aaf55"", ""10.1101/2020.05.04.20090274"", ""10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30114-8"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.08.042"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2005687"", ""10.5305/intelegamate.53.6.1227"", ""10.1080/07393140902872245"", ""10.1542/peds.2019-0206"", ""10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30081-5"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2005953"", ""10.15585/mmwr.mm6913e2"", ""10.2105/AJPH.87.2.217""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

This study aims to investigate how to improve online learning effectiveness during this special time. Through a mixed design, this study revealed the effect of educational levels, gender, and personality traits on online learning outcomes. It was concluded that postgraduates (N = 599) outperformed undergraduates (N = 553) in online learning, learners (N = 1152) with strong personality traits such as agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to a new experience outperformed those with strong extraversion and neuroticism. Future research could improve interpersonal interactions and encourage learners to post words in the online discussion forum, focus on how to design scaffolding online learning and how to improve the quality and dynamic of the online contents, and highlight blended learning rather than either merely online or traditional face-to-face learning.","[{""name"": ""Zhonggen Yu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.iheduc.2019.100724"", ""10.1037/a0028496"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.08.018"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2011.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.system.2012.10.013"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.1991.tb00688.x"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.3.595"", ""10.1016/j.newideapsych.2019.100759"", ""10.3102/00346543074003379"", ""10.14742/ajet.4162"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00668"", ""10.21432/T2B88W"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.030"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2010.01.004"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2005.00542.x"", ""10.1021/j.jchemed.0c00783"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.06.002"", ""10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.192"", ""10.1007/s11528-014-0753-6"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.10.002"", ""10.1111/hequ.12116"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.08.015"", ""10.1007/s11423-007-9065-2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.01.014"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.01.001"", ""10.4103/ijo.IJO_1241_20"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2013.06.007"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02208-z"", ""10.1016/S0923-4748(97)00010-6"", ""10.4018/IJHCITP.2016070103"", ""10.1109/TLT.2019.2924223"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107204"", ""10.3390/su13020781"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103695"", ""10.1207/s15327752jpa6401_2"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2014.03.022"", ""10.1177/016146811311500307"", ""10.4103/ijo.IJO_2535_20"", ""10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2785"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.05.016"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2014.10.005"", ""10.1080/0307507032000122305"", ""10.1108/S2044-9968(2013)000006G007"", ""10.3102/00346543076001093"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00541"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2018.05.019"", ""10.1002/ece3.6948"", ""10.1007/s12528-012-9059-x"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2014.07.011"", ""10.1108/IJILT-03-2019-0040"", ""10.1021/j.jchemed.0c00543"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2015.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.11.013""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13028,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Effects of an immersive virtual reality-based classroom on students' learning performance in science lessons,"AbstractThe increased availability and development of immersive technologies have given students growing opportunities to engage in different educational subjects. However, there is a lack of empirical research exploring the educational influence of using Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in science classrooms. To address this gap, this study developed a series of IVR‐based science lessons for middle‐school students and further examined these lessons’ effects on learning performance. Our quasi‐experimental approach employed a pretest and posttest to measure academic achievement and questionnaires to measure engagement and technology acceptance. A total of 90 sixth‐grade students from two classes were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group engaged with the science lessons using Head‐Mounted Displays, whereas the control group learned the same material through traditional teaching methods. The results revealed that the experimental group obtained significantly higher academic achievement and engagement scores (cognitive, behavioral, emotional and social) than the control group. Moreover, the experimental group had a high level of technology acceptance for IVR usage in classrooms. Our study provides empirical evidence for IVR’s use in science education. Furthermore, it also sheds light on how to develop and implement an IVR‐based classroom for formal educational purposes. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic? Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been applied to different educational subjects and there is some empirical evidence indicating its potential benefits for students’ learning. VR is considered to have potential for educational uses in classrooms. Many studies have applied non‐immersive VR to science subjects, but few have focused on the use of Immersive VR (IVR) in everyday classrooms. What this paper adds We developed and implemented an IVR‐based teaching platform containing a set of systematic science lessons that students can engage in with Head‐Mounted Displays in classrooms. The results revealed that adopting IVR science lessons in the classroom can improve students’ academic achievement and engagement. Implications for practice and/or policy This study contributes to identifying the positive influences of an IVR‐based classroom on students’ science academic achievement and engagement. The results provide practical insights into developing and implementing an IVR‐based classroom for educational purposes. This study offers a concrete example of using IVR in middle‐school classrooms for formal science education.","[{""name"": ""Ruixue Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lei Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jing Lei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Qiu Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Youqun Ren"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3991/ijet.v15i05.11890"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.04.011"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.08.031"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2017.2653117"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02321"", ""10.1111/bjet.12790"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2015.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103600"", ""10.1111/bjet.12956"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.004"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.01038.x"", ""10.1109/VRAIS.1996.490534"", ""10.1111/bjet.12806"", ""10.1080/10508406.1999.9672075"", ""10.1007/s10956-005-0221-3"", ""10.1111/bjet.12842"", ""10.1111/bjet.12893"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.005"", ""10.1007/s10956-013-9441-0"", ""10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.07.010"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00531.x"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-5490-7"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2016.07.078"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9581-2"", ""10.1111/bjet.12954"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2017.12.007"", ""10.4018/jgcms.2011010107"", ""10.1177/0735633119854034"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199706)48:6<484::AID-ASI2>3.0.CO;2-Q"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-3949-0.ch008"", ""10.1037/edu0000241"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2015.2403312"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1681467"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.10.002"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00812.x"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.019"", ""10.1007/s10763-009-9181-z"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.01.008"", ""10.1080/10494820.2014.994533"", ""10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.01.005"", ""10.20448/journal.522.2018.42.62.69""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

Among the various neuromorphic devices, optoelectronic synapses are promising neuromorphic devices that use optical means to mimic synaptic plasticity and related functions. Compared with classical neuromorphic chip based on electronic synapses using electrical means, photonic neuromorphic chip using light as input spike signal can be attractive alternative approach for next‐generation artificial intelligent system capable of high density, low power consumption, and low crosstalk.

10.1111/flan.12460,FOREIGN LANGUAGE ANNALS,0401 Education,Planned online language education versus crisis-prompted online language teaching: Lessons for the future,"AbstractOnline (language) teaching has been found to be as effective as face‐to‐face (F2F) learning (Moneypenny &amp; Aldrich 2016, J. Educators Online, 13, 105–174; Goertler &amp; Gacs, 2018, Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German, 51, 156–174). Online language teaching has different affordances and challenges than F2F teaching, which can be taken into consideration when online language education is carefully planned using a backwards design iterative process (e.g., Meskill &amp; Anthony, 2015, Teaching language online). In early 2020, many institutions rapidly transitioned away from F2F instruction due to the global pandemic. While this was at times referred to as online teaching, it in fact is not planned online teaching but rather crisis‐prompted remote teaching (Hodges, Moore, Lockee, Trust, &amp; Bond, 2020, Educause Review, 27 March). Given the circumstances and the timeframes for crisis online teaching, quality expectations must be lowered especially in regards to testing security, technological sophistication, accessibility, copyright, and learning outcomes. This article presents a roadmap for planning, implementing, and evaluating online education in ideal and in crisis contexts.","[{""name"": ""Adam Gacs"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Linguistics and Germanic Slavic, Asian, and African Languages, Michigan State University  East Lansing Michigan""]}, {""name"": ""Senta Goertler"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Linguistics and Germanic Slavic, Asian, and African Languages, Michigan State University  East Lansing Michigan""]}, {""name"": ""Shannon Spasova"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Linguistics and Germanic Slavic, Asian, and African Languages, Michigan State University  East Lansing Michigan""]}]","[""10.1016/j.system.2012.10.013"", ""10.1017/S0261444809005850"", ""10.1111/modl.12301"", ""10.17161/iallt.v46i2.8562"", ""10.1111/tger.12071"", ""10.1075/tblt.6.02gon"", ""10.1057/9781137514370"", ""10.1057/9781137412263"", ""10.21832/9781783093786"", ""10.1558/cj.33855"", ""10.1558/cj.v25i2.189-206"", ""10.1111/modl.12220"", ""10.14705/rpnet.2019.38.1039"", ""10.1017/S0261444806003727""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Education', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1186/s41239-021-00289-4,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Adaptive e-learning environment based on learning styles and its impact on development students' engagement,"AbstractAdaptive e-learning is viewed as stimulation to support learning and improve student engagement, so designing appropriate adaptive e-learning environments contributes to personalizing instruction to reinforce learning outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to design an adaptive e-learning environment based on students' learning styles and study the impact of the adaptive e-learning environment on students’ engagement. This research attempts as well to outline and compare the proposed adaptive e-learning environment with a conventional e-learning approach. The paper is based on mixed research methods that were used to study the impact as follows: Development method is used in designing the adaptive e-learning environment, a quasi-experimental research design for conducting the research experiment. The student engagement scale is used to measure the following affective and behavioral factors of engagement (skills, participation/interaction, performance, emotional). The results revealed that the experimental group is statistically significantly higher than those in the control group. These experimental results imply the potential of an adaptive e-learning environment to engage students towards learning. Several practical recommendations forward from this paper: how to design a base for adaptive e-learning based on the learning styles and their implementation; how to increase the impact of adaptive e-learning in education; how to raise cost efficiency of education. The proposed adaptive e-learning approach and the results can help e-learning institutes in designing and developing more customized and adaptive e-learning environments to reinforce student engagement.","[{""name"": ""Hassan A.

10.3390/educsci10070180,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,COVID-19 and the Digital Transformation of Education: What Are We Learning on 4IR in South Africa?,"The study sought to assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic in motivating digital transformation in the education sector in South Africa. The study was premised on the fact that learning in South Africa and the rest of the world came to a standstill due to the lockdown necessitated by COVID-19. To assess the impact, the study tracked the rate at which the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) tools were used by various institutions during the COVID-19 lockdown. Data were obtained from secondary sources. The findings are that, in South Africa, during the lockdown, a variety of 4IR tools were unleashed from primary education to higher and tertiary education where educational activities switched to remote (online) learning. These observations reflect that South Africa generally has some pockets of excellence to drive the education sector into the 4IR, which has the potential to increase access. Access to education, particularly at a higher education level, has always been a challenge due to a limited number of spaces available. Much as this pandemic has brought with it massive human suffering across the globe, it has presented an opportunity to assess successes and failures of deployed technologies, costs associated with them, and scaling these technologies to improve access.","[{""name"": ""David Mhlanga"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Accounting, Auckland Park, P.O.

In this sense, an investigation was carried out on the design, development and use of a metaverse as a digital tool of didactic support to students of the Faculty of Systems Engineering of the University of Cundinamarca, with a view to establishing its viability to be implemented in a course of mathematics and demonstrate the possibilities offered by this type of resource to motivate the student in his training. The metaverse design included various ICT tools, thereby promoting self-learning and collaborative learning. Finally, it was evaluated what was the appreciation of a group of students against their interaction with the metaverse, which validated its usefulness and functionality inside and outside the classroom.","[{""name"": ""Jairo Eduardo Márquez Díaz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Camilo Andrés Domínguez Saldaña"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Camilo Alberto Rodríguez Ávila"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

It then highlights multiple changes in the instruments and scaling methods used by PISA over time, and suggests ways of resolving the tensions behind some of these changes and thereby stabilise the measure of ESCS. A stable definition and operational procedure to derive the ESCS index appears essential to compare the ESCS-achievement relationship over time. Some of the suggestions included in this article were already implemented in the 2018 cycle.","[{""name"": ""Francesco Avvisati"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/a0024448"", ""10.1177/1477878515620887"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.21.2.13"", ""10.1515/9780691188485-005"", ""10.1016/0049-089X(92)90017-B"", ""10.1542/peds.108.2.e31"", ""10.1093/esr/jcu072"", ""10.1136/jech.55.10.731"", ""10.2307/2112830"", ""10.2307/1129211"", ""10.1016/j.intell.2019.04.005"", ""10.1787/9789264195905-en"", ""10.1787/9789264010666-en"", ""10.1787/9789264010543-en"", ""10.1787/9789264048096-en"", ""10.1787/9789264167872-en"", ""10.1787/6341a959-en"", ""10.1787/9789264301603-en"", ""10.1787/9789264073234-en"", ""10.1080/08957347.2017.1353985"", ""10.2304/rcie.2013.8.3.259"", ""10.3102/00346543075003417"", ""10.1787/5js1kv8crsjf-en""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3991/ijet.v15i21.15647,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING,0401 Education,Students' Satisfaction with Online Learning Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This research aims to evaluate the level of postsecondary student satisfaction with online learning platforms and learning experiences during the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This paper is based on the premise of transformative learning theories [1], which describe the learners’ authority and investment over their learning. Quantitative research was carried out using a survey that was sent out to 283 students enrolled at one higher education institution in KSA. These data were analyzed using SPSS. Average Mean Score (AMS) was used for data analysis, where the results are validated using the Standard Deviation (SD), Skewness and Kurtosis test, and Cronbach Alpha test. The research findings revealed that the students are satisfied with the university staff and faculty members who agreed on specific online platforms to use, grading system, assessment options, training workshops, online technical support, and more. The research findings also showed that participants were highly satisfied with Google Hangouts the most for lecture delivery, followed by Google Classroom and LMS (Moodle) for course management and assessments. With only respect to the students’ online learning experiences, the COVID-19 situation within this study context was handled adequately. This study calls for further research into the integration of professional development workshops and practical training courses for online learning and teaching to endorse innovative teaching techniques and alternative assessment plans for instructors, learners, administrators, and policymakers.","[{""name"": ""Norah Almusharraf"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shabir Khahro"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1108/JPCC-05-2020-0019,JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL CAPITAL AND COMMUNITY,0401 Education,Beyond COVID-19 supernova. Is another education coming?,"PurposeThis article explores social and educational responses to COVID-19 as seen through the lens of the Spanish education, in which professional capital and community is at the epicenter of the fight against the pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThis is a reflective and forward-thinking piece in which educators are presented as first responders to the crisis. The article is structured in four parts. First, the opportunities and barriers that COVID-19 is encountering in 21st-century education are commented on. Second, there is recognition of the need to be connected more than ever; and the vital role of networks. Third, the article discusses the effort to realize the maxim “not to leave anyone behind.” Fourth, the last section summarizes the key points related to the aspects to which education should devote its efforts in the coming months and years in Spain.FindingsThere is a set of reasons why the Spanish education system is extremely vulnerable to the consequences caused by COVID-19, and these include, among others: the high rates of socioeconomic segregation, of school dropouts and of academic failure; poor culture of networking and collaboration; overcrowded classrooms that hinders quality education; an obsolete curriculum; the consideration of education as a political currency; the need to strengthen bimodal education; and teachers' obligation to update their digital competences.Originality/valueThe article questions whether another education is possible beyond the pandemic and promotes a deep reflection in this particular context for practitioners and policymakers on which topics more attention could be focused during this time of turmoil.","[{""name"": ""Cecilia Azorín"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JPCC-03-2018-0012"", ""10.1080/13632434.2020.1745396"", ""10.1080/13632434.2019.1647418"", ""10.1080/13632434.2019.1699525"", ""10.1038/s41550-020-1066-7""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Being fundamentally different from traditional rigid robots, soft robots exhibit properties of infinite degrees of freedom (DOF) and nonlinear materials properties that require innovations in control systems. With the rapid development of materials science, robotics, and artificial intelligence, the diversification of actuator mechanisms and algorithms has enabled a wide range of unique control strategies. This review summarizes the basics of actuator mechanisms and control strategies, including open‐loop control, closed‐loop control, and autonomous control, and discusses their implementation from diversified perspectives. Control strategies are evaluated based on their compatibility with materials sets, application goals, and implementation route. The emerging directions are forecasted from the perspectives of interfacing between controller and actuator, underactuated control strategies, and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI).","[{""name"": ""Jue Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Purdue University  500 Central Dr West Lafayette IN 47907 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Alex Chortos"", ""affiliation"": [""Purdue University  500 Central

Memristors are assembled in crossbar arrays with data bits encoded by the resistance of individual cells. Despite the proposed high density and excellent scalability, the sneak‐path current causing cross interference impedes their practical applications. Therefore, developing novel architectures to mitigate sneak‐path current and improve efficiency, reliability, and stability may benefit next‐generation storage‐class memory (SCM). Moreover, conventional digital computers face the von‐Neumann bottleneck and the slowdown of transistors’ scaling, imposing a big challenge to hardware artificial intelligence. Memristive crossbar features colocation of memory and processing units, as well as superior scalability, making it a promising candidate for hardware accelerating machine learning and neuromorphic computing. Herein, first, crossbar architecture is introduced. Then, for storage, the origin of sneak‐path current is reviewed and techniques to mitigate this issue from the angle of materials and circuits are discussed. Computing wise, the applications of memristive crossbars in both machine learning and neuromorphic computing are surveyed, focusing on the structure of unit cells, the network topology, and the learning types. Finally, a perspective on future engineering and applications of memristive crossbars is discussed.","[{""name"": ""Huihan Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Quantum Physics Key Laboratory of

10.3102/0013189X231167149,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,Beyond Making a Statement: An Intersectional Framing of the Power and Possibilities of Positioning,"In this essay, two women of Color researchers examine the intersections of race and disability and ask, “What is the power and purpose of positioning and positionality statements?” Informed by Black feminist theory, and drawing from the DisCrit tenets of intersectional oppressions, historicity, and whiteness and ability as property, the authors focus on researchers’ positioning in relation to how they engage and communicate knowledge about multiply marginalized people. Positionality statements, they argue, must be more than a listing of identities or a claim on authority through the naming of professional proximity to marginalized communities. Recognizing the increasing expectations for education scholars to articulate positionality in their scholarship, the authors offer a three-pronged intersectional framework, with provocations about the onto-epistemic, sociohistoric, and sociocultural elements of positioning. Education researchers interested in conveying how intersectional oppressions effect knowledge production will find this framework useful for crafting positionality statements that consider the multidimensional nature of power, oppression, and research in relation to their field, the literature, and multiply marginalized participants.","[{""name"": ""Mildred Boveda"", ""affiliation"": [""Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA""]}, {""name"": ""Subini Ancy Annamma"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University, Stanford, CA""]}]","[""10.1177/1473325010370188"", ""10.4324/9781003199113-28"", ""10.1080/13613324.2012.730511"", ""10.3102/0091732X18759041"", ""10.1017/S1742058X13000271"", ""10.1177/001440290807400303"", ""10.1080/09687599.2015.1030066"", ""10.1037/h0034701"", ""10.1007/s11256-018-00493-z"", ""10.1080/09518398.2020.1771465"", ""10.1007/BF02697787"", ""10.1080/00330124.2016.1252268"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5914.1990.tb00174.x"", ""10.34293/education.v8i4.3232"", ""10.18061/dsq.v34i2.4248"", ""10.1080/00131946.2019.1687481"", ""10.4324/9781351046077"", ""10.29098/crs.v1i2.25"", ""10.2307/1341787"", ""10.1080/02757200500219289"", ""10.34293/education.v8i4.3232"", ""10.1177/07417136211003612"", ""10.1177/1609406919870075"", ""10.1136/emermed-2017-207158"", ""10.1177/016146819509700104"", ""10.1177/016146811111301008"", ""10.1002/9781118340349.ch3"", ""10.1177/1468794118770078"", ""10.3102/0013189X07309471"", ""10.3102/0034654319901128"", ""10.1080/17508487.2017.1285335"", ""10.1080/0951839032000060635"", ""10.1002/jee.20377"", ""10.1002/fea2.12040"", ""10.1002/ncp.10623""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000005439,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,ChatGPT and Generative Artificial Intelligence for Medical Education: Potential Impact and Opportunity,"Abstract ChatGPT has ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) that already has significant consequences for many industries, including health care and education. Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, refer to AI that is designed to create or generate new content, such as text, images, or music, from their trained parameters. With free access online and an easy-to-use conversational interface, ChatGPT quickly accumulated more than 100 million users within the first few months of its launch. Recent headlines in the popular press have ignited concerns relevant to medical education over the possible implications of cheating and plagiarism in assessments as well as excitement over new opportunities for learning, assessment, and research. In this Scholarly Perspective, the authors offer insights and recommendations about generative AI for medical educators based on literature review, including the AI literacy framework. The authors provide a definition of generative AI, introduce an AI literacy framework and competencies, and offer considerations for potential impacts and opportunities to optimize integration of generative AI for admissions, learning, assessment, and medical education research to help medical educators navigate and start planning for this new environment. As generative AI tools continue to expand, educators need to increase their AI literacy through education and vigilance around new advances in the technology and serve as stewards of AI literacy to foster social responsibility and ethical awareness around the use of AI.","[{""name"": ""Christy K.

10.1186/s41239-021-00260-3,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,An examination of teachers' strategies to foster student engagement in blended learning in higher education,"AbstractThis qualitative study examined how teachers fostered student engagement in blended learning (BL), i.e., blended, blended online, and blended synchronous courses that combine synchronous and asynchronous activities. Twenty semi-structured interviews with teachers in various disciplines, at the undergraduate or graduate level in four universities, were conducted and analyzed using an inductive approach. Therefore, the study proposed a broad and comprehensive picture of teachers’ strategies to enhance student engagement in BL, that were classified in three meta-categories concerning (i) the course structure and pace; (ii) the selection of teaching and learning activities; and (iii) the teacher’s role and course relationships. Strategies were also linked with student engagement dimensions (behavioral, emotional, cognitive), whenever possible. The findings particularly emphasized the importance of a well-structured and -paced course, fully exploiting and integrating synchronous and asynchronous modes of BL. Clearly communicating how the course would unfold and corresponding expectations as well as establishing trusting relationships at the beginning of the semester also appeared as key to foster student engagement in BL. The use of various digital tools was also highlighted to promote student behavioral and emotional engagement at the undergraduate level, whereas cognitive and emotional engagement of graduate students was mainly targeted through experience-sharing and learning co-construction between students.","[{""name"": ""Géraldine Heilporn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sawsen Lakhal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marilou Bélisle"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/08923647.2019.1610304"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0112-3"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-4912-5.ch011"", ""10.59668/33"", ""10.24059/olj.v23i1.1425"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-6982-7_12"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.02.009"", ""10.1080/01587919.2018.1520041"", ""10.5334/jime.528"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0176-8"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09744-x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100772"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7"", ""10.24059/olj.v22i3.1467"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.11.003"", ""10.1080/03075070903545058"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00199-x"", ""10.12959/issn.1855-0541.IIASS-2017-no1-art1"", ""10.3102/00346543074001059"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.02.002"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-813413-9.00001-2"", ""10.4324/9781315296135-15"", ""10.24059/olj.v23i2.1481"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2013.09.004"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v16i3.2015"", ""10.28945/1968"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.598505"", ""10.1080/07294360.2017.1344197"", ""10.16920/jeet/2016/v30i1/97427"", ""10.22329/celt.v10i0.4747"", ""10.5206/cjsotl-rcacea.2020.3.13420"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-60013-0_41-1"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-0180-z"", ""10.3102/0034654313480891"", ""10.1080/00220671.2013.807491"", ""10.13189/ujer.2018.061034"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.06.002"", ""10.1080/08923647.2017.1264807"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2018.01.003"", ""10.14742/ajet.1869"", ""10.24059/olj.v21i3.1231"", ""10.24059/olj.v13i1.1673"", ""10.4018/IJMBL.2018010101"", ""10.1007/s10984-019-09303-z"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103682"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103701"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_1"", ""10.24059/olj.v21i4.1240"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0063-0"", ""10.1111/ejed.12330"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2006.06.005"", ""10.1080/00461520.2014.1002924"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_2"", ""10.1080/07294360.2018.1517732"", ""10.1504/IJTEL.2016.075961"", ""10.14742/ajet.2232"", ""10.4018/IJMBL.2019040101"", ""10.4018/IJAVET.2018010101"", ""10.1177/1098214005283748"", ""10.1080/1360144X.2013.786720"", ""10.24059/olj.v22i4.1389"", ""10.3390/educsci4040247"", ""10.1080/07294360.2013.832160""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

The emission of gases and fuel efficiency of vehicles are two important issues. The best way to improve the fuel efficiency is to decrease the weight of vehicle parts. Research and development played an important role in lightweight materials for decreasing cost, increasing ability to be recycled, enabling their integration into vehicles, and maximizing their fuel economy efficacy. There arises a need for developing a novel generation of materials that will combine both weight reduction and safety issues. The application of carbon fibre reinforced plastic material offers the best lightweight potential to realize lightweight concepts. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic has outstanding specific stiffness, specific strength, and fatigue properties compared to commonly used metals. In automotive industry, the advantages of carbon fibre reinforced plastic are reduction in weight, part integration and reduction, crashworthiness, durability, toughness, and aesthetic appealing. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic is a composite material that has been used extensively in various applications such as aerospace industry, sports equipment, oil and gas industry, and automotive industry. Keeping in view the aforementioned advantages of carbon fibre reinforced plastic, the authors have presented a brief review on carbon fibre for automotive industrial applications.","[{""name"": ""H Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A A Markina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M V Porotnikov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.21272/jes.2017.4(2).f8"", ""10.13005/msri/140109"", ""10.1002/app.20336"", ""10.1140/epjp/i2015-15022-8"", ""10.1016/S0034-3617(03)00715-X"", ""10.1016/j.tws.2013.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.addma.2019.100962"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.10.067"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.10.038"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.06.028"", ""10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2019.105115"", ""10.4271/2012-01-0730"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.1015"", ""10.1016/S0034-3617(10)70173-9""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

This trend, stemming in part from the “credibility revolution” in the social sciences, particularly economics, is notable along with the increasing use of randomized controlled trials in the strive toward rigorous causal inference. The overarching purpose of this chapter is to explore and document the growth, applicability, promise, and limitations of quasi-experimental research designs in education research. We first provide an overview of widely used quasi-experimental research methods in this growing literature, with particular emphasis on articles from the top ranked education research journals, including those published by the American Educational Research Association. Next, we demonstrate the applicability and promise of these methods in enhancing our understanding of the causal effects of education policies and interventions using key examples and case studies culled from the extant literature across the pre-K–16 education spectrum. Finally, we explore the limitations of these methods and conclude with thoughts on how education researchers can adapt these innovative, interdisciplinary techniques to further our understanding of some of the most enduring questions in educational policy and practice.","[{""name"": ""Maithreyi Gopalan"", ""affiliation"": [""The Pennsylvania State University""]}, {""name"": ""Kelly Rosinger"", ""affiliation"": [""The Pennsylvania State University""]}, {""name"": ""Jee Bin Ahn"", ""affiliation"": [""The Pennsylvania State University""]}]","[""10.1257/jep.24.2.3"", ""10.1177/2332858418766291"", ""10.1037/h0040950"", ""10.1162/edfp_a_00236"", ""10.1257/pol.6.4.135"", ""10.1162/qjec.2010.125.1.215"", ""10.1353/foc.2018.0008"", ""10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.05.002"", ""10.1353/rhe.2012.0040"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.12.005"", ""10.1257/app.1.3.111"", ""10.3102/0162373711398125"", ""10.1353/book.47910"", ""10.1037/a0037996"", ""10.1257/jep.27.2.109"", ""10.1257/000282802320189401"", ""10.1007/s11162-017-9483-x"", ""10.1257/00028280260344560"", ""10.1080/07350015.2017.1366909"", ""10.3386/w25018"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.41.6.872"", ""10.3102/01623737019002141"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00099"", ""10.1126/science.1128898"", ""10.1080/19345747.2017.1375583"", ""10.3102/0013189X023003005"", ""10.3102/0002831217732951"", ""10.3102/0162373714560224"", ""10.1353/jhe.2014.0031"", ""10.2307/1602444"", ""10.3386/w25368"", ""10.1093/qje/qjv036"", ""10.3102/0162373715587965"", ""10.1257/pol.20180510"", ""10.1080/00221546.2018.1434282"", ""10.1177/0091552119865611"", ""10.1177/2332858419873619"", ""10.1353/jef.2016.0006"", ""10.1257/app.20160567"", ""10.3102/0013189X14539189"", ""10.1177/0091552117743790"", ""10.3102/0162373714547266"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2005.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.05.002"", ""10.3102/0013189X17737739"", ""10.1177/2332858418769287"", ""10.1126/science.aac4716"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0219727"", ""10.1162/edfp.2010.5.2.5201"", ""10.3386/w25320"", ""10.1177/0002716214541048"", ""10.1162/EDFP_a_00063"", ""10.3102/0091732X18759040"", ""10.1080/19345747.2017.1402397"", ""10.1002/pam.21803"", ""10.1214/09-STS313"", ""10.1080/19345747.2016.1205160"", ""10.1353/jef.2014.a539805"", ""10.1177/016146811411601205"", ""10.1037/h0044319"", ""10.3368/jhr.53.4.0216.7735R1"", ""10.3102/1076998614558486"", ""10.3102/0013189X18781522"", ""10.1177/0895904815614398"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2018.08.001"", ""10.1111/cdev.12099"", ""10.1177/1098214017736155"", ""10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040617-013507"", ""10.3102/0013189X17743230""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"
10.1111/modl.12741,MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL,0401 Education,The Development and Validation of the Short Form of the Foreign Language Enjoyment Scale,"AbstractWe used a data set with n = 1,603 learners of foreign languages (FL) to develop and validate the short form of the Foreign Language Enjoyment Scale (S‐FLES). The data was split into 2 groups, and we used the first sample to develop the short‐form measure. A 3‐factor hierarchical model of foreign language enjoyment (FLE) was uncovered, with FLE as a higher‐order factor and with teacher appreciation, personal enjoyment, and social enjoyment as 3 lower‐order factors. We selected 3 items for each of the 3 lower‐order factors of the S‐FLES. The proposed 9‐item S‐FLES was validated in the second sample, and the fit statistics for the factor structure indicated close fit. Further evidence was found to support the internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the S‐FLES.

Telemedicine has grown exponentially in the United States, and the shift toward remote care to align with social distancing guidelines is fueling this growth. Training medical students to deliver high-quality, secure, and personalized health care through telemedicine will prepare the next generation of physicians to conscientiously use these technologies and meet a growing need for telehealth services. Telemedicine-specific educational goals can be incorporated into curricula and integrated with existing clinical experiences to provide students with core telemedicine and clinical skills to prepare them for current and future pandemics. Medical educators could explore 5 major telemedicine domains: (1) access to care, (2) cost, (3) cost-effectiveness, (4) patient experience, and (5) clinician experience. Schools could use the following learning vehicles to help medical students explore these domains: (1) asynchronous lectures covering telehealth history; (2) discussions on applications, ethics, safety, etiquette, and patient considerations; (3) faculty-supervised standardized patient telehealth encounters; and (4) hands-on diagnostic or therapeutic procedures using telehealth equipment. Incorporating telemedicine into the medical school curriculum exposes students to the application of telemedicine across specialties as well as its limitations.","[{""name"": ""Oranicha Jumreornvong"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year student, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Emmy Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""is a fourth-year student, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Jasmine Race"", ""affiliation"": [""is a fourth-year student, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Jacob Appel"", ""affiliation"": [""is assistant professor, Departments of Psychiatry and Medical Education, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York; ORCID:.""]}]","[""10.1001/jama.2020.5227"", ""10.1126/science.abb5793"", ""10.2196/12515"", ""10.1377/hlthaff.27.3.759"", ""10.7205/MILMED-D-14-00115"", ""10.1089/tmj.2012.0023"", ""10.1001/jama.2019.0395"", ""10.1089/tmj.2015.0079"", ""10.1089/tmj.2014.0101"", ""10.7812/TPP/18-293"", ""10.1016/j.rdc.2019.01.003"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002701"", ""10.3171/2014.4.JNS131805"", ""10.5152/jtgga.2012.05"", ""10.1007/s00402-019-03295-4"", ""10.2196/rehab.7511"", ""10.1097/PHM.0000000000001451"", ""10.1186/s12890-016-0288-z"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2009787"", ""10.2196/10867"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.2648"", ""10.2196/jmir.5191"", ""10.4037/ajcc2012416"", ""10.7812/TPP/14-004"", ""10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30161-2"", ""10.1056/NEJMsb2005114"", ""10.1186/s13054-019-2494-6"", ""10.5435/JAAOS-D-20-00360"", ""10.1089/tmj.2018.0248"", ""10.24869/psyd.2020.25"", ""10.2196/jmir.9403"", ""10.1093/fampra/cmu084"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2003539"", ""10.1097/01.NAJ.0000520244.60138.1c"", ""10.1089/tmj.2009.0152"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002708"", ""10.1177/1049732311420446"", ""10.7326/M20-1982"", ""10.1186/s12913-018-2956-6""]",['Medicine'],"['Oncology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

Synapses modulated by light signals, which are also referred as photonic synapses, can not only make effective use of the outstanding properties of light to provide devices with ultrahigh propagation speed, high bandwidth and low crosstalk but also provide a noncontact writing method, which can facilitate the evolution of optical wireless communication and operation. More importantly, real‐time image processing can also be performed by photonic synapses which possess temporary memory. Thus far, tremendous efforts have been taken to design and fabricate photonic synapses. Herein, a summary of the development of different kinds of emerging materials utilized in photonic synaptic devices including memristors, field‐effect transistors, and phase change memory is presented, followed by the innovative applications of photonic synapses for neuromorphic systems. Finally, some current challenges and future study directions are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Junyao Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Shanghai Institute of Intelligent Science and Technology Interdisciplinary Materials Research Center School of Materials Science and Engineering Tongji University  Shanghai 201804 P.

10.1002/jee.20347,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Interdisciplinary engineering education: A review of vision, teaching, and support","AbstractBackgroundSocietal challenges that call for a new type of engineer suggest the need for the implementation of interdisciplinary engineering education (IEE). The aim of IEE is to train engineering students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support.PurposeWe aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses. This aim leads to two research questions:What aspects of vision, teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical studies of IEE?What points of attention regarding vision, teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as supporting or challenging IEE?Scope/MethodNinety‐nine studies published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis across studies. The procedure included formulation of research questions, searching and screening of studies according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of study characteristics, appraisal, and synthesis of results.ConclusionsChallenges exist for identifying clear learning goals and assessments for interdisciplinary education in engineering (vision). Most pedagogy for interdisciplinary learning is designed to promote collaborative teamwork requiring organization and team management. Our review suggests that developing interdisciplinary skills, knowledge, and values needs sound pedagogy and teaming experiences that provide students with authentic ways of engaging in interdisciplinary practice (teaching). Furthermore, there is a limited understanding of what resources hinder the development of engineering programs designed to support interdisciplinarity (support).","[{""name"": ""Antoine Van den Beemt"", ""affiliation"": [""Eindhoven University of Technology  Eindhoven The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Miles MacLeod"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Twente  Enschede The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Jan Van der Veen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Twente  Enschede The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Anne Van de Ven"", ""affiliation"": [""Eindhoven University of Technology  Eindhoven The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Sophie van Baalen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Twente  Enschede The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Renate Klaassen"", ""affiliation"": [""Delft University of Technology  Delft The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Mieke Boon"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Twente  Enschede The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1205/ece06030"", ""10.1080/00405849209543521"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000051"", ""10.1007/s11165-013-9369-7"", ""10.1108/14676371111118237"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2316290"", ""10.1080/13562517.2013.836089"", ""10.1007/s11625-012-0181-5"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000098"", ""10.1080/03043797.2010.505278"", ""10.1007/s10956-010-9219-6"", ""10.1080/0729436990180105"", ""10.1108/14676371211211854"", ""10.1080/00221546.2009.11779016"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01068.x"", ""10.1002/jee.20038"", ""10.1002/jee.20023"", ""10.1353/rhe.2010.0006"", ""10.1108/14676371011077540"", ""10.1080/17425964.2013.831756"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2013-0036"", ""10.1080/03043797.2011.603039"", ""10.18848/1832-3669/CGP/v08i06/56350"", ""10.1080/03043790801980276"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000030"", ""10.1080/03043797.2010.483277"", ""10.1007/s10763-013-9400-5"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-6-35"", ""10.1016/j.mechatronics.2012.11.003"", ""10.1080/03043791003703177"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.01.012"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000208"", ""10.1016/j.ece.2014.02.001"", ""10.1108/14676370810885907"", ""10.1177/1063293X13520316"", ""10.1002/sys.20025"", ""10.1007/s10734-013-9648-2"", ""10.3102/0034654317704306"", ""10.1080/03043797.2014.944103"", ""10.1080/19378629.2014.944186"", ""10.1007/s10798-012-9212-x"", ""10.1080/03043797.2014.903228"", ""10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x"", ""10.1080/03057267.2013.877694"", ""10.1109/TE.2013.2240388"", ""10.1016/j.ece.2012.09.001"", ""10.7146/lom.v10i17.25854"", ""10.1504/IJCEELL.2010.037789"", ""10.1080/02602938.2013.842539"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2012.tb01122.x"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2009.09.011"", ""10.1007/s10798-013-9242-z"", ""10.1023/A:1021105309984"", ""10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-115954"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2014.08.001"", ""10.7227/IJMEE.40.2.1"", ""10.1080/03043790902987410"", ""10.1504/IJSSCA.2013.059777"", ""10.1108/13665620810852269"", ""10.3846/1648715X.2013.805312"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.604409"", ""10.1108/14626001011088723"", ""10.1007/s10755-012-9232-1"", ""10.1080/03043797.2018.1441265"", ""10.1007/s11423-011-9215-4"", ""10.1002/sd.533"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.10.019"", ""10.1080/03043790903150687"", ""10.2307/j.ctv167563f"", ""10.1002/jee.20155"", ""10.1353/rhe.2004.0028"", ""10.1007/s10439-013-0778-6"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00006.x"", ""10.1002/sce.20422"", ""10.1007/s11229-016-1236-4"", ""10.1016/j.shpsa.2018.01.001"", ""10.2478/v10099-012-0007-7"", ""10.1080/13562510600680954"", ""10.1080/01580370601146270"", ""10.1187/cbe.12-12-0209"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00018.x"", ""10.7227/IJEEE.47.2.7"", ""10.1002/9780470754887"", ""10.1080/03043790802710185"", ""10.7158/D12-019.2013.19.1"", ""10.1002/cae.20377"", ""10.1080/03043797.2014.903227"", ""10.1016/j.mechatronics.2012.08.005"", ""10.1002/jee.20112"", ""10.1109/TE.2010.2080359"", ""10.1115/1.4031638"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-8-45"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-1205-7"", ""10.1080/13562510802045394""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"
10.1002/ase.2049,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,Virtual and Augmented Reality Enhancements to Medical and Science Student Physiology and Anatomy Test Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Virtual and augmented reality have seen increasing employment for teaching within medical and health sciences programs. For disciplines such as physiology and anatomy, these technologies may disrupt the traditional modes of teaching and content delivery. The objective of this systematic review and meta‐analysis is to evaluate the impact of virtual reality or augmented reality on knowledge acquisition for students studying preclinical physiology and anatomy. The protocol was submitted to Prospero and literature search undertaken in PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and other databases. Citations were reviewed and articles published in full assessing learning or knowledge acquisition in preclinical physiology and anatomy from virtual or augmented reality were included. Of the 919 records found, 58 eligible articles were reviewed in full‐text, with 8 studies meeting full eligibility requirements. There was no significant difference in knowledge scores from combining the eight studies (626 participants), with the pooled difference being a non‐significant increase of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI [−2.9; 8.6]). For the four studies comparing virtual reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI [−4.1; 15.7]). For the five studies comparing augmented reality to traditional teaching, the pooled treatment effect difference was 0.07 (95% CI [−7.0; 7.2]). Upon review of the literature, it is apparent that educators could benefit from adopting assessment processes that evaluate three‐dimensional spatial understanding as a priority in physiology and anatomy. The overall evidence suggests that although test performance is not significantly enhanced with either mode, both virtual and augmented reality are viable alternatives to traditional methods of education in health sciences and medical courses.","[{""name"": ""Christian Moro"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine Bond University  Gold Coast Queensland Australia""]}, {""name"": ""James Birt"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Society and Design Bond University  Gold Coast Queensland Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Zane Stromberga"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine Bond University  Gold Coast Queensland Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Charlotte Phelps"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine Bond University  Gold Coast Queensland Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Justin Clark"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Evidence‐Based Healthcare Bond University  Gold Coast Queensland Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Paul Glasziou"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Evidence‐Based Healthcare Bond University  Gold Coast Queensland Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Anna Mae Scott"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute for Evidence‐Based Healthcare Bond University  Gold Coast Queensland Australia""]}]","[""10.2196/jmir.2497"", ""10.1002/ase.1858"", ""10.3390/info9020031"", ""10.1002/ase.1864"", ""10.1016/j.thorsurg.2019.03.010"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1806-5"", ""10.9778/cmajo.20170110"", ""10.3991/ijet.v14i03.9289"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2016.02.010"", ""10.1002/ase.1949"", ""10.1002/9781119536604"", ""10.1007/s11596-019-1992-8"", ""10.1089/cyber.2018.0150"", ""10.1002/ase.1603"", ""10.1001/jama.2017.20800"", ""10.2196/12959"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.01.010"", ""10.1002/ase.1873"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103857"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2016.1271944"", ""10.1002/ca.23292"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.1152/advan.00074.2020"", ""10.1111/medu.14251"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-6106-7_118-1"", ""10.1002/ase.1696"", ""10.2196/mhealth.7943"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02643.x"", ""10.31524/bkkmedj.2019.02.021"", ""10.14742/ajet.2902"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09811-3"", ""10.3991/ijet.v15i02.11394"", ""10.1002/alr.21986"", ""10.1002/ase.1373"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-43283-6_36"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1293-0"", ""10.25304/rlt.v28.2329"", ""10.1080/13645706.2019.1625404"", ""10.1002/ase.2035"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S240150"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-1994-z""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Surgery', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

The authors of this Perspective discuss many of the likely causes of the observed differences in mean Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores between students from groups well represented in medicine and those from groups underrepresented in medicine. The lower mean MCAT scores of underrepresented groups can present challenges to diversifying the physician workforce if medical schools only admit those applicants with the highest MCAT scores. The authors review the psychometric literature, which showed no evidence of bias in the exam, and note that the differences in mean MCAT scores between racial and ethnic groups are similar to those in other measures of academic achievement and performance on high-stakes tests. The authors then describe the ways in which structural racism in the United States has contributed to differences in achievement for underrepresented students compared with well-represented students. These differences are not due to differences in aptitude but to differences in opportunities. The authors describe the widespread consequences of structural racism on economic success, educational opportunity, and bias in the educational environment. They close with 3 recommendations for medical schools that may mitigate the consequences of structural racism while maintaining academic standards and admitting students likely to succeed. Adopting these recommendations may help the medical profession build the diverse physician workforce needed to serve communities today.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Reinis Lucey"", ""affiliation"": [""is executive vice dean, vice dean for education, and professor of medicine, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco, California.""]}, {""name"": ""Aaron Saguil"", ""affiliation"": [""was associate dean for recruitment and admissions, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, F.

10.1111/bjet.12810,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Learner engagement in MOOCs: Scale development and validation,"AbstractThe purpose of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of conceptualising and measuring learner engagement in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The paper develops and validates a MOOC engagement scale (MES) to measure learner engagement. The initial questionnaire items of the scale were developed by reviewing existing related literature and validated student engagement constructs. This was followed by a modified scale development process, including two focus group interviews (n = 10), an exploratory survey (n = 12), an expert review (n = 10), a pilot survey (n = 15), an item purification study (n = 590) and a construct validation study (n = 303). The final version of the scale is made up of four dimensions: behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement, emotional engagement and social engagement. The paper concludes with recommendations for how the MES can be used to assess the pattern of engagement in MOOCs and to investigate the relationship between learner engagement and other important MOOC teaching and learning factors.","[{""name"": ""Ruiqi Deng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pierre Benckendorff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deanne Gannaway"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4135/9781483381411"", ""10.1002/pits.20303"", ""10.1016/j.jsp.2006.04.002"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_4"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2015.1061571"", ""10.1080/08832323.2015.1019821"", ""10.2478/eurodl-2014-0003"", ""10.46504/10201508co"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-800649-8.00004-3"", ""10.1111/jcal.12130"", ""10.1111/bjet.12268"", ""10.3102/0013189X14523038"", ""10.18178/ijiet.2017.7.8.939"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59044-8_20"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.10.019"", ""10.24059/olj.v19i4.561"", ""10.14686/BUEFAD.201428190"", ""10.1007/s10964-011-9647-5"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_6"", ""10.1002/ir.20155"", ""10.1353/jhe.2016.0006"", ""10.1007/0-387-23823-9_19"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_37"", ""10.1007/BF03340899"", ""10.1002/ir.20153"", ""10.1002/1520-6807(199301)30:1<79::AID-PITS2310300113>3.0.CO;2-X"", ""10.1080/02602938.2014.938019"", ""10.3200/JOER.98.3.184-192"", ""10.1007/BF03340964"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.09.005"", ""10.1007/s10964-011-9665-3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.016"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.10.019"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1007/BF03340893"", ""10.1080/02602930701698892"", ""10.1037/spq0000057"", ""10.1080/00220671.2013.807491"", ""10.1007/s10964-012-9857-5"", ""10.1002/ir.20151"", ""10.1108/S1548-6435(2010)6"", ""10.3102/00028312037001153"", ""10.1080/00220671.1983.10885495"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.02.153"", ""10.24059/olj.v19i4.555"", ""10.58680/rte199115462"", ""10.1108/S2044-9968(2013)8"", ""10.3102/0013189X14562423"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.015"", ""10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00055-5"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.85.4.571"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_2"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2006.09.017"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.09.001"", ""10.1111/bjet.12623"", ""10.1111/bjet.12297"", ""10.1111/cdep.12073"", ""10.1111/cdev.12138"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.01.008"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.12.001""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

More recent computing paradigms, such as high parallelization and near‐memory computing, help alleviate the data communication bottleneck to some extent, but paradigm‐shifting concepts are required. In‐memory computing has emerged as a prime candidate to eliminate this bottleneck by colocating memory and processing. In this context, resistive switching (RS) memory devices is a key promising choice, due to their unique intrinsic device‐level properties, enabling both storing and computing with a small, massively‐parallel footprint at low power. Theoretically, this directly translates to a major boost in energy efficiency and computational throughput, but various practical challenges remain. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of several key existing challenges in implementing high‐capacity, high‐volume RS memories for accelerating the most computationally demanding computation in machine learning (ML) inference, that of vector‐matrix multiplication (VMM), is presented. The monolithic integration of RS memories with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits is presented as the core underlying technology. The key existing design choices in terms of device‐level physical implementation, circuit‐level design, and system‐level considerations is reviewed and an outlook for future directions is provided.","[{""name"": ""Amirali Amirsoleimani"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Toronto  Toronto Ontario M5S2E4 Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Fabien Alibart"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut Interdisciplinaire dInnovation Technologique (3IT) Universite de Sherbrooke  Sherbrooke Quebec J1K 0A5 Canada"", ""Laboratoire Nanotechnologies Nanosystemes (LN2) CNRS UMI-3463 3IT  Sherbrooke Quebec J1K 0A5 Canada"", ""Institute of Electronics Microelectronics and Nanotechnology (IEMN) Universite de Lille  59650 Villeneuve dAscq France""]}, {""name"": ""Victor Yon"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut Interdisciplinaire dInnovation Technologique (3IT) Universite de Sherbrooke  Sherbrooke Quebec J1K 0A5 Canada"", ""Laboratoire Nanotechnologies Nanosystemes (LN2) CNRS UMI-3463 3IT  Sherbrooke Quebec J1K 0A5 Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Jianxiong Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Toronto  Toronto Ontario M5S2E4 Canada""]}, {""name"": ""M.

With the ability to perform vector‐matrix multiplications and flexible tunable conductance, the memristor crossbar array (CBA) structure is one of the most promising candidates to realize neural cognitive systems. The boom in the development of memristive synapses and neurons has propelled the developments of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to emulate the highly hierarchically organized network of human brain in the past decade. To achieve this, realizing large scale, high‐density memristive CBAs is a prerequisite to constructing complex ANNs. Herein, the stringent requirements in device performance and array parameters for hardware ANNs are analyzed, and the efforts in addressing the associated challenges are discussed. Recent progress on the experimental demonstration of neuromorphic computing systems (NCSs) is presented. Recommendations for further performance optimization at the device, circuit, and algorithm levels are proposed. This Report serves as a guide for the hardware implementation of NCS based on large‐scale CBAs.","[{""name"": ""Yesheng Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

The quality of the interactive experience with the real and virtual world using wearable HMI technologies depends on the intuitive two‐way haptic interfaces they offer and the real‐time touch‐based information they send and receive. Herein, various smart glove solutions and their application in interaction, rehabilitation, virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tasks are reviewed. While the early variants of such systems were based on commercial touch sensors and displays integrated (e.g., stitched) on wearables, electronic skin (e‐skin)‐type technologies with multifunctional capabilities are being explored nowadays for rich user experience and comfort. In this regard, instead of using separate touch sensors and actuators, miniaturized integrated devices providing both touch sensing and vibrotactile actuation have also been reported recently. Such advances, the associated challenges, and the advantages they offer for users to enjoy the full characteristic benefits of VR/ARs for interaction, immersion, and imagination are discussed. Finally, the huge potential the smart‐glove‐type solutions hold for advances in various application areas such as robotics, health care, sensorial augmentation for nondisabled and tactile Internet is also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Oliver Ozioko"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering University of Glasgow  Glasgow G12 8QQ

As AI technologies are new to K-12 schools, there is a lack of studies that inform how to design learning when AI is introduced as a collaborative learning agent to classrooms. The present study, therefore, aimed to explore teachers’ perspectives on what (1) curriculum design, (2) student-AI interaction, and (3) learning environments are required to design student-AI collaboration (SAC) in learning and (4) how SAC would evolve. Through in-depth interviews with 10 Korean leading teachers in AI in Education (AIED), the study found that teachers perceived capacity and subject-matter knowledge building as the optimal learning goals for SAC. SAC can be facilitated through interdisciplinary learning, authentic problem solving, and creative tasks in tandem with process-oriented assessment and collaboration performance assessment. While teachers expressed instruction on AI principles, data literacy, error analysis, AI ethics, and AI experiences in daily life were crucial support, AI needs to offer an instructional scaffolding and possess attributes as a learning mate to enhance student-AI interaction. In addition, teachers highlighted systematic AIED policy, flexible school system, the culture of collaborative learning, and a safe to fail environment are significant. Teachers further anticipated students would develop collaboration with AI through three stages: (1) learn about AI, (2) learn from AI, and (3) learn together. These findings can provide a more holistic understanding of the AIED and implications for the educational policies, educational AI design as well as instructional design that are aimed at enhancing SAC in learning.","[{""name"": ""Jinhee Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hyunkyung Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Young Hoan Cho"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00094056.2019.1565809"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-93846-2_4"", ""10.1145/1929887.1929905"", ""10.1007/s11409-017-9178-x"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90500-6_14"", ""10.1109/TLT.2014.2346756"", ""10.1111/bjet.12432"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-521-1"", ""10.1177/004005991204400402"", ""10.1017/S0033291720000835"", ""10.1145/3139513.3139526"", ""10.4324/9780429323058-13"", ""10.21236/AD0289565"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.045"", ""10.1111/bjet.12995"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8975.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1461444819858691"", ""10.3390/ai1020008"", ""10.1080/07370000701798495"", ""10.1145/353485.353487"", ""10.29333/ejmste/91248"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog1903_1"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9992.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10447318.2020.1801227"", ""10.1007/s40299-020-00547-5"", ""10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17833"", ""10.1007/s10956-019-09803-w"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.640115"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.09.019"", ""10.1007/s11251-020-09525-2"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3767.001.0001"", ""10.1787/32b6cdcf-en"", ""10.1177/1474022214534081"", ""10.1186/s40561-019-0089-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195304381.003.0010"", ""10.1002/hbe2.117"", ""10.1109/FIE.2016.7757409"", ""10.1007/s00146-020-01004-z"", ""10.1126/science.128.3330.969"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.09.003"", ""10.18356/d94175df-en"", ""10.54675/PCSP7350"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2021.186"", ""10.1108/JEA-10-2020-0216"", ""10.3102/0091732X09349791"", ""10.1017/S0269888900008122"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-3980-2_20"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1109/AEMCSE50948.2020.00023"", ""10.1109/MMUL.2017.8"", ""10.1016/j.future.2018.04.016""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/jcal.12617,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,The impact of augmented reality on cognitive load and performance: A systematic review,"AbstractBackgroundPrevious studies on augmented reality‐enriched learning and training indicated conflicting results regarding the cognitive load involved: some authors report that AR can reduce cognitive load, others have shown that AR is perceived as cognitively demanding and can lead to poorer performance.ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to systematically analyse previous research on AR and cognitive load, including performance, and thus to be able to contribute to answering the question of the impact of AR on cognitive load when used in learning environments.MethodsThis study applied the systematic review method. A total of 58 studies were identified and analysed using rigorously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results are now reported as a synthesis.Results and ConclusionsCompared to other technologies, AR seems to be less cognitively demanding and also leads to higher performance. However, these results are based on media comparison studies that have been criticized for years. The spatial AR type is better compared to see‐through AR. However, the latter can be improved by visual cues and the addition of learning activities, such as value‐added studies have revealed.Major takeawaysThe essential findings of this study are that the technology used, for example, AR glasses, can unnecessarily increase cognitive load and that still many studies focus on the comparison of AR with more traditional media. Less studies applied alternative research designs, for example, value‐added comparisons. However, such designs are better suited to investigate design principles for AR‐enriched learning environments, which can then in turn reduce cognitive load as well as positively affect performance.","[{""name"": ""Josef Buchner"", ""affiliation"": [""Learning Lab University of Duisburg‐Essen  Essen Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Katja Buntins"", ""affiliation"": [""Learning Lab

10.32674/jis.v10i1.1893,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS,0401 Education,Internationalization of Higher Education: The Need for a More Ethical and Qualitative Approach,"Universities have always had international dimensions in their research, teaching, and service to society, but those dimensions were in general more ad hoc, fragmented, and implicit than explicit and comprehensive. In the last decade of the previous century, the increasing globalization and regionalization of economies and societies, combined with the requirements of the knowledge economy and the end of the Cold War, created a context for a more strategic approach to internationalization in higher education. International organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, national governments, the European Union, and higher education organizations such as the International Association of Universities placed internationalization at the top of the reform agenda. Internationalization became a key change agent in higher education, in the developed world but also in emerging and developing societies. Mobility of students, scholars, and programs; reputation and branding (manifested by global and regional rankings); and a shift in paradigm from cooperation to competition (van der Wende, 2001) have been the main manifestations of the agenda of internationalization in higher education over the past 30 years. International education has become an industry, a source of revenue and a means for enhanced reputation. Quantitative data about the number of international degree-seeking students, of international talents and scholars, of students going for credits abroad, of agreements and memoranda of understanding, as well as of co-authored international publications in high impact academic journals, have not only been key manifestations of this perception of internationalization, but also have driven its agenda and actions. This perception has resulted in an increasing dominance of English in research but also teaching, has createdthe emergence of a whole new industry around internationalization, has forced national governments to stimulate institutions of higher education going international, and hasgenerated new buzz words such as “cross-border delivery” and “soft power” in the higher education arena. In the period 2010–2020, we have seen not only the number of international students double to 5 million in the past decade, but also we have noticed an increase in franchise operations, articulation programs, branch campuses, and online delivery of higher education. There is fierce competition for talented international students and scholars, and immigration policies have shifted from low-skill to high-skill immigration. National excellence programs have increased differentiation in higher education with more attention for a small number of international world-class universities and national flagship institutions that compete for these talents, for positions in the global rankings, for access to high impact journals, and for funding, at the cost of other institutions. There is also an increasing concern about the neo-colonial dimension. In the current global-knowledge society, the concept of internationalization of higher education has itself become globalized, demanding further consideration of its impact on policy and practice as more countries and types of institution around the world engage in the process. Internationalization should no longer be considered in terms of a westernized, largely Anglo-Saxon, and predominantly English-speaking paradigm. (Jones &amp; de Wit, 2014, p. 28) Internationalization became defined by the generally accepted definition of Knight (2008): “The process of integrating an international, intercultural or global dimension into the purpose, functions and delivery of post-secondary education,” describing clearly the process in a general and value neutral way. Some of the main trends in internationalization in the past 30 years have been: More focused on internationalization abroad than on internationalization at home More ad hoc, fragmented, and marginal than strategic, comprehensive, and central in policies More in the interest of a small, elite subset of students and faculty than focused on global and intercultural outcomes for all Directed by a constantly shifting range of political, economic, social/cultural, and educational rationales, with increasing focus on economic motivations Increasingly driven by national, regional, and global rankings Little alignment between the international dimensions of the three core functions of higher education: education, research, and service to society Primarily a strategic choice and focus of institutions of higher education, and less a priority of national governments Less important in emerging and developing economies, and more of a particular strategic concern among developed economies In the past decade, however, one can observe a reaction to these trends. While mobility is still the most dominant factor in internationalization policies worldwide, there is increasing attention being paid to internationalization of the curriculum at home. There is also a stronger call for comprehensive internationalization, which addresses all aspects of education in an integrated way. Although economic rationales and rankings still drive the agenda of internationalization, there is more emphasis now being placed on other motivations for internationalization. For example, attention is being paid to integrating international dimensions into tertiary education quality assurance mechanisms, institutional policies related to student learning outcomes, and the work of national and discipline-specific accreditation agencies (de Wit, 2019). Traditional values that have driven international activities in higher education in the past, such as exchange and cooperation, peace and mutual understanding, human capital development, and solidarity, although still present in the vocabulary of international education, have moved to the sideline in a push for competition, revenue, and reputation/branding. Around the change of the century, we observed a first response to these developments. The movement for Internationalization at Home within the European Union started in 1999 in Malmö, Sweden, drawing more attention to the 95% of nonmobile students not participating in the successful flagship program of the EU, ERASMUS. In the United Kingdom and Australia, a similar movement asked for attention to internationalization of the curriculum and teaching and learning in response to the increased focus on recruiting income-generating international students. And in the United States, attention emerged around internationalizing campuses and developing more comprehensive approaches to internationalization as an alternative for the marginal and fragmented focus on undergraduate study abroad on the one hand and international student recruitment on the other. These reactions were and are important manifestations of concern about the competitive, elitist, and market direction of internationalization, and are a call for more attention to the qualitative dimensions of internationalization, such as citizenship development, employability, and improvement of the quality of research, education, and service to society. A wide range of academic scholars and international education practitioners have pushed for change with their publications and presentations. A study for the European Parliament on the state of internationalization in higher education gave this push an extra dimension. Not only did the study provide a comprehensive overview of the literature and the practice of internationalization in higher education around the world, but also—based on a global Delphi Exercise—it promoted a new agenda for internationalization for the future, by extending the definition of Knight (2008), defining internationalization as follows: The intentional process of integrating an international, intercultural or global dimension into the purpose, functions and delivery of post-secondary education, in order to enhance the quality of education and research for all students and staff and to make a meaningful contribution to society. (de Wit et al., 2015) This definition gave a normative direction to the process by emphasizing that such a process does not proceed by itself but needs clear intentions, that internationalization is not a goal in itself but needs to be directed toward quality improvement, that it should not be of interest to a small elite group of mobile students and scholars but directed to all students and scholars, and that it should make a contribution to society. Over the past 5 years this new approach has received positive attention, and at the start of a new decade it is important to see if this shift back to a more ethical and qualitative approach with respect to internationalization is indeed taking place and what new dimensions one can observe in that shift.","[{""name"": ""Hans De Wit"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.21810/sfuer.v12i3.1036"", ""10.1163/9789087905224"", ""10.1016/S0952-8733(01)00018-6""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Education', 'Communication']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Here, we offer an expanded framework that addresses three key questions. Specifically, we suggest that attending involves not only selecting particular features of instruction to observe, but also disregarding aspects of classroom interactions that are less consequential. In addition, we propose that a stance of inquiry about observed phenomena is central to drawing inferences about observed phenomena. Finally, we extend the boundaries of teacher noticing to include shaping, the act of creating interactions that provide increased opportunities to attend to and interpret noteworthy mathematical interactions. In other words, teachers are not simply passive bystanders in the act of noticing, rather they shape interactions to gain access to additional information to allow for further observation and interpretation of student thinking.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth A. van Es"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Miriam G.

10.1007/s11422-019-09954-7,CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0303 Sociology,Science identity as a landscape of becoming: rethinking recognition and emotions through an intersectionality lens,"Abstract In this conceptual paper, I put forward an argument about the conceptualization of science identity as a landscape of becoming by placing emphasis on recognition and emotions, as core features of identity, through an intersectionality lens. These constructs intertwined, I argue, can give meaning to the process of becoming a science person or forming a science identity, and at the same time shed light on issues related to power, inequality, racism, and exclusion. In the context of these bigger issues, I argue that forming a science identity is not only personal, but also political. The need for intersectionality as a conceptual framework for studying science identity is underscored by the dearth of theory and empirical evidence that addresses classroom inequalities, as well as the multiple and interlocking influence of systems of privilege and oppression in science, such as racism and sexism. Recognition, which refers to how individuals are recognized by others as certain kinds of people, is an ineradicable part of our social world; it is bound within sociopolitical contexts and tied to specific cultural norms, values, beliefs, and stereotypes. Hence, recognition becomes of paramount importance in science identity research. However, critical questions still remain unanswered, such as who is allowed in the world of science and who is recognized as a science person in specific contexts? Directly linked to recognition, I argue, are different types of emotions which can offer a valuable lens for studying inequalities within the process of forming a science identity. What this means for science identity research is how important it is to explore the emotionality of science identity given that emotions are not just dialectically related but inextricably bound with (mis)recognition as well as with various systems of oppression.","[{""name"": ""Lucy Avraamidou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0882-6145(04)21013-X"", ""10.1080/03057267.2014.937171"", ""10.1007/s11422-017-9855-8"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.96.1.97"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2012.300750"", ""10.1002/tea.1041"", ""10.1002/sce.20069"", ""10.3102/0002831212458142"", ""10.1108/EDI-05-2012-0037"", ""10.1002/tea.20237"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198528975.003.0001"", ""10.1080/09540253.2011.565040"", ""10.1080/09540253.2018.1557322"", ""10.1007/s11422-013-9546-z"", ""10.1002/sce.20265"", ""10.3102/0091732X025001099"", ""10.1002/jee.20118"", ""10.1007/s11422-012-9447-6"", ""10.1119/1.4974122"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.010132"", ""10.1002/tea.20411"", ""10.17763/1943-5045-89.1.132"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9041-7_3"", ""10.1007/978-94-6300-450-3"", ""10.1002/sce.21047"", ""10.3102/0002831218818093"", ""10.1515/9780804779142"", ""10.1002/tea.21417"", ""10.1002/tea.21081"", ""10.1177/1538192717739958"", ""10.1080/03057260802681847"", ""10.1080/00461520.2013.864955"", ""10.1007/s11422-011-9339-1"", ""10.1080/09518390050156422"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020114"", ""10.1002/tea.21521"", ""10.1007/s11422-017-9831-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803932"", ""10.1080/13540600309378"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2005.06""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Consequently, universities closed down to minimise the face-to-face contacts, and the majority of the universities are now conducting degree programmes through online delivery. Remote online delivery and assessment are novel experiences for many universities, which presents many challenges, particularly when safeguarding academic integrity. For example, invigilated assessments, often considered as more secure, are not an option given the current situation and detecting any cheating would be significantly challenging. This paper reviews assessment security in the digital domain and critically evaluates the practices from different universities in safeguarding academic integrity, including associated challenges.","[{""name"": ""Kelum A.A.

10.3390/educsci13020150,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Dental Education: A Review and Guide for Curriculum Update,"In this intellectual work, the clinical and educational aspects of dentistry were confronted with practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). The aim was to provide an up-to-date overview of the upcoming changes and a brief analysis of the influential advancements in the use of AI in dental education since 2020. In addition, this review provides a guide for a dental curriculum update for undergraduate and postgraduate education in the context of advances in AI applications and their impact on dentistry. Unsurprisingly, most dental educators have limited knowledge and skills to assess AI applications, as they were not trained to do so. Also, AI technology has evolved exponentially in recent years. Factual reliability and opportunities with OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT are considered critical inflection points in the era of generative AI. Updating curricula at dental institutions is inevitable as advanced deep-learning approaches take over the clinical areas of dentistry and reshape diagnostics, treatment planning, management, and telemedicine screening. With recent advances in AI language models, communication with patients will change, and the foundations of dental education, including essay, thesis, or scientific paper writing, will need to adapt. However, there is a growing concern about its ethical and legal implications, and further consensus is needed for the safe and responsible implementation of AI in dental education.","[{""name"": ""Andrej Thurzo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Orthodontics, Regenerative and Forensic Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University in Bratislava, 81250 Bratislava, Slovakia""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Strunga"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Orthodontics, Regenerative and Forensic Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University in Bratislava, 81250 Bratislava, Slovakia""]}, {""name"": ""Renáta Urban"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Orthodontics, Regenerative and Forensic Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University in Bratislava, 81250 Bratislava, Slovakia""]}, {""name"": ""Jana Surovková"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Orthodontics, Regenerative and Forensic Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University in Bratislava, 81250 Bratislava, Slovakia""]}, {""name"": ""Kelvin I.

While his contemporaries hypothesized that tumor cells derived the energy required for uncontrolled replication from proteolysis and lipolysis, Warburg instead found them to rapidly consume glucose, converting it to lactate even in the presence of oxygen. The significance of this finding, later termed the Warburg effect, went unnoticed by the broader scientific community at that time. The field of cancer metabolism lay dormant for almost a century awaiting advances in molecular biology and genetics, which would later open the doors to new cancer therapies [2, 3].","[{""name"": ""Sminu Bose"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cissy Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anne Le"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/BF01504608"", ""10.1007/s00109-011-0730-x"", ""10.1016/j.semcancer.2015.10.002"", ""10.1126/science.68.1767.437"", ""10.1085/jgp.8.6.519"", ""10.1126/science.123.3191.309"", ""10.1016/bs.ircmb.2019.07.003"", ""10.1038/nrc.2016.77"", ""10.1098/rsif.2009.0310"", ""10.1126/science.1058079"", ""10.1016/j.tibs.2015.12.001"", ""10.1038/ng.890"", ""10.1007/s13238-014-0082-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65768-0_3"", ""10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.006"", ""10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0549"", ""10.1007/s10555-019-09794-5"", ""10.1128/MCB.06248-11"", ""10.3892/or.2020.7657"", ""10.1186/s12967-019-02173-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65768-0_6"", ""10.1016/j.gde.2009.10.009"", ""10.1038/nature06734"", ""10.1126/science.1193494"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65768-0_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65768-0_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65768-0_8"", ""10.1038/nbt.2530"", ""10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2904"", ""10.1126/science.1171721"", ""10.1016/j.cmet.2006.02.002"", ""10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0889"", ""10.1007/978-1-62703-429-6_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65768-0_11"", ""10.1073/pnas.1402012111"", ""10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.10.012"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65768-0_10"", ""10.1016/j.biocel.2010.07.010"", ""10.1021/jacs.5b00944"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0154576"", ""10.1002/emmm.201100193"", ""10.1093/jnci/dju062"", ""10.1016/j.febslet.2010.09.040"", ""10.3389/fonc.2012.00018"", ""10.1016/j.bcp.2014.09.001"", ""10.1002/pros.21300"", ""10.1016/j.cmet.2012.11.010"", ""10.1073/pnas.1411026111"", ""10.1038/cddiscovery.2015.16"", ""10.1007/s00109-011-0730-x"", ""10.1126/scitranslmed.3002394"", ""10.1517/14728220903307509"", ""10.1016/j.nbd.2012.04.011"", ""10.1517/13543784.2015.960077"", ""10.1074/jbc.274.32.22517"", ""10.4103/0973-1482.55136"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65768-0_4"", ""10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0482"", ""10.1016/j.cmet.2013.11.008"", ""10.1042/BJ20080805"", ""10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1271"", ""10.2147/IJN.S170564"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-00467-3"", ""10.1172/JCI69741"", ""10.1007/s10585-005-2343-7"", ""10.1038/sj.bjc.6601205"", ""10.1159/000259260"", ""10.1073/pnas.0914433107"", ""10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0465"", ""10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0108"", ""10.1021/jm101007q"", ""10.1002/cmdc.201100471"", ""10.2174/0929867003375119"", ""10.1016/S0006-2952(01)00636-0"", ""10.1007/s10637-013-9999-7"", ""10.1093/annonc/mdr555"", ""10.1016/j.semcancer.2017.12.011"", ""10.1038/sj.bjc.6602243"", ""10.1093/annonc/mdg343"", ""10.1007/s00280-004-0969-9"", ""10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0050"", ""10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-040020"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-68713-9"", ""10.1111/cas.14271""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Cancer Research', 'Molecular Biology']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0836 生物工程', 0.6862), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.684)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)]]"
10.1108/ET-02-2020-0033,EDUCATION AND TRAINING,0401 Education,Entrepreneurial intention of Indian university students: the role of opportunity recognition and entrepreneurship education,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial self-efficacy on the entrepreneurial intention of Indian university students. This paper also examines the moderating role of entrepreneurship education and gender on the opportunity recognition–intention and self-efficacy–intention relationships.Design/methodology/approachThe data were collected through a comprehensive questionnaire from 334 students having business and management background. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to ensure the reliability and validity of all the constructs, and structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed hypotheses.FindingsThis study unveils three important findings. First, opportunity recognition and self-efficacy both show a significant positive impact on the entrepreneurial intention of students. Second, education positively moderates “self-efficacy–intention relationship”, and third, gender negatively moderates “opportunity recognition–intention” and “self-efficacy–intention” relationships.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has been carried out using a sample of students from only one university, and the study included only business and management background students. Similar studies can be conducted by adding more motivational and contextual factors with an increased sample size of students having different educational backgrounds.Practical implicationsThis study provides pragmatic support to formulate new educational initiatives that can support students in their present or future entrepreneurial projects.Originality/valueThis study adds to the scarce literature on opportunity recognition and entrepreneurial intention and also highlights the moderating role of entrepreneurship education and gender on opportunity recognition–intention and entrepreneurial self-efficacy–intention relationships.","[{""name"": ""Aamir Hassan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Imran Saleem"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Imran Anwar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Syed Abid Hussain"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1108/APJIE-07-2018-0044"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.02.006"", ""10.1007/BF02723327"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.37.2.122"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.41.12.1389"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00713.x"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(03)00008-9"", ""10.1016/0167-8116(95)00038-0"", ""10.4314/jfecs.v35i1.52916"", ""10.1142/S0218495817500066"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(97)00029-3"", ""10.1287/isre.8.4.342"", ""10.4324/9780203774441"", ""10.1108/13620430710756762"", ""10.1080/089856200283063"", ""10.1108/14626000810871655"", ""10.2307/249524"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2018-0212"", ""10.1108/03090590610715022"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-08-2016-0241"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1016/S0925-5273(98)00007-3"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12019"", ""10.1108/17566261311328828"", ""10.1108/S1474-7979(2009)0000020014"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-02-2015-0041"", ""10.1108/00400911111185026"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12137"", ""10.1108/03090599710171404"", ""10.1177/001316447003000308"", ""10.1080/08985629300000020"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.1994.tb01849.x"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00033-0"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.12.910"", ""10.1080/089856200283072"", ""10.1108/13552551211268148"", ""10.1177/1470595811399190"", ""10.1007/s11365-015-0356-5"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.1.2.130"", ""10.3390/su11184939"", ""10.1108/02610151011024493"", ""10.1007/s10843-017-0222-3"", ""10.1177/0266242614544198"", ""10.5465/amle.2015.0026"", ""10.1111/j.1540-627X.2010.00314.x"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2004.10.012"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2009.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.12.001"", ""10.1108/JEC-12-2016-0043"", ""10.1046/j.1540-6520.2003.00035.x"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12116"", ""10.1177/014920638601200408"", ""10.1108/AJEMS-09-2017-0211"", ""10.1007/s11365-017-0434-y"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12090"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12129"", ""10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00055-5"", ""10.1142/S0218495814500162"", ""10.1108/JSBED-10-2015-0149"", ""10.1108/03090590910939049"", ""10.1007/s11365-005-1127-5"", ""10.1016/j.joep.2011.02.009"", ""10.2307/270754"", ""10.1007/s11365-012-0246-z""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Business and International Management', 'Education']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1108/IJSHE-04-2019-0152,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,Education for sustainability: Fostering a more conscious society and transformation towards sustainability,"Purpose Current approaches to sustainability science and education focus on (assessing and addressing) the external world of ecosystems, wider socio-economic structures, technology and governance dynamics. A major shortcoming of such approaches is the neglect of inner dimensions and capacities (which constrains education for sustainability as an end), and a limited capacity to facilitate reflection on the cognitive and socio-emotional processes underpinning people’s learning, everyday life choices and decision-taking (which constrains education for sustainability as a means). More integral approaches and pedagogies are urgently needed. The purpose of this paper is to advance related knowledge. Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a reflexive case study of the development of an innovative course on “Sustainability and Inner Transformation” and associated interventions in the form of a practice lab and weekly councils. Findings The paper elaborates on the connections between sustainability and inner transformation in education, offers insights into the process of adapting contemplative interventions to sustainability education and concludes with some reflections on challenges, lessons learnt and future work needed to support more integral approaches. The findings show that inner dimensions and transformation can be a vehicle for critical, improved education for sustainability and how this can be achieved in practice. Originality/value It is only recently that the concept of the inner or personal (sphere of) transformation has received growing attention in sustainability science and education. Despite this interest, such new conceptualizations and heuristics have, to date, not been systematically connected to education for sustainability (neither as an end nor means). The paper presents a critical, reflexive case, which advances related knowledge. It sets a precedent, which other universities/training institutions could follow or learn from.","[{""name"": ""Christine Wamsler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s13280-016-0800-y"", ""10.1177/1073191105283504"", ""10.1007/BF00162619"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.164"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2019.03.003"", ""10.1080/15507394.2010.486367"", ""10.1002/jclp.20776"", ""10.1007/s11422-014-9585-0"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2018.11.007"", ""10.1007/s12671-012-0101-x"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.007"", ""10.1007/s12671-014-0372-5"", ""10.1016/S0022-3999(03)00573-7"", ""10.1037/a0026355"", ""10.1007/s12671-017-0841-8"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2018.04.010"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2012.11.011"", ""10.1177/1478210316637972"", ""10.1023/A:1003548313194"", ""10.1177/1745691617709589"", ""10.1108/14676370210434688"", ""10.1007/s11625-017-0524-3"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.029"", ""10.1007/s11625-017-0428-2"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2018.03.021""]","['Environmental Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Education', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

10.1186/s12909-022-03852-3,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Artificial intelligence in medical education: a cross-sectional needs assessment,"AbstractBackgroundAs the information age wanes, enabling the prevalence of the artificial intelligence age; expectations, responsibilities, and job definitions need to be redefined for those who provide services in healthcare. This study examined the perceptions of future physicians on the possible influences of artificial intelligence on medicine, and to determine the needs that might be helpful for curriculum restructuring.MethodsA cross-sectional multi-centre study was conducted among medical students country-wide, where 3018 medical students participated. The instrument of the study was an online survey that was designed and distributed via a web-based service.ResultsMost of the medical students perceived artificial intelligence as an assistive technology that could facilitate physicians’ access to information (85.8%) and patients to healthcare (76.7%), and reduce errors (70.5%). However, half of the participants were worried about the possible reduction in the services of physicians, which could lead to unemployment (44.9%). Furthermore, it was agreed that using artificial intelligence in medicine could devalue the medical profession (58.6%), damage trust (45.5%), and negatively affect patient-physician relationships (42.7%). Moreover, nearly half of the participants affirmed that they could protect their professional confidentiality when using artificial intelligence applications (44.7%); whereas, 16.1% argued that artificial intelligence in medicine might cause violations of professional confidentiality. Of all the participants, only 6.0% stated that they were competent enough to inform patients about the features and risks of artificial intelligence. They further expressed that their educational gaps regarding their need for “knowledge and skills related to artificial intelligence applications” (96.2%), “applications for reducing medical errors” (95.8%), and “training to prevent and solve ethical problems that might arise as a result of using artificial intelligence applications” (93.8%).ConclusionsThe participants expressed a need for an update on the medical curriculum, according to necessities in transforming healthcare driven by artificial intelligence. The update should revolve around equipping future physicians with the knowledge and skills to effectively use artificial intelligence applications and ensure that professional values and rights are protected.","[{""name"": ""M.

10.1002/rrq.334,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,The Science of Learning to Read Words: A Case for Systematic Phonics Instruction,"ABSTRACTThe author reviews theory and research by Ehri and her colleagues to document how a scientific approach has been applied over the years to conduct controlled studies whose findings reveal how beginners learn to read words in and out of text. Words may be read by decoding letters into blended sounds or by predicting words from context, but the way that contributes most to reading and comprehending text is reading words automatically from memory by sight. The evidence shows that words are read from memory when graphemes are connected to phonemes. This bonds spellings of individual words to their pronunciations along with their meanings in memory. Readers must know grapheme–phoneme relations and have decoding skill to form connections, and must read words in text to associate spellings with meanings. Readers move through four developmental phases as they acquire knowledge about the alphabetic writing system and apply it to read and write words and build their sight vocabularies. Grapheme–phoneme knowledge and phonemic segmentation are key foundational skills that launch development followed subsequently by knowledge of syllabic and morphemic spelling–sound units. Findings show that when spellings attach to pronunciations and meanings in memory, they enhance memory for vocabulary words. This research underscores the importance of systematic phonics instruction that teaches students the knowledge and skills that are essential in acquiring word‐reading skill.","[{""name"": ""Linnea C.

10.1111/1467-9817.12313,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN READING,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,How morphology impacts reading and spelling: Advancing the role of morphology in models of literacy development,"A defining feature of language lies in its capacity to represent meaning across oral and written forms. Morphemes, the smallest units of meaning in a language, are the fundamental building blocks that encode meaning, and morphological skills enable their effective use in oral and written language. Increasing evidence indicates that morphological skills are linked to literacy outcomes, including word reading, spelling and reading comprehension. Despite this evidence, the precise ways in which morphology influences the development of children's literacy skills remain largely underspecified in theoretical models of reading and spelling development. In this paper, we draw on the extensive empirical evidence base in English to explicitly detail how morphology might be integrated into models of reading and spelling development. In doing so, we build on the perspective that morphology is multidimensional in its support of literacy development. The culmination of our efforts is the Morphological Pathways Framework – an adapted framework that illuminates precise mechanisms by which morphology impacts word reading, spelling and reading comprehension. Through this framework, we bring greater clarity and specificity on how the use of morphemes in oral and written language supports the development of children's literacy skills. We also highlight gaps in the literature, revealing important areas to focus future research to improve theoretical understanding. Furthermore, this paper provides valuable theoretical insight that will guide future empirical inquiries in identifying more precise morphological targets for intervention, which may have widespread implications for informing literacy practices in the classroom and educational policies more broadly.","[{""name"": ""Kyle C.

Soft actuators, made of elastomers and gels functionalized with magnetically active materials, are natural choices to drive magnetically controlled motions of soft robots. Recent innovations in soft material technologies, including 3D printing, origami/kirigami, tough hydrogels, mechanical metamaterials, and liquid metal‐injected elastomers, offer technological foundations to develop soft actuators and robots with significantly enhanced performance. Herein, an overview of magnetic soft actuators and robots from a materials engineer's perspective is provided. First, the historical background and recent trends of magnetic soft actuators are discussed. Second, the motions of tethered or untethered magnetic soft robotics are classified into aquatic swimmers, terrestrial locomotors, and grippers. Herein, preprogrammed motion under patterned magnetic stimuli is achieved by controlled magnetization of elastomeric materials containing hard magnetic particles. Finally, the applications of magnetically controlled soft robotics in surgical and therapeutic medical devices are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Hyun‐Joong Chung"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering University of Alberta  Edmonton Alberta T6G 1H9 Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew M.

10.1093/elt/ccaa062,ELT JOURNAL,0401 Education,An agenda for well-being in ELT: an ecological perspective,"Abstract Well-being is a basic human right according to the World Health Organization. It is the foundation of a life well lived and ought to be the basis of all educational endeavours and encounters. In this article, I urge ELT to make well-being a priority for research and practice. I make three main points. Firstly, we need to be serious in defining and understanding well-being for research and teaching and get beyond superficial conceptualizations, which inhibit growth in this area and meaningful debate. Secondly, we need to consider well-being for the whole ELT ecology, understanding that well-being does not reside solely within the individual but is socially situated too. Finally, I discuss learner and teacher well-being, which lie at the heart of ELT, and argue that we have a collective responsibility in the community to work towards better conditions for well-being for all members of the ELT ecology.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Mercer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315736181"", ""10.1016/j.jsp.2006.09.001"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276"", ""10.21832/9781783099467-004"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.02.013"", ""10.21832/9781783095360"", ""10.1016/j.system.2014.08.005"", ""10.1080/03054980902934563"", ""10.1093/elt/ccz029""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1186/s41239-023-00425-2,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,AI-generated feedback on writing: insights into efficacy and ENL student preference,"AbstractThe question of how generative AI tools, such as large language models and chatbots, can be leveraged ethically and effectively in education is ongoing. Given the critical role that writing plays in learning and assessment within educational institutions, it is of growing importance for educators to make thoughtful and informed decisions as to how and in what capacity generative AI tools should be leveraged to assist in the development of students’ writing skills. This paper reports on two longitudinal studies. Study 1 examined learning outcomes of 48 university English as a new language (ENL) learners in a six-week long repeated measures quasi experimental design where the experimental group received writing feedback generated from ChatGPT (GPT-4) and the control group received feedback from their human tutor. Study 2 analyzed the perceptions of a different group of 43 ENLs who received feedback from both ChatGPT and their tutor. Results of study 1 showed no difference in learning outcomes between the two groups. Study 2 results revealed a near even split in preference for AI-generated or human-generated feedback, with clear advantages to both forms of feedback apparent from the data. The main implication of these studies is that the use of AI-generated feedback can likely be incorporated into ENL essay evaluation without affecting learning outcomes, although we recommend a blended approach that utilizes the strengths of both forms of feedback. The main contribution of this paper is in addressing generative AI as an automatic essay evaluator while incorporating learner perspectives.","[{""name"": ""Juan Escalante"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Austin Pack"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex Barrett"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03043797.2022.2046709"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.03195"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2011.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100118"", ""10.35542/osf.io/hcgzj"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.08005"", ""10.22148/001c.17212"", ""10.1080/14703297.2023.2195846"", ""10.31002/metathesis.v5i1.3519"", ""10.58680/rte198215743"", ""10.21203/rs.3.rs-2840105/v1"", ""10.1037//1040-3590.12.1.19"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2304.14276"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11200-7"", ""10.1016/j.tree.2023.05.007"", ""10.1080/00461520.1996.9653266"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2020.100450"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2303.13408"", ""10.1007/s40979-023-00130-7"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4468181"", ""10.1016/j.rmal.2023.100050"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.076"", ""10.4324/9780203122761"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209479"", ""10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.17"", ""10.35542/osf.io/4mec3"", ""10.1515/jccall-2023-0008"", ""10.5070/L214151790"", ""10.1002/tesj.716"", ""10.34105/j.kmel.2023.15.008""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Herein, a magnetic continuum device with variable stiffness (VS) is presented, whose tip is precisely shaped and controlled using an external magnetic field. Based on a low melting point alloy (LMPA), the serial segments composing the continuum device are independently softened via electrical current and remotely deformed under a magnetic torque, whereas the rest of the device is locked in place. The resulting system has the advantage of combining the precision of magnetic navigation with additional degrees of freedom provided by changing the segments stiffness. With a minimum diameter as small as 2.33 mm and an inner working channel, the magnetic continuum device with VS is adapted to use in several therapeutic scenarios, including radio‐frequency cardiac ablations and interventional endoscopy in the gastrointestinal tract. The magnetic torque is used to remotely control the shape of the soft sections, whereas the stiff sections remain unchanged, thus adding degrees of freedom to the magnetic continuum device.","[{""name"": ""Christophe Chautems"", ""affiliation"": [""Multi-Scale Robotics Lab ETH Zurich  Tannenstrasse 3 8092 Zurich Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Alice Tonazzini"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratory of Intelligent Systems EPF Lausanne  1015 Lausanne Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Quentin Boehler"", ""affiliation"": [""Multi-Scale Robotics Lab ETH Zurich  Tannenstrasse 3 8092 Zurich Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Seung Hee Jeong"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratory of Intelligent Systems EPF Lausanne  1015 Lausanne Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Dario Floreano"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratory of Intelligent Systems EPF Lausanne  1015 Lausanne Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Bradley J.

In recent years, a large number of training data, improved computing power, and advanced deep learning algorithms are conducive to the wide application of AI, including material research. The traditional trial‐and‐error method is inefficient and time‐consuming to study materials. Therefore, AI, especially machine learning, can accelerate the process by learning rules from datasets and building models to predict. This is completely different from computational chemistry where a computer is only a calculator, using hard‐coded formulas provided by human experts. Herein, the application of AI in material innovation is reviewed, including material design, performance prediction, and synthesis. The realization details of AI techniques and advantages over conventional methods are emphasized in these applications. Finally, the future development direction of AI is expounded from both algorithm and infrastructure aspects.","[{""name"": ""Wuxin Sha"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Computer Science and Technology

10.1097/ACM.0000000000002995,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Toward Cultural Competency in Health Care: A Scoping Review of the Diversity and Inclusion Education Literature,"Purpose To explore best practices for increasing cultural competency and reducing health disparities, the authors conducted a scoping review of the existing literature. Method The review was guided by 2 questions: (1) Are health care professionals and medical students learning about implicit bias, health disparities, advocacy, and the needs of diverse patient populations? (2) What educational strategies are being used to increase student and educator cultural competency? In August 2016 and July 2018, the authors searched 10 databases (including Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus) and MedEdPORTAL, respectively, using keywords related to multiple health professions and cultural competency or diversity and inclusion education and training. Publications from 2005 to August 2016 were included. Results were screened using a 2-phase process (title and abstract review followed by full-text review) to determine if articles met the inclusion or exclusion criteria. Results The search identified 89 articles that specifically related to cultural competency or diversity and inclusion education and training within health care. Interventions ranged from single-day workshops to a 10-year curriculum. Eleven educational strategies used to teach cultural competency and about health disparities were identified. Many studies recommended using multiple educational strategies to develop knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and skills. Less than half of the studies reported favorable outcomes. Multiple studies highlighted the difficulty of implementing curricula without trained and knowledgeable faculty. Conclusions For the field to progress in supporting a culturally diverse patient population, comprehensive training of trainers, longitudinal evaluations of interventions, and the identification and establishment of best practices will be imperative.","[{""name"": ""Melissa R.

In recent years a considerable amount of classroom-based research and language teacher education (LTE) research has emerged to investigate these proposals in practice. This paper outlines key proposals for change in language teaching from the related fields of World Englishes (WE), English as a lingua franca (ELF), English as an international language (EIL), and Global Englishes, and critically reviews the growing body of pedagogical research conducted within these domains. Adopting the methodology of a systematic review, 58 empirical articles published between 2010 and 2020 were shortlisted, of which 38 were given an in-depth critical review and contextualized within a wider body of literature. Synthesis of classroom research suggests a current lack of longitudinal designs, an underuse of direct measures to explore the effects of classroom interventions, and under-representation of contexts outside of university language classrooms. Synthesis of teacher education research suggests future studies need to adopt more robust methodological designs which measure the effects of Global Englishes content on teacher beliefs and pedagogical practices both before and throughout the programme, and after teachers return to the classroom.","[{""name"": ""Heath Rose"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jim McKinley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicola Galloway"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/bjet.12269"", ""10.1016/j.system.2013.07.019"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511667220"", ""10.1080/01434632.2014.994638"", ""10.1057/9781137398093_10"", ""10.1515/jelf-2015-0005"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107425965"", ""10.1111/weng.12368"", ""10.1093/elt/ccu021"", ""10.1016/j.system.2015.04.017"", ""10.1515/jelf-2012-0006"", ""10.1017/S095834401700026X"", ""10.1093/elt/ccx024"", ""10.1017/S0261444811000115"", ""10.1017/9781316678343"", ""10.1515/jelf-2012-0002"", ""10.4324/9780203819159"", ""10.1515/jelf-2012-0007"", ""10.1080/01434632.2018.1480628"", ""10.1080/09588221.2014.904360"", ""10.5054/tq.2010.235995"", ""10.4324/9781315734347"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2016.6.3.6"", ""10.1080/13488678.2015.1006350"", ""10.1111/j.1467-971X.1991.tb00150.x"", ""10.1080/13488678.2019.1624931"", ""10.1017/S0266078413000527"", ""10.1017/S0261444800006583"", ""10.1515/mlt-2018-0003"", ""10.1016/j.system.2017.12.002"", ""10.1002/tesq.113"", ""10.1093/applin/amx034"", ""10.21832/9781847697042"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.04.005"", ""10.21832/9781847692030"", ""10.1111/j.1467-971X.1985.tb00423.x"", ""10.4324/9781315158983"", ""10.1080/17501229.2014.936869"", ""10.21832/9781847691231-006"", ""10.1177/0033688217753848"", ""10.4324/9781315209449"", ""10.1111/weng.12150"", ""10.1080/01434632.2018.1503669"", ""10.1111/j.1473-4192.2006.00111.x"", ""10.1002/9780470754887"", ""10.1515/9783110335965.121"", ""10.1177/0033688218822853"", ""10.1111/j.1467-1770.1984.tb00996.x"", ""10.1007/s40299-018-0381-6"", ""10.1177/0033688216684281"", ""10.1080/01434632.2016.1242595"", ""10.1186/s13643-016-0384-4"", ""10.1017/S0266078415000383"", ""10.1080/17501229.2015.1120736"", ""10.1002/tesq.547"", ""10.21832/9781847697042-003"", ""10.1080/1358684X.2016.1228444"", ""10.1080/09588221.2017.1304966"", ""10.1093/elt/ccx010"", ""10.1093/elt/ccy012"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2010.08.009"", ""10.1111/bjet.12652"", ""10.1111/weng.12149"", ""10.1057/9781137398093_7"", ""10.1177/003368827600700205"", ""10.1111/j.1467-971X.1993.tb00007.x"", ""10.21832/9781847697042-007"", ""10.1080/01434632.2016.1260572"", ""10.1002/j.1545-7249.2009.tb00187.x"", ""10.1075/japc.26.2.08zac"", ""10.1080/13488678.2018.1434396"", ""10.1080/09571736.2016.1196384"", ""10.1177/0033688217746206"", ""10.1515/9783110335965.89"", ""10.1080/13488678.2016.1173466"", ""10.1016/j.system.2014.07.008"", ""10.1080/1358684X.2014.968469"", ""10.1002/tesq.509"", ""10.1080/10572252.2011.551503"", ""10.2307/40264515"", ""10.1515/jelf-2014-0019"", ""10.4324/9780203120293"", ""10.1111/j.1467-971X.2011.01717.x"", ""10.1093/elt/ccq024"", ""10.1093/elt/ccr017"", ""10.21832/9781783097036""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1186/s41239-022-00362-6,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,The impact of a virtual teaching assistant (chatbot) on students' learning in Ghanaian higher education,"AbstractChatbot usage is evolving rapidly in various fields, including higher education. The present study’s purpose is to discuss the effect of a virtual teaching assistant (chatbot) that automatically responds to a student’s question. A pretest–posttest design was implemented, with the 68 participating undergraduate students being randomly allocated to scenarios representing a 2 × 2 design (experimental and control cohorts). Data was garnered utilizing an academic achievement test and focus groups, which allowed more in depth analysis of the students’ experience with the chatbot. The results of the study demonstrated that the students who interacted with the chatbot performed better academically comparing to those who interacted with the course instructor. Besides, the focus group data garnered from the experimental cohort illustrated that they were confident about the chatbot’s integration into the course. The present study essentially focused on the learning of the experimental cohort and their view regarding interaction with the chatbot. This study contributes the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot literature to improve student academic performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Ghana to integrate a chatbot to engage undergraduate students. This study provides critical information on the use and development of virtual teaching assistants using a zero-coding technique, which is the most suitable approach for organizations with limited financial and human resources.","[{""name"": ""Harry Barton Essel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dimitrios Vlachopoulos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Akosua Tachie-Menson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Esi Eduafua Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Papa Kwame Baah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.mlwa.2020.100006"", ""10.1080/08832323.2019.1644276"", ""10.1108/LHT-09-2021-0330"", ""10.1002/widm.1424"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-24305-0_38"", ""10.55544/ijrah.2.2.12"", ""10.1111/bjet.13158"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01689-0_23"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0252880"", ""10.1145/3099023.3099112"", ""10.1109/MICAI.2012.18"", ""10.1145/3366030.3366115"", ""10.1080/03054985.2014.921613"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104395"", ""10.1002/tea.10111"", ""10.1145/3287921.3287937"", ""10.1155/2019/9517321"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00302-w"", ""10.1145/3323771.3323824"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-50506-6_8"", ""10.1109/FIE.2018.8659174"", ""10.1177/1461444818804980"", ""10.21315/mjms2018.25.1.9"", ""10.1002/cae.22326"", ""10.1145/3291078.3291115"", ""10.1109/ICACCI.2017.8126057"", ""10.1186/s41239-022-00326-w"", ""10.1109/ITHET46829.2019.8937382"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-69914-1_9"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103862,103862"", ""10.1177/0013124517727053"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10627-8"", ""10.21272/fmir.5(4).128-138.202"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00269-8"", ""10.1109/FIE.2018.8659282"", ""10.32628/CSEIT1952171"", ""10.3991/ijet.v16i06.20173"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100023"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104536"", ""10.1145/3371647.3371659"", ""10.1177/0735633120952067""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), known for their reversible and anisotropic deformation, are promising candidates as embedded intelligent actuators in soft robots. So far, most studies on LCEs have focused on achieving complex deformation in thin films over centimeter‐scale areas with relatively small specific energy densities. Herein, using an extrusion process, meter‐long LCE composite filaments that are responsive to both infrared light and electrical fields are fabricated. In the composite filaments, a small quantity of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is incorporated to facilitate the alignment of liquid crystal molecules along the long axis of the filament. Up to 2 wt% carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is introduced into a LCE matrix without aggregation, which in turn greatly improves the mechanical property of filaments and their actuation speed, where the Young's modulus along the long axis reaches 40 MPa, the electrothermal response time is within 10 s.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003441,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Pandemics and Their Impact on Medical Training: Lessons From Singapore,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has hit Singapore hard. As of February 25, 2020, Singapore had the fourth highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections outside of China, only trailing behind South Korea, Italy, and Japan. This has had reverberating effects on Singapore’s health care system, and has, consequently, also affected medical education all the way from the undergraduate to the postgraduate level. While efforts are underway to contain disease spread and transmission, the authors believe that this is an opportune time to examine and reflect on the impact that medical crises like COVID-19 can have on medical training and education and to evaluate “business continuity plans” to ensure quality medical education even in the face of constant disruptions from pandemic outbreaks. Medical training is as important a mandate as patient care and service. The authors believe that even in trying times like this, rich and precious lessons can be sought and taught, which will immensely benefit medical students and residents—the health care leaders of tomorrow. In this Perspective, the authors discuss the various ways in which the COVID-19 crisis has affected medical instruction in Singapore and explore pertinent practical and creative solutions for the continuity of medical training in these trying times, drawing on their previous experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003 as well as the current ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","[{""name"": ""Zhen Chang Liang"", ""affiliation"": [""is a resident, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Shirley Beng Suat Ooi"", ""affiliation"": [""is senior consultant, Emergency Medicine Department, National University Hospital, National University Health System, associate professor, Department of Surgery, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, and designated institutional official, National University Health System Residency Programme, Singapore; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Wilson Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""is senior consultant and associate professor, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore; ORCID:.""]}]","[""10.1056/NEJMoa2001017"", ""10.3389/fimmu.2019.00549"", ""10.4066/AMJ.2011.823"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2006.3.3"", ""10.2106/JBJS.20.00236"", ""10.1080/01421590903050374""]",['Medicine'],"['Oncology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Infectious Diseases']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)]]"

The recent development provides valuable tools for understanding the student learning environment by exploring and utilizing educational data using machine learning and data mining techniques. Modern academic institutions operate in a highly competitive and complex environment. Analyzing performance, providing high-quality education, strategies for evaluating the students’ performance, and future actions are among the prevailing challenges universities face. Student intervention plans must be implemented in these universities to overcome problems experienced by the students during their studies. In this systematic review, the relevant EDM literature related to identifying student dropouts and students at risk from 2009 to 2021 is reviewed. The review results indicated that various Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to understand and overcome the underlying challenges; predicting students at risk and students drop out prediction. Moreover, most studies use two types of datasets: data from student colleges/university databases and online learning platforms. ML methods were confirmed to play essential roles in predicting students at risk and dropout rates, thus improving the students’ performance.","[{""name"": ""Balqis Albreiki"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain 15551, United Arab Emirates"", ""Big Data Analytics Center, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain 15551, United Arab Emirates""]}, {""name"": ""Nazar Zaki"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain 15551, United Arab Emirates"", ""Big Data Analytics Center, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain 15551, United Arab Emirates""]}, {""name"": ""Hany Alashwal"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain 15551, United Arab Emirates"", ""Big Data Analytics Center, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain 15551, United Arab Emirates""]}]","[""10.1201/b10274"", ""10.1155/2019/1306039"", ""10.1145/3448250"", ""10.1002/asi.20970"", ""10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9471"", ""10.3115/v1/W14-4111"", ""10.1145/3293881.3295783"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-0177-7"", ""10.3390/app11010237"", ""10.2106/00004623-200209000-00024"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.05.010"", ""10.1504/IJKESDP.2009.022718"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2010.03.010"", ""10.1007/s11162-011-9229-0"", ""10.1007/s10462-011-9234-x"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2013.99"", ""10.1007/s10489-012-0374-8"", ""10.1145/2498328.2500061"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.002"", ""10.18608/jla.2014.13.14"", ""10.2478/eurodl-2014-0008"", ""10.3991/ijet.v10i1.4189"", ""10.1145/2783258.2788620"", ""10.1109/ICDMW.2015.174"", ""10.1145/2801948.2802013"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.007"", ""10.1145/2462476.2462501"", ""10.13189/wjcat.2014.020203"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.09.005"", ""10.1145/3126973.3126990"", ""10.1111/exsy.12135"", ""10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.03.005"", ""10.1145/2787622.2787717"", ""10.1109/ISET.2017.43"", ""10.5815/ijmecs.2017.08.02"", ""10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2692560"", ""10.1109/CCECE.2017.7946847"", ""10.1145/3041021.3054162"", ""10.1109/ICCSE.2016.7581554"", ""10.1007/s10586-017-0967-4"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.032"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2018.02.031"", ""10.1177/0735633118757015"", ""10.1007/s00500-018-3064-6"", ""10.25077/jitce.4.01.10-15.2020"", ""10.1109/ICICS49469.2020.239566"", ""10.2991/assehr.k.200509.104"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3565874"", ""10.1111/bjet.12836"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986809"", ""10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106903"", ""10.1007/s10462-018-9620-8"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2010.08.006"", ""10.3390/su11102833"", ""10.1109/ICAEM.2019.8853723"", ""10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0072""]","['Computer Science', 'Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Health Information Management', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7414), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7405)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/lang.12347,LANGUAGE LEARNING,0401 Education,The Study of Heritage Language Development From a Bilingualism and Social Justice Perspective,"AbstractUsing the lenses of bilingualism and social justice, I reflect on relevant conceptual and methodological issues encountered in the study of the linguistic development of heritage language speakers. Themes examined include the early but varying timing of heritage language learning; the surrounding linguistic environment, including the link between parental input and linguistic outcomes and heritage language speakers’ bilingualism, multilingualism, and multilectalism; the framing of literacy in the minority language; and the unique and language‐shaping experience of minoritization, often an outcome of immigration. I argue that bilingualism is gradient and that better measurement of relevant variables—particularly those related to timing, input/exposure, and literacy—can invigorate the study of heritage language development and make new and more robust insights possible. I propose that heritage speakers and their languages must be understood as connected to minoritized communities and to the experience of inequitable multilingualism.","[{""name"": ""Lourdes Ortega"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-44694-3_51"", ""10.1075/sibil.52.03aal"", ""10.1111/flan.12087"", ""10.1136/bmj.332.7549.1080"", ""10.3758/s13428-017-0867-9"", ""10.1017/S0272263113000600"", ""10.1075/btl.129.13ang"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-44694-3_48"", ""10.1002/9781118332382"", ""10.1080/10573569.2017.1370623"", ""10.1515/tl-2013-0009"", ""10.1017/S0272263109090275"", ""10.21283/2376905X.3.44"", ""10.1353/sls.2018.0005"", ""10.1016/j.jneuroling.2018.01.003"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107425965"", ""10.1111/lang.12323"", ""10.1017/S0142716407070221"", ""10.21832/9781847691507"", ""10.1177/1367006913489202"", ""10.1075/sibil.54.07hou"", ""10.1080/01434632.2013.859687"", ""10.1080/14790718.2013.878347"", ""10.1075/rcl.10.2.07sez"", ""10.4324/9780203864739"", ""10.1111/modl.12534"", ""10.1353/hpn.2018.0029"", ""10.1353/hpn.2016.0000"", ""10.1080/19313152.2016.1273740"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316091326"", ""10.1016/j.lingua.2014.09.008"", ""10.1002/9781118445112.stat00070"", ""10.1111/flan.12291"", ""10.1017/S0142716400008183"", ""10.1016/0093-934X(89)90048-5"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199281282.001.0001"", ""10.1075/tilar.13.02gru"", ""10.1080/01434632.2015.1044997"", ""10.1080/19313152.2013.770339"", ""10.1075/lia.2.2.03gur"", ""10.1080/15427580903118689"", ""10.1177/2158244016669552"", ""10.1080/01434632.2015.1127930"", ""10.1080/13670050.2015.1008979"", ""10.1075/lab.15001.hig"", ""10.1080/23273798.2018.1425803"", ""10.1111/lang.12317"", ""10.1136/medethics-2015-103242"", ""10.1016/j.patrec.2009.09.011"", ""10.46538/hlj.5.1.5"", ""10.1177/1367006918762151"", ""10.1075/lab.14032.kei"", ""10.1515/multi-2014-1020"", ""10.1017/S0261444812000493"", ""10.1080/2331186X.2015.1006504"", ""10.1177/0963721414528511"", ""10.1515/tl-2013-0012"", ""10.1177/1367006916654355"", ""10.1515/9783110198553.1.45"", ""10.1037/a0036424"", ""10.3758/BF03192770"", ""10.1017/S1366728916001073"", ""10.2979/chiricu.1.2.06"", ""10.1037/bul0000172"", ""10.1080/20445911.2013.795574"", ""10.1177/1367006916681084"", ""10.1044/1092-4388(2007/067)"", ""10.1017/S1366728917000724"", ""10.1075/lald.46.04mei"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511862694"", ""10.1017/S1366728902000135"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139030502"", ""10.1353/lan.2015.0035"", ""10.1080/13670050.2014.928258"", ""10.1017/S1366728912000727"", ""10.1177/1367006918762160"", ""10.1515/9783110341249"", ""10.1111/modl.12525"", ""10.1075/sibil.49.01pas"", ""10.1093/applin/ams037"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199937240.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1367006916656048"", ""10.1017/9781107252349"", ""10.4324/9781315735139"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02212"", ""10.1177/0267658316648732"", ""10.1002/wcs.1437"", ""10.1177/13670069070110040201"", ""10.1017/S0272263117000134"", ""10.1093/applin/amt049"", ""10.1177/1367006916684919"", ""10.1002/tesq.53"", ""10.1111/lang.12361"", ""10.1075/lab.17058.sch"", ""10.1080/1360200042000212205"", ""10.1111/flan.12249"", ""10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal1460"", ""10.1093/applin/amu027"", ""10.1080/13670050.2015.1126217"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9841.2009.00436.x"", ""10.1037/amp0000265"", ""10.1111/modl.12511"", ""10.1037/10694-000"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-44694-3_53"", ""10.1017/S030500091500080X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2005.00314.x"", ""10.1037/a0029232"", ""10.1207/S15327701JLIE0203_4"", ""10.4324/9780203122419"", ""10.46538/hlj.8.2.6"", ""10.1515/caslar-2017-0004""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)]]"
10.1007/s10758-020-09477-z,TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING,0401 Education,Blended Learning Adoption and Implementation in Higher Education: A Theoretical and Systematic Review,"AbstractTechnological innovations such as blended learning (BL) are rapidly changing teaching and learning in higher education, where BL integrates face to face teaching with web based learning. Thus, as polices related to BL increases, it is required to explore the theoretical foundation of BL studies and how BL were adopted and implemented in relation to students, lecturers and administration. However, only fewer studies have focused on exploring the constructs and factors related to BL adoption by considering the students, lecturers and administration concurrently. Likewise, prior research neglects to explore what practices are involved for BL implementation. Accordingly, this study systematically reviews, synthesizes, and provides meta-analysis of 94 BL research articles published from 2004 to 2020 to present the theoretical foundation of BL adoption and implementation in higher education. The main findings of this study present the constructs and factors that influence students, lecturers and administration towards adopting BL in higher education. Moreover, findings suggest that the BL practices to be implemented comprises of face-to-face, activities, information, resources, assessment, and feedback for students and technology, pedagogy, content, and knowledge for lecturers. Besides, the review reveals that the ad hoc, technology acceptance model, information system success model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and lastly diffusion of innovations theories are the mostly employed theories employed by prior studies to explore BL adoption.

10.1002/ase.2051,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,An Analysis of Anatomy Education Before and During Covid-19: May-August 2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19) created unparalleled challenges to anatomy education. Gross anatomy education has been particularly impacted given the traditional in‐person format of didactic instruction and/or laboratory component(s). To assess the changes in gross anatomy lecture and laboratory instruction, assessment, and teaching resources utilized as a result of Covid‐19, a survey was distributed to gross anatomy educators through professional associations and listservs. Of the 67 survey responses received for the May–August 2020 academic period, 84% were from United States (US) institutions, while 16% were internationally based. Respondents indicated that in‐person lecture decreased during Covid‐19 (before: 76%, during: 8%, P &lt; 0.001) and use of cadaver materials declined (before: 76 ± 33%, during: 34 ± 43%, P &lt; 0.001). The use of cadaver materials in laboratories decreased during Covid‐19 across academic programs, stand‐alone and integrated anatomy courses, and private and public institutions (P ≤ 0.004). Before Covid‐19, cadaveric materials used in laboratories were greater among professional health programs relative to medical and undergraduate programs (P ≤ 0.03) and among stand‐alone relative to integrated anatomy courses (P ≤ 0.03). Furthermore, computer‐based assessment increased (P &lt; 0.001) and assessment materials changed from cadaveric material to images (P &lt; 0.03) during Covid‐19, even though assessment structure was not different (P &gt; 0.05). The use of digital teaching resources increased during Covid‐19 (P &lt; 0.001), with reports of increased use of in‐house created content, BlueLink, and Complete Anatomy software (P &lt; 0.05). While primarily representing US institutions, this study provided evidence of how anatomy educators adapted their courses, largely through virtual mediums, and modified laboratory protocols during the initial emergence of the Covid‐19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Derek J.

10.1007/s10734-019-00486-1,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"The 'internationalisation', or 'Englishisation', of higher education in East Asia","AbstractIn recent years, one of the most significant trends in higher education in non-anglophone countries has been the growth in English Medium Instruction (EMI). However, provision is rapidly outpacing empirical research. This study examined how macro-level education policy with regard to EMI is both implemented and conceptualised at the institutional and classroom level in Chinese and Japanese universities. Utilising questionnaires with home students (n = 579) and staff (n = 28), interviews with home students (n = 29) and staff (n = 28) and four focus groups with staff and four with home students, in addition to questionnaires (n = 123), interviews (n = 10) and three focus groups with international students, the study provides insights into how EMI policy is operationalised, including types of programmes and language use, and how it is conceptualised by different stakeholders. The results highlight contextual constraints to policy implementation, calling for the need for more research into this growing trend and curriculum evaluation to inform context-sensitive ways to implement EMI policy. It also calls for a critical examination of monolingual EMI policies and academic norms amidst growing multilingualism in the EMI classroom as well as clear goals and objectives due to varying conceptualisations of the purposes of EMI amongst staff and students.","[{""name"": ""Nicola Galloway"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Takuya Numajiri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nerys Rees"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13670050.2011.615906"", ""10.1088/0143-0807/27/3/009"", ""10.1007/s10734-018-0323-5"", ""10.20355/C5B59J"", ""10.1080/14767724.2010.537931"", ""10.5539/ies.v8n3p1"", ""10.1080/13670050.2012.676621"", ""10.1080/01434632.2013.874433"", ""10.1111/ijal.12114"", ""10.7146/hjlcb.v23i45.97343"", ""10.1017/S0266078409990472"", ""10.1007/s10734-013-9661-5"", ""10.1007/s10993-013-9298-3"", ""10.1057/9781137002006_7"", ""10.1093/elt/cct045"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0125-1"", ""10.1080/01434632.2012.661735"", ""10.1177/1475240905050291"", ""10.21832/9781847698162-005"", ""10.1080/01434632.2017.1404070""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

Student accountability is achieved through the specific steps of TBL, including pre-class preparation, readiness assurance testing, problem-solving activities, and immediate feedback. Globally, a growing number of healthcare faculties have adopted TBL in a variety of combinations, across diverse settings and content areas. This paper provides a succinct overview of TBL and guidance for teachers towards successful design and implementation of TBL within health professional education. It also offers guidance for students participating in TBL. The paper is informed by both educational theory, and the extensive, seven year experience of the first and last authors in designing, implementing, facilitating and evaluating TBL at a large medical school.","[{""name"": ""Annette Burgess"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christie van Diggele"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Craig Mellis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3109/0142159X.2012.651179"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000162"", ""10.1002/tl.330"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318244759e"", ""10.4172/2167-1168.S1-008"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9066-6"", ""10.1186/s12909-015-0506-z"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-1068-z"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1172-8"", ""10.5688/ajpe77470"", ""10.5688/ajpe807120"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2013.849802"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2017.1340636"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181f52bed"", ""10.1207/s15328015tlm1603_9"", ""10.1207/s15328015tlm1701_15"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000512"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000539"", ""10.1111/medu.13151"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2011.542522"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3180555d4e"", ""10.1080/13562517.2016.1221811"", ""10.1080/1356182021000044139"", ""10.3102/0013189X029007004"", ""10.1097/00001888-200212000-00005"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S77890"", ""10.1001/jama.296.9.1094"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.668240"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-1037-6"", ""10.1080/0260293022000009302"", ""10.1108/00400910610705890"", ""10.1111/tct.12260"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.2003.21049.x"", ""10.3109/01421590903548539"", ""10.3109/01421590903548562""]","['Engineering', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003077,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Seeking Inclusion Excellence: Understanding Racial Microaggressions as Experienced by Underrepresented Medical and Nursing Students,"Purpose To describe how racial microaggressions may affect optimal learning for under-represented health professions students. Method The authors conducted focus groups and individual interviews from November 2017 to June 2018 with 37 students at University of California, Davis and Yale University who self-identified as underrepresented in medicine or nursing. Questions explored incidence, response to, and effects of racial microaggressions, as well as students’ suggestions for change. Data were organized and coded, then thematic analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes. Results The data showed consistent examples of microaggressions across both health professions and schools, with peers, faculty, preceptors, and structural elements of the curricula all contributing to microaggressive behavior. The 3 major themes were: students felt devalued by microaggressions; students identified how microaggressions affected their learning, academic performance, and personal wellness; and students had suggestions for promoting inclusion. Conclusions The data indicated that students perceived that their daily experiences were affected by racial microaggressions. Participants reported strong emotions while experiencing racial microaggressions including feeling stressed, frustrated, and angered by these interactions. Further, students believed microaggressions negatively affected their learning, academic performance, and overall well-being. This study shows the need for leadership and faculty of health professions schools to implement policies, practices, and instructional strategies that support and leverage diversity so that innovative problem-solving can emerge to better serve underserved communities and reduce health disparities.","[{""name"": ""Kupiri Ackerman-Barger"", ""affiliation"": [""is associate clinical professor, Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California.""]}, {""name"": ""Dowin Boatright"", ""affiliation"": [""is assistant professor of emergency medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.""]}, {""name"": ""Rosana Gonzalez-Colaso"", ""affiliation"": [""is assistant professor of internal medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.""]}, {""name"": ""Regina Orozco"", ""affiliation"": [""is a PhD student, Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California.""]}, {""name"": ""Darin Latimore"", ""affiliation"": [""is deputy dean for diversity and inclusion and chief diversity officer, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.""]}]","[""10.1037/a0025193"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.62.4.271"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01984.x"", ""10.1037/a0025457"", ""10.1080/095183998236926"", ""10.17763/haer.79.4.m6867014157m707l"", ""10.1037/0735-7028.39.3.329"", ""10.1353/csd.2014.0051"", ""10.1177/00333549141291S209"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.06.032"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.13705""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s11618-021-01002-x,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERZIEHUNGSWISSENSCHAFT,0401 Education,"Learning during COVID-19: the role of self-regulated learning, motivation, and procrastination for perceived competence","AbstractIn March 2020 schools in Austria temporarily closed and switched to distance learning to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The resulting situation posed great challenges to teachers, guardians and students (Huber and Helm 2020). Research has shown that perceived competence (Deci and Ryan 2000) affects selfregulated learning (SRL), intrinsic motivation and procrastination, however few studies have considered these variables in context of distance learning among adolescents. This study investigated differences in students who perceived themselves as high vs. low in competence with respect to these constructs. In an online questionnaire, 2652 Austrian secondary school students answered closed questions regarding SRL, intrinsic motivation and procrastination as well as open-ended questions about challenges, successes and need for support in distance. Structural equation modeling was applied for the quantitative analysis which was complemented by thematic analysis for the qualitative questions (Braun and Clarke 2006). Results showed that students who experienced themselves as highly competent use SRL strategies (goal setting and planning, time management, metacognitive strategies) more often and are more intrinsically motivated than students with lower perceived competence. They also procrastinate less. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed that although all students face similar challenges (e.g., independent learning, time and task management, learning on the computer, lack of contact with teachers and peers), students who perceived themselves as highly competent seemed to cope better, and have less need for support. Implications for distance learning and future research are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Elisabeth Rosa Pelikan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marko Lüftenegger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julia Holzer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Selma Korlat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christiane Spiel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Barbara Schober"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-70010-6_14"", ""10.1111/bjet.12089"", ""10.1016/j.enfcle.2019.07.013"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007"", ""10.1348/096317909X481382"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.01.011"", ""10.1080/01443410.2011.560597"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.1037/a0012801"", ""10.1007/s10648-015-9320-8"", ""10.1007/s11409-008-9029-x"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2013.11.002"", ""10.3200/JEXE.77.1.3-20"", ""10.1007/s10212-010-0030-9"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1771895"", ""10.1006/ceps.1995.1017"", ""10.1080/01443410.2013.822964"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.01.008"", ""10.1007/s11218-011-9170-2"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.93.1.3"", ""10.1177/0146167201276001"", ""10.1007/s10942-012-0153-9"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2006.11.017"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1007/s11092-020-09322-y"", ""10.31244/9783830942160"", ""10.1027/1016-9040/a000138"", ""10.1024/1010-0652/a000230"", ""10.15760/nwjte.2017.12.2.2"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2011.06.001"", ""10.1177/016146811311500307"", ""10.1006/ceps.1993.1002"", ""10.3200/TCHS.78.3.105-109"", ""10.1177/1477878509104318"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2010.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.09.004"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00422"", ""10.1017/sjp.2014.63"", ""10.1177/0748175609344096"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.95.2.375"", ""10.1080/15391523.2006.10782468"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2006.10.001"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1020"", ""10.11587/VRQL3B"", ""10.1553/gw-unterricht158s51"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65"", ""10.1111/ap.12173"", ""10.1348/000709910X522285"", ""10.1026/0012-1924/a000201"", ""10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30095-X"", ""10.1007/s00502-017-0527-x"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.034"", ""10.1080/01587919.2013.835779"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03087"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3804_1"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50052-4"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50031-7"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep2501_2"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.1.51"", ""10.3102/00028312023004614"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5826.2008.01275.x""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003173,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Implicit Bias in Health Professions: From Recognition to Transformation,"Implicit bias recognition and management curricula are offered as an increasingly popular solution to address health disparities and advance equity. Despite growth in the field, approaches to implicit bias instruction are varied and have mixed results. The concept of implicit bias recognition and management is relatively nascent, and discussions related to implicit bias have also evoked critique and controversy. In addition, challenges related to assessment, faculty development, and resistant learners are emerging in the literature. In this context, the authors have reframed implicit bias recognition and management curricula as unique forms of transformative learning that raise critical consciousness in both individuals and clinical learning environments. The authors have proposed transformative learning theory (TLT) as a guide for implementing educational strategies related to implicit bias in health professions. When viewed through the lens of TLT, curricula to recognize and manage implicit biases are positioned as a tool to advance social justice.","[{""name"": ""Javeed Sukhera"", ""affiliation"": [""is associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics and scientist, Centre for Education Research and Innovation, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Christopher J.

Segmentation is valuable for two significant clinical applications, namely lesion detection and classification, providing means to improve accuracy and robustness. The manual segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images is time-consuming. As a result, the use of deep learning (DL) for automation of polyp segmentation has become important. However, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting inability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes. Recent transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation both achieve higher performance and generalise better than alternatives, however typically predict a segmentation map of $$\frac{h}{4}\times \frac{w}{4}$$ spatial dimensions for a $$h\times w$$ input image. To this end, we propose a new architecture for full-size segmentation which leverages the strengths of a transformer in extracting the most important features for segmentation in a primary branch, while compensating for its limitations in full-size prediction with a secondary fully convolutional branch. The resulting features from both branches are then fused for final prediction of a $$h\times w$$ segmentation map. We demonstrate our method’s state-of-the-art performance with respect to the mDice, mIoU, mPrecision, and mRecall metrics, on both the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB dataset benchmarks. Additionally, we train the model on each of these datasets and evaluate on the other to demonstrate its superior generalisation performance.Code available: https://github.com/CVML-UCLan/FCBFormer.","[{""name"": ""Edward Sanderson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bogdan J.

In‐memory computing (IMC) appears as a promising approach to suppress the memory bottleneck and enable higher parallelism of data processing, thanks to the memory array architecture. As a result, IMC shows a better throughput and lower energy consumption with respect to the conventional digital approach, not only for typical AI tasks, but also for general‐purpose problems such as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and linear algebra. Herein, an overview of IMC is provided in terms of memory devices and circuit architectures. First, the memory device technologies adopted for IMC are summarized, focusing on both charge‐based memories and emerging devices relying on electrically induced material modification at the chemical or physical level. Then, the computational memory programming and the corresponding device nonidealities are described with reference to offline and online training of IMC circuits. Finally, array architectures for computing are reviewed, including typical architectures for neural network accelerators, content addressable memory (CAM), and novel circuit topologies for general‐purpose computing with low complexity.","[{""name"": ""Daniele Ielmini"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano and Italian

10.14201/eks.31279,EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY,0401 Education,The perception of Artificial Intelligence in educational contexts after the launch of ChatGPT: Disruption or Panic?,"El año 2022 ha finalizado con una de esas innovaciones tecnológicas que tienen un comportamiento difícil de predecir, un cisne negro, acaparando la atención en los medios de comunicación tradicionales y los medios digitales. Efectivamente, se trata de ChatGPT. Si bien la inteligencia artificial ya venía ocupando un lugar destacado en diversas noticias, aunque muchas veces enmascarada bajo otras diversas acepciones, el fenómeno ChatGPT ha vuelto a poner en primera plana esta disciplina, así como sus efectos, tanto positivos como negativos, en nuestra sociedad. Las reacciones a su lanzamiento, sobre todo influidas por su facilidad de acceso y uso, están siendo de lo más variadas, yendo del entusiasmo de los innovadores y adoptadores tempranos hasta el terror casi apocalíptico propio de la película Terminator. De las múltiples aplicaciones de esta herramienta, el mayor debate está centrándose en sus implicaciones en la Educación y en la Academia, por su tremenda potencia para generar textos que perfectamente podrían pasar por creaciones humanas. Estamos en los albores de una tecnología que ha pasado de ser una herramienta de juguete a presentar su candidatura a convertirse en una innovación disruptiva. Que lo consiga o no dependerá de muchos factores, pero si no es esta será otra similar. Negarlo o prohibirlo no servirá absolutamente de nada para parar el efecto tsunami que ya ha comenzado. Por todo ello, primero hay que entender estas tecnologías basadas en modelos de lenguaje y conocer tanto sus beneficios como sus puntos débiles, además de lo que realmente suponen para un sector de actividad específico, como puede ser la Educación. Después de conocer la tecnología y la herramienta, se estaría en condiciones de utilizar (o no) su potencial y de prevenir o detectar sus posibles efectos perniciosos, seguramente cambiando y adaptando procesos que probablemente se tengan muy arraigados y que, por tanto, obliguen a salir de la zona de confort, lo que siempre es causa de resistencia al cambio y de reacciones extremas que, normalmente, no van a parar el camino de una tecnología hacia su meseta de productividad cuando esta llegue a ser parte cotidiana de una mayoría suficiente de usuarios, máxime cuando además se trata de herramientas transversales que van a contagiar sus patrones de uso entre los diferentes dominios de aplicación.","[{""name"": ""Francisco José García-Peñalvo"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],['Computer Science Applications'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1007/s10639-022-11122-4,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Tailored gamification in education: A literature review and future agenda,"AbstractGamification has been widely used to design better educational systems aiming to increase students’ concentration, motivation, engagement, flow experience, and others positive experiences. With advances in research on gamification in education, over the past few years, many studies have highlighted the need to tailor the gamification design properties to match individual students’ needs, characteristics and preferences. Thus, different studies have been conducted to personalize the gamification in education. However, the results are still contradictory and need to be better understood to advance this field. To provide a complete understanding of this research domain, we conducted a systematic literature review to summarize the results and discussions on studies that cover the field of tailored gamified education. Following a systematic process, we analysed 2108 studies and identified 19 studies to answer our research questions. The results indicate that most of the studies only consider students’ gamer types to tailor the systems, and most of the experiments do not provide sufficient statistical evidence, especially regarding learning performance using tailored gamified systems. Based on the results, we also provided an agenda with different challenges, opportunities, and research directions to improve the literature on tailored gamification in education. Our study contributes to the field of gamification design in education.","[{""name"": ""Wilk Oliveira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juho Hamari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lei Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Armando M.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and encapsulate practices adopted by universities and colleges across the globe in integrating sustainability in education (here refers to curriculum and pedagogy), research, campus operations and outreach programs.Design/methodology/approachThe review analyzed 229 peer-reviewed research studies in the time period 2005–2018 selected from 44 journals. The literature review was done in phases. The first phase was the selection of the database, the second phase was refining the database by eliminating irrelevant studies and the last phase was distributing selected studies on the basis of the journal, year and country of publication, research paradigm, sustainability integration in higher education, teaching techniques adopted by HEIs and research focus in publications.FindingsThis study contributes to the literature review of sustainability in higher education. From the literature review, it is evident that sustainability has made inroads into HEIs, but only a few universities have been successful in implementing it holistically, integrating all the triple bottom line dimensions in balance.Practical implicationsThe study has practical implications for HEIs planning to integrate sustainability into teaching and learning and other aspects of educational practices. The findings and the examples of successful implementation of sustainable education by institutions around the world would help universities and colleges in formulating policies, strategies and practices that would promote sustainability on campuses.Originality/valueThe literature reviews on sustainability in higher education so far have focused either on curricula, pedagogical approaches, assessment and reporting or barriers and solutions. This study attempts to offer a comprehensive view of the initiatives adopted by the institutions in incorporating sustainability in education, research, campus operations and outreach programs.","[{""name"": ""Shalini Menon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M.

10.1186/s40594-020-00225-4,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Reviewing assessment of student learning in interdisciplinary STEM education,"AbstractSTEM education has received increasing attention in recent years. However, developing valid and reliable assessment of interdisciplinary learning in STEM has been a challenge. This study is a comprehensive review of assessment of interdisciplinary STEM education during the last two decades. A total of 49 empirical research articles were collected from an initial library of 635 articles focusing on interdisciplinary STEM education. A two-dimensional framework was developed to examine the literature. The first dimension concerns the nature of disciplines being assessed and includes three categories: monodisciplinary, interdiscipline, and transdiscipline. The second dimension concerns the learning objectives and includes four aspects: knowledge, skill, practice, and affective domain. The results show that most assessments focused on assessments of monodisciplinary knowledge, monodisciplinary affective domains, and transdisciplinary affective domains. Although many programs aimed to improve students’ interdisciplinary understanding or skills, their assessments did not align with their aims. Based on the review, future directions are proposed for developing assessments for interdisciplinary STEM educational programs.","[{""name"": ""Xiaoyi Gao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peishan Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ji Shen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Huifang Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10956-008-9114-6"", ""10.14221/ajte.2015v40n7.8"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.2011.00109.x"", ""10.4324/9781315753157-3"", ""10.1007/s10763-019-09961-8"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2012.tb01127.x"", ""10.1007/s10763-017-9802-x"", ""10.1080/00220671.2016.1264053"", ""10.1186/s40594-015-0027-7"", ""10.1007/s10798-015-9328-x"", ""10.1186/s40594-015-0025-9"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9673-x"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9612-x"", ""10.1111/ssm.12061"", ""10.1007/s10798-013-9241-0"", ""10.1186/s40594-017-0094-z"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.2001.tb18028.x"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.010"", ""10.1002/tea.21125"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.1997.tb17342.x"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.06.006"", ""10.1007/s10798-010-9114-8"", ""10.1023/B:ITDE.0000007359.81781.7c"", ""10.1002/sce.21336"", ""10.2307/j.ctt6wq7bh.7"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0099-2"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1012185"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1017863"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139519526.015"", ""10.1080/09500693.2013.879224"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1106026"", ""10.1080/00220671.2016.1273178"", ""10.1002/tea.21423"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1085658""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

Reliable, rapid, and high‐throughput screening of MPs from other components of a water sample after sieving and/or digestion is still a highly desirable goal to avoid cumbersome visual analysis by expert users under the optical microscope. Here, a new approach is presented that combines 3D coherent imaging with machine learning (ML) to achieve accurate and automatic detection of MPs in filtered water samples in a wide range at microscale. The water pretreatment process eliminates sediments and aggregates that fall out of the analyzed range. However, it is still necessary to clearly distinguish MPs from marine microalgae. Here, it is shown that, by defining a novel set of distinctive “holographic features,” it is possible to accurately identify MPs within the defined analysis range. The process is specifically tailored for characterizing the MPs' “holographic signatures,” thus boosting the classification performance and reaching accuracy higher than 99% in classifying thousands of items. The ML approach in conjunction with holographic coherent imaging is able to identify MPs independently from their morphology, size, and different types of plastic materials.","[{""name"": ""Vittorio Bianco"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems (ISASI) National Research Council (CNR) of Italy  Via Campi Flegrei 34 80078 Pozzuoli NA Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Pasquale Memmolo"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems (ISASI) National Research Council (CNR) of Italy  Via Campi Flegrei 34 80078 Pozzuoli NA Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Pierluigi Carcagnì"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems (ISASI) National Research Council (CNR) of Italy  Via Monteorni snc University Campus 73100 Lecce Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Francesco Merola"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems (ISASI) National Research Council (CNR) of Italy  Via Campi Flegrei 34 80078 Pozzuoli NA Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Melania Paturzo"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems (ISASI) National Research Council (CNR) of Italy  Via Campi Flegrei 34 80078 Pozzuoli NA Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Cosimo Distante"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems (ISASI) National Research Council (CNR) of Italy  Via Monteorni snc University Campus 73100 Lecce Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Pietro Ferraro"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems (ISASI) National Research Council (CNR) of Italy  Via Campi Flegrei 34 80078 Pozzuoli NA Italy""]}]","[""10.1126/science.1260352"", ""10.1073/pnas.1600715113"", ""10.1038/502615a"", ""10.1021/es2031505"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.050"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2017.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2013.10.068"", ""10.1073/pnas.1519019113"", ""10.1038/srep03263"", ""10.1038/494169a"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2019.02.054"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.012"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-03104-3"", ""10.1039/C6AY02558G"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2018.05.060"", ""10.1021/es501757s"", ""10.1039/C6AY02302A"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2017.06.006"", ""10.1038/s41377-018-0067-0"", ""10.1533/9780857093523"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511801389"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-51448-2"", ""10.1364/OE.22.026884"", ""10.1364/AO.55.000133"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1134/S1990519X09030122"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-45528-0"", ""10.1364/AOP.7.000713"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0111913"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.04.025"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2016.2617892"", ""10.1364/OL.42.003824"", ""10.1109/TIP.2006.888351"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0103750"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-12165-1"", ""10.1109/TSMC.1973.4309314"", ""10.1098/rspl.1895.0041"", ""10.1007/s13042-011-0012-5"", ""10.1109/5.726791"", ""10.1364/OPEX.13.004492"", ""10.1117/1.2397576"", ""10.1126/sciadv.1700606"", ""10.1016/j.media.2019.06.014"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-35274-x"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0163045"", ""10.1109/JSTQE.2018.2859234"", ""10.1002/cyto.a.23189"", ""10.1038/srep21471"", ""10.1039/C7LC00414A"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939785"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-04565-2""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Engineering']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Biophysics']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7711), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7598)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7179), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7089)]]"

Among various building materials, hydrogels have great advantages as artificial muscles, such as responsiveness to a wide range of stimuli, large volume deformation, and sensitivity. However, conventional hydrogel actuators that generate only isotropic volume change in response to an external stimulus cannot be considered as artificial muscles because complex deformations are not possible. Instead, programmed complex deformations originated from a rationally designed anisotropic structure are desired in artificial muscles. Herein, recent approaches for constructing stimuli‐responsive hydrogels with an anisotropic structure, thereby enabling a directional complex motion to mimic a muscle are reviewed. First, stimuli‐responsive shape‐deforming hydrogels as a main building matrix are categorized according to stimulating external signals. The representative methods for modulating the isotropic structure of a hydrogel into various anisotropic structures, such as multilayer structure, linearly oriented structure, and patterned structure are discussed. Finally, the recent strategies to achieve muscle‐like motion of hydrogels by combining stimuli responsiveness and anisotropic structures for translation from elementary contraction and expansion to programmed deformations, such as multidirectional bending, directionally amplified deformation, and compositive programmed motion, are covered.","[{""name"": ""Nuri Park"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)  Suwon 16419 Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Jaeyun Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)  Suwon 16419 Republic of Korea"", ""Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Science &amp; Technology (SAIHST) Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)  Suwon 16419 Republic of Korea"", ""Biomedical Institute for Convergence at SKKU (BICS) Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)  Suwon 16419 Republic of Korea"", ""Institute of Quantum Biophysics (IQB) Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)  Suwon 16419 Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1109/JOE.2004.833135"", ""10.1002/adma.201704407"", ""10.1126/science.1246906"", ""10.1002/adma.201604734"", ""10.1126/science.287.5454.836"", ""10.1002/adma.201503078"", ""10.1177/027836498600400404"", ""10.1007/s10047-015-0827-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-75645-3_1"", ""10.1002/jbm.820070604"", ""10.1039/b714376a"", ""10.1016/S0169-409X(01)00203-4"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.40.820"", ""10.1002/anie.201708196"", ""10.1002/adfm.201203692"", ""10.1002/advs.201801584"", ""10.1016/j.jsb.2004.08.009"", ""10.1039/C3BM60288E"", ""10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.013"", ""10.1039/b706563a"", ""10.3390/s8010561"", ""10.1021/jacs.8b11351"", ""10.1002/ange.201810052"", ""10.1038/346345a0"", ""10.1021/ja00345a075"", ""10.1021/cr00098a012"", ""10.1038/nchem.2513"", ""10.1021/ma00164a003"", ""10.1021/nn8002373"", ""10.1021/ja051088p"", ""10.31635/ccschem.019.20180023"", ""10.1038/nchem.2709"", ""10.1039/a703485g"", ""10.1039/C9LC00206E"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b03635"", ""10.1126/science.218.4571.467"", ""10.1039/c2sm07435d"", ""10.1016/0009-2509(90)87019-O"", ""10.1016/0009-2509(95)00344-4"", ""10.1021/ja9602511"", ""10.1002/marc.200900908"", ""10.1021/ma00071a010"", ""10.1021/ma00115a027"", ""10.1016/S0168-3659(02)00409-1"", ""10.1039/C5NR07195J"", ""10.1038/21619"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199810)42:1<112::AID-JBM14>3.0.CO;2-N"", ""10.1021/js980418j"", ""10.1021/bm049349v"", ""10.1038/nmat4544"", ""10.1039/B513292D"", ""10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.12.029"", ""10.1096/fj.06-7873com"", ""10.1088/1758-5090/aaf09b"", ""10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.actbio.2015.04.015"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.10.033"", ""10.1039/C2TB00067A"", ""10.1038/nature06619"", ""10.1039/C4TB01852D"", ""10.1038/nmat2778"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b01276"", ""10.1039/c2sm07411g"", ""10.1002/adma.201801934"", ""10.1002/adma.201102963"", ""10.1038/ncomms5018"", ""10.1002/adma.201002509"", ""10.1002/smll.201601893"", ""10.1002/adfm.201904342"", ""10.1038/ncomms14346"", ""10.1002/admi.201500687"", ""10.1002/marc.201400333"", ""10.1002/adma.201301300"", ""10.1038/ncomms2666"", ""10.1016/j.jmmm.2011.03.016"", ""10.1002/adma.200602295"", ""10.1038/nature14060"", ""10.1002/adma.200801396"", ""10.1002/adhm.201500707"", ""10.1038/nmat1487"", ""10.1002/adma.201704937"", ""10.1038/ncomms2549"", ""10.1088/1758-5090/aaaf50"", ""10.1021/ja400518c"", ""10.1126/sciadv.1700348"", ""10.1002/adhm.201400180"", ""10.1038/s41578-018-0002-2"", ""10.1002/smtd.201900519"", ""10.1002/adma.201402026"", ""10.1021/ma071041j"", ""10.1039/c2jm34010k"", ""10.1039/c2cc36654a"", ""10.1021/acs.macromol.8b00939"", ""10.1038/nmat4363"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-10243-8"", ""10.1002/adfm.201803366"", ""10.1002/mame.201600212"", ""10.1002/adma.201306137"", ""10.1126/science.1215309"", ""10.1002/adma.201702231"", ""10.1016/j.matt.2019.05.012"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b17907"", ""10.1039/c2lc40617a"", ""10.1002/marc.201500079"", ""10.1039/b926443d"", ""10.1039/C6SM02089E"", ""10.1038/ncomms14230"", ""10.1021/nl401088b"", ""10.1002/adfm.201704568"", ""10.1038/nature05024"", ""10.1186/s40580-019-0191-4"", ""10.1039/c1sm05109a"", ""10.1002/anie.201311047"", ""10.1021/am508621s"", ""10.1002/adfm.201601389"", ""10.1002/adfm.201500420"", ""10.1039/C7TB00426E"", ""10.1038/srep13622"", ""10.1016/j.snb.2017.05.005"", ""10.1039/C3SM51921J"", ""10.1038/s41427-019-0165-3"", ""10.1002/adfm.201903471"", ""10.1039/C8PY01286E"", ""10.1002/smll.201903798"", ""10.1039/C9TC01483G"", ""10.1002/asia.201900292"", ""10.1002/admt.201900566""]",['Engineering'],"['Biomedical Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Soft robots, which are mainly fabricated with ﬂexible or elastomeric materials, can easily adjust to environmental changes and accomplish complex tasks, offering a new paradigm to achieve human–machine compliance. Soft robots do not replace rigid robots but add diverse features for softer robotic applications. In particular, the use of flexible actuators in robotic systems can realize certain intelligent functions, enrich soft robotic systems and migrate academic research to engineering applications. Currently, the application of flexible actuators in soft robotic fields is still at the embryonic stage. However, tremendous application spaces can be envisaged when combining flexible actuators with soft wearable robotics. Therefore, the current flexible actuators that rely on different external stimuli are addressed herein, and their materials, designs, and approaches suitable for soft robotic applications are highlighted. The application advancement and future perspective of flexible actuator prototypes toward various soft robotics are also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Ying Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""i-Lab Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics Chinese Academy of Sciences  Suzhou 215123 P.

10.3390/educsci10120368,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Challenges and Opportunities for Russian Higher Education amid COVID-19: Teachers' Perspective,"The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously affected higher education systems in Russia and all over the world, forcing to transform curriculum into an online format, which is a challenge for all the educational process participants. The current study discusses the implementation of online learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian higher education context and investigates the challenges experienced by university teachers during this period to define their readiness for online education. To address the above-mentioned issues, a study was conducted in Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. A variety of methods of scientific and pedagogical research were used including systematic structural analysis, synthesis, work with research papers, the generalization of experience and experimental work, observation, surveys, etc., with 87 university teachers asked to respond to several sets of questions describing their online teaching experience after the launch of online education amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the participants’ answers helped to identify the following main challenges experienced by university teachers: computer literacy level, the university electronic environment and support, academic staff readiness and students’ readiness for online learning, the last two being the most important hindering the implementation of the efficient online education process. It was also underlined by most respondents that methodological work of a teacher in a digital educational environment differs from conventional teaching methods. Thus, psychological, technological, methodological support and teachers’ professional development programs are of vital importance to minimize the negative impact of the rapid changes of the educational process and to ensure efficient online education.","[{""name"": ""Nadezhda Almazova"", ""affiliation"": [""Higher School of Linguodidactics and Translation, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, Saint-Petersburg 195251, Russia""]}, {""name"": ""Elena Krylova"", ""affiliation"": [""Higher School of Linguodidactics and Translation, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, Saint-Petersburg 195251, Russia""]}, {""name"": ""Anna Rubtsova"", ""affiliation"": [""Higher School of Linguodidactics and Translation, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, Saint-Petersburg 195251, Russia""]}, {""name"": ""Maria Odinokaya"", ""affiliation"": [""Higher School of Linguodidactics and Translation, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, Saint-Petersburg 195251, Russia""]}]","[""10.1111/dsji.12144"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4609.2006.00102.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007"", ""10.14742/ajet.2993"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2019.1625867"", ""10.5539/hes.v7n2p43"", ""10.1017/S0958344011000152"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00155-y"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103701"", ""10.29333/pr/7947"", ""10.2507/30th.daaam.proceedings.113"", ""10.2190/4UJE-B6VW-A30N-MCE5"", ""10.1007/s11423-006-9022-5"", ""10.2304/elea.2009.6.2.221"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.11.009"", ""10.1080/07294360.2018.1450360"", ""10.1080/01587919.2010.513951"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0083-9"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.01.004"", ""10.1111/bjet.12530"", ""10.1007/s10956-008-9123-5""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1002/sce.21575,SCIENCE EDUCATION,0401 Education,Reconceptualizing nature-of-science education in the age of social media,"AbstractIndividuals are increasingly relying on social media as their primary source of scientific information. Science education needs to adapt. Nature of science (NOS) education is already widely accepted as essential to scientific literacy and to an informed public. We argue that NOS now needs to also include the NOS communication: its mediation, mechanisms, and manipulation. Namely, students need to learn about the epistemics of communicative practices, both within science (as a model) and in society. After profiling the current media landscape, we consider the implications of recent major studies on science communication for science education in the 21st century. We focus in particular on communicative patterns prominent in social media: algorithms to aggregate news, filter bubbles, echo chambers, spirals of silence, false‐consensus effects, fake news, and intentional disinformation. We claim that media literacy is now essential to a complete view of the NOS, or “Whole Science.” We portray that new content as an extension of viewing science as a system of specialized experts, with mutual epistemic dependence, and the social and communicative practices that establish trust and credibility.","[{""name"": ""Dietmar Höttecke"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education, Physics Education Group University of Hamburg Hamburg Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Douglas Allchin"", ""affiliation"": [""Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science University of Minnesota Minneapolis Minnesota""]}]","[""10.1086/392732"", ""10.1002/sce.20026"", ""10.1002/sce.20432"", ""10.1525/abt.2012.74.4.17"", ""10.1525/abt.2012.74.5.17"", ""10.1525/abt.2012.74.9.13"", ""10.1002/sce.21019"", ""10.1525/abt.2013.75.2.16"", ""10.1525/abt.2015.77.4.12"", ""10.1525/abt.2018.80.8.631"", ""10.1080/17524032.2015.1084015"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-92437-3_1"", ""10.1023/A:1008712616090"", ""10.1177/053901847501400602"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511978586"", ""10.1093/ct/qty001"", ""10.1073/pnas.1212744110"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.11.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-91562-3_3"", ""10.3726/b13293"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226113623.001.0001"", ""10.1525/bio.2011.61.3.8"", ""10.1177/0267323198013001001"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199566600.003.0010"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.806"", ""10.1177/016224399502000402"", ""10.1002/tea.21192"", ""10.1515/9781503620766"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.00220"", ""10.1111/bjso.12286"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511613517.016"", ""10.1002/tea.3660310915"", ""10.1093/0198238207.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0195138791.001.0001"", ""10.1080/1461670X.2016.1150193"", ""10.2307/2026523"", ""10.2307/2027007"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.757"", ""10.1177/0093650211416646"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195300680.001.0001"", ""10.1080/17524032.2017.1410198"", ""10.1163/9789087905071"", ""10.1007/978-94-6091-472-0"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226360492.001.0001"", ""10.1073/pnas.1805868115"", ""10.1073/pnas.1700175114"", ""10.1017/S1930297500005271"", ""10.1080/01596300500200169"", ""10.1002/sce.3730770208"", ""10.2307/2026796"", ""10.1163/9789401207355_003"", ""10.1002/sce.1011"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199709)81:5<515::AID-SCE2>3.0.CO;2-D"", ""10.1177/0002716214554758"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.1177/0956797612457686"", ""10.1515/9780691209753"", ""10.2307/3340510"", ""10.36198/9783838540047"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-17738-6"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-2457-0_1"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1976.tb01374.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11483.001.0001"", ""10.4159/9780674977860"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-92437-3_3"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175"", ""10.1007/s11191-012-9475-3"", ""10.1002/sce.3730790206"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199704)81:2<239::AID-SCE7>3.0.CO;2-G"", ""10.1177/09636625030122001"", ""10.1787/9789264255425-en"", ""10.1126/science.1103618"", ""10.1080/095006999290723"", ""10.1007/s11422-015-9709-1"", ""10.1038/4591055a"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195067712.001.0001"", ""10.1080/03057260108560166"", ""10.1002/tea.20042"", ""10.3998/mjs.12333712.0005.102"", ""10.1093/poq/nfq073"", ""10.1093/ijpor/eds022"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-16058-6"", ""10.1080/17512786.2012.691351"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226148847.001.0001"", ""10.1080/17524032.2017.1289108"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.03.003"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6296.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11616-017-0378-9"", ""10.1111/soc4.12404"", ""10.1126/science.aap9559"", ""10.1080/17524032.2017.1394893"", ""10.5771/9783748926672"", ""10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/304"", ""10.1177/107769905002700403"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1pncnrh"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1159-4_14"", ""10.5771/9783748926672-196"", ""10.1002/sce.20048"", ""10.1002/sce.10025"", ""10.1007/s11191-007-9125-3"", ""10.1088/0963-6625/10/1/303"", ""10.1017/9781108569149""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Neuromorphic computing, which takes inspiration from the highly parallel, low‐power, high‐speed, and noise‐tolerant computing capabilities of the brain, may provide such a shift. Many researchers from across academia and industry have been studying materials, devices, circuits, and systems, to implement some of the functions of networks of neurons and synapses to develop neuromorphic computing platforms. These platforms are being designed using various hardware technologies, including the well‐established complementary metal‐oxide semiconductor (CMOS), and emerging memristive technologies such as SiOx‐based memristors. Herein, recent progress in CMOS, SiOx‐based memristive, and mixed CMOS‐memristive hardware for neuromorphic systems is highlighted. New and published results from various devices are provided that are developed to replicate selected functions of neurons, synapses, and simple spiking networks. It is shown that the CMOS and memristive devices are assembled in different neuromorphic learning platforms to perform simple cognitive tasks such as classification of spike rate‐based patterns or handwritten digits. Herein, it is envisioned that what is demonstrated is useful to the unconventional computing research community by providing insights into advances in neuromorphic hardware technologies.","[{""name"": ""Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Science and Engineering James Cook University  Townsville QLD 4811 Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Ying-Chen Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering The University of Texas at Austin  Austin TX 78712 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jason K.

10.1111/bjet.13158,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Promoting students' learning achievement and self-efficacy: A mobile chatbot approach for nursing training,"AbstractThe aims of nursing training include not only mastering skills but also fostering the competence to make decisions for problem solving. In prenatal education, cultivating nurses' knowledge and competence of vaccine administration is a crucial issue for protecting pregnant women and newborns from infection. Therefore, obstetric vaccination knowledge has become a basic and essential training program for nursing students. However, most of these training programs are given via the lecture‐based teaching approach with skills practice, providing students with few opportunities to think deeply about the relevant issues owing to the lack of interaction and context. This could have a negative impact on their learning effectiveness and clinical judgment. To address this problem, a mobile chatbot‐based learning approach is proposed in this study to enable students to learn and think deeply in the contexts of handling obstetric vaccine cases via interacting with the chatbot. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was implemented. Two classes of 36 students from a university in northern Taiwan were recruited as participants. One class was the experimental group learning with the proposed approach, while the other class was the control group learning with the conventional approach (ie, giving lectures to explain the instructional content and training cases). The results indicate that applying a mobile chatbot for learning can enhance nursing students' learning achievement and self‐efficacy. In addition, based on the analysis of the interview results, students generally believed that learning through the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self‐efficacy as well as their learning engagement and performance. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Issues relevant to AI technology in education have been extensively discussed and explored around the world. Among the various AI systems, the potential of chatbots has been highlighted by researchers owing to the user‐friendly interface developed using the natural language processing (NLP) technology. Few studies using AI chatbots in professional training have been conducted. What this paper adds In this study, a mobile chatbot was used in a nursing training program to enhance students' learning achievement and self‐efficacy for handling vaccine cases. The mobile chatbot significantly improved the students' learning achievement and self‐efficacy in comparison with the conventional learning approach in the vaccine training program. From the interview results, it was found that the students generally believed that the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self‐efficacy as well as learning engagement and performances in the vaccine training program. Implications for practice and/or policy Mobile chatbots have great potential for professional training owing to their convenient and user‐friendly features. It would be worth applying mobile chatbots as well as other NLP‐based applications to other professional training programs in the future.","[{""name"": ""Ching‐Yi Chang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Nursing College of Nursing Taipei Medical University  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Gwo‐Jen Hwang"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate Institute of Digital Learning and Education National Taiwan University of Science and Technology  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Meei‐Ling Gau"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Midwifery and Women Health Care National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences  Taipei Taiwan""]}]","[""10.11591/eei.v8i4.1432"", ""10.33902/JPSP.2020261309"", ""10.1609/aimag.v35i4.2513"", ""10.3390/ijerph17093185"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.05.013"", ""10.1111/jems.12259"", ""10.1016/j.inffus.2019.12.012"", ""10.1109/TLT.2017.2682084"", ""10.1016/j.arth.2018.02.067"", ""10.1007/s00500-020-04939-z"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100002"", ""10.1111/1468-5973.12319"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100004"", ""10.1007/s10586-018-2334-5"", ""10.1080/21645515.2018.1483809"", ""10.1177/0047239520934018"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2020.02.212"", ""10.14207/ejsd.2017.v6n4p353"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2017.05.007"", ""10.2152/jmi.66.24"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.02.016"", ""10.1111/bjet.12247"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.09.052"", ""10.1016/j.ajic.2018.08.011"", ""10.21276/ijircst.2018.6.3.2"", ""10.1007/s10479-016-2342-x"", ""10.1111/bjet.12908"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113647"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-9439-3_4"", ""10.1016/j.jaci.2018.02.025"", ""10.1016/j.amjmed.2017.10.035"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.08.129"", ""10.1016/j.ajog.2010.08.050"", ""10.1016/j.jogc.2018.05.042"", ""10.1111/bjet.12755"", ""10.3390/su12083298"", ""10.2196/14658"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103862"", ""10.5539/elt.v10n4p22"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2019.1637025"", ""10.1145/3359272"", ""10.7459/ept/40.1.05"", ""10.3233/JIFS-169653"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2018.1436590""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1111/bjet.12993,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Multimodal data capabilities for learning: What can multimodal data tell us about learning?,"AbstractMost research on learning technology uses clickstreams and questionnaires as their primary source of quantitative data. This study presents the outcomes of a systematic literature review of empirical evidence on the capabilities of multimodal data (MMD) for human learning. This paper provides an overview of what and how MMD have been used to inform learning and in what contexts. A search resulted in 42 papers that were included in the analysis. The results of the review depict the capabilities of MMD for learning and the ongoing advances and implications that emerge from the employment of MMD to capture and improve learning. In particular, we identified the six main objectives (ie, behavioral trajectories, learning outcome, learning‐task performance, teacher support, engagement and student feedback) that the MMLA research has been focusing on. We also summarize the implications derived from the reviewed articles and frame them within six thematic areas. Finally, this review stresses that future research should consider developing a framework that would enable MMD capacities to be aligned with the research and learning design (LD). These MMD capacities could also be utilized on furthering theory and practice. Our findings set a baseline to support the adoption and democratization of MMD within future learning technology research and development. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Capturing and measuring learners’ engagement and behavior using MMD has been explored in recent years and exhibits great potential. There are documented challenges and opportunities associated with capturing, processing, analyzing and interpreting MMD to support human learning. MMD can provide insights into predicting learning engagement and performance as well as into supporting the process. What this paper adds Provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical evidence on MMD for human learning. Summarizes the insights MMD can give us about the learning outcomes and process.

10.1007/s11858-020-01216-z,ZDM-MATHEMATICS EDUCATION,0401 Education,Mathematics teacher learning to notice: a systematic review of studies of video-based programs,"AbstractTeacher noticing has become increasingly acknowledged as a fundamental aspect of teacher professional competence. Teacher education scholars have examined how the development of noticing might be supported both in initial teacher education and in professional development. In mathematics teacher education, several studies have explored the use of video as a supporting tool for teacher noticing. It remains unclear how this body of work builds on the various theoretical perspectives of noticing prevalent in the literature, thus broadening our understanding of noticing. Furthermore, the field has not examined systematically the extent to which research has leveraged the affordances of digital video technologies, and whether scholars have employed different research methods to answer questions that are critical to teacher educators. This survey paper reviews studies published in the last two decades on programs centered on mathematics teacher noticing that used video as a supporting tool for teacher learning. Thirty-five peer-reviewed papers written in English were identified and coded along three dimensions: (1) theoretical perspectives; (2) use of video technologies; and (3) research questions and methods. This review summarizes important findings and highlights several directions for future research. Most studies involved pre-service teachers, and only a few centered on in-service teachers. Developers of the large majority of programs took a cognitive psychological perspective and focused on the attending/perceiving and interpreting/reasoning facets of noticing. Few studies used video-based software and few studies used grouping, and even fewer used randomized grouping. Evidence of program effects on responding and decision making, and on instructional practice, is limited and should be extended in the future.","[{""name"": ""Rossella Santagata"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Johannes König"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thorsten Scheiner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ha Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ann-Kristin Adleff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xinrong Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gabriele Kaiser"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10857-009-9138-8"", ""10.1080/1046560X.2018.1423837"", ""10.1177/0022487114549072"", ""10.4135/9781071878644"", ""10.1080/1547688X.2015.1113350"", ""10.1111/ssm.12324"", ""10.1007/s13394-017-0228-0"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2015.06.001"", ""10.54870/1551-3440.1442"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2018.02.003"", ""10.1525/aa.1994.96.3.02a00100"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0727-y"", ""10.29333/ejmste/93421"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc.41.2.0169"", ""10.1007/s11528-018-0286-5"", ""10.1177/1475725716638010"", ""10.1007/s10763-015-9616-7"", ""10.1057/s41307-019-00139-z"", ""10.3102/0034654315626800"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0736-x"", ""10.1007/s10857-009-9133-0"", ""10.1007/s10649-017-9775-2"", ""10.4324/9780203471876"", ""10.1007/s10857-013-9257-0"", ""10.1080/13603116.2017.1420827"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2014.05.003"", ""10.1007/s10857-014-9294-3"", ""10.1080/00131881.2015.1117321"", ""10.30935/scimath/9508"", ""10.3102/0013189X029001004"", ""10.1007/s10857-015-9307-x"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0737-9"", ""10.1080/10508406.2018.1441030"", ""10.1007/s10857-013-9240-9"", ""10.1007/s11858-016-0771-2"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01202-5"", ""10.3102/0002831214531321"", ""10.4324/9780203832714"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2003.08.001"", ""10.1177/0022487108328155"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-102803"", ""10.1007/s11858-016-0775-y"", ""10.1007/s10857-007-9063-7"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.jmathb.2018.11.002"", ""10.29333/ejmste/92020"", ""10.1080/07370008.2017.1317125"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2006.11.005"", ""10.1007/s10857-014-9289-0"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01145-x""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1186/s40594-020-00219-2,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Factors influencing participation of underrepresented students in STEM fields: matched mentors and mindsets,"Abstract Background Women and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The goal of this pilot study is to better understand the beliefs and experiences of underrepresented US students pursuing STEM. Our focus was to gain insights into their mentorship experiences and preferences regarding having mentors who are gender and ethnicity matched. Environmental and psychological factors associated with participants’ decision to pursue STEM, such as family influences, academic mindsets, and attitudes towards STEM, were also studied. Methods We developed a survey tool based on published literature and established instruments, including measures of STEM belonging, science identity, and growth mindset, as well as measures assessing students’ views on their STEM participation. We surveyed members of a STEM-focused non-profit who were in college, graduate school, or were recent graduates. Results Forty-eight adults currently pursuing STEM responded to the survey. The majority (71%) were female and nearly all (96%) identified as an ethnic minority. Most reported knowing someone of their same gender (68%) or ethnicity (66%) with a STEM career who served as a role model. The majority (54%) stated that meeting a STEM professional of their own gender and ethnicity would be effective encouragement to pursue STEM. A similar percentage (56%) believed that media exposure to gender- and ethnicity-matched STEM professionals would be effective encouragement. Most (73%) demonstrated a growth mindset and had strong family support to pursue STEM (68%). Only two-thirds (66%) felt they belonged in STEM careers, and 30% agreed that people in their STEM classes are a lot like them. Conclusion This study contributes additional information on the views and experiences of diverse students actively pursuing STEM. Most participants indicated the importance of meeting and being mentored in STEM by those of their same gender and ethnicity, either in person or through media. Future educational efforts to increase STEM diversity should consider students’ mentorship preferences and facilitate interactions with matched-background mentors accordingly, with consideration given to the use of media. Educators should focus on inclusive learning by highlighting the accomplishments of diverse STEM professionals, to help strengthen feelings of STEM belonging.","[{""name"": ""Katherine Kricorian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michelle Seu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Lopez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elsie Ureta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ozlem Equils"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1126/science.aah6524"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01717.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1613117114"", ""10.1002/sce.21499"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.05.022"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01535"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0149-9"", ""10.1126/science.1261375"", ""10.1177/0361684317720186"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.100307"", ""10.3389/fdigh.2018.00022"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02264"", ""10.1002/tea.21417"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0115-6"", ""10.1177/1745691615599383"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0139-y"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00716"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0140-5"", ""10.1177/0963721413512856"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.92.1.82"", ""10.1038/nj7430-125a"", ""10.1186/s40594-016-0043-2""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Safety Research']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1007/s40979-021-00070-0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY,0401 Education,Contract cheating by STEM students through a file sharing website: a Covid-19 pandemic perspective,"AbstractStudents are using file sharing sites to breach academic integrity in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper analyses the use of one such site, Chegg, which offers “homework help” and other academic services to students. Chegg is often presented as a file sharing site in the academic literature, but that is just one of many ways in which it can be used. As this paper demonstrates, Chegg can and is used for contract cheating This is despite the apparent existence of an Honour Code on Chegg which asks students not to breach academic integrity. With pandemic led safety considerations leading to increased online teaching and assessment, the paper analyses data relating to how Chegg is used by students in five STEM subjects, namely Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry. The results show that students are using Chegg to request exam style questions. They demonstrate that contract cheating requests can be put live and answered within the short duration of an examination. The number of student requests posted for these five subjects increased by 196.25% comparing the time period April 2019 to August 2019 with the period April 2020 to August 2020. This increase corresponds with the time when many courses moved to be delivered and assessed online. The growing number of requests indicates that students are using Chegg for assessment and exam help frequently and in a way that is not considered permissible by universities. The paper concludes by recommending that academic institutions put interventions in place to minimise the risk to educational standards posed by sites such as Chegg, particularly since increased online teaching and assessment may continue after the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Lancaster"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Codrin Cotarlan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.010"", ""10.1080/03075079.2018.1462788"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00546"", ""10.1007/s10805-020-09381-2"", ""10.1007/s40979-017-0024-3"", ""10.1119/1.3566032"", ""10.1119/1.3578424"", ""10.9743/JEO.2009.1.5"", ""10.1007/s10805-019-09357-x"", ""10.1007/s40979-020-00053-7"", ""10.1109/CISIS.2014.9"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_55"", ""10.1007/s40979-017-0021-6"", ""10.1080/03055698.2014.889597"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1730313""]",['Social Sciences'],['Safety Research'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003109,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Re-visioning Academic Medicine Through a Constructionist Lens,"Constructionism in academic medicine matters. It encourages educators and researchers to question taken-for-granted assumptions, paying close attention to socially and historically contingent meanings. In this Invited Commentary, the authors explain what constructionism is; examine its ontological, epistemological, and axiological underpinnings; and outline its common methodologies and methods. Although constructivism favors the individual, constructionism privileges the social as the controlling force behind the construction of meaning. Where micro-constructionism attends to the minutiae of language, macro-constructionism focuses on broader discourses reproduced through material and social practices and structures. While social constructionists might situate themselves at any point on the relativist–realist continuum, many constructionists focus on constructionism as epistemology (the nature of knowledge) rather than ontology (the nature of reality). From an epistemological standpoint, constructionism asserts that how we come to know the world is constructed through social interaction. Constructionism thus values language, dialogue, and context, in addition to internal coherence between epistemology, methodology, and methods. Constructionism similarly values the concepts of dependability, authenticity, credibility, confirmability, reflexivity, and transferability. It also embraces the researcher–researched relationship. Given the privileging of language, qualitative methodologies and methods are key in constructionism, with constructionist-type questions focusing on how people speak. Here, the authors encourage the reader to develop an understanding of constructionism to re-vision academic medicine through a constructionist lens.","[{""name"": ""Charlotte E.

Design Retrospective observational study. Setting This study was conducted among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Brazil. Participants We analysed all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with available vaccination information captured in Brazil’s national electronic respiratory infection data system between 1 January 2020 and 23 June 2020. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were age-specific mortality rates of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with and without recent inactivated trivalent influenza vaccination. Results A total of 53 752 clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases were analysed. Controlling for health facility of treatment, comorbidities as well as an extensive range of sociodemographic factors, patients who received a recent influenza vaccine experienced on average 7% lower odds of needing intensive care treatment (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98), 17% lower odds of requiring invasive respiratory support (95% CI 0.77 to 0.88) and 16% lower odds of death (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90). Protective effects were larger when the vaccine was administered after onset of symptoms as well as among younger patients. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 with recent inactivated influenza vaccination experience significantly better health outcomes than non-vaccinated patients in Brazil. Beneficial off-target effects of influenza vaccination through trained innate immune responses seem plausible and need to be further explored. Large-scale promotion of influenza vaccines seems advisable, especially in populations at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease progression.","[{""name"": ""Günther Fink"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland"", ""Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Basel-Stadt, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Nina Orlova-Fink"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland"", ""Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Basel-Stadt, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Tobias Schindler"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland"", ""Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Basel-Stadt, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Sandra Grisi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Pediatrics, University of São Paulo Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Ana Paula S Ferrer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Pediatrics, University of São Paulo Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Claudia Daubenberger"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland"", ""Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Basel-Stadt, Switzerland""]}, {""name"": ""Alexandra Brentani"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Pediatrics, University of São Paulo Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil""]}]","[""10.1371/journal.pone.0170550"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.07.061"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3572814"", ""10.3389/fimmu.2017.01903"", ""10.1590/S0034-89102005000100017"", ""10.1186/s12879-018-3484-z"", ""10.1016/S2666-5247(20)30009-4"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.6266"", ""10.3201/eid2606.200299"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31052-7"", ""10.1101/2020.02.12.20022327"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7"", ""10.1002/jmv.25953"", ""10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.10.046"", ""10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6"", ""10.1016/j.chom.2011.04.006"", ""10.1126/science.aaf1098"", ""10.1038/ni.2961"", ""10.1016/j.smim.2018.06.002"", ""10.1136/bmj.i5170"", ""10.1093/infdis/jiv332"", ""10.1093/infdis/jiu573"", ""10.1371/journal.ppat.1000138"", ""10.1126/science.1093616"", ""10.3389/fimmu.2018.00245"", ""10.4049/jimmunol.1801648"", ""10.1128/CVI.00357-07"", ""10.1101/2020.10.14.20212498"", ""10.1007/s40266-018-0597-4"", ""10.1186/s12979-019-0164-9"", ""10.1126/science.abc4262"", ""10.1093/cid/cis307"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(11)70295-X"", ""10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108378""]","['Immunology and Microbiology', 'Medicine']","['Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases']","[[('1001 基础医学', 0.7323), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.732), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7292), ('0710 生物学', 0.7287), ('0836 生物工程', 0.72)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1001 基础医学', 0.7385), ('0710 生物学', 0.7264)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13049,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,HoloLens and mobile augmented reality in medical and health science education: A randomised controlled trial,"AbstractDue to increasing demands in the amount of content to be learned within a medical and health sciences curriculum, there are benefits towards exploring options for new and effective delivery modes. Augmented reality technology has the potential to enhance learning in physiology and anatomy, where students require a three‐dimensional knowledge of human organ systems and structures. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of learning when an identical lesson was delivered through augmented reality using either the Microsoft HoloLens or a mobile handheld tablet device. Thirty‐eight pre‐clinical undergraduate participants completed a lesson detailing the physiology and anatomy of the brain. Pre‐ and post‐intervention tests were provided to evaluate acquired knowledge. After the activity, participants also completed a Likert‐style questionnaire to evaluate adverse health effects experienced and assess their perceptions of the module. There were no significant differences between test scores from lesson delivery in either the HoloLens or mobile‐based augmented reality. However, a significant increase was reported in dizziness when using the HoloLens (25% higher, n = 19, p = .04). No other adverse health effects, such as nausea, disorientation or fatigue were observed. Both modes were effective for learning, providing evidence to support educators and developers wishing to adopt an augmented reality method of delivery in health sciences and medicine.A video abstract of this article can be viewed at https://youtu.be/GSayCmopGZg Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Modern technology continues to disrupt the way we teach in higher education. Teaching through virtual and augmented reality has shown great benefit in enhancing learning and the student experience in health sciences and medicine. There is the potential for new and upcoming delivery modes to continue this trend, including the introduction of both mobile and head‐mounted display based augmented reality. What this study contributes Investigates the potential for augmented reality to be used as a teaching tool, and supports its implementation in tertiary education. Identifies that although slight dizziness was reported in some participants from using the HoloLens, this does not appear to impact learning or student perceptions of the technology. Presents the HoloLens and mobile‐based augmented reality as novel and evidence‐based methods of instruction in health sciences and medicine. Implications for practice and/or policy Augmented reality is an effective delivery mode which can enhance learning. Students consider augmented reality through both the HoloLens and mobile‐based devices to be enjoyable and engaging. This novel method of instruction is useful to supplement learning in a tertiary education programme.","[{""name"": ""Christian Moro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Charlotte Phelps"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Petrea Redmond"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zane Stromberga"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3109/01421591003680644"", ""10.1097/01.OPX.0000156307.95086.6"", ""10.1007/s00464-016-4800-6"", ""10.3390/info9020031"", ""10.1093/ehjci/jey184"", ""10.1007/s11548-020-02165-4"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02086"", ""10.1080/00131728609335764"", ""10.4304/jetwi.2.1.27-33"", ""10.21037/acs.2019.03.02"", ""10.1111/medu.13729"", ""10.1007/s11423-015-9374-9"", ""10.5858/arpa.2017-0189-OA"", ""10.1080/15424065.2016.1175987"", ""10.1167/8.3.33"", ""10.1126/science.aah5394"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-94941-0"", ""10.1016/S0141-9382(97)00011-5"", ""10.1007/S40037-013-0107-7"", ""10.5032/jae.2003.04022"", ""10.1001/jama.2017.20800"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103857"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2020.1737210"", ""10.5688/ajpe6505"", ""10.1097/PRS.0000000000005215"", ""10.1007/s40670-017-0384-6"", ""10.1152/advan.00074.2020"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-6106-7_118-1"", ""10.1002/ase.1696"", ""10.14742/ajet.3840"", ""10.31524/bkkmedj.2019.02.021"", ""10.1016/j.jocn.2016.09.002"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-0039-1.ch020"", ""10.1162/105474600566808"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00628a"", ""10.1007/s10278-018-0122-7"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.02.009"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-62855-6"", ""10.1111/eje.12492""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"
10.1186/s40594-020-00238-z,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Fostering computational thinking through educational robotics: a model for creative computational problem solving,"Abstract Background Educational robotics (ER) is increasingly used in classrooms to implement activities aimed at fostering the development of students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. Though previous works have proposed different models and frameworks to describe the underlying concepts of CT, very few have discussed how ER activities should be implemented in classrooms to effectively foster CT skill development. Particularly, there is a lack of operational frameworks, supporting teachers in the design, implementation, and assessment of ER activities aimed at CT skill development. The current study therefore presents a model that allows teachers to identify relevant CT concepts for different phases of ER activities and aims at helping them to appropriately plan instructional interventions. As an experimental validation, the proposed model was used to design and analyze an ER activity aimed at overcoming a problem that is often observed in classrooms: the trial-and-error loop, i.e., an over-investment in programming with respect to other tasks related to problem-solving. Results Two groups of primary school students participated in an ER activity using the educational robot Thymio. While one group completed the task without any imposed constraints, the other was subjected to an instructional intervention developed based on the proposed model. The results suggest that (i) a non-instructional approach for educational robotics activities (i.e., unlimited access to the programming interface) promotes a trial-and-error behavior; (ii) a scheduled blocking of the programming interface fosters cognitive processes related to problem understanding, idea generation, and solution formulation; (iii) progressively adjusting the blocking of the programming interface can help students in building a well-settled strategy to approach educational robotics problems and may represent an effective way to provide scaffolding. Conclusions The findings of this study provide initial evidence on the need for specific instructional interventions on ER activities, illustrating how teachers could use the proposed model to design ER activities aimed at CT skill development. However, future work should investigate whether teachers can effectively take advantage of the model for their teaching activities. Moreover, other intervention hypotheses have to be explored and tested in order to demonstrate a broader validity of the model.","[{""name"": ""Morgane Chevalier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Giang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alberto Piatti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francesco Mondada"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/0144929X.2011.630415"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2015.10.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527685"", ""10.1145/1929887.1929905"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.10.020"", ""10.1007/s10956-017-9719-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52691-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-26945-6"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.06.005"", ""10.1016/S0747-5632(01)00018-8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.04.013"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-18141-3_8"", ""10.1109/TE.2019.2912351"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9702-x"", ""10.5539/ies.v11n4p29"", ""10.1007/BF02400938"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.004"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9729-z"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.022"", ""10.3390/su10040905"", ""10.4018/ijgbl.2011070103"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2012.04.056"", ""10.2307/2529310"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9628-2"", ""10.1007/s41979-020-00030-2"", ""10.1109/45.464655"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-32552-1_79"", ""10.1109/MRA.2016.2636372"", ""10.20368/1971-8829/1628"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61425-0_24"", ""10.1145/1822090.1822126"", ""10.1111/1467-8691.00134"", ""10.1145/2700517"", ""10.1109/ARSO.2013.6705527"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27482-4_7"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0080-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52691-1_14"", ""10.4135/9781412983518"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.09.003"", ""10.1007/s10956-011-9307-2"", ""10.1007/s10956-015-9581-5"", ""10.1145/1118178.1118215""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Software', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.3390/educsci10110304,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Compassionate Flexibility and Self-Discipline: Student Adaptation to Emergency Remote Teaching in an Integrated Engineering Energy Course during COVID-19,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 brought about the transition to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) at higher education institutions across the United States, prompting both students and the faculty to rapidly adjust to a different modality of teaching and learning. Other crises have induced disruptions to academic continuity (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes), but not to the same extent as COVID-19, which has affected universities on a global scale. In this paper, we describe a qualitative case study where we interviewed 11 second-year Integrated Engineering students during the Spring 2020 semester to explore how they adapted to the transition to remote learning. Our results revealed several student challenges, how they used self-discipline strategies to overcome them, and how the faculty supported students in the classroom through a compassionate and flexible pedagogy. Faculty members showed compassion and flexibility by adjusting the curriculum and assessment and effectively communicating with students. This was especially important for the women participants in this study, who more frequently expressed utilizing pass/fail grading and the personal and gendered challenges they faced due to the pandemic. During this unprecedented crisis, we found that a key element for supporting students’ well-being and success is the faculty members communicating care and incorporating flexibility into their courses.","[{""name"": ""Laura A.

10.1108/ITSE-04-2023-0061,INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION,0401 Education,What drives students toward ChatGPT? An investigation of the factors influencing adoption and usage of ChatGPT,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors determining students’ attitude toward using newly emerged artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), for educational and learning purpose based on technology acceptance model. Design/methodology/approach The recommended model was empirically tested with partial least squares structural equation modeling using 375 student survey responses. Findings The study revealed that students have a favorable view of the instructional use of ChatGPT. Usefulness, social presence and legitimacy of the tool, as well as enjoyment and motivation, contribute to a favorable attitude toward using this tool in a learning environment. However, perceived ease of use was not found to be a significant determinant in the adoption and utilization of ChatGPT by the students. Practical implications This research is intended to benefit enterprises, academic institutions and the global community by offering light on how students perceive the ChatGPT service in an educational setting. Furthermore, the application enhances confidence and interest among learners, leading to improved literacy and general awareness. Eventually, the outcome of this research will help AI developers to improve their product and service delivery, as well as benefit regulators in regulating the usage of AI-based bots. Originality/value Due to its novelty, the current research on AI-based ChatGPT usage in the education sector is rather restricted. This study provides the adoption aspects of ChatGPT, a new AI-based technology for students, thereby contributing significantly to the existing research on the adoption of advanced education technologies. In addition, the literature lacks research on the adoption of ChatGPT by students for educational purposes; this study addresses this gap by identifying adoption determinants of ChatGPT in education.","[{""name"": ""Chandan Kumar Tiwari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohd.

10.1186/s12909-020-02306-y,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,The effectiveness of the combined problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning (CBL) teaching method in the clinical practical teaching of thyroid disease,"Abstract Background This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of PBL–CBL combined teaching in thyroid surgery and make observations from the students’ perspectives, based on their satisfaction with the learning process. Methods We prospectively enrolled 354 fourth-year students majoring in clinical medicine, along with 232 residents, from September 2014 to June 2019. These participants were randomly allocated into either the combined PBL–CBL teaching group or the traditional lecture-based classroom group to attend a course about thyroid nodules. Both pre- and post-class quizzes were conducted. An anonymous questionnaire was also administered to both groups to evaluate the students’ perceptions and experiences. We compared the two teaching methods among all the students as well as with the fourth-year students and residents in subgroups. Results The traditional group’s pre-class quiz scores were significantly higher than the PBL–CBL group’s (as determined by a two-tailed t-test at a 95% confidence interval, T = 16.483, P &lt; 0.001). After class, in the PBL–CBL group, the mean total quiz score and the basic knowledge and case analysis scores increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001). The PBL–CBL group’s performance improvement was significantly higher than the traditional group’s (increasing from 52.76 to 70.51 vs. from 67.03 to 71.97). Furthermore, the scores for learning motivation, understanding, student–teacher interaction, the final examination, communication skills, clinical thinking skills, self-learning skills, teamwork skills, and knowledge absorption, as measured by the survey, were significantly higher in the PBL–CBL group than in the traditional group (P &lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, the survey scores representing the amount of students’ free time the course consumed were significantly lower in the PBL–CBL group than in the traditional group (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions PBL combined with CBL may be an effective method for improving medical students’ and residents’ performance and enhancing their clinical skills.","[{""name"": ""Wanjun Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Linye He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wenyi Deng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jingqiang Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anping Su"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yong Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000786"", ""10.1097/00001888-199802000-00011"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2012.76.1.tb05240.x"", ""10.1080/01421590701316530"", ""10.1017/S1049096508080815"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2017.07.028"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2018.09.027"", ""10.1007/s12262-007-0016-2"", ""10.5271/sjweh.732"", ""10.1136/emj.2004.022707"", ""10.1097/00001888-199301000-00012"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-5-20"", ""10.1097/00001888-200003000-00017"", ""10.1034/j.1600-0579.2001.050301.x"", ""10.1093/ehr/114.458.1013"", ""10.1002/ase.1635"", ""10.1136/bmj.326.7386.437"", ""10.1111/eje.12486"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2004.68.10.tb03851.x"", ""10.1055/s-0038-1667042"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-1068-z"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318244759e"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181f52bed"", ""10.1197/j.aem.2006.09.052"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.680939"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2007.02732.x"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip4104_2"", ""10.1177/2382120519891178"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S155731"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1714-8""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Family Practice', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1017/S0261444821000057,LANGUAGE TEACHING,0401 Education,Investment Pad motivation in language learning: What's me difference?,"The year 2020 marked the 25th year since Bonny Norton published her influential TESOL Quarterly article, ‘Social identity, investment, and language learning’ (Norton Peirce, 1995) and the fifth year since we, Darvin and Norton (2015), co-authored ‘Identity and a model of investment in applied linguistics’ in the Annual Review of Applied Linguistics. From the time Norton's 1995 piece was published, investment and motivation have been conceptually imbricated and often collocated, as they hold up two different lenses to investigate the same reality: why learners choose to learn an additional language (L2). In our 2015 article, we made the case that while it is important to ask the question, ‘Are students motivated to learn a language?’ it is equally productive to ask, ‘Are students invested in the language practices of the classroom or community?’ (Darvin &amp; Norton, 2015, p. 37). We recognize that the relationship between language teachers and learners is unequal, and that teachers hold the power to shape these practices in diverse ways. Teachers bring to the classroom not only their personal histories and knowledge, but also their own worldviews and assumptions (Darvin, 2015), which may or may not align with those of learners. Relations of power between learners can also be unequal. As Norton and Toohey (2011, p. 421) note: A language learner may be highly motivated, but may nevertheless have little investment in the language practices of a given classroom or community, which may, for example, be racist, sexist, elitist, anti-immigrant, or homophobic. Alternatively, the language learner's conception of good language teaching may not be consistent with that of the teacher, compromising the learner's investment in the language practices of the classroom. Thus, the language learner, despite being highly motivated, may not be invested in the language practices of a given classroom.","[{""name"": ""Ron Darvin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bonny Norton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0261927X20966734"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9922.2012.00719.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-28380-3_4"", ""10.1017/S0261444811000309"", ""10.1515/applirev-2018-0119"", ""10.1002/tesq.235"", ""10.1515/9781503621749"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2007.00674.x"", ""10.1016/0346-251X(95)00005-5"", ""10.1177/053901847701600601"", ""10.21832/9781847691293-003"", ""10.4324/9780203830932"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190493028.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09588221.2010.538701"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-28380-3_12"", ""10.21832/9781847691293-012"", ""10.1017/S0267190514000191"", ""10.1017/S0267190514000051"", ""10.4324/9780429485893"", ""10.1016/j.system.2014.01.013"", ""10.1017/9781108333603.020"", ""10.21832/9781783090563"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-28380-3"", ""10.1016/j.system.2013.03.006"", ""10.1017/S0261444817000325"", ""10.1207/S15327701JLIE0204_1"", ""10.1093/applin/amy046"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-28380-3_11"", ""10.1002/RRQ.016"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.1998.tb05543.x"", ""10.21832/9781783090419"", ""10.1017/S026144480000700X"", ""10.4324/9781315181271"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-02344-1_18"", ""10.21832/9781847691293"", ""10.1016/j.system.2016.04.002"", ""10.1017/9781108333603"", ""10.1080/17439884.2014.942665"", ""10.1111/j.1467-1770.1976.tb00265.x"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.1515/jelf-2017-0014"", ""10.1075/ll.3.2.03jon"", ""10.1111/modl.12301"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02899-2_34"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-59900-1_35"", ""10.2307/3587803"", ""10.1111/modl.12368"", ""10.1016/j.system.2015.10.006"", ""10.21832/9781783091010"", ""10.1017/9781108333603.018""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

However, the current direct‐ink‐write (DIW) printing‐based fabrication of hmSAM parts and structures only permits programmable magnetic direction with a constant magnetic density. Also, the existing designs rely on the brute‐force approach to generate the assignment of magnetization direction distribution, which can only produce intuitional deformations. These two factors greatly limit the design space and the application potentials of hmSAMs. Herein, a “voxel‐encoding DIW printing” method to program both the magnetic density and direction distributions during hmSAM printing is introduced. The voxel‐encoding DIW printing is then integrated with an evolutionary algorithm (EA)‐based design strategy to achieve the desired magnetic actuation and motion with complex geometry variations and curvature distributions. With the new EA‐guided voxel‐encoding DIW printing technique, the functional hmSAMs that produce complicated shape morphing with desired curvature distributions for advanced applications such as biomimetic motions are demonstrated. These demonstrations indicate that the proposed EA‐guided voxel‐encoding DIW printing method significantly broadens the application potentials of hmSAMs.","[{""name"": ""Shuai Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering The Ohio State University  Columbus OH 43210 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Craig M.

In order to understand how to progress AI-related research and analysis, this critical review systematically searched top higher education journals for references to the term ‘artificial intelligence’. We reviewed definitions and conducted a discourse analysis of included texts. Our findings identify few, confusing definitions and little overt reference to AI as a research object. We delineated two Discourses. The Discourse of imperative change outlines how AI is seen as an inevitable change to which all must respond. Additionally, the Discourse of altering authority describes how texts position AI as decentring the teacher and spreading authority across staff, machines, corporations and students. Our analysis prompts a call for new research foci that attend to the social implications of AI, including tracing accountability in AI-mediated practices and exploring how AI influences learning and teaching relationships.","[{""name"": ""Margaret Bearman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juliana Ryan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rola Ajjawi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7551/mitpress/11456.001.0001"", ""10.1162/003355303322552801"", ""10.1080/0260293860110306"", ""10.1080/00131911.2021.1955830"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00218-x"", ""10.1080/13562517.2015.1020783"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41956-1_5"", ""10.1080/13562517.2018.1547276"", ""10.1080/13562517.2020.1825373"", ""10.1080/13562517.2019.1602762"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.04.002"", ""10.1002/9781118275825"", ""10.1177/1368431010362289"", ""10.4324/9781410609786-9"", ""10.4324/9780203850992"", ""10.4324/9781315819679"", ""10.3390/app11125467"", ""10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(02)00129-X"", ""10.1177/1741659020917434"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2019.100693"", ""10.1080/03085147.2020.1733842"", ""10.1007/s10734-019-00490-5"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104271"", ""10.1007/s11023-017-9417-6"", ""10.1080/0729436860050106"", ""10.1145/3375627.3375835"", ""10.1177/0306396818823172"", ""10.1080/13562517.2020.1734922"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1739013"", ""10.1080/13562517.2020.1748593"", ""10.1080/13562517.2020.1739641"", ""10.1080/0729436860050209"", ""10.1111/medu.14021"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1807493"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2020.09.151"", ""10.1080/01596306.2012.717195"", ""10.4324/9781315768656"", ""10.1080/13562517.2019.1689388"", ""10.1007/BF00991468"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100730"", ""10.1080/02602938.2019.1676396"", ""10.1080/13562517.2020.1748811"", ""10.1080/02602938.2014.881980"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Safety Research', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1186/s40594-020-0202-3,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Change theory and theory of change: what's the difference anyway?,"AbstractThis commentary focuses on the difference between a theory of change and change theory, as it relates to systemic change projects in STEM higher education. A theory of change is project-specific and related to evaluation. It makes the underlying rationale of a project explicit, which supports planning, implementation, and assessment of the project. In addition, a theory of change is often required by funding agencies as part of grant proposals. In contrast, change theories represent theoretical and empirically grounded knowledge about how change occurs that goes beyond any one project. Ideally, a theory of change is informed by change theories. This essay describes the connections between a theory of change and change theory and provides examples of how change theory can inform a project’s theory of change. Grounding projects in change theory allows change agents to draw on existing knowledge and to better contribute to our collective knowledge about how to achieve meaningful change in STEM higher education.","[{""name"": ""Daniel L.

10.1111/bjet.12991,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,The virtual field trip: Investigating how to optimize immersive virtual learning in climate change education,"AbstractImmersive Virtual Reality (IVR) is being used for educational virtual field trips (VFTs) involving scenarios that may be too difficult, dangerous or expensive to experience in real life. We implemented an immersive VFT within the investigation phase of an inquiry‐based learning (IBL) climate change intervention. Students investigated the consequences of climate change by virtually traveling to Greenland and exploring albedo and greenhouse effects first hand. A total of 102 seventh and eighth grade students were randomly assigned to one of two instructional conditions: (1) narrated pretraining followed by IVR exploration or (2) the same narrated training material integrated within the IVR exploration. Students in both conditions showed significant increases in declarative knowledge, self‐efficacy, interest, STEM intentions, outcome expectations and intentions to change behavior from the pre‐ to post‐assessment. However, there was a significant difference between conditions favoring the pretraining group on a transfer test consisting of an oral presentation to a fictitious UN panel. The findings suggest that educators can choose to present important prerequisite learning content before or during a VFT. However, adding pretraining may lead to better transfer test performance, presumably because it helps reduce cognitive load while learning in IVR. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic? Immersive virtual reality (IVR) simulations lead to higher presence but may lead to less learning when the content is not designed based on the affordances of the technology. One explanation for this finding is that cognitive load may be higher in IVR. The pretraining principle (ie, individuals learn more deeply from interactive multimodal learning environments when they receive pretraining on relevant prior knowledge) can be particularly effective in IVR‐based learning compared to learning through a video. Evidence shows that instructional design principles such as segmentation and generative learning strategies such as summarization can improve learning in IVR simulations. What this paper adds An investigation of the value of two different approaches to designing immersive virtual field trips (VFTs) within a real educational middle school context. Evidence that VFTs featuring IVR climate change simulations, in the context of inquiry‐based learning (IBL), can increase important variables such as declarative knowledge, interest in science and intentions to take climate action in seventh and eighth grade students. Evidence that presenting important learning content before a VFT leads to higher transfer scores. Implications for practice and/or policy Implementing an immersive VFT within the context of an IBL intervention provides students with relevant and engaging learning experiences and results in increased knowledge and interest in science. In the design of instruction using VFTs, educators can choose to either present prerequisite learning content prior to a VFT or during a VFT. However, adding pretraining has an advantage in terms of higher transfer scores.","[{""name"": ""Gustav B.

BACKGROUND The anxiety nursing students often experience during clinical rotations can affect their academic performance and interpersonal interactions. METHOD An integrative review was undertaken following guidelines by Whittemore and Knafl. The search was limited to articles published from 1999 to 2018 to increase the likelihood that they included the generations of students currently most prevalent in nursing programs, millennials and generation Z. RESULTS Most researchers (17 studies) supported their interventions as somewhat effective in reducing nursing student anxiety in the clinical setting. A number of limitations of the research were identified. CONCLUSION Various faculty-led and student-led interventions may reduce student anxiety in the clinical setting. Further rigorous research on this topic is needed to provide a strong evidence base for such interventions.","[{""name"": ""Amanda Cornine"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3928/01484834-20160114-05"", ""10.1097/NND.0b013e31829aedd4"", ""10.1097/00006223-200109000-00009"", ""10.3928/01484834-20050401-04"", ""10.1111/ijpp.12389"", ""10.1177/1049732302238251"", ""10.3928/0148-4834-20020901-11"", ""10.1097/NNE.0b013e31825a875a"", ""10.1111/ijn.12272"", ""10.3928/0148-4834-19870301-04"", ""10.3928/0148-4834-19880201-10"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2011.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2015.09.011"", ""10.1016/j.outlook.2016.10.002"", ""10.1001/jama.2014.9263"", ""10.1016/j.profnurs.2012.10.012"", ""10.3928/0148-4834-19901001-06"", ""10.1097/00006223-200411000-00010"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2016.11.002"", ""10.1097/NNE.0000000000000095"", ""10.1016/0020-7489(95)00047-X"", ""10.3928/01484834-20161011-08"", ""10.1016/j.hrtlng.2014.05.014"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03621.x"", ""10.1097/NNE.0000000000000376"", ""10.3928/01484834-20090828-05""]","['Health Professions', 'Nursing']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Research and Theory', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1011 护理学', 0.7465), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7157), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7101), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7061), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7035)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7393), ('0714 统计学', 0.7357)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

We aimed to assess perceptions of remote learning among pre-clinical medical students and subsequently to identify pros and cons of remote learning, as well as uncover gaps to address in ongoing curricular development.MethodsA survey was distributed to first- and second-year medical students at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine in March 2020. Frequencies of responses to structured multiple-choice questions were compared regarding impacts of remote learning on quality of instruction and ability to participate, value of various remote learning resources, living environment, and preparedness for subsequent stages of training. Responses to open-ended questions about strengths and weaknesses of the remote curriculum and overall reflections were coded for thematic content.ResultsOf 268 students enrolled, 104 responded (53.7% of first-year students and 23.9% of second-year students). Overall, students felt that remote learning had negatively affected the quality of instruction and their ability to participate. Most (64.1%) preferred the flexibility of learning material at their own pace. Only 25.5% of respondents still felt connected to the medical school or classmates, and feelings of anxiety and isolation were noted negatives of remote learning. Most second-year students (56.7%) felt their preparation for the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 exam was negatively affected, and 43.3% felt unprepared to begin clerkships. In narrative responses, most students appreciated the increased flexibility of remote learning, but they also identified several deficits that still need to be addressed, including digital fatigue, decreased ability to participate, and lack of clinical skills, laboratory, and hands-on learning.ConclusionsVideocasted lectures uploaded in advance, electronic health record and telehealth training for students, and training for teaching faculty to increase technological fluency may be considered to optimize remote learning curricula.","[{""name"": ""Bita Shahrvini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sally L.

This study investigates the capabilities of various AI content detection tools in discerning human and AI-authored content. Fifteen paragraphs each from ChatGPT Models 3.5 and 4 on the topic of cooling towers in the engineering process and five human-witten control responses were generated for evaluation. AI content detection tools developed by OpenAI, Writer, Copyleaks, GPTZero, and CrossPlag were used to evaluate these paragraphs. Findings reveal that the AI detection tools were more accurate in identifying content generated by GPT 3.5 than GPT 4. However, when applied to human-written control responses, the tools exhibited inconsistencies, producing false positives and uncertain classifications. This study underscores the need for further development and refinement of AI content detection tools as AI-generated content becomes more sophisticated and harder to distinguish from human-written text.","[{""name"": ""Ahmed M.

Robots have long been perceived as machines made of metals that their sole purpose is to perform repetitive tasks in isolated environments. Herein, the recently developed soft pneumatic actuators and sensors that are fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques and in which the fluid used for actuation and sensing is mainly or solely air are focused upon. This review presents the soft pneumatic actuators and sensors in terms of their types, materials, fabrication techniques, capabilities, and applications. Also, it offers a discussion on the presented 3D‐printable soft actuators and sensors along with a list of what is needed to develop robust and functional soft actuators and sensors for soft robots and how such robots will evolve in the future. This article is expected to stimulate more interaction between materials scientists and robotic researchers to synthesize soft and functional materials that meet application, function, and user requirements, in a way to implement a top‐down approach to shorten the path between science and application of soft smart materials and their use in establishing functional soft robotic systems.","[{""name"": ""Charbel Tawk"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical, Materials, Mechatronic and Biomedical Engineering Applied Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering Research (AMBER)

However, the most important hurdle to progress in their development is the so‐called cycle‐to‐cycle variability, which is inherently rooted in the resistive switching mechanism behind the operational principle of these devices. In order to achieve the whole picture, variability must be assessed from different viewpoints going from the experimental characterization to the adequation of modeling and simulation techniques. Herein, special emphasis is put on the modeling part because the accurate representation of the phenomenon is critical for circuit designers. In this respect, a number of approaches are used to the date: stochastic, behavioral, mesoscopic..., each of them covering particular aspects of the electron and ion transport mechanisms occurring within the switching material. These subjects are dealt with in this review, with the aim of presenting the most recent advancements in the treatment of variability in resistive memories.","[{""name"": ""Juan B.

However, recent studies continue to demonstrate a lack of usage on the part of teaching staff for developing their teaching practices, especially at the university level. Through the identification of personal, professional, institutional, and contextual barriers, this study seeks to reveal the reasons why teachers in institutions of higher education do not use digital technologies for teaching purposes and whether the academic discipline influences this perception. The results suggest that professional barriers are the most prevalent and that the discipline of arts and humanities is where the most obstacles are perceived. In conclusion, there is a need for better professional development for teachers and more institutional involvement through strategic plans.","[{""name"": ""Cristina Mercader"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joaquín Gairín"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.03.015"", ""10.18172/con.2767"", ""10.1007/s12528-013-9066-6"", ""10.5465/256603"", ""10.11591/ij-ict.v2i3.5285"", ""10.30935/cedtech/6211"", ""10.3916/C37-2011-02-00"", ""10.1007/BF02299597"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.039"", ""10.1080/13540602.2012.632271"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(85)90062-8"", ""10.28945/3512"", ""10.3916/C45-2015-12"", ""10.21556/edutec.2012.39.377"", ""10.17811/rifie.48.2.2019.167-174"", ""10.4995/redu.2017.7635"", ""10.1108/09699980610680171"", ""10.13042/Bordon.2017.51445"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00204.x"", ""10.1111/bjet.12051"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.015"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926"", ""10.32870/Ap.v9n1.922""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Most respondents experienced much higher workloads and stress than in face-to-face classes. Previous experience with Online Distance Learning (ODL) predicted positive faculty response. Less than half used a school-provided LMS, instead using a wide range of other technologies. Respondents said they learned the need for adaptability and good planning, emphasizing doing what it takes to serve their students. There was high variability in most answers, indicating that the experiences of individual teachers ranged widely between positive and negative. The researchers provide recommendations based on the findings, including the need for better ODL instructional design training as part of long-term professional development for faculty and remembering the importance of all student higher education experiences, many of which are beyond the scope of the actual classes.","[{""name"": ""Michael W.

Given the uncertainties of WVC educational quality and the challenge of shifting to an online environment, this study aimed to evaluate student satisfaction with the teaching quality of case-based discussion (CBD) sessions conducted through WVC.MethodsOne hundred sixty-two undergraduate medical students in pediatrics completed the reduced Students’ Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) survey with a five-point Likert scale over 5 weeks. The WVC CBD sessions were facilitated by 50 faculty members.Results82% of respondents were highly satisfied with the WVC CBD session’s teaching quality. The majority agreed that the sessions were intellectually challenging, that the instructors were dynamic, and encouraged students to participate. No statistically significant correlation was found between student satisfaction and technical issues (r = 0.037, p = 0.003).ConclusionsWVC teaching had an overall positive outcome on student satisfaction, and teaching quality relied on teaching, cognitive, and social presence rather than technology. However, technology remains an important platform that supports teachers’ educational activities. Thus, implementing a blended pediatric course to augment future course delivery is optimal.","[{""name"": ""Tarah H.

10.3390/educsci11070331,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,STEM vs. STEAM Education and Student Creativity: A Systematic Literature Review,"STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) is an educational approach that is now accompanied by the STEAM (STEM + Arts) variant. Both educational approaches seek to renew the scientific literacy of younger generations, and, with the inclusion of the arts, student creativity is described as a key skill that must receive special attention. A review is therefore presented here of empirical STEM and STEAM-based educational interventions so as to determine their potential to develop student creativity. A systematic search of papers over one decade, 2010–2020, found 14 didactic interventions on the Web of Science and Scopus databases for analysis within the review process. The analysis suggested that: (1) the interventions based both on STEM and STEAM have multiple and even contradictory forms, both in theory and in practice; (2) there appears to be a preference among researchers for the Likert-type test to evaluate creativity; and (3) both educational approaches show evidence of positive effects on student creativity. In the light of the principal findings, it was concluded that arguing for the implementation of STEAM education over STEM education, with a view to developing or promoting student creativity, is not in agreement with the evidence from the empirical studies.","[{""name"": ""David Aguilera"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Science Education, University of Granada, 18071 Granada, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Jairo Ortiz-Revilla"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Specific Didactics, University of Burgos, 09001 Burgos, Spain""]}]","[""10.1111/1467-8527.t01-1-00229"", ""10.5642/steam.20140102.15"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2016.1537a"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.2011.00109.x"", ""10.1007/s10798-014-9290-z"", ""10.5951/mathteacmiddscho.18.6.0324"", ""10.1186/s40594-016-0046-z"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.2012.00101.x"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2013.09.317"", ""10.1037/h0063487"", ""10.1080/13598139.2014.905247"", ""10.4324/9780203813096"", ""10.1037/h0048073"", ""10.1080/00223980.1953.9712897"", ""10.1080/10400419.2012.676974"", ""10.1080/10400419.2012.650092"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep3902_1"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9085-7_10"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2012.07.004"", ""10.1002/9780470712184"", ""10.14306/renhyd.18.3.114"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6738-6_60"", ""10.1145/3017680.3017763"", ""10.1145/3159450.3159523"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2018.09.001"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1340/1/012038"", ""10.3390/educsci10030070"", ""10.18421/TEM94-42"", ""10.1186/s40561-020-00132-9"", ""10.1080/10400419.2018.1488195"", ""10.1002/jocb.77"", ""10.1007/s11191-020-00131-9"", ""10.1002/tea.21199"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9085-7""]",['Psychology'],['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003427,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Assessing Trainees and Making Entrustment Decisions: On the Nature and Use of Entrustment-Supervision Scales,"Clinical teachers are continuously entrusting trainees with care responsibilities in health care settings. Entrustable professional activities employ entrustment decision making as an approach to assessment in the workplace. Various scales have been created to measure “entrustment,” all basically expressing the level or type of supervision a trainee requires for safe and high-quality care. However, some of these scales are only weakly related to the purpose of making decisions about the autonomy trainees will be granted. The authors aim to increase understanding about the nature, purpose, and practice of supervision scales aimed at entrustment. After arguing for entrustment as a component of workplace-based assessment, the distinction between ad hoc entrustment decisions (daily decisions in health care settings) and summative entrustment decisions (with a certifying nature) is clarified. Next, the noncontinuous nature of entrustment-supervision (ES) scales, as opposed to most workplace-based assessment scales, is explained. ES scales have ordinal, rather than interval, properties and focus on discrete decisions. Finally, some scales are retrospective (“how much supervision was provided?”), and others are prospective (“how much supervision will be needed in the near future?”). Although retrospective scales reflect observed behavior, prospective scales truly focus on entrustment and ask for more holistic judgment, as they include a broader evaluation and a risk estimation to enable a decision about increase of autonomy. The analysis concludes with a discussion about entrustment for unsupervised practice and supervision of others, as well as the program, context, and specialty specificity of scales.","[{""name"": ""Olle ten Cate"", ""affiliation"": [""O. ten Cateis professor of medical education and senior scientist, Center for Research and Development of Education, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Alan Schwartz"", ""affiliation"": [""A.

10.1007/s10734-020-00565-8,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Higher education contributing to local, national, and global development: new empirical and conceptual insights","AbstractHigher education offers the potential to support glonacal (global, national, and local) development. This study presents new empirical and conceptual insights into the ways in which higher education can help to achieve and exceed the outcomes enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals. Open-ended online surveys were used to learn how academics in Georgia and Kazakhstan view the contributions of universities to addressing self-identified development challenges; and how universities work with the government and the private sector for realising their glonacal development potential. While the study provides ample evidence on the national manifestations of the developmental role of universities, it also shows that limited academic freedom and institutional autonomy impede the full realisation of the potential of higher education. The assumptions underpinning the academics’ views on how higher education can support development are discussed in the light of an innovative framework of essentialist and anti-essentialist approaches. Juxtaposing the national with the global development missions of universities, the paper raises questions on the possibility of delinking higher education from the immediate human capital and modernisation needs of the nation-state and becoming concerned with the global, on promoting freedom to cultivate intellectual curiosity through education and research, and stimulating a more holistic imaginary of the developmental purposes of higher education.","[{""name"": ""Maia Chankseliani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ikboljon Qoraboyev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dilbar Gimranova"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315742793"", ""10.1057/s41307-017-0077-1"", ""10.1007/978-94-6209-230-3_10"", ""10.1086/670739"", ""10.1007/s11125-013-9274-x"", ""10.1002/psp.1932"", ""10.1080/03050068.2017.1293407"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2018.07.006"", ""10.1080/03057925.2020.1761294"", ""10.1177/1757743814567383"", ""10.1007/s10734-014-9769-2"", ""10.4324/9781315710624"", ""10.5539/ies.v13n1p42"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2015.09.004"", ""10.1023/A:1014699605875"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0035-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-19597-7"", ""10.4324/9780203850817"", ""10.1111/ejed.12237"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2014.12.003"", ""10.1080/21568235.2014.967794"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2014.11.005"", ""10.15252/embr.201949928"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-9475-5"", ""10.1596/31895"", ""10.4324/9780415249126-X012-1"", ""10.1080/0143659042000256887""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

Los objetivos son analizar la incidencia del contexto personal y familiar en la equidad digital, identificar el modelo de enseñanza recibido, y conocer su valoración y percepción sobre este modelo. La investigación obedece a un estudio mixto de alcance descriptivo en el que se combinan métodos cualitativos y cuantitativos. En primer lugar, se realizó un cuestionario a estudiantes de la Universidad de Extremadura (UEx) (n= 548) y a posteriori se efectuaron entrevistas online a miembros del equipo de gobierno de la universidad. Los resultados indican que los estudiantes procedentes de familias con un nivel formativo bajo tienen menos oportunidades de uso de tecnologías digitales. Las clases virtuales que han recibido han consistido esencialmente en presentaciones subidas al campus virtual con interacciones asíncronas. La valoración negativa que hacen de la enseñanza a distancia se explica por la inversa relación percibida entre dedicación al estudio y rendimiento académico y por falta de adaptación de los docentes a las circunstancias personales y académicas de los estudiantes. En conclusión, se determina que la universidad debe transitar hacia modelos más colaborativos y centrados en el estudiante.","[{""name"": ""Eva Pérez López"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alfonso Vázquez Atochero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Santiago Cambero Rivero"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

While most of these debates are about higher education in general, this article focuses on schoolteacher education and teacher training. This research aimed to determine the contribution of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT in lesson planning, critical thinking and openness in education. The research used a qualitative approach and document analysis following an interpretative paradigm. The findings reveal that generative language models such as ChatGPT can provide specific materials and support mechanisms, such as lesson plans, to schoolteachers and student teachers. It also showed that ChatGPT has levelled the playing field by opening access to lesson plans to all teachers. However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is crucial to approach these models with caution and critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases, understanding that they are tools to support teaching and learning and do not replace teachers. The study’s contribution lies in ChatGPT-generated lesson plans’ implications and the enhancement of critical thinking for teacher education, and it also underscores the need for further research to explore best practices for integrating ChatGPT in lesson planning.","[{""name"": ""Geesje van den Berg"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Curriculum and Instructional Studies, University of South Africa, Pretoria 0003, South Africa""]}, {""name"": ""Elize du Plessis"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Curriculum and Instructional Studies, University of South Africa, Pretoria 0003, South Africa""]}]","[""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.1097/01.NEP.0000000000001129"", ""10.1186/s40561-023-00237-x"", ""10.61414/jeti.v5i1.103"", ""10.47852/bonviewAIA3202820"", ""10.1002/hbe2.140"", ""10.5430/ijhe.v6n5p26"", ""10.1007/978-981-19-5037-7"", ""10.1126/science.adg7879""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Safety Research']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

When it comes to foreign language education, translanguaging advocates a view that the languages the learners already have should and can play a very positive role in learning additional languages. Moreover, the knowledge already acquired through the learners’ first and/or prior learned languages also plays an important role in foreign-language-medium education. This view is more than a pedagogic or theoretical perspective; it is a political stance, a decolonizing stance, that this article explores. It discusses the implications of the political naming of languages and critiques notions such as academic English.","[{""name"": ""Li Wei"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203968390"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139524599"", ""10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.149"", ""10.4324/9780429453113-6"", ""10.1057/9781137385765"", ""10.1080/15427587.2021.1935957"", ""10.21832/9781783098774-004"", ""10.1111/j.1467-1770.1966.tb00804.x"", ""10.1093/elt/ccab015"", ""10.1093/applin/amx039"", ""10.1080/13670050802153210""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

To gain a comprehensive understanding of AI applications in STEM education, this study conducted a systematic review to examine 63 empirical AI-STEM research from 2011 to 2021, grounded upon a general system theory (GST) framework. Results The results examined the major elements in the AI-STEM system as well as the effects of AI in STEM education. Six categories of AI applications were summarized and the results further showed the distribution relationships of the AI categories with other elements (i.e., information, subject, medium, environment) in AI-STEM. Moreover, the review revealed the educational and technological effects of AI in STEM education. Conclusions The application of AI technology in STEM education is confronted with the challenge of integrating diverse AI techniques in the complex STEM educational system.

Overall, the potential of AI technology for enhancing STEM education is fertile ground to be further explored together with studies aimed at investigating the integration of technology and educational system.","[{""name"": ""Weiqi Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fan Ouyang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.17577/IJERTV4IS030127"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10315-z"", ""10.1109/TLT.2014.2355831"", ""10.1109/TE.2010.2098442"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.2023890"", ""10.1007/s11257-019-09234-7"", ""10.1002/cae.21924"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aat5954"", ""10.1007/s11412-015-9217-z"", ""10.1007/s10956-020-09888-8"", ""10.1080/10508406.2014.954750"", ""10.3390/su11102833"", ""10.1007/s12008-020-00702-8"", ""10.3991/ijet.v16i05.20295"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0109-y"", ""10.1007/BF00694427"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988510"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.05.020"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10128-0"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.10.014"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010938"", ""10.1145/1163405.1163409"", ""10.1080/03081079.2014.1000642"", ""10.1007/s10758-021-09508-3"", ""10.1039/c5rp00144g"", ""10.1002/cae.21996"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.12377"", ""10.1002/cae.22043"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2003.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijis.2020.09.001"", ""10.1007/s10734-020-00560-z"", ""10.18608/jla.2019.62.3"", ""10.1111/jcal.12099"", ""10.1177/0735633117731872"", ""10.1109/TETC.2017.2701201"", ""10.3390/math9060584"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100001"", ""10.3991/ijet.v14i03.10105"", ""10.1007/s10462-022-10155-y"", ""10.1007/s12369-017-0430-y"", ""10.1007/s12369-017-0458-z"", ""10.3991/ijet.v16i17.18995"", ""10.1109/TLT.2016.2521372"", ""10.3390/systems2040541"", ""10.1177/0735633120921581"", ""10.1002/cae.21787"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.04.002"", ""10.1093/hcr/30.3.411"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2018.1485053"", ""10.1007/s10956-020-09871-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-00293-4_20"", ""10.14569/IJACSA.2017.080316"", ""10.3390/su9060899"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000004291"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1958348"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977679"", ""10.1109/TLT.2016.2612659"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2011.610931"", ""10.1007/s10956-020-09895-9"", ""10.1002/cae.22345"", ""10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090514"", ""10.3233/JAI-2010-0001"", ""10.1109/TE.2012.2222646"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097.t001"", ""10.3991/ijet.v14i20.10992"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-0819-7_17"", ""10.1109/TLT.2013.26"", ""10.1007/S10639-021-10682-1/FIGURES/10"", ""10.1007/s10956-011-9300-9"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100020"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-10925-9"", ""10.1111/bjet.12953"", ""10.1016/j.kjss.2018.07.017"", ""10.1007/s40593-016-0110-3"", ""10.4018/IJDET.2020010103"", ""10.1109/TE.2018.2876363"", ""10.1038/d41586-019-02213-3"", ""10.1111/jcal.12263"", ""10.14569/ijacsa.2019.0100501"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1875001"", ""10.1002/cae.22349"", ""10.1080/19345747.2021.1969710"", ""10.1109/TE.2020.3012744"", ""10.1093/bjps/I.2.134"", ""10.1080/09500693.2021.1874071"", ""10.1007/s40593-013-0001-9"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.08.003"", ""10.1007/s11162-015-9397-4"", ""10.1145/2601248.2601268"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1680391"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10774-y"", ""10.1002/cae.22158"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.16.020130"", ""10.3390/app9102078"", ""10.1007/s40593-020-00194-3"", ""10.1109/TLT.2016.2598167"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.020120"", ""10.1002/cae.22385"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3110475"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1016/j.infrared.2020.103211"", ""10.33225/jbse/18.17.711"", ""10.1177/1094428114562629""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Information Systems', 'Control and Systems Engineering', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13102,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Students' experience of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: A province-wide survey study,"AbstractOnline learning is currently adopted by educational institutions worldwide to provide students with ongoing education during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Even though online learning research has been advancing in uncovering student experiences in various settings (i.e., tertiary, adult, and professional education), very little progress has been achieved in understanding the experience of the K‐12 student population, especially when narrowed down to different school‐year segments (i.e., primary and secondary school students). This study explores how students at different stages of their K‐12 education reacted to the mandatory full‐time online learning during the COVID‐19 pandemic. For this purpose, we conducted a province‐wide survey study in which the online learning experience of 1,170,769 Chinese students was collected from the Guangdong Province of China. We performed cross‐tabulation and Chi‐square analysis to compare students’ online learning conditions, experiences, and expectations. Results from this survey study provide evidence that students’ online learning experiences are significantly different across school years. Foremost, policy implications were made to advise government authorises and schools on improving the delivery of online learning, and potential directions were identified for future research into K‐12 online learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Online learning has been widely adopted during the COVID‐19 pandemic to ensure the continuation of K‐12 education. Student success in K‐12 online education is substantially lower than in conventional schools. Students experienced various difficulties related to the delivery of online learning. What this paper adds Provide empirical evidence for the online learning experience of students in different school years. Identify the different needs of students in primary, middle, and high school. Identify the challenges of delivering online learning to students of different age. Implications for practice and/or policy Authority and schools need to provide sufficient technical support to students in online learning. The delivery of online learning needs to be customised for students in different school years.","[{""name"": ""Lixiang Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Learning Analytics at Monash, Faculty of Information Technology Monash University Clayton VIC Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Alexander Whitelock‐Wainwright"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Learning Analytics at Monash, Faculty of Information Technology Monash University Clayton VIC Australia"", ""Portfolio of the Deputy Vice‐Chancellor (Education) Monash University Melbourne VIC Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Quanlong Guan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science Jinan University Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Gangxin Wen"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Cyber Security Jinan University Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Dragan Gašević"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Learning Analytics at Monash, Faculty of Information Technology Monash University Clayton VIC Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Guanliang Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Learning Analytics at Monash, Faculty of Information Technology Monash University Clayton VIC Australia""]}]","[""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.03.013"", ""10.31940/soshum.v10i2.1316"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v4i2.149"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000024821"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.09.009"", ""10.1108/JIMA-09-2020-0301"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007"", ""10.24059/olj.v19i3.510"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.004"", ""10.9781/ijimai.2014.276"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2009.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.09.006"", ""10.1177/0002764213479362"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2013.06.002"", ""10.1080/08923647.2014.868739"", ""10.3402/rlt.v23.26507"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v15i1.1664"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.04.001"", ""10.1080/02680513.2012.678613"", ""10.1007/s11423-006-8252-x"", ""10.2307/1511063"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02247"", ""10.1080/08923648909526659"", ""10.1080/01587910500081269"", ""10.46328/ijtes.v4i4.167"", ""10.1080/01587910902845923"", ""10.1111/bjet.12592"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3638718"", ""10.1080/15391523.2006.10782468"", ""10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561329"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2003.11.003"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-394293-7.00004-2"", ""10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30084-0"", ""10.1080/01587919.2013.835779"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.049"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.04.010"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2020.1854337""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1007/s10649-020-09948-1,EDUCATIONAL STUDIES IN MATHEMATICS,0401 Education,Eye-tracking methodology in mathematics education research: A systematic literature review,"AbstractEye tracking is an increasingly popular method in mathematics education. While the technology has greatly evolved in recent years, there is a debate about the specific benefits that eye tracking offers and about the kinds of insights it may allow. The aim of this review is to contribute to this discussion by providing a comprehensive overview of the use of eye tracking in mathematics education research. We reviewed 161 eye-tracking studies published between 1921 and 2018 to assess what domains and topics were addressed, how the method was used, and how eye movements were related to mathematical thinking and learning. The results show that most studies were in the domain of numbers and arithmetic, but that a large variety of other areas of mathematics education research was investigated as well. We identify a need to report more methodological details in eye-tracking studies and to be more critical about how to gather, analyze, and interpret eye-tracking data. In conclusion, eye tracking seemed particularly beneficial for studying processes rather than outcomes, for revealing mental representations, and for assessing subconscious aspects of mathematical thinking.","[{""name"": ""Anselm R.

10.1007/s10758-020-09470-6,TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING,0401 Education,Covid-19 and Crisis-Promted Distance Education in Sweden,"AbstractThis study represents the first research effort to explore the transition from traditional teaching into distance teaching in Swedish schools enforced by covid-19. Governments made gradual and injudicious decisions to impede the spread of the pandemic (covid-19) in 2020. The enactment of new measures affected critical societal functions and included travel restrictions, closing of borders, school closures and lockdowns of entire countries worldwide. Social distancing became the new reality for many, and for many teachers and students, the school closure prompted a rapid transition from traditional to distance education. This study aims to capture the early stages of that transition. We distributed a questionnaire to teachers’ (n = 153) to gain insights into teacher and school preparedness, plans to deliver distance education, and teachers’ experience when making this transition. Results show that the school preparedness was mainly related to technical aspects, and that teachers lack pedagogical strategies needed in the emerging learning landscape of distance education. Findings reveal four distinct pedagogical activities central for distance education in a crisis, and many challenges faced during the transition. While preparedness to ensure continuity of education was halting, schools and teachers worked with tremendous effort to overcome the challenges. Results expand on previous findings on school closure during virus outbreaks and may in the short-term support teachers and school leaders in making informed decisions during the shift into distance education. The study may also inform the development of preparedness plans for schools, and offers a historical documentation.","[{""name"": ""Nina Bergdahl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jalal Nouri"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1101/2020.03.09.20033415"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103783"", ""10.33965/ict2019_201908L004"", ""10.1007/s12103-020-09547-z"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70176-8"", ""10.1145/3322276.3322319"", ""10.37062/sf.57.21539"", ""10.2759/94499"", ""10.1016/j.pmedr.2019.100871"", ""10.4324/9780203887332"", ""10.4324/9780203973820"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-11-73"", ""10.1007/978-94-6209-530-4_2"", ""10.2307/2804509"", ""10.1016/s0262-4079(20)30424-3"", ""10.1017/S1049023X00007044"", ""10.1542/peds.2005-1474"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103682"", ""10.4324/9780429288661"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30547-X"", ""10.4018/jea.2010070105""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000004291,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Artificial Intelligence in Undergraduate Medical Education: A Scoping Review,"Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing phenomenon poised to instigate large-scale changes in medicine. However, medical education has not kept pace with the rapid advancements of AI. Despite several calls to action, the adoption of teaching on AI in undergraduate medical education (UME) has been limited. This scoping review aims to identify gaps and key themes in the peer-reviewed literature on AI training in UME. Method The scoping review was informed by Arksey and O’Malley’s methodology. Seven electronic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles discussing the inclusion of AI in UME between January 2000 and July 2020. A total of 4,299 articles were independently screened by 3 co-investigators and 22 full-text articles were included. Data were extracted using a standardized checklist. Themes were identified using iterative thematic analysis. Results The literature addressed: (1) a need for an AI curriculum in UME, (2) recommendations for AI curricular content including machine learning literacy and AI ethics, (3) suggestions for curriculum delivery, (4) an emphasis on cultivating “uniquely human skills” such as empathy in response to AI-driven changes, and (5) challenges with introducing an AI curriculum in UME. However, there was considerable heterogeneity and poor consensus across studies regarding AI curricular content and delivery. Conclusions Despite the large volume of literature, there is little consensus on what and how to teach AI in UME. Further research is needed to address these discrepancies and create a standardized framework of competencies that can facilitate greater adoption and implementation of a standardized AI curriculum in UME.","[{""name"": ""Juehea Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year medical student, University of Toronto, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]}, {""name"": ""Annie Siyu Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""is a third-year medical student, University of Toronto, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]}, {""name"": ""David Li"", ""affiliation"": [""is a second-year medical student, University of Ottawa, Faculty of Medicine, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.""]}, {""name"": ""Kulamakan (Mahan) Kulasegaram"", ""affiliation"": [""is associate professor, Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Toronto and The Wilson Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]}]","[""10.1038/s41591-018-0300-7"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1001/jama.2015.18421"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1606181"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1799-6"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-0842-3"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002866"", ""10.1001/amajethics.2019.146"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002044"", ""10.1038/s41746-018-0061-1"", ""10.1080/1364557032000119616"", ""10.1186/1748-5908-5-69"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0759-1"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002175"", ""10.2196/19285"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2019.1595557"", ""10.1186/s13037-019-0188-2"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2019.1679361"", ""10.2196/16048"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002661"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2019.16.18"", ""10.1038/s41746-020-0294-7"", ""10.1016/j.ejvs.2020.02.030"", ""10.12669/pjms.36.5.3042"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1891-5"", ""10.1111/medu.13350"", ""10.1111/medu.14131"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30023-6"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0143703"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.0281"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001812"", ""10.1080/01421590600902976"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318253cad4"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182a45def""]",['Medicine'],"['Family Practice', 'Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"
10.1007/s40979-023-00146-z,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY,0401 Education,Testing of detection tools for AI-generated text,"AbstractRecent advances in generative pre-trained transformer large language models have emphasised the potential risks of unfair use of artificial intelligence (AI) generated content in an academic environment and intensified efforts in searching for solutions to detect such content. The paper examines the general functionality of detection tools for AI-generated text and evaluates them based on accuracy and error type analysis. Specifically, the study seeks to answer research questions about whether existing detection tools can reliably differentiate between human-written text and ChatGPT-generated text, and whether machine translation and content obfuscation techniques affect the detection of AI-generated text. The research covers 12 publicly available tools and two commercial systems (Turnitin and PlagiarismCheck) that are widely used in the academic setting. The researchers conclude that the available detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting AI-generated text. Furthermore, content obfuscation techniques significantly worsen the performance of tools. The study makes several significant contributions. First, it summarises up-to-date similar scientific and non-scientific efforts in the field. Second, it presents the result of one of the most comprehensive tests conducted so far, based on a rigorous research methodology, an original document set, and a broad coverage of tools. Third, it discusses the implications and drawbacks of using detection tools for AI-generated text in academic settings.","[{""name"": ""Debora Weber-Wulff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alla Anohina-Naumeca"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sonja Bjelobaba"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tomáš Foltýnek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jean Guerrero-Dib"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olumide Popoola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Petr Šigut"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lorna Waddington"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/bmjsem-2023-001568"", ""10.1145/3442188.3445922"", ""10.11118/978-80-7509-772-9-0009"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2302.03494"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2005.14165"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2304.04736"", ""10.1007/s40979-023-00140-5"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00192-4"", ""10.1007/s40979-023-00133-4"", ""10.1101/2022.12.23.521610"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2301.07597"", ""10.2307/378403"", ""10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.164/"", ""10.35542/osf.io/fnh48"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2303.13408"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2301.10416"", ""10.48550/arXiv.1301.3781"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2304.01487"", ""10.1109/5.880083t"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2304.05193""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02245-8,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Pre-graduation medical training including virtual reality during COVID-19 pandemic: a report on students' perception,"Abstract Background The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic brought significant disruption to in-hospital medical training. Virtual reality simulating the clinical environment has the potential to overcome this issue and can be particularly useful to supplement the traditional in-hospital medical training during the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital access is banned for medical students. The aim of this study was to assess medical students’ perception on fully online training including simulated clinical scenarios during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From May to July 2020 when in-hospital training was not possible, 122 students attending the sixth year of the course of Medicine and Surgery underwent online training sessions including an online platform with simulated clinical scenarios (Body Interact™) of 21 patient-based cases. Each session focused on one case, lasted 2 h and was divided into three different parts: introduction, virtual patient-based training, and debriefing. In the same period, adjunctive online training with formal presentation and discussion of clinical cases was also given. At the completion of training, a survey was performed, and students filled in a 12-item anonymous questionnaire on a voluntary basis to rate the training quality. Results were reported as percentages or with numeric ratings from 1 to 4. Due to the study design, no sample size was calculated. Results One hundred and fifteen students (94%) completed the questionnaire: 104 (90%) gave positive evaluation to virtual reality training and 107 (93%) appreciated the format in which online training was structured. The majority of participants considered the platform of virtual reality training realistic for the initial clinical assessment (77%), diagnostic activity (94%), and treatment options (81%). Furthermore, 97 (84%) considered the future use of this virtual reality training useful in addition to the apprenticeship at patient’s bedside. Finally, 32 (28%) participants found the online access difficult due to technical issues. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, online medical training including simulated clinical scenarios avoided training interruption and the majority of participant students gave a positive response on the perceived quality of this training modality. During this time frame, a non-negligible proportion of students experienced difficulties in online access to this virtual reality platform.","[{""name"": ""Roberto De Ponti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jacopo Marazzato"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea M.

10.1186/s40594-022-00344-0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Effects of digital game-based STEM education on students' learning achievement: a meta-analysis,"AbstractMany researchers have explored the impact of digital games on learning effects in different STEM subjects. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to examine the effect of digital game-based STEM education on the learning achievement of K-12 or higher education students. The analysis results of effect sizes from 33 studies (N = 3894) published from 2010 to 2020 showed that digital games contributed to a moderate overall effect size (ES = 0.667, 95% CI [0.520–0.814], p &lt; 0.001) when compared with other instructional methods. Furthermore, the study explored multiple moderator variables and their potential impacts on learning outcomes such as control treatment, subject discipline, educational level, game type, gaming platform, and intervention duration. The findings suggest that digital games are a promising pedagogical method in STEM education that effectively improves learning gains. Additionally, the study concludes with three recommendations for future research and practices on digital games in STEM education.","[{""name"": ""Liang-Hui Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bing Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gwo-Jen Hwang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jue-Qi Guan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yun-Qing Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10956-010-9257-0"", ""10.1007/s10956-013-9438-8"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100322"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01269.x"", ""10.2307/2533446"", ""10.1002/9780470743386"", ""10.1002/jrsm.12"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.07.003"", ""10.1080/09523987.2015.1005427"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09834-w"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3000659"", ""10.1111/bjet.12270"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09794-1"", ""10.3102/0034654318791584"", ""10.1111/bjet.12098"", ""10.1007/s11423-013-9323-4"", ""10.1007/s10956-013-9466-4"", ""10.1136/bmj.315.7109.629"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.031"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.08.010"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09787-0"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.06.005"", ""10.3102/0013189X005010003"", ""10.1007/s11423-007-9073-2"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.92.2.490"", ""10.1136/bmj.327.7414.557"", ""10.1002/tea.21661"", ""10.1007/s40692-014-0008-8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2012.01285.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.05.009"", ""10.1080/10494820.2015.1057747"", ""10.1145/2858036.2858515"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-09643-2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.007"", ""10.1007/s10639-017-9622-1"", ""10.1080/10494820.2016.1167744"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.10.040"", ""10.1186/2196-7822-1-1"", ""10.1007/s10956-013-9436-x"", ""10.1186/s40594-020-00207-6"", ""10.1080/10494820.2014.917109"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-102744"", ""10.4018/IJGBL.2017010103"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2010.02.007"", ""10.1186/2046-4053-4-1"", ""10.5897/ERR012.143"", ""10.1016/j.lab.2005.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.im.2014.08.008"", ""10.1080/03057267.2019.1722420"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638"", ""10.3390/su12176986"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2011.01190.x"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.305"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100332"", ""10.1111/jcal.12347"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.01.011"", ""10.1111/jcal.12430"", ""10.1186/s40594-020-00236-1"", ""10.1080/09588221.2019.1598444"", ""10.1037/a0031311"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-10008-2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.05.023"", ""10.33225/jbse/20.19.484"", ""10.1111/jcal.12422"", ""10.3102/0034654316628645""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Information Systems', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

Given the already rapidly growing AIEd literature base in higher education, now is the time to ensure that the field has a solid research and conceptual grounding. This review of reviews is the first comprehensive meta review to explore the scope and nature of AIEd in higher education (AIHEd) research, by synthesising secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews), indexed in the Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, EBSCOHost, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and ACM Digital Library, or captured through snowballing in OpenAlex, ResearchGate and Google Scholar. Reviews were included if they synthesised applications of AI solely in formal higher or continuing education, were published in English between 2018 and July 2023, were journal articles or full conference papers, and if they had a method section 66 publications were included for data extraction and synthesis in EPPI Reviewer, which were predominantly systematic reviews (66.7%), published by authors from North America (27.3%), conducted in teams (89.4%) in mostly domestic-only collaborations (71.2%). Findings show that these reviews mostly focused on AIHEd generally (47.0%) or Profiling and Prediction (28.8%) as thematic foci, however key findings indicated a predominance of the use of Adaptive Systems and Personalisation in higher education. Research gaps identified suggest a need for greater ethical, methodological, and contextual considerations within future research, alongside interdisciplinary approaches to AIHEd application. Suggestions are provided to guide future primary and secondary research.","[{""name"": ""Melissa Bond"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hassan Khosravi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maarten De Laat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nina Bergdahl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Violeta Negrea"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emily Oxley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Phuong Pham"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sin Wang Chong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""George Siemens"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3143035"", ""10.1007/s10758-019-09408-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-23233-6_2"", ""10.4018/IJICTE.20210701.oa3"", ""10.1007/s11528-023-00840-2"", ""10.3390/su151310723"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-0177-7"", ""10.1080/1364557032000119616"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2022.100489"", ""10.1007/s10734-022-00937-2"", ""10.1109/ieem44572.2019.8978798"", ""10.1111/bjet.12712"", ""10.14742/ajet.4363"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00282-x"", ""10.1111/bjet.12730"", ""10.1177/1049732312466295"", ""10.5281/zenodo.7755273"", ""10.2196/23933"", ""10.21240/mpaed/54/2023.12.20.X"", ""10.32593/jstmu/Vol5.Iss1.183"", ""10.1177/1521025120964920"", ""10.58459/rptel.2023.18002"", ""10.1515/applirev-2022-0190"", ""10.2196/31043"", ""10.2307/48647028"", ""10.1515/applirev-2022-0193"", ""10.14742/ajet.7526"", ""10.1016/j.ipm.2012.12.002"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00392-8"", ""10.1145/3160489.3160492"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11087-4"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00256-0"", ""10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637207"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2023.101258"", ""10.1007/s11257-011-9106-8"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-36949-5_16"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10741-7"", ""10.1007/s10758-022-09628-4"", ""10.5206/EEI.V31I1.14089"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025252"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-77943-6_11"", ""10.1038/s41559-020-1141-6"", ""10.1177/23821205211036836"", ""10.1057/s41599-023-01633-x"", ""10.20525/ijrbs.v12i4.2585"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1378"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0138237"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-78645-8_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-36272-9_54"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104700"", ""10.1145/3293881.3295783"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103724"", ""10.3390/educsci9010051"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0249423"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00239-1"", ""10.1080/10494820.2022.2086579"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09788-z"", ""10.22521/edupij.2023.123.2"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-12178-6"", ""10.59350/7ps3d-bzf63"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100074"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2021.09.012"", ""10.1016/j.infsof.2008.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.infsof.2010.03.006"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1131506"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.01.010"", ""10.1111/jcal.12412"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000004291"", ""10.3390/educsci12110781"", ""10.1136/bmj.b2700"", ""10.1177/0312896219877678"", ""10.3390/app9245569"", ""10.3390/educsci13040410"", ""10.9781/ijimai.2018.02.008"", ""10.23919/CISTI54924.2022.9820205"", ""10.1145/3415088.3415096"", ""10.1109/icabcd51485.2021.9519368"", ""10.1007/s11423-023-10195-3"", ""10.1145/3544548.3580658"", ""10.11613/BM.2012.031"", ""10.1136/bmj.b2535"", ""10.1186/2046-4053-4-1"", ""10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120213"", ""10.1787/5ee71f34-en"", ""10.1145/3377817.3377836"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-10925-9"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.1177/016264341402900404"", ""10.1186/s13643-021-01821-3"", ""10.11124/JBIES-20-00167"", ""10.1002/9780470754887"", ""10.55267/iadt.07.13227"", ""10.3102/0034654316631117"", ""10.1108/idd-10-2022-0099"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1097"", ""10.3390/su15043507"", ""10.1186/s13643-020-01542-z"", ""10.46932/sfjdv4n4-022"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.07.020"", ""10.1002/jdd.12856"", ""10.3390/educsci12080569"", ""10.1186/s41239-022-00326-w"", ""10.2196/19285"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11536-0"", ""10.1136/bmj.g7647"", ""10.1136/bmj.j4008"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104564"", ""10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005212"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1537"", ""10.11124/JBIES-20-00361"", ""10.1111/hir.12276"", ""10.3102/0034654310393361"", ""10.1186/s12874-021-01295-w"", ""10.7326/M18-0850"", ""10.1186/s13643-020-01324-7"", ""10.1007/s44163-022-00031-7"", ""10.3390/electronics10141611"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1798995"", ""10.1109/JAS.2023.123618"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1061778"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-27602-7"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100134"", ""10.1080/19345747.2023.2209079"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-12009-8"", ""10.1136/bmjgh-2022-009378"", ""10.1080/10494820.2022.2061006"", ""10.35940/ijrte.B1061.0782S319""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.3390/educsci10070188,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Studying During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Inductive Content Analysis of Nursing Students' Perceptions and Experiences,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest pandemic with a high rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Crises like these can harm the academic functioning and psychophysical health of nursing students. With this qualitative study, we aim to explore how students perceive the COVID-19 crisis and what their personal experiences were while studying during the global pandemic. In the study, data saturation was achieved after analyzing the reports of 33 undergraduate nursing students, using the inductive thematic saturation method. Data were collected using an online form, which students filled out, describing their perceptions and experiences. Qualitative inductive content analysis of students’ reports resulted in 29 codes, indicating different student perceptions of the efficiency of state institutions in crises. All students described the spread of misinformation on social networks and the risky behavior of the population. Most are afraid of infection and worried about the well-being of their family, so they constantly apply protective measures. Students recognize their responsibility to the community and the importance and risks of the nursing profession. They also describe negative experiences with public transportation and residence in the student dorm. The fear of possible infection in the classroom is not significant, however, students are afraid of the clinical settings. Thirteen students reported difficulty in concentrating and learning, while all students praised teacher support and faculty work in this crisis.","[{""name"": ""Robert Lovrić"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dental Medicine and Health Osijek, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, 31000 Osijek, Croatia""]}, {""name"": ""Nikolina Farčić"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dental Medicine and Health Osijek, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, 31000 Osijek, Croatia"", ""University Hospital Centre Osijek, 31000 Osijek, Croatia"", ""Faculty of Medicine, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, 31000 Osijek, Croatia""]}, {""name"": ""Štefica Mikšić"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dental Medicine and Health Osijek, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, 31000 Osijek, Croatia""]}, {""name"": ""Aleksandar Včev"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dental Medicine and Health Osijek, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, 31000 Osijek, Croatia"", ""University Hospital Centre Osijek, 31000 Osijek, Croatia"", ""Faculty of Medicine, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, 31000 Osijek, Croatia""]}]","[""10.3390/ijerph17062094"", ""10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217"", ""10.1002/jmv.25749"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30232-2"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2001737"", ""10.3946/kjme.2016.30"", ""10.1007/s10389-018-0917-5"", ""10.3844/ajidsp.2019.37.43"", ""10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005"", ""10.1111/jocn.13295"", ""10.1016/j.sjbs.2016.01.032"", ""10.15207/JKCS.2017.8.4.149"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30461-X"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x"", ""10.1080/02699938708408362"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-06606-0_4"", ""10.1177/106907279300100102"", ""10.1111/j.1466-7657.2012.01013.x"", ""10.1007/s10488-013-0528-y"", ""10.1016/j.npls.2016.01.001"", ""10.1007/s11135-017-0574-8"", ""10.1002/nur.4770180211"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2017.08.013"", ""10.1093/jtm/taaa020"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-10-413"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-14-1281"", ""10.1080/01421590400006572"", ""10.3121/cmr.2016.1303"", ""10.31887/DCNS.2002.4.3/tsteimer"", ""10.1101/2020.03.15.20036673"", ""10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30134-X"", ""10.21203/rs.3.rs-16836/v1"", ""10.1186/s12912-015-0065-y"", ""10.33160/yam.2018.03.001"", ""10.1017/dmp.2017.10"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8"", ""10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2010.11.001"", ""10.1097/NNE.0000000000000137"", ""10.1016/j.ajic.2008.04.253"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.03.006""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Economics and Econometrics', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

Soft robotics, which originates from interdisciplinary advances in materials, fabrication, and electronics, featuring better adaptability and safer interaction, holds great promises in addressing current technical challenges in MIS, which are difficult to be solved with current rigid robotic technologies. For the first time, herein, the expected characteristics of next‐generation MIS from the surgeons’ perspectives are analyzed and the recent progress of soft surgical instruments from three different aspects is comprehensively summarized: engineering design, fabrication techniques, and human–robot interaction. Perspectives of next‐generation soft surgical robots are then discussed, where some exciting possibilities are emphasized. It is believed that further developments of intelligent soft robotics enable the next‐generation MIS to agilely navigate to the target and conduct dexterous diagnostic or therapeutic procedures without any trade‐offs in invasiveness and ultimately be a propitious solution for future surgery.","[{""name"": ""Jiaqi Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology Huazhong University of Science and Technology  Wuhan 430074 P.

A systematic review and four recommendations for maximizing the effectiveness of role models in STEM,"AbstractIs exposing students to role models an effective tool for diversifying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)? So far, the evidence for this claim is mixed. Here, we set out to identify systematic sources of variability in STEM role models’ effects on student motivation: If we determinewhich role modelsare effective forwhich students, we will be in a better position to maximize role models’ impact as a tool for diversifying STEM. A systematic narrative review of the literature (55 articles) investigated the effects of role models on students’ STEM motivation as a function of several key features of the role models (their perceived competence, their perceived similarity to students, and the perceived attainability of their success) and the students (their gender, race/ethnicity, age, and identification with STEM). We conclude with four concrete recommendations for ensuring that STEM role models are motivating for students of all backgrounds and demographics—an important step toward diversifying STEM.","[{""name"": ""Jessica R.

10.1108/IJSHE-05-2019-0168,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Transformative learning in the field of sustainability: a systematic literature review (1999-2019),"Purpose This study aims to investigate how transformative learning has been conceptualised and operationalised in education for sustainable development (ESD) and sustainability learning and to collect evidence on how to support transformative learning in formal and non-formal environments. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a systematic literature review to provide a structured and replicable search and analysis of the relevant literature to produce a bibliometric overview that combines a quantitative description of the body of literature and qualitative analysis of the learning processes, outcomes and conditions. Findings The convergence between transformative learning and sustainability has become an emerging field of inquiry, despite the superficial use of transformative learning theory in many studies. By examining the learning process, outcomes and conditions in the core sample of studies, this study demonstrates that transformative learning theory – if carefully studied – can contribute to the design and implementation of educational interventions and assessments of learning towards sustainability. Furthermore, the sustainability context provides an empirical grounding that highlights the fact that social learning, the role of experience and the development of sustainability competencies are inherently part of transformative learning. Originality/value To date, few attempts have been made to better understand how transformative learning theory has been used in sustainability learning and ESD research. This systematic review allows for a better comprehension of how concepts and mechanisms elucidated in transformative learning theory are operationalised in sustainability learning and ESD research and serves as a source of inspiration for those researchers and practitioners who aims to make sustainability education, teaching and learning more transformative.","[{""name"": ""Jorge Gustavo Rodríguez Aboytes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthias Barth"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13504622.2015.1135418"", ""10.14512/gaia.26.4.15"", ""10.1007/s11159-017-9687-5"", ""10.1007/s11625-012-0181-5"", ""10.1515/jtes-2016-0004"", ""10.1080/02614367.2014.962585"", ""10.3390/su5125347"", ""10.3390/su5041725"", ""10.1504/IJISD.2015.071858"", ""10.1108/SRJ-07-2018-0164"", ""10.1177/0973408213495599"", ""10.7227/JACE.20.1.8"", ""10.1080/13538322.2014.904587"", ""10.1080/09669582.2010.542246"", ""10.1108/SAMPJ-05-2018-0152"", ""10.1002/ace.97"", ""10.1017/aee.2015.51"", ""10.1177/1541344617753071"", ""10.1142/S1464333203001401"", ""10.1080/09640568.2011.645718"", ""10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.11.057"", ""10.1080/13504622.2014.966657"", ""10.1007/s13280-014-0582-z"", ""10.1080/13504622.2015.1027883"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.04.118"", ""10.1080/0141192980240508"", ""10.1002/hrdq.20033"", ""10.1177/1541344605275099"", ""10.1080/15427587.2011.545766"", ""10.1080/02660830.2016.1155849"", ""10.2478/v10099-009-0002-9"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.047"", ""10.1080/713611442"", ""10.1007/s10460-009-9233-6"", ""10.1177/1541344608322678"", ""10.1108/02630801311304422"", ""10.5465/amle.2005.17268566"", ""10.2478/v10099-009-0051-0"", ""10.1177/0741713603260276"", ""10.1177/1541344618786452"", ""10.1177/1541344618796997"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.02.002"", ""10.1007/978-94-6300-797-9_7"", ""10.1177/1534484315622735"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.08.012"", ""10.1177/074171367802800202"", ""10.1177/0001848191041003004"", ""10.1177/074171369404400403"", ""10.1002/ace.7401"", ""10.1177/074171369804800305"", ""10.1177/1541344603252172"", ""10.1080/13504622.2016.1226266"", ""10.1080/02601370.2016.1174746"", ""10.1017/aee.2017.22"", ""10.1080/03098265.2015.1038701"", ""10.1007/s10798-012-9213-9"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.395"", ""10.37801/ajad2019.16.2.6"", ""10.1177/0741713616640881"", ""10.1080/15313220.2010.525968"", ""10.1016/j.cpa.2015.05.008"", ""10.1080/14615517.2012.736761"", ""10.1080/09640568.2016.1165188"", ""10.1177/0741713607309802"", ""10.1111/1477-8947.12012"", ""10.1108/14676370810842193"", ""10.1177/1541344607310576"", ""10.1017/S0376892911000270"", ""10.1177/1541344618784375"", ""10.1177/1541344614540335"", ""10.1177/074171369704800104"", ""10.1002/ace.301"", ""10.1177/1541344610385753"", ""10.1007/s10755-007-9055-7"", ""10.3390/su6052893"", ""10.1017/aee.2013.21"", ""10.1016/j.eiar.2013.10.003"", ""10.1080/13504622.2019.1677858"", ""10.1177/1541344617696970"", ""10.1007/s11625-011-0132-6"", ""10.1504/IJISD.2015.071857"", ""10.1080/2005615X.2019.1615244"", ""10.1108/ET-04-2014-0041""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Education']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

This study aims to explore the factors driving students' acceptance of ChatGPT in higher education. The study employs the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) theoretical model, with an extension of Personal innovativeness, to verify the Behavioral intention and Use behavior of ChatGPT by students. The study uses data from a sample of 503 Polish state university students. The PLS-SEM method is utilized to test the model. Results indicate that Habit has the most significant impact (0.339) on Behavioral intention, followed by Performance expectancy (0.260), and Hedonic motivation (0.187). Behavioral intention has the most significant effect (0.424) on Use behavior, followed by Habit (0.255) and Facilitating conditions (0.188). The model explains 72.8% of the Behavioral intention and 54.7% of the Use behavior variance. While the study is limited by the sample size and selection, it is expected to be a starting point for more research on ChatGPT-like technology in university education, given that this is a recently introduced technology.","[{""name"": ""Artur Strzelecki"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1287/isre.9.2.204"", ""10.1177/0266666915597546"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11051-2"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09965-5"", ""10.1007/s10209-019-00685-8"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02302-2"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00218-x"", ""10.1111/bjet.13009"", ""10.1007/s10956-023-10039-y"", ""10.1080/14703297.2023.2190148"", ""10.53761/1.20.3.02"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-36272-9_13"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02536"", ""10.1016/j.csda.2014.07.008"", ""10.1007/s10796-017-9774-y"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9508-8"", ""10.2196/46885"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101787"", ""10.1108/ITSE-06-2016-0015"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100890"", ""10.2753/MTP1069-6679190202"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2013.01.001"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103761"", ""10.1016/S0262-4079(23)00099-4"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10171-x"", ""10.1108/JTF-02-2023-0038"", ""10.1109/ICDAMT.2017.7904962"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44188-6_29"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-09858-z"", ""10.5430/ijhe.v2n2p22"", ""10.1111/bjet.13227"", ""10.1016/S2589-7500(23)00019-5"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100790"", ""10.2307/25148817"", ""10.1108/LHTN-01-2023-0009"", ""10.1002/asi.24750"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103617"", ""10.1057/s41271-023-00400-1"", ""10.1111/bjet.13232"", ""10.1145/3506860.3506866"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10157-9"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11047-y"", ""10.1177/10776958221149577"", ""10.53761/1.20.02.07"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104468"", ""10.5539/ies.v6n7p157"", ""10.1108/JARHE-02-2021-0054"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57413-4_15"", ""10.1108/OIR-01-2021-0017"", ""10.1002/mar.20823"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2209881"", ""10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.17"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102269"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04315-5_19"", ""10.1007/s12599-023-00795-x"", ""10.1126/science.adg7879"", ""10.1186/s40561-023-00237-x"", ""10.1108/JSTPM-12-2020-0168"", ""10.1038/d41586-023-00288-7"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.17705/1jais.00428"", ""10.1145/365153.365168"", ""10.1080/17439884.2023.2167830"", ""10.1177/21582440211055721"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11116-2"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1080/17439884.2021.2010094"", ""10.1108/ITSE-09-2018-0065""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1182/hematology.2020000118,HEMATOLOGY-AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY EDUCATION PROGRAM,0401 Education; 1002 Clinical Medicine,Managing toxicities of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors,"Abstract Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) has revolutionized the treatment landscape for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). By targeting this critical kinase in proximal B-cell receptor signaling, BTK inhibitors (BTKis) impair cell proliferation, migration, and activation of NF-κB. Clinically, because indefinite inhibition is a mainstay of therapy, there is an extended period of exposure in which adverse effects can develop. Given the impressive efficacy and activity of BTKis in the treatment of patients with CLL, appropriate management of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) is of paramount importance. Here we review the BTKi landscape and present the available toxicity and safety data for each agent. The long-term toxicity profile of ibrutinib, a first-in-class inhibitor, is well characterized and includes a clinically significant incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, infection, diarrhea, arthralgias, and hypertension. Acalabrutinib, the initial second-generation BTKi to earn approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, demonstrates improved kinase selectivity for BTK, with commonly observed adverse reactions including infection, headache, and diarrhea. Mediated by both on-target inhibition of BTK and variable off-target inhibition of other kinases including interleukin-2–inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), tyrosine-protein kinase (TEC), and endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), the toxicity profile of BTKis is closely linked to their pattern of kinase binding. Other emerging BTKis include second-generation agents with variable degrees of kinase selectivity and third-generation agents that exhibit reversible noncovalent binding to BTK. We also highlight critical considerations for the prevention and monitoring of AEs and offer practical management strategies for treatment-emergent toxicities.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Lipsky"", ""affiliation"": [""Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY""]}, {""name"": ""Nicole Lamanna"", ""affiliation"": [""Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY""]}]","[""10.1182/blood-2011-01-328484"", ""10.1038/leu.2013.131"", ""10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2856"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa1400376"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa1509388"", ""10.1182/bloodadvances.2018028761"", ""10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30212-1"", ""10.1038/s41375-019-0602-x"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa1509981"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30262-2"", ""10.1182/blood.2018884940"", ""10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.8015"", ""10.1182/blood.V128.22.642.642"", ""10.1182/blood-2019-125394"", ""10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.TPS7572"", ""10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3504"", ""10.1182/blood.V128.22.2032.2032"", ""10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01712"", ""10.1016/j.clml.2018.07.081"", ""10.1158/2159-8290.CD-17-1409"", ""10.3324/haematol.2017.182907"", ""10.1073/pnas.1004594107"", ""10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-0463"", ""10.1182/blood.2019003715"", ""10.1182/blood-2019-125483"", ""10.1182/blood-2017-02-765115"", ""10.1182/blood-2016-06-719294"", ""10.1200/JCO.2016.70.2282"", ""10.3389/fonc.2020.00894"", ""10.1182/blood-2019-126286"", ""10.1182/blood-2019-127509"", ""10.18632/oncotarget.24310"", ""10.1182/blood-2019-127260"", ""10.1002/ajh.25638"", ""10.1161/01.CIR.96.7.2455"", ""10.1080/10428194.2016.1257795"", ""10.1016/j.clml.2018.06.016"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa1817073"", ""10.1182/blood-2019-126824"", ""10.1182/blood-2018-99-116653"", ""10.1182/blood-2014-10-604272"", ""10.1182/blood-2017-08-764712"", ""10.1182/blood-2018-11-846808"", ""10.3324/haematol.2015.126672"", ""10.1016/j.jacc.2018.06.002"", ""10.1182/blood-2016-10-742437"", ""10.1016/j.jacc.2019.07.056"", ""10.1038/leu.2014.247"", ""10.3324/haematol.2015.140558"", ""10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000640"", ""10.1182/blood-2013-06-507947"", ""10.3324/haematol.2014.119669"", ""10.1182/blood-2017-12-823393"", ""10.3324/haematol.2019.219220"", ""10.1038/s41375-019-0481-1"", ""10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001678"", ""10.1093/cid/ciy175"", ""10.1182/blood-2017-09-806398"", ""10.1016/j.blre.2019.100635"", ""10.1182/blood-2019-121675"", ""10.1182/blood.2020006965"", ""10.1097/HS9.0000000000000432"", ""10.1182/blood.2019000840"", ""10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.8024"", ""10.1016/j.clml.2020.02.001"", ""10.1182/blood-2010-05-286500"", ""10.1038/leu.2015.273"", ""10.3324/haematol.2015.138289"", ""10.1111/bjh.15545"", ""10.3324/haematol.2017.164103"", ""10.1111/bjh.14302"", ""10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.0225"", ""10.1182/blood-2016-12-737346"", ""10.3324/haematol.2016.147900"", ""10.1182/blood.2019896688"", ""10.1002/cam4.2998"", ""10.1182/bloodadvances.2018030007"", ""10.1038/leu.2017.175"", ""10.1016/j.clml.2018.08.007""]",['Medicine'],"['Genetics', 'Hematology', 'Pathology and Forensic Medicine']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0710 生物学', 0.733), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7315)], [('1001 基础医学', 0.7426), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7371)], [('1012 法医学', 0.7527), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7148)]]"
10.18326/rgt.v13i1.49-76,REGISTER JOURNAL,0401 Education,EFL Classes Must Go Online! Teaching Activities and Challenges during COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia,"In view of the COVID-19 pandemic and government policy to carry out online learning, the present research is aimed at investigating how EFL teachers carry out online EFL learning and its challenges. 16 EFL teachers volunteered to participate in this research through invitation. The EFL teachers were requested to make written reflections regarding their practices in carrying out online EFL learning and the challenges they encounter. Five of them were involved in a follow-up interview individually. Semi-structured interview was administered. Data coding was done and appropriate extracts were informed in results section. To validate the data, data coding was done independently by both researchers, continued by several cycles of discussion. As results, the EFL teachers have carried out online learning through a series of activities ranging from checking the students’ attendance to giving score on the students’ works synchronously or asynchronously depending on each school policy. Various applications and platforms ranging from learning management system to additional resource are employed. However, many problems emerge from the students, the teachers, and the students’ parents along with the valid reasons.

10.3352/jeehp.2021.18.27,JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS,0401 Education,E-learning in health professions education during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,"As an alternative to traditional teaching, e-learning has enabled continuity of learning for health professions students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review explored health professions students; perceptions, acceptance, motivation, and engagement with e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic review was conducted by consulting 5 databases: PubMed, ERIC (Ebsco), Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. The research protocol was previously registered in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42021237055). From 250 studies identified, 15 were selected with a total of 111,622 students. Mostly positive perceptions were reported in 7 of 12 studies, which mainly focused on technology access, possession of basic computer skills, pedagogical design of online courses, online interactions, and learning flexibility. However, predominantly negative perceptions were identified in 5 of 12 studies, which pointed out constraints related to internet connections, the use of educational platforms, and acquisition of clinical skills. Satisfactory levels of acceptance of distance learning were reported in 3 of 4 studies. For student motivation and engagement, 1 study reported similar or higher motivation than with traditional teaching, and another study indicated that student engagement significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health professions students showed a positive response to e-learning regarding perceptions, acceptance, motivation, and engagement. Future research is needed to remediate the lack of studies addressing health professions students’ motivation and engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Aziz Naciri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Radid"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Kharbach"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ghizlane Chemsi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/ijerph18052420"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v13i2.1161"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1240-0"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-10027-z"", ""10.1007/s11159-020-09880-9"", ""10.33225/pec/11.30.113"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.1186/s13643-016-0384-4"", ""10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2766"", ""10.12669/pjms.37.1.3124"", ""10.7196/ajhpe.2020.v12i4.1391"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02236-9"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042378"", ""10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.jiph.2020.11.007"", ""10.3233/PRM-200765"", ""10.23751/pn.v22i2-S.10443"", ""10.31782/IJCRR.2020.122336"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02343-7"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104796"", ""10.1007/s13187-020-01863-6"", ""10.1016/j.amsu.2021.01.073"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041886"", ""10.1186/s12909-015-0429-8"", ""10.1007/s40670-020-01040-w"", ""10.25134/ieflj.v6i2.3378"", ""10.46328/ijonse.49"", ""10.51248/.v41i1.549"", ""10.46328/ijtes.v4i4.113"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000024821"", ""10.5430/ijhe.v9n1p133"", ""10.1177/0023677219879170"", ""10.1186/s41239-016-0034-x"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.905"", ""10.18178/ijiet.2020.10.3.1360"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9753-z"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10473-8"", ""10.2190/EC.44.1.a"", ""10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2385"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104985"", ""10.3390/su11040985""]","['Medicine', 'Dentistry', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Dentistry']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.78), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7342), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7246), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7141), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7138)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.7328), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6867)]]"

Herein, a self‐monitoring system based on real‐time camera images and deep learning algorithms is developed to classify the various extents of delamination in a printed part. In addition, a novel method incorporating strain measurements is established to measure and predict the onset of warping. Results show that the machine‐learning model is capable of detecting different levels of delamination conditions, and the strain measurements setup successfully reflects and determines the extent and tendency of warping before it actually occurs in the print job. This multifunctional system can be applied to assess other manufacturing processes to realize autocalibration and prediagnosis of imperfections without human interaction.","[{""name"": ""Zeqing Jin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of California  Berkeley CA 94720 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Zhizhou Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of California  Berkeley CA 94720 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Grace X.

10.1111/bjet.13191,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Academia's responses to crisis: A bibliometric analysis of literature on online learning in higher education during COVID-19,"AbstractThis paper aimed to provide a holistic view of research that investigated online learning in higher education around the globe during COVID‐19 utilizing a bibliometric analysis. The researchers used co‐citation analysis and text mining afforded by VOSviewer to document and analyze research patterns and topics reported in peer‐reviewed documents published between January 2020 and August 2021. Findings of this study indicated that scholars from 103 countries or regions from the Global North and Global South investigated a wide array of topics, such as use of various technologies and strategies, redesigned curriculum, student perceptions and psychological impacts of the pandemic‐imposed online learning. Many researchers applied technology acceptance theories and structural equation modeling to investigate factors associated with adoption and impacts of the pandemic‐imposed online learning. Of the large quantity of research, medical education and chemical education were the most investigated disciplines. Inquiry‐based learning, discovery learning, hands‐on learning and collaborative learning emerged as instructional approaches frequently discussed or utilized across the target studies. This paper discussed (a) ongoing and emerging challenges to online higher education, (b) placing innovative pedagogies at the forefront of online learning, and (c) rapid, but imbalanced distribution of evolving literature based on the findings. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Online learning had attracted growing traction as a flexible and affordable means to complement traditional higher education prior to COVID‐19. Higher education institutions (HEIs), faculty and students around the globe have encountered various challenges and opportunities regarding online teaching and learning during COVID‐19. What this paper adds A bird's‐eye‐view perspective of how HEIs around the globe responded to the pandemic‐imposed online teaching and learning using the bibliometric methodology. Identifications of a large body of research (n = 1061 documents) conducted by scholars from 103 countries or regions that investigated the pandemic‐imposed online higher education, indicating an unprecedented level of participation in this area. An analysis of distinct themes arising from research on the pandemic‐imposed online learning, such as medical education and psychological impact, chemistry curriculum and laboratory‐based instruction and technology acceptance model. Implications for practice and/or policy The large corpus of studies on online higher education from different aspects can provide cross‐disciplinary information guiding future research and design of online learning. With technology often conceptualized as the solution to support online learning, it is imperative to put innovative pedagogy at the forefront of the design of online teaching and learning.","[{""name"": ""Ling Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Research on Learning Center for Innovation, Design, and Digital Learning University of Kansas  Lawrence Kansas USA""]}, {""name"": ""Richard Allen Carter"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Education University of Wyoming  Laramie Wyoming USA""]}, {""name"": ""Xueqin Qian"", ""affiliation"": [""Woodland Elementary School  Olathe Kansas USA""]}, {""name"": ""Sohyun Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Advanced Education Programs Fort Hays State University  Hays Kansas USA""]}, {""name"": ""James Rujimora"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Community Innovation and Education University of Central Florida  Orlando Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Shuman Wen"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Education Rutgers University  New Brunswick New Jersey USA""]}]","[""10.1007/s10639‐021‐10507‐1"", ""10.33902/JPSP.2020261309"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2021.03.009"", ""10.24059/olj.v25i2.223"", ""10.1007/s10639‐021‐10550‐y"", ""10.1007/s11423‐020‐09855‐5"", ""10.1007/s10639‐021‐10469‐4"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.01.006"", ""10.1177/0047117815596590"", ""10.1002/hbe2.191"", ""10.3390/info12060256"", ""10.1007/s40670‐021‐01231‐z"", ""10.1080/13662716.2020.1792274"", ""10.1016/j.jarmac.2020.03.004"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1821184"", ""10.1002/ece3.7123"", ""10.1007/s10639‐019‐10027‐z"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100027"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00830"", ""10.1080/01425690301914"", ""10.3390/su13105336"", ""10.1177/0011392116680020"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2016.11.004"", ""10.37074/jalt.2020.3.1.7"", ""10.1111/bjet.13114"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.3390/ijerph18126674"", ""10.1177/0047239520934018"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00705"", ""10.3991/ijet.v16i09.17895"", ""10.1007/s11192‐015‐1645‐z"", ""10.1007/s40692‐021‐00191‐y"", ""10.1126/science.1154562"", ""10.1186/s12909‐020‐02310‐2"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2018.10.002"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00722"", ""10.2307/3151312"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.3000959"", ""10.1073/pnas.1319030111"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2007.04.001"", ""10.24093/awej/vol11no3.2"", ""10.24059/olj.v25i1.2484"", ""10.1108/ILS‐04‐2020‐0138"", ""10.3205/zma001365"", ""10.3102/0034654319830380"", ""10.1023/A:1017919924342"", ""10.1108/QAE‐08‐2020‐0098"", ""10.17705/1CAIS.04826"", ""10.1108/ITSE‐12‐2020‐0246"", ""10.1108/ITSE‐06‐2020‐0087"", ""10.1007/BF02504675"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.100282"", ""10.1108/ILS‐04‐2020‐0120"", ""10.1136/bmj.b2700"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100759"", ""10.1111/bjet.13070"", ""10.1177/87568705211015684"", ""10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101013"", ""10.18662/rrem/12.2Sup1/303"", ""10.18162/ritpu‐2020‐v17n2‐08"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.10.001"", ""10.1177/0013161X07307796"", ""10.1080/13523260.2020.1761749"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐8535.2008.00910.x"", ""10.1080/03323315.2021.1932553"", ""10.1787/83c41957-en"", ""10.1177/2382120520973212"", ""10.1080/10963758.2021.1907193"", ""10.28945/4611"", ""10.1007/s11618‐021‐01002‐x"", ""10.3390/s21144762"", ""10.1007/s10639‐021‐10581‐5"", ""10.1007/s42438‐020‐00155‐y"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2021.106732"", ""10.3390/su12187362"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00355"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐8535.2010.01057.x"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.5227"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00802"", ""10.7759/cureus.7541"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00780"", ""10.28945/4615"", ""10.1080/0309877X.2020.1847261"", ""10.1108/IJEM‐03‐2021‐0085"", ""10.1080/08923647.2019.1663082"", ""10.1002/hbe2.261"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐8535.2009.00990.x"", ""10.3390/su12166520"", ""10.1016/j.ece.2021.01.007"", ""10.1177/17446295211002346"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c01433"", ""10.1108/CG‐09‐2020‐0419"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104211"", ""10.29333/pr/7947"", ""10.1007/s10639‐021‐10633‐w"", ""10.1002/asi.21421"", ""10.1007/s11192‐010‐0173‐0"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2306_20"", ""10.5858/arpa.2020‐0652‐SA"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0147913"", ""10.1111/bjet.13023"", ""10.1080/01587919.2021.1956305"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.11.003"", ""10.1108/IJILT‐02‐2021‐0033"", ""10.1080/23311983.2021.1953228"", ""10.1177/1094428114562629""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

It offers different views on nature and science that generally differ from traditional Western science. Futhermore, it introduces different perspectives on nature and the human in nature. Coming basically from a Western perspective on nature and science, the paper analyzes the literature in science education focusing on research and practices of integrating indigenous knowledge with science education. The paper suggestsDidaktikmodels and frameworks for how to elaborate on and design science education for sustainability that takes indigenous knowledge and related non-Western and alternative Western ideas into consideration. To do so, indigenous knowledge is contextualized with regards to related terms (e.g., ethnoscience), and with Eastern perspectives (e.g., Buddhism), and alternative Western thinking (e.g., post-humanBildung). This critical review provides justification for a stronger reflection about how to include views, aspects, and practices from indigenous communities into science teaching and learning. It also suggests that indigenous knowledge offers rich and authentic contexts for science learning. At the same time, it provides chances to reflect views on nature and science in contemporary (Western) science education for contributing to the development of more balanced and holistic worldviews, intercultural understanding, and sustainability.","[{""name"": ""Robby Zidny"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesper Sjöström"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ingo Eilks"", ""affiliation"":

10.1186/s41239-020-00194-2,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Students' perceptions on distance education: A multinational study,"AbstractMany universities offer Distance Education (DE) courses and programs to address the diverse educational needs of students and to stay current with advancing technology. Some Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) that do not offer DE find it difficult to navigate through the steps that are needed to provide such courses and programs. Investigating learners’ perceptions, attitudes and willingness to try DE can provide guidance and recommendations for IHEs that are considering expanding use of DE formats. A survey was distributed to undergraduate students in Portugal, UAE and Ukraine. The results of this pilot study showed that in all three countries, students’ major concerns about such programs were time management, motivation, and English language skills. Although students were somewhat apprehensive many indicated they were interested in taking DE courses. Six recommendations informed by interpretation of students’ responses and the literature, are offered to assist institutions who want to offer DE as part of their educational strategy.","[{""name"": ""Patricia Fidalgo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joan Thormann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oleksandr Kulyk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""José Alberto Lencastre"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.28945/3540"", ""10.29315/gm.v5i4.214"", ""10.1080/02680513.2017.1414586"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v1i1.2"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2004.02.001"", ""10.21125/iceri.2016.090"", ""10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.58"", ""10.1080/02602938.2010.496532"", ""10.1080/0268051940090206"", ""10.1080/10511250600866166"", ""10.5772/intechopen.75702"", ""10.3200/JOEB.84.2.101-109"", ""10.24059/olj.v13i2.1670"", ""10.18421/TEM84-52"", ""10.1007/s10755-005-1938-x"", ""10.1080/0268051032000131035"", ""10.1080/01587919.2016.1185079""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

In this blooming area of fundamental and technological importance, liquid crystal polymer networks and liquid crystal elastomers (referred to as LCNs) have emerged as one of the most valuable candidates for soft robots due to their complex, large, and reversible shape change capabilities. To date, much research effort, mainly regarding chemical synthesis, fabrication technologies and soft robot design, has been dedicated to LCN robotic systems to endow them with versatile and complex actions controlled by various stimuli. Herein, starting with the principle that governs the stimuli‐responsiveness of LCNs, recent progress made in LCN soft robots is summarized while focusing on different robotic motions, such as grapping, walking, swimming, and oscillation. Especially, novel LCNs with intelligent functions such as reprocessability, reconfigurability, self‐regulating behavior and associative learning capability, are highlighted.

This has led to claims that a ‘smoker’s paradox’ may exist in COVID-19, wherein smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. We aimed to review and summarise existing literature in this context. Electronic databases were searched for articles that reported prevalence of smokers among patients with COVID-19 or studied any association of smoking with outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in COVID-19. As of now, the data supporting smoker’s paradox claims are limited and questionable. Plausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be protective in COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers (reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19) and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells). On the other hand, smoking may worsen susceptibility and prognosis in COVID-19, in a manner similar to other respiratory infections. The claims of a protective effect must be viewed with extreme caution by both the general population as well as clinicians. Further investigations into the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients suffering from it.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Shariq Usman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tariq Jamal Siddiqi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Shahzeb Khan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Urvish K Patel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Izza Shahid"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jawad Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ankur Kalra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erin D Michos"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1001/archinte.164.20.2206"", ""10.1186/1741-7015-9-97"", ""10.1161/01.CIR.91.2.298"", ""10.1093/ntr/ntx020"", ""10.1093/eurheartj/ehn210"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.04.022"", ""10.1093/aje/kwm165"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.0020160"", ""10.1016/j.jacc.2020.02.045"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa2002032"", ""10.1111/all.14238"", ""10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3"", ""10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa248"", ""10.1007/s11739-020-02457-2"", ""10.32388/WPP19W.2"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2010419"", ""10.1101/2020.04.15.20067157"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.6775"", ""10.18332/tid/119324"", ""10.1016/j.ejim.2020.03.014"", ""10.1038/s41586-020-2521-4"", ""10.1038/nature01339"", ""10.1007/BF03402177"", ""10.1007/s00134-020-05991-x"", ""10.1016/j.ejim.2020.04.042"", ""10.1080/14622200210142724"", ""10.1128/JVI.79.3.1966-1969.2005"", ""10.1093/ntr/ntaa059"", ""10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100617"", ""10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105941"", ""10.1378/chest.109.4.1006"", ""10.1007/s00011-008-8078-6"", ""10.1016/j.ejim.2020.04.037"", ""10.1253/circj.CJ-12-1544"", ""10.3390/jcm9030841"", ""10.1152/ajpregu.00099.2018""]",['Medicine'],"['Neurology', 'Infectious Diseases']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7465), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7432)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)]]"

10.1017/S0261444819000387,LANGUAGE TEACHING,0401 Education,Teaching Chinese as a second or foreign language to non-Chinese learners in mainland China (2014-2018),"AbstractThis review involved 60 articles chosen from 336 empirical studies identified in five leading journals on the learning and teaching of Chinese as a second or foreign language in mainland China during the period 2014–2018. The selected studies document Chinese researchers' efforts to improve the teaching and learning of the Chinese language in terms of language pedagogy, language learning and teacher development. We contend that these studies on the teaching and learning of Chinese as a second or foreign language (CSL/CFL) can contribute to the advancement of second/foreign language education theories even though they were largely conducted to address local needs and interests in the Chinese context. Unfortunately, the impact of these studies on international language education research and pedagogical development remains limited and peripheral. For this reason, this review concludes with recommendations for Chinese researchers and journal editors in the field of Chinese language teaching and learning research on how to promote quality empirical research and enhance their contributions to second/foreign language education research.","[{""name"": ""Yang (Frank) Gong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xuesong (Andy) Gao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Boning Lyu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10671-009-9078-1"", ""10.1016/j.system.2018.10.014"", ""10.1080/00207596708247220"", ""10.1080/01434630802147908"", ""10.1016/S1060-3743(96)90005-3"", ""10.1111/flan.12137"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511732942"", ""10.2307/2342192"", ""10.1002/job.4030020205"", ""10.1017/S0261444809990358"", ""10.1016/j.tree.2004.10.010"", ""10.1093/applin/aml029"", ""10.2307/40264518"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2012.2.1.2"", ""10.1007/s40299-018-0385-2"", ""10.1017/S0261444809990255"", ""10.1017/S0261444810000340"", ""10.1017/S026144481600001X"", ""10.1017/S0261444811000292"", ""10.1177/0267658311417836"", ""10.1111/modl.12526"", ""10.1016/j.system.2018.09.009"", ""10.1177/1362168812436903"", ""10.1111/modl.12301"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.05.002"", ""10.1017/S0261444808005405"", ""10.1080/01434632.2016.1268146"", ""10.1017/S0261444813000414"", ""10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00203-X""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1108/JPCC-06-2020-0039,JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL CAPITAL AND COMMUNITY,0401 Education,Professional capital after the pandemic: revisiting and revising classic understandings of teachers' work,"PurposeThis article revisits three classic findings from Dan Lortie's 1975 book Schoolteacher, in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and its possible aftermaths. These findings are that teachers and others base their ideas about teaching on the long apprenticeship of observation as students; they derive their satisfaction from the psychic rewards of teaching – the emotional satisfaction and feedback that teachers got from students; and they work in conservative cultures of individualism.Design/methodology/approachThe article appraises Lortie's foundational text in relation to contemporary public domain surveys and op-ed articles about the impact of the pandemic on teaching and learning.FindingsCOVID-19 created conditions that undermined traditional psychic rewards, weakened the tenuous student–teacher relationship as more students found schooling less engaging, began to give parents distorted observations of teaching online and made teacher collaboration more difficult.Research limitations/implicationsDue to the current nature of the pandemic and the shortage of just-in-time original data, the research relies on rapid responses and op-ed perceptions rather than on an established body of literature and database.Practical implicationsThe postpandemic agenda holds out three ways to modernize Lortie's agenda in ways that advance the presence and impact of professional capital. These ways comprise new psychic rewards for students and not just teachers, a more open professionalism that is actively inclusive of parents and collaborative professionalism that has greater strength and depth.Social implicationsEducational reform in the postpandemic age must be transformational and not seek to return to normal.Originality/valueThe paper gives new meaning to Lortie's original ideas on COVID-19 circumstances","[{""name"": ""Andy Hargreaves"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Fullan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1787/19cf08df-en""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1108/AEDS-05-2020-0097,ASIAN EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,0401 Education,Online education during COVID-19: perception of academic stress and emotional intelligence coping strategies among college students,"PurposeDue to COVID-19 pandemic, the government around the world has closed all the educational institutions to control the spread of disease, which is creating a direct impact on students, educators and institutions. The sudden shift from the physical classroom to virtual space is creating a disruption among students. The purpose of this study was to analyze the perception of academic stress experienced by students during current online education and coping strategies using emotional intelligence adopted by them.Design/methodology/approachUsing a purposive sampling method, data were collected on a sample of 94 students pursuing undergraduation and postgraduation from two Indian cities, Ahmedabad, and Mumbai. The survey was conducted using two online questionnaires, Perceptions of Academic Stress Scale and Emotional Intelligence Scale and analyzed using descriptive statistics with chi-square analysis. A telephonic discussion was also conducted with some respondents to understand different coping strategies used by them to handle the stress.FindingsThe findings indicated significant differences were observed between the fear of academic failure and online and home environment among male and female students. Many of them have started diverting themselves to various creative activities and taking up courses that are helping them to learn new technical skills. By using emotional intelligence and distancing from boredom and depressive thoughts, students were trying to cope with negative effects arising from the current pandemic situation.Research limitations/implicationsThis research study will be beneficial to educators, scholars, students, parents and will add a contribution to its field. However, the key factors studied were limited to a small sample from selected institutions and cities, which cannot be used to generalize to a large population.Practical implicationsThe findings of this paper will be useful to assess the key challenges of online education especially at the time when it is the only option.Social implicationsThe findings of this paper will be beneficial to understand the academic stress experienced by students and how a cultural and educational modification will be implemented.Originality/valueThis research study was conducted during the lockdown in India (April–May 2020), and the results derived through it are original in nature.","[{""name"": ""Yamini Chandra"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2003.67.10.tb03707.x"", ""10.1177/0011000095232009"", ""10.31237/osf.io/fpg4j"", ""10.4103/0971-5916.156571"", ""10.1177/0143034308093676"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2005.01.016"", ""10.1037/1072-5245.11.2.132"", ""10.1002/j.1556-6676.2000.tb02571.x"", ""10.1080/08923640802039024"", ""10.1097/00001888-200603000-00002"", ""10.1177/016502549201500103"", ""10.1177/1010539512440818"", ""10.1108/09513540010344731""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Sometimes, a guideline panel might judge the certainty that the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh its undesirable effects as high, but the body of supportive evidence is indirect. In such cases, the application of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach for grading the strength of recommendations is inappropriate. Instead, the GRADE Working Group has recommended developing ungraded best or good practice statement (GPS) and developed guidance under which circumsances they would be appropriate.Through an evaluation of COVID-1- related recommendations on the eCOVID Recommendation Map (COVID-19.recmap.org), we found that recommendations qualifying a GPS were widespread. However, guideline developers failed to label them as GPS or transparently report justifications for their development. We identified ways to improve and facilitate the operationalisation and implementation of the GRADE guidance for GPS.Herein, we propose a structured process for the development of GPSs that includes applying a sequential order for the GRADE guidance for developing GPS. This operationalisation considers relevant evidence-to-decision criteria when assessing the net consequences of implementing the statement, and reporting information supporting judgments for each criterion. We also propose a standardised table to facilitate the identification of GPS and reporting of their development. This operationalised guidance, if endorsed by guideline developers, may palliate some of the shortcomings identified. Our proposal may also inform future updates of the GRADE guidance for GPS.","[{""name"": ""Omar Dewidar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tamara Lotfi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Miranda W Langendam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elena Parmelli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zuleika Saz Parkinson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karla Solo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Derek K Chu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joseph L Mathew"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elie A Akl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Romina Brignardello-Petersen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Reem A Mustafa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lorenzo Moja"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alfonso Iorio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuan Chi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carlos Canelo-Aybar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tamara Kredo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Justine Karpusheff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexis F Turgeon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Alonso-Coello"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wojtek Wiercioch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Annette Gerritsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Miloslav Klugar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""María Ximena Rojas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Tugwell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vivian Andrea Welch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kevin Pottie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zachary Munn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robby Nieuwlaat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nathan Ford"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adrienne Stevens"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joanne Khabsa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zil Nasir"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Grigorios Leontiadis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joerg Meerpohl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Piggott"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amir Qaseem"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Micayla Matthews"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Holger J Schünemann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.09.011"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2017.01.015"", ""10.1053/j.gastro.2015.01.015"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.04.026"", ""10.1210/jc.2013-1814"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.10.011"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2016.07.006"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.09.028"", ""10.1136/bmjebm-2021-111866"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.11.009"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2015.03.004"", ""10.1136/bmjebm-2018-111032"", ""10.7326/M20-7641"", ""10.1136/bmj.i2016"", ""10.1177/0194599812467004"", ""10.1186/1748-5908-7-61"", ""10.15585/mmwr.mm695152e2"", ""10.1186/s12889-020-09826-8"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2011.04.014"", ""10.1017/S0266462313000287"", ""10.1136/bmj.39489.470347.AD""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1007/s11251-020-09502-9,INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,"Understanding instructional design effects by differentiated measurement of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load","AbstractInstructional design deals with the optimization of learning processes. To achieve this, three aspects need to be considered: (1) the learning task itself, (2) the design of the learning material, and (3) the activation of the learner’s cognitive processes during learning. Based on Cognitive Load Theory, learners also need to deal with the task itself, the design of the material, and the decision on how much to invest into learning. To link these concepts, and to help instructional designers and teachers, cognitive load during learning needs to be differentially measured. This article reviews studies using a questionnaire to measure intrinsic, extraneous and germane cognitive load in order to provide evidence for the instruments’ prognostic validity. Six exemplary studies from different domains with different variations of the learning material were chosen to show that the theoretically expected effects on different types of load are actually reflected in the learners’ answers in the questionnaire. Major hypotheses regarding the different load types were (1) variations in difficulty are reflected in the scale on intrinsic cognitive load, (2) variations in design are reflected in the scale on extraneous cognitive load, and (3) variations in enhancing deeper learning through activation of cognitive processes are reflected in the scale on germane cognitive load. We found prognostic validity to be good. The review concludes by discussing the practical and theoretical implications, as well as pointing out the limitations and needs for further research.","[{""name"": ""Melina Klepsch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tina Seufert"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1088868309341564"", ""10.3102/00346543070002181"", ""10.1002/acp.1245"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816819.009"", ""10.1024/1010-0652.23.2.139"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_7"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511844744.011"", ""10.1207/s1532690xci0804_2"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01099"", ""10.1002/acp.3004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816819.008"", ""10.1007/s10648-010-9150-7"", ""10.1518/001872098779480587"", ""10.1177/0146167207310026"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.004"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01997"", ""10.1007/s11409-016-9154-x"", ""10.3758/s13428-013-0334-1"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2013.12.001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816819.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811678"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.358"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511844744.003"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.429"", ""10.1016/S0959-4752(01)00016-0"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816819.016"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511844744.007"", ""10.1026//0012-1924.47.2.57"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816819.005"", ""10.1026//0949-3964.46.3.217"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2018.03.004"", ""10.1007/s11251-016-9387-8"", ""10.1016/0959-4752(94)90003-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511844744.004"", ""10.1007/s10648-010-9128-5"", ""10.1207/s1532690xci1203_1"", ""10.1023/A:1022193728205"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-8126-4"", ""10.1007/BF02504793""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003628,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,They Don't See a Lot of People My Color: A Mixed Methods Study of Racial/Ethnic Stereotype Threat Among Medical Students on Core Clerkships,"Purpose Stereotype threat is an important psychological phenomenon in which fear of fulfilling negative stereotypes about one’s group impairs performance. The effects of stereotype threat in medical education are poorly characterized. This study examined the prevalence of racial/ethnic stereotype threat amongst fourth-year medical students and explored its impact on students’ clinical experience. Method This was an explanatory sequential mixed methods study at 2 institutions in 2019. First, the authors administered the quantitative Stereotype Vulnerability Scale (SVS) to fourth-year medical students. The authors then conducted semistructured interviews among a purposive sample of students with high SVS scores, using a qualitative phenomenographic approach to analyze experiences of stereotype threat. The research team considered reflexivity through group discussion and journaling. Results Overall, 52% (184/353) of students responded to the survey. Collectively, 28% of students had high vulnerability to stereotype threat: 82% of Black, 45% of Asian, 43% of Latinx, and 4% of White students. Eighteen students participated in interviews. Stereotype threat was a dynamic, 3-stage process triggered when students experienced the workplace through the colored lens of race/ethnicity by standing out, reliving past experiences, and witnessing microaggressions. Next, students engaged in internal dialogue to navigate racially charged events and workplace power dynamics. These efforts depleted cognitive resources and interfered with learning. Finally, students responded and coped to withstand threats. Immediate and deferred interventions from allies reduced stereotype threat. Conclusions Stereotype threat is common, particularly among non-White students, and interferes with learning. Increased minority representation and developing evidence-based strategies for allyship around microaggressions could mitigate effects of stereotype threat.","[{""name"": ""Justin L.

10.1007/s13384-021-00436-w,AUSTRALIAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,The impact of COVID-19 on student learning in New South Wales primary schools: an empirical study,"AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic produced widespread disruption to schooling, impacting 90% of the world’s students and moving entire school systems to remote and online learning. In the state of New South Wales, Australia, most students engaged in learning from home for at least eight weeks, with subsequent individual and intermittent school closures. However, while numerous claims have circulated in the popular media and in think tank reports, internationally, about the negative impacts on learning, there is limited empirical evidence of decreased student achievement. Drawing on data from more than 4800 Year 3 and 4 students from 113 NSW government schools, this paper compares student achievement during 2019 and 2020 in a sample of matched schools to examine the effects of the system-wide disruption. Somewhat surprisingly, our analysis found no significant differences between 2019 and 2020 in student achievement growth as measured by progressive achievement tests in mathematics or reading. A more nuanced picture emerges when the sample is examined by dis/advantage (ICSEA) and Year level. The Year 3 cohort in the least advantaged schools (ICSEA &lt; 950) achieved 2 months less growth in mathematics, while the Year 3 students in mid-ICSEA schools (950–1050) achieved 2 months’ additional growth. No significant differences were identified for Indigenous students or students located in regional locations. These results provide an important counter-narrative to widespread speculation about alarming levels of ‘learning loss’ for all students. While the lower achievement growth in mathematics for Year 3 students in lower ICSEA schools must be addressed as a matter of urgency to avoid further inequities, most students are, academically, where they are expected to be. Our findings are a testament to the dedicated work of teachers during the 2020 pandemic to ensure that learning for most students was not compromised, despite unusually trying circumstances.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Gore"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leanne Fray"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrew Miller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jess Harris"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wendy Taggart"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/hsj.2010.0007"", ""10.1176/appi.pn.2020.5a10"", ""10.4018/IJICTE.2019070101"", ""10.1111/j.1753-318X.2010.01060.x"", ""10.1080/03004279.2017.1383502"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2021.103297"", ""10.1108/JPCC-06-2020-0039"", ""10.4236/ce.2012.31011"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2019.09.002"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3682160"", ""10.1080/10510974.2017.1373370""]",['Psychology'],['Clinical Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)]]"

A new era for “smart” sensor systems is emerging that changes the way that conventional sensor systems are used to understand the world. Smart sensor systems have taken advantage of classic and emerging ML algorithms and modern computer hardware to create sophisticated “smart” models that are tailored specifically for sensing applications and fusing diverse sensing modalities to gain a more holistic appreciation of the system being monitored. Herein, a review of the recent sensing applications, which harness ML enabled smart sensor systems, is presented. First well‐known ML algorithms implemented in smart sensor systems for practical sensing applications are discussed. Subsequent sections summarize the practical sensing applications under two major categories: physical and chemical sensing and visual imaging sensing describing how the sensor technologies are coupled with ML “smart” models and how these systems achieve practical benefits. Finally, an outlook on the current trajectory and challenges that will be faced by future smart sensing systems and the opportunities that may be unlocked is provided.","[{""name"": ""Nam Ha"",

10.3102/0013189X20902110,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,High School GPAs and ACT Scores as Predictors of College Completion: Examining Assumptions About Consistency Across High Schools,"High school GPAs (HSGPAs) are often perceived to represent inconsistent levels of readiness for college across high schools, whereas test scores (e.g., ACT scores) are seen as comparable. This study tests those assumptions, examining variation across high schools of both HSGPAs and ACT scores as measures of academic readiness for college. We found students with the same HSGPA or the same ACT score graduate at very different rates based on which high school they attended. Yet, the relationship of HSGPAs with college graduation is strong and consistent and larger than school effects. In contrast, the relationship of ACT scores with college graduation is weak and smaller than high school effects, and the slope of the relationship varies by high school.","[{""name"": ""Elaine M.

10.1111/bjet.12948,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Gamification of in-class activities in flipped classroom lectures,"AbstractFor higher education, the question of how in‐class activities can be supported in large lectures is of great relevance. This paper suggests a gamified flipped classroom approach to address this challenge. In an experimental study, N = 205 educational science students performed either gamified in‐class activities using a gamified quiz with points and a team leaderboard, or non‐gamified in‐class activities using exercise sheets. In line with the theory of gamified learning, the results show a positive indirect effect of gamification on application‐oriented knowledge that is mediated by learning process performance. Furthermore, based on a self‐determination theory framework, the results show positive effects of gamified in‐class activities on intrinsic motivation and social relatedness, but no significant effect on competence need satisfaction. The study provides insights into a particular casual construct of game design elements (points and team leaderboards) triggering specific mechanisms (immediate task‐level feedback and team competition) affecting a mediator (learning process performance) that in turn affects a learning outcome (application‐oriented knowledge).","[{""name"": ""Michael Sailer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maximilian Sailer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11135‐017‐0597‐1"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100322"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.018"", ""10.1080/00461520.2014.965823"", ""10.1002/tl.8101"", ""10.1016/s1041‐6080(96)90013‐8"", ""10.1145/2181037.2181040"", ""10.1186/s41239‐017‐0042‐5"", ""10.1187/cbe.15‐02‐0040"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.036"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2014.377"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.19030/cier.v7i1.8312"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.018"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1495653"", ""10.1093/elt/ccx055"", ""10.1002/cae.21992"", ""10.2307/1170349"", ""10.1177/2332858419870489"", ""10.2307/1183338"", ""10.1177/1046878114563660"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10208-5_9"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1541910"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0101-6"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.08.048"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103682"", ""10.5040/9798400658105"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1020"", ""10.1037//0022‐3514.45.4.736"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.033"", ""10.1007/s10648‐019‐09498‐w"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103666"", ""10.1037/edu0000115"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2014.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100314"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.028"", ""10.1037/a0032359"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100326"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103729""]",['Psychology'],"['Social Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

Published research from 2014 to 2019 has been explored and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria have been applied resulting in 54 relevant publications. Our findings determined: (a) devices and software employed for mastering AR; languages and contexts in which AR had been applied; theoretical perspectives adopted for guiding the use of AR; the number of participants in AR activities and benefits from using AR as an educational tool in the language classroom; (b) alignment of the affordances of Augmented Reality with the KSAVE (Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes, Values, Ethics) 21st‐century skills framework; (c) future directions in AR research and practice. The main findings from this review demonstrate the popularity of mobile‐based AR for supporting vocabulary (23.9%), reading (12.7%), speaking (9.9%) writing (8.5%) or generic language skills (9.9%). Our findings also uncovered areas that merit future attention in the application of AR in language learning – for instance learning theories were not often considered in the implementation of AR. The study concludes with suggestions for future research especially in the areas of instructional design and user experience.","[{""name"": ""Antigoni Parmaxi"", ""affiliation"": [""Language Centre Cyprus University of Technology  Limassol Cyprus""]}, {""name"": ""Alan A.

It is indeed a challenge to satisfy these performances at the same time. Inspired by the arthropod metamerism in nature, herein, a millirobot composed of three piezoelectric segments is proposed. The millirobot is tethered for power, and the whole size of the millirobot is 58 × 44 × 12 mm; it uses several principles of arthropod locomotion, can carry loads and cross obstacles, and also has the rapidity and agility like a centipede through the coordination of multiple piezoelectric segments. Fast motion with a maximum speed of 516 mm s−1 is realized by operating at resonant mode, and stepping motion with a resolution of 0.44 μm is achieved by the pulsed sinusoidal mode. The widest speed range among published reports of millirobots is achieved (from 4.5e−3 to 9 BL s−1). Its agility surpasses other piezoelectric millirobots; the linear, steering, and rotational motions are performed and switched flexibly. The results show that fast motion, high resolution, wide speed range, high agility, large load capacity, good adaptability, and miniaturization are successfully achieved by the millirobot.","[{""name"": ""Yingxiang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System Harbin Institute of Technology  Harbin 150001 China""]}, {""name"": ""Jing Li"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System Harbin Institute of Technology  Harbin 150001 China""]}, {""name"": ""Jie Deng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System Harbin Institute of Technology  Harbin 150001 China""]}, {""name"": ""Shijing Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System Harbin Institute of Technology  Harbin 150001 China""]}, {""name"": ""Weishan Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System Harbin Institute of Technology  Harbin 150001 China""]}, {""name"": ""Hui Xie"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System Harbin Institute of Technology  Harbin 150001 China""]}, {""name"": ""Jie Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System Harbin Institute of Technology  Harbin 150001 China""]}]","[""10.1177/0278364906069150"", ""10.1109/BIOROB.2010.5626034"", ""10.1115/1.4039773"", ""10.1109/LRA.2018.2805165"", ""10.1109/LRA.2019.2895896"", ""10.1115/1.4042626"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aat2874"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1737-7"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aaz6451"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aau7557"", ""10.1002/admt.201800540"", ""10.1089/soro.2019.0090"", ""10.1038/nature25443"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-06491-9"", ""10.1109/LRA.2020.2965912"", ""10.1002/advs.202000069"", ""10.1002/adom.201600503"", ""10.1002/advs.201902842"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aax7044"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2019.03.049"", ""10.1109/TIE.2012.2233691"", ""10.1109/TASE.2014.2352364"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aar3018"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2019.2890825"", ""10.1109/TASE.2018.2875711"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1322-0"", ""10.1177/0278364905055594"", ""10.1177/0278364914521473"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2883269"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aax1594"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2018.2792618"", ""10.1109/TRO.2017.2656902"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aau3038"", ""10.1002/adfm.201808995"", ""10.1109/LRA.2020.2997317""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Engineering']","['Condensed Matter Physics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0702 物理学', 0.731), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7181)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1186/s40594-021-00323-x,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,A systematic review on trends in using Moodle for teaching and learning,"Abstract Background The Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) is widely used in online teaching and learning, especially in STEM education. However, educational research on using Moodle is scattered throughout the literature. Therefore, this review aims to summarise this research to assist three sets of stakeholders—educators, researchers, and software developers. It identifies: (a) how and where Moodle has been adopted; (b) what the concerns, trends, and gaps are to lead future research and software development; and (c) innovative and effective methods for improving online teaching and learning. The review used the 4-step PRISMA-P process to identify 155 suitable journal articles from 104 journals in 55 countries published from January 2015 to June 2021. The database search was conducted with Scopus and Web of Science. Insights into the educational use of Moodle were determined through bibliometric analysis with Vosviewer outputs and thematic analysis. Results This review shows that Moodle is mainly used within University STEM disciplines and effectively improves student performance, satisfaction, and engagement. Moodle is increasingly being used as a platform for adaptive and collaborative learning and used to improve online assessments. The use of Moodle is developing rapidly to address academic integrity, ethics, and security issues to enhance speed and navigation, and incorporate artificial intelligence. Conclusion More qualitative research is required on the use of Moodle, particularly investigating educators’ perspectives. Further research is also needed on the use of Moodle in non-STEM and non-tertiary disciplines. Further studies need to incorporate educational theories when designing courses using the Moodle platform.","[{""name"": ""Sithara H. P. W. Gamage"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jennifer R.

10.1186/s40594-020-00211-w,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Increasing high school teachers self-efficacy for integrated STEM instruction through a collaborative community of practice,"AbstractBackgroundTeachers can have a significant impact on student interest and learning in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects and careers. Teacher self-efficacy can also significantly affect student learning. Researchers investigated the effects of teacher professional development and integrated STEM curriculum development on teacher self-efficacy. Participants in the study included high school science and engineering technology teachers enrolled in a National Science Foundation–ITEST project called Teachers and Researchers Advancing Integrated Lessons in STEM (TRAILS). The TRAILS program sought to prepare teachers to integrate STEM content using engineering design, biomimicry, science inquiry, and 3D printing as pedagogical approaches. Teachers learned within a community of practice working alongside industry partners and college faculty. The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of the 70 h of professional development to train three cohorts of teachers over 3 years on teacher self-efficacy. The research design utilized a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group approach, including an experimental group and an untreated control group.ResultsMeasurements on beliefs about teacher self-efficacy were collected on pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest survey assessments. Researchers analyzed the T-STEM survey results for teaching self-efficacy using the Wilcoxson signed-rank test for detecting significant differences. Science teachers showed a significant increase in teacher self-efficacy comparing the pretest and delayed posttest scores after TRAILS professional development and STEM lesson implementation (p=.001, effect size = .95). Additionally, significant differences between groups (science experimental vs science control group teachers) using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test were detected from pretest to posttest (p= .033, effect size = .46), posttest to delayed posttest (p= .029, effect size = .47), and pretest to delayed posttest (p= .005, effect size = .64). There were no significant differences detected in the control group. Engineering technology teachers showed no significant differences between the pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest self-efficacy scores.ConclusionsThe results indicate the science teachers’ self-efficacy increased after professional development and after lesson implementation. Potential implications from this research suggest that the science teacher participants benefited greatly from learning within a community of practice, engaging in science practices, and using science knowledge to solve a real-world problem (engineering design).","[{""name"": ""Todd R.

10.1186/s40594-020-00227-2,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Growing a growth mindset: characterizing how and why undergraduate students' mindsets change,"Abstract Background The extent to which students view their intelligence as improvable (i.e., their “mindset”) influences students’ thoughts, behaviors, and ultimately their academic success. Thus, understanding the development of students’ mindsets is of great interest to education scholars working to understand and promote student success. Recent evidence suggests that students’ mindsets continue to develop and change during their first year of college. We built on this work by characterizing how mindsets change and identifying the factors that may be influencing this change among upper-level STEM students. We surveyed 875 students in an organic chemistry course at four points throughout the semester and interviewed a subset of students about their mindsets and academic experiences. Results Latent growth modeling revealed that students tended to shift towards viewing intelligence as a stable trait (i.e., shifted towards a stronger fixed mindset and a weaker growth mindset). This trend was particularly strong for students who persistently struggled in the course. From qualitative analysis of students’ written survey responses and interview transcripts, we determined that students attribute their beliefs about intelligence to five factors: academic experiences, observing peers, deducing logically, taking societal cues, and formal learning. Conclusions Extensive prior research has focused on the influence of mindset on academic performance. Our results corroborate this relationship and further suggest that academic performance influences students’ mindsets. Thus, our results imply that mindset and academic performance constitute a positive feedback loop. Additionally, we identified factors that influence undergraduates’ mindset beliefs, which could be leveraged by researchers and practitioners to design more persuasive and effective mindset interventions to promote student success.","[{""name"": ""Lisa B.

10.14742/ajet.5477,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Facilitating student engagement through educational technology in higher education: A systematic review in the field of arts and humanities,"Understanding how educational technology can enhance student engagement is becoming increasingly necessary in higher education, and particularly so in arts and humanities, given the communicative nature of courses. This narrative systematic review synthesises 42 peer-reviewed arts and humanities articles published between 2007-2016, indexed in four international databases. The results indicate that the majority of research has been undertaken in language learning, predominantly in East Asian countries, with limited grounding of research in theory. This review found that educational technology supports student engagement, with behavioural engagement by far the most prevalent dimension. Affective engagement was the lowest observed dimension, with affective disengagement the most prevalent negative dimension. Blogs, mobile learning, and assessment tools were the most effective at promoting engagement. However, caution and education in how to use technology are needed, as any use not underpinned by effective and informed pedagogy can also lead to students feeling overwhelmed and disengaging from learning. Further research is needed on online collaboration, as well as international courses that offer cross-cultural opportunities for language use, and the increased use of qualitative methods is also advised.","[{""name"": ""Svenja Bedenlier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Melissa Bond"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katja Buntins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olaf Zawacki-Richter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Kerres"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.3102/0013189X20902822,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,(Re)Defining Urban Education: A Conceptual Review and Empirical Exploration of the Definition of Urban Education,"Generally, educational studies do not problematize the definition of urban education or examine the positionality of sites along a spectrum of urban districts and schools. This study addresses the definitional gap by (a) examining the conceptualization of urban education through an integrative review of prior definitional research and (b) exploring how an urban district may be defined in empirical terms. Our findings indicate six categories are typically used to define urban education: (a) population/location/geography, (b) enrollment, (c) demographic composition of students, (d) resources in schools, (e) disparities and educational inequality, and (f) social and economic context. The results indicate that deficit-oriented language permeates prevailing definitions of urban education and that large-city-centered conceptualizations of urban education may overlook a substantial number of smaller districts with similar levels of educational inequality and diversity.","[{""name"": ""Richard O.

This is also fueled by parallel research in areas such as perception and control of robots, safe human–robot interaction, wearable systems, and the underpinning flexible/printed electronics technologies. Some of these are being routed to AVs. Growing number of network of sensors are being integrated into the vehicles for multimodal interaction to draw correct inferences of the communicative cues from the user and to vary the interaction dynamics depending on the cognitive state of the user and contextual driving scenario. In response to this growing trend, this timely article presents a comprehensive review of the technologies that are being used or developed to perceive user's intentions for natural and intuitive in‐vehicle interaction. The challenges that are needed to be overcome to attain truly interactive AVs and their potential solutions are discussed along with various new avenues for future research.","[{""name"": ""Prajval

10.1111/bjet.13206,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,How student perceptions about online learning difficulty influenced their satisfaction during Canada's Covid-19 response,"AbstractThe COVID‐19 pandemic has posed a significant challenge to higher education and forced academic institutions across the globe to abruptly shift to remote teaching. Because of the emergent transition, higher education institutions continuously face difficulties in creating satisfactory online learning experiences that adhere to the new norms. This study investigates the transition to online learning during Covid‐19 to identify factors that influenced students' satisfaction with the online learning environment. Adopting a mixed‐method design, we find that students' experience with online learning can be negatively affected by information overload, and perceived technical skill requirements, and describe qualitative evidence that suggest a lack of social interactions, class format, and ambiguous communication also affected perceived learning. This study suggests that to digitalize higher education successfully, institutions need to redesign students' learning experience systematically and re‐evaluate traditional pedagogical approaches in the online context. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic University transitions to online learning during the Covid‐19 pandemic were undertaken by faculty and students who had little online learning experience. The transition to online learning was often described as having a negative influence on students' learning experience and mental health. Varieties of cognitive load are known predictors of effective online learning experiences and satisfaction. What this paper adds Information overload and perceptions of technical abilities are demonstrated to predict students' difficulty and satisfaction with online learning. Students express negative attitudes towards factors that influence information overload, technical factors, and asynchronous course formats. Communication quantity was not found to be a significant factor in predicting either perceived difficulty or negative attitudes. Implications for practice and/or policy We identify ways that educators in higher education can improve their online offerings and implementations during future disruptions. We offer insights into student experience concerning online learning environments during an abrupt transition.

A sample of 217 first-year Chinese college students, who studied in a smart classroom environment for one semester, completed a survey that measures their smart classroom preferences, learning motivation, learning strategy, peer interaction, and HOTS. The results indicated that peer interaction and learning motivation had a direct impact on students’ HOTS. Furthermore, indirect effects were found between students’ learning strategy and HOTS through the mediator peer interaction, and between smart classroom preferences and HOTS through the following: learning motivation, the combination of learning strategy and peer interaction, and the combination of learning motivation, learning strategy and peer interaction. Based on these findings, this study recommends that instructors teaching in a smart learning environment should focus on improving peer interaction and learning motivation, as well as smart classroom preferences and learning strategy, to hone students’ HOTS.","[{""name"": ""Kaili Lu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Harrison H.

We explored university educators’ eLearning perspectives, practices, and future adoption intentions. In-depth interviews with 14 educators from a large university in Singapore were conducted. Educators had limited eLearning experience prior to COVID-19 emergency eLearning and expressed strong preferences for in-person sessions. The short notice to switch to eLearning and lack of eLearning experiences created stress and anxiety. Educators responded by making efforts that allowed for teaching to continue, conceding that some expectations had to be readjusted. Despite many obstacles, educators acknowledged reduced apprehension towards eLearning. Reflecting upon their experiences, educators highlighted opportunities and challenges of eLearning. A key opportunity was increased flexibility, which enabled students to learn independently. Additionally, eLearning triggered reflection upon educators teaching which could lead to improved practice. Reduction of some barriers to student–educator interaction were also mentioned. Key challenges include creating social, emotional, and cognitive engagement, catering to diverse student needs and providing holistic learning experiences. Considering opportunities and challenges, educators envisioned that eLearning would feature in their future teaching if practical and helpful for achieving educational goals. Hybrid or blended learning approaches were preferred, but support enabling the implementation of technology-based and pedagogy-informed teaching is necessary.","[{""name"": ""Andre Matthias Müller"", ""affiliation"": [""Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117549, Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Charlene Goh"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dentistry, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 119085, Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Li Zhen Lim"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dentistry, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 119085, Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoli Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117549, Singapore"", ""Faculty of Dentistry, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 119085, Singapore""]}]","[""10.1177/1478210320935671"", ""10.1080/13523260.2020.1761749"", ""10.1007/BF02299597"", ""10.37074/jalt.2020.3.1.7"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.2467"", ""10.1080/03075079.2014.942276"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10117-3"", ""10.1093/intqhc/mzm042"", ""10.1177/1609406919874596"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.24059/olj.v22i1.1175"", ""10.1177/0047239520934018"", ""10.1111/jcal.12423"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00910.x"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.10.002"", ""10.1080/14623940500106187"", ""10.24059/olj.v19i4.561"", ""10.1080/01587910903236312"", ""10.14742/ajet.3913"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2019.1659211"", ""10.1177/1049732319889354""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1186/s41239-020-00199-x,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,A balancing act: a window into online student engagement experiences,"AbstractThis article reports on a qualitative study which explored online student engagement experiences in a higher education institution. There are very few studies providing in-depth perspectives on the engagement experiences of online students. The project adopted a case study approach, following 24 online students over one academic year. The setting for the study was an undergraduate online Humanities programme at Dublin City University. The research question for the study was:What themes are central to online student engagement experiences?Data was collected from participant-generated learning portfolios and semi-structured interviews and analysed following a data-led thematic approach. The five central themes that make up the study’s findings highlight key issues of students’ sense of community, their support networks, balancing study with life, confidence, and their learning approaches. The findings of this study indicate that successful online student engagement was influenced by a number of psychosocial factors such as peer community, an engaging online teacher, and confidence and by structural factors such as lifeload and course design. One limitation of the study is that it is a relatively small, qualitative study, its findings provide insights into how online degrees can support online students to achieve successful and engaging learning experiences.","[{""name"": ""Orna Farrell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Brunton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.14742/ajet.828"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v13i4.1283"", ""10.1080/01587919.2010.513955"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1264927"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1080/09523987.2018.1548783"", ""10.1080/1533290X.2016.1206781"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v15i4.1840"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v19i2.3382"", ""10.1080/03323310802597333"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2013.813405"", ""10.1080/01587919.2018.1457948"", ""10.1080/02680513.2016.1208553"", ""10.1002/ss.84"", ""10.1080/01587919.2018.1553565"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v17i5.2024"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2007.08.002"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.598505"", ""10.1080/07294360.2017.1344197"", ""10.1007/s10734-019-00429-w"", ""10.1080/02601370.2014.884177"", ""10.1080/01425692.2014.973017"", ""10.1080/0268051042000177836"", ""10.1080/01587919.2015.1019970"", ""10.5153/sro.1615"", ""10.1080/01587919.2017.1322457"", ""10.1007/s40593-018-0170-7"", ""10.61468/jofdl.v22i2.336"", ""10.4324/9780203932353"", ""10.4324/9780203416563"", ""10.14742/ajet.3913"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v13i1.1078"", ""10.1080/01587919.2017.1299561"", ""10.1080/07377363.2013.836823"", ""10.1080/09523980802107237""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Addressing the role of GenAI in teaching and learning has become an urgent task. This study reports the results of a survey comparing educators’ (n = 68) and university students’ (n = 158) perceptions on the appropriate use of GenAI in the writing process. The survey included representations of user prompts and output from ChatGPT, a GenAI chatbot, for each of six tasks of the writing process (brainstorming, outlining, writing, revising, feedback, and evaluating). Survey respondents were asked to differentiate between various uses of GenAI for these tasks, which were divided between student and teacher use. Results indicate minor disagreement between students and teachers on acceptable use of GenAI tools in the writing process, as well as classroom and institutional-level lack of preparedness for GenAI. These results imply the need for explicit guidelines and teacher professional development on the use of GenAI in educational contexts. This study can contribute to evidence-based guidelines on the integration of GenAI in teaching and learning.","[{""name"": ""Alex Barrett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Austin Pack"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/tesj.759"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00285-9"", ""10.1136/bmj.314.7080.572"", ""10.56297/BKAM1691/WIEO1749"", ""10.1080/08957347.2012.635502"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.00280"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100118"", ""10.3354/esep00195"", ""10.1002/JAAL.00100"", ""10.1177/21582440231181296"", ""10.1080/14703297.2023.2195846"", ""10.31002/metathesis.v5i1.3519"", ""10.1111/jcal.12577"", ""10.1002/geo2.8"", ""10.3102/0091732X18821125"", ""10.3102/0034654320914744"", ""10.1093/elt/ccy044"", ""10.1007/s10639-022-11200-7"", ""10.1016/j.tree.2023.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004"", ""10.2202/1940-1639.1115"", ""10.1007/s40979-023-00130-7"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4468181"", ""10.3390/educsci13040410"", ""10.14742/ajet.3795"", ""10.1002/tesq.3253"", ""10.56297/buka4060/vrro1747"", ""10.2307/3588141"", ""10.1177/1747016116654065"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511667190.044"", ""10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.17"", ""10.1016/j.jeap.2004.07.007"", ""10.1080/2194587X.2021.2017977"", ""10.1515/jccall-2023-0008"", ""10.5070/L214151790"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2022.909802"", ""10.1002/tesj.716"", ""10.1080/07294360701310813"", ""10.1080/13538320701629202"", ""10.3389/feduc.2023.1183162"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2019.100439""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13101,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Emergency education effects on teacher abilities and motivation to use digital technologies,"AbstractTo identify factors that can contribute toward supporting educator adoption of digital technologies beyond the emergency remote teaching response to COVID‐19, we investigated how teachers’ motivation and abilities related to the use of digital technologies for teaching changed since the onset of the pandemic. Two surveys and interviews were conducted with school teachers in Spain. The first survey was completed at the onset of the COVID‐19 lockdown, the second survey and interviews in the weeks leading up to the school year that followed. Survey questions were from SELFIE and the Work Tasks Motivation Scale for Teachers. Moreover we analysed the type of advice teachers sought on Twitter during the lockdown and post‐lockdown periods. Results indicate that teachers believe their proficiency in using digital technologies for teaching has improved. Teacher confidence in using technology for preparing lessons, class teaching, assessing and providing feedback, and for communicating with students and families has increased along with teacher motivation to improve their digital skills and use digital technologies for teaching. Teacher advice seeking on Twitter seemed to shift from serving immediate instructional needs to focussing on professional development and the creation of their own digital content. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic There is a need to enhance educator digital skills and competences for a digital transformation of education. The emergency remote teaching response to COVID‐19 made educators increase their usage of technology. What this paper adds Teachers’ motivation and abilities related to the use of digital technologies for teaching have changed since the onset of the pandemic. Teachers believe their proficiency in using digital technologies for teaching has improved. Teacher confidence in using technology for preparing lessons, class teaching, assessing and providing feedback, and communication has increased. Teacher motivation to use digital technologies in their teaching practice increased during the pandemic. Teacher advice seeking on Twitter shifted from serving immediate instructional needs to focusing on professional development and the creation of their own digital content. Implications for practice and/or policy COVID‐19 has rapidly advanced teacher digital skills and has altered their relationships with digital technologies for teaching and learning. Teachers have acquired a range of new experiences related to using digital technologies for teaching from which future initiatives can build upon.","[{""name"": ""Marc Beardsley"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Information and Communication Technologies Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Laia Albó"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Information and Communication Technologies Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Pablo Aragón"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Information and Communication Technologies Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Davinia Hernández‐Leo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Information and Communication Technologies Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona Spain""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-57717-9_23"", ""10.1080/10494820.2015.1113709"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104080"", ""10.1111/bjet.12695"", ""10.1016/0092-6566(85)90023-6"", ""10.3390/fi12060094"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.02.001"", ""10.1177/1069072707305764"", ""10.1111/1475‐6773.12117"", ""10.1080/02607476.2020.1799709"", ""10.1145/1541948.1541999"", ""10.1109/IISA.2019.8900666"", ""10.1109/RITA.2020.3033208"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.05.016"", ""10.1080/15391523.2017.1343691"", ""10.2791/54070"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1809650"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.537"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.06.006"", ""10.1111/bjet.12705"", ""10.46786/ac20.8253"", ""10.1007/s40299‐019‐00467‐z"", ""10.1080/02607476.2020.1802583"", ""10.3390/ijerph17218002"", ""10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.01.010"", ""10.1080/02607476.2020.1801330"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1694945"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1820981"", ""10.1002/pa.2503"", ""10.70725/286698bovllj"", ""10.1007/s11031-020-09827-5""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In contrast to conventional robots composed of rigid materials, soft robots made from soft materials offer remarkable advantages in achieving various adaptive locomotion, manipulating delicate objects, providing safe human–robot interaction and adapting to confined environments due to their excellent compliance and adaptability, which have the potential to be widely used in numerous applications such as medical, exploration and rescue devices, etc. Unlike ﬁxed‐morphology soft robots, modularization of soft robots is a low‐cost and rapid strategy that enables them to adapt to changing tasks and environments by rearranging the connectivity of module units and attain complex functionalities such as self‐assembly, self‐repair, or self‐replication.

Compared with conventional medical robotic systems, microrobots may be capable of reaching more narrow and vulnerable regions in the human body with minimal damage. However, limited by the small scale of microrobots, microprocessors, power supplies, and sensors can hardly be integrated on‐board. Thus, new strategies for the actuation and feedback for microrobots need to be explored. Furthermore, the open‐loop control method accomplished by operators may lack accuracy, and long‐duration operation could bring a severe physical challenge in many applications. Consequently, the automatic control of microrobots with the aid of control theories is developed to improve the control efficiency and precision. To further promote the automation level of microrobots, machine learning algorithms are expected to provide a solution to let microrobots adapt to more dynamic environments and undertake more complex medical tasks. Herein, a systematic introduction of the manipulation of microrobots from open‐loop to closed‐loop control is given in this review. It is envisioned that microrobots will play an important role in future biomedical applications.","[{""name"": ""Jialin Jiang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering

10.1111/bjet.12954,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Can an immersive virtual reality simulation increase students' interest and career aspirations in science?,"AbstractScience‐related competencies are demanded in many fields, but attracting more students to scientific educations remains a challenge. This paper uses two studies to investigate the value of using Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) laboratory simulations in science education. In Study 1, 99 (52 male, 47 female) seventh (49) and eighth (50) grade students between 13 and 16 years of age used an IVR laboratory safety simulation with a pre‐ to posttest design. Results indicated an overall increase in interest in science and self‐efficacy, but only females reported an increase in science career aspirations. Study 2 was conducted with 131 (47 male, 84 female) second (77) and third (54) year high school students aged 17 to 20 and used an experimental design to compare the value of using an IVR simulation or a video of the simulation on the topic of DNA‐analysis. The IVR group reported significantly higher gains from pre‐ to posttest on interest, and social‐outcome expectations than the video group. Furthermore, both groups had significant gains in self‐efficacy and physical outcome expectations, but the increase in career aspirations and self‐outcome expectations did not reach statistical significance. Thus, results from the two studies suggest that appropriately developed and implemented IVR simulations can address some of the challenges currently facing science education. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Science‐related skills are becoming increasingly important as these are in high demand, not only in traditional science occupations, but also in other fields of work and in our daily lives. Thus, it is desirable to inspire students to pursue careers within science. According to the social cognitive career theory (SCCT), students’ educational choice goals (ie, career aspirations) are shaped by their interests, self‐efficacy and outcome expectations. Students report low levels of interest in science and several studies find that positive attitudes toward science decline with age, from primary through the secondary school years. Unfavorable attitudes toward science could be attributed to science education failing to engage students at a satisfactory level. Immersive Virtual reality (IVR) is touted for its potential to offer inspiring learning experiences that increase interest and self‐efficacy. What this paper adds A systematic investigation of how IVR laboratory simulations can increase science interest and career aspirations in middle school (aged 13 to 16) and high school (aged 17 to 20) students. Evidence that IVR‐based learning experiences can significantly increase students’ interest in science topics. An indication that an IVR‐based simulation led to a significant pre‐ to posttest increase in science aspirations among 13‐ to 16‐year‐old female students. Implications for practice and/or policy IVR‐based simulations are specifically relevant when the goal of an educational intervention is to increase students’ situational interest and social‐outcome expectations in a science topic. Provided the right instructional design, IVR might help bridge the gender difference within science education in middle school (ie, students between ages of 13 and 16). Although IVR‐based simulations can increase situational interest, longitudinal interventions are needed to create lasting effects on career aspirations in science.","[{""name"": ""Guido Makransky"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gustav B.

10.1186/s41239-023-00420-7,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Acceptance of artificial intelligence among pre-service teachers: a multigroup analysis,"AbstractOver the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI)-based educational applications in education. As pre-service teachers’ attitudes towards educational technology that utilizes AI have a potential impact on the learning outcomes of their future students, it is essential to know more about pre-service teachers’ acceptance of AI. The aims of this study are (1) to discover what factors determine pre-service teachers’ intentions to utilize AI-based educational applications and (2) to determine whether gender differences exist within determinants that affect those behavioral intentions. A sample of 452 pre-service teachers (325 female) participated in a survey at one German university. Based on a prominent technology acceptance model, structural equation modeling, measurement invariance, and multigroup analysis were carried out. The results demonstrated that eight out of nine hypotheses were supported; perceived ease of use (β = 0.297***) and perceived usefulness (β = 0.501***) were identified as primary factors predicting pre-service teachers’ intention to use AI. Furthermore, the latent mean differences results indicated that two constructs, AI anxiety (z = − 3.217**) and perceived enjoyment (z = 2.556*), were significantly different by gender. In addition, it is noteworthy that the paths from AI anxiety to perceived ease of use (p = 0.018*) and from perceived ease of use to perceived usefulness (p = 0.002**) are moderated by gender. This study confirms the determinants influencing the behavioral intention based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3 of German pre-service teachers to use AI-based applications in education. Furthermore, the results demonstrate how essential it is to address gender-specific aspects in teacher education because there is a high percentage of female pre-service teachers, in general. This study contributes to state of the art in AI-powered education and teacher education.","[{""name"": ""Chengming Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jessica Schießl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lea Plößl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Florian Hofmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michaela Gläser-Zikuda"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.19173/irrodl.v14i5.1631"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-69746-3_24"", ""10.11591/ijece.v10i6.pp6484-6496"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02686-8_85"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100099"", ""10.1111/1464-0597.00092"", ""10.1080/10494820.2016.1232277"", ""10.5898/JHRI.3.2.Beer"", ""10.4324/9781315757421"", ""10.1086/703462"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2011.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2011.11.007"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1635395"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100002"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM0902_5"", ""10.1080/10447318.2022.2049145"", ""10.3390/su12166597"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.4135/9781446249222.n49"", ""10.1007/s11199-019-01052-w"", ""10.5897/ERR2015.2119"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02204"", ""10.1111/bjet.12864"", ""10.1080/15391523.2011.10782576"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10664-3"", ""10.1007/s11423-021-09973-8"", ""10.1111/bjet.13144"", ""10.1002/asi.23867"", ""10.4018/978-1-7998-2104-5.ch015"", ""10.1080/02601370210156745"", ""10.1007/s10639-013-9302-8"", ""10.1007/978-981-33-4126-5"", ""10.1016/j.im.2003.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101410"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v16i4.2355"", ""10.3860/taper.v18i2.1327"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2022.856405"", ""10.1186/s40594-021-00295-y"", ""10.28945/1970"", ""10.1007/s10209-014-0348-1"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09933-z"", ""10.1007/s00426-019-01285-0"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.02.005"", ""10.1504/IJMLO.2018.095130"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0130-7"", ""10.14324/LRE.19.1.05"", ""10.4324/9780203887011"", ""10.18637/jss.v048.i02"", ""10.1145/3362789.3362918"", ""10.1016/j.im.2006.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.03.001"", ""10.1016/0360-1315(93)90085-W"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-09859-y"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2005.04.013"", ""10.1007/s10639-014-9335-7"", ""10.1109/RITA.2021.3052848"", ""10.1108/10650741011073770"", ""10.1080/10494821003714632"", ""10.14742/ajet.1672"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.05.017"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.03.002"", ""10.1080/10494820.2011.641674"", ""10.17275/per.22.85.9.4"", ""10.1111/bjet.12834"", ""10.1177/109442810031002"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.2008.00192.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1674887"", ""10.14742/ajet.1890"", ""10.1080/10705511.2017.1387859"", ""10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100041"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1155/2021/8812542"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100025"", ""10.1177/0192636506291521""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

The distal phalanges of the 3D printed hand presented herein have inherent soft capacitive touch or pressure sensors and embedded electronics. Materials such as thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), silver paint, conductive polylactic acid composite, graphite ink, etc. are explored to develop five different variants of the sensors using a modified 3D printer, which is capable of extruding conductive ink, metal paste, and polymers. The best‐performing 3D printed soft capacitive touch sensors, formed with silver paint and soft rubber (Ecoflex 00‐30), are integrated on the distal phalanges of the 3D printed robotic hand. These sensors exhibit a stable response with sensitivity of 0.00348 kPa−1 for pressure &lt;10 kPa and 0.00134 kPa−1 for higher pressure. To demonstrate the practical applicability, the 3D printed hand with embedded soft capacitive touch sensors is used for interacting with everyday objects. The tightly integrated sensing elements within the 3D printed structures, as presented herein, can pave the way for a new generation of truly smart material systems that can possibly change their appearance and shape autonomously.","[{""name"": ""Markellos Ntagios"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Habib Nassar"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Abhilash Pullanchiyodan"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""William Taube Navaraj"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Ravinder Dahiya"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8QQ Glasgow UK""]}]","[""10.1109/JPROC.2018.2890729"", ""10.1038/nature14543"", ""10.1126/science.1261689"", ""10.1002/j.2637-496X.2015.tb00824.x"", ""10.1002/adfm.201606287"", ""10.1038/s41528-018-0045-x"", ""10.1002/adma.201304018"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aau9795"", ""10.3389/fnins.2017.00501"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0579-1"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2013.2279056"", ""10.1038/nmat3711"", ""10.1002/adma.201302240"", ""10.1002/aisy.201900051"", ""10.1109/TRO.2009.2033627"", ""10.1080/01691864.2015.1095653"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2011.02.038"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.11.034"", ""10.5402/2012/208760"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.02.012"", ""10.1126/science.aaf2093"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2011.11.003"", ""10.1080/05704928.2017.1287082"", ""10.1016/j.addma.2017.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.dental.2015.09.018"", ""10.1108/AA-06-2013-055"", ""10.1108/aa.2012.03332baa.010"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.05.014"", ""10.1038/nature21003"", ""10.1002/adfm.201303220"", ""10.1002/adfm.200600434"", ""10.1038/micronano.2015.13"", ""10.1088/0960-1317/20/12/125029"", ""10.1002/adfm.200701216"", ""10.1038/ncomms1929"", ""10.1002/adfm.201203589"", ""10.1002/mop.28327"", ""10.1109/TCPMT.2019.2919187"", ""10.1002/admt.201600013"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0049365"", ""10.1002/adma.201003734"", ""10.1002/adma.201400334"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.08.033"", ""10.1186/s13036-015-0001-4"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2311810"", ""10.3390/s17051166"", ""10.1007/s12541-015-0181-3"", ""10.5194/jsss-7-169-2018"", ""10.5114/pdia.2013.38359"", ""10.3390/s16101667"", ""10.1109/LAWP.2016.2516101""]","['Engineering', 'Neuroscience']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.7821/naer.2020.7.578,JOURNAL OF NEW APPROACHES IN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0401 Education,Evaluation of Teacher Digital Competence Frameworks Through Expert Judgement: the Use of the Expert Competence Coefficient,"Abstract In this paper, different proposals made by national and international organizations and institutions on Teacher Digital Literacy are taken into account. The 7 most commonly used competence frameworks in international contexts are presented for evaluation through expert judgment. Next, the most suitable for the subsequent realization of a t-MOOC on Teacher Digital Literacy was selected. The selection of these experts was based on seven criteria that helped to establish the expert knowledge coefficient (EKC). This strategy served to obtain the viability of the selected sample. A total of 412 people, 155 experts and 257 non-experts participated in this study. After conducting the expert judgment, in a single round, it was concluded that the European Framework of Digital Competence for Teachers DigCompEdu is the most valued and adequate to be used as reference for the formative t-MOOC, followed by INTEF. This result is logical, since the latter is inspired by the former. These findings do not question the validity of the other competency frameworks, but the preferences granted by the judges.","[{""name"": ""Julio Cabero-Almenara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rosalía Romero-Tena"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Antonio Palacios-Rodríguez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.13042/brp.2013.65202"", ""10.30827/profesorado.v23i3.9421"", ""10.21071/edmetic.v9i1.12462"", ""10.2760/38842"", ""10.12795/pixelbit.2019.i56.05"", ""10.12795/pixelbit.2016.i48.07"", ""10.18381/Ap.v9n2.993"", ""10.5220/0007679005410548"", ""10.19053/22160159.5217"", ""10.17516/1997-1370-0387"", ""10.7821/naer.2019.1.370"", ""10.5944/educXX1.15536"", ""10.1186/s41239-016-0009-y"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00684.x"", ""10.7821/naer.2020.1.459"", ""10.12795/pixelbit.2018.i53.02"", ""10.24310/innoeduca.2019.v5i2.5600"", ""10.1080/11356405.2019.1603274 10.1080/11356405.2019.1603274"", ""10.4438/1988-592X-RE-2011-361-140"", ""10.12795/pixelbit.2018.i52.04"", ""10.30827/PROFESORADO.V22I3.8001 10.30827/PROFESORADO.V22I3.8001"", ""10.3916/c52-2017-07"", ""10.14507/epaa.27.3822"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9591-010.1007/s11423-018-9591-0"", ""10.1080/17439884.2019.1614953""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

10.1111/jcal.12520,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,"Motivation, engagement, and performance across multiple virtual reality sessions and levels of immersion","AbstractThis study investigated changes in learners' motivation, engagement, performance, and spatial reasoning over time and across different levels of virtual reality (VR) immersion. Undergraduate participants explored a virtual solar system via a moderately immersive or highly immersive VR platform over three sessions. In a third condition, participants initially learned with moderate immersion and transitioned to higher immersion after the second session. Following research on novelty effects, we explored whether subjective experiences and performance would decline over time (e.g., decreasing motivation or performance) as participants became familiar with the virtual environment and tools. However, we hypothesized that transitional immersion (i.e., switching from moderate to higher immersion) might lead to a renewed sense of novelty. Results suggested that both moderate and higher levels of immersion were motivating, engaging, and supportive of learning. In contrast to predictions based on novelty effects, these outcomes did not decline overall as learners gained familiarity with the systems. However, transitional immersion emerged as a promising and testable pedagogical approach for future VR education. All participants also showed gains in spatial reasoning.","[{""name"": ""Wen Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""Engineering Education Systems and Design, The Polytechnic School, Ira A.

10.1111/ejed.12413,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Comparative research on shadow education: Achievements, challenges, and the agenda ahead","AbstractThis paper reviews research on private supplementary tutoring, widely known as shadow education, during the initial decades of the present century. It takes as its starting point the first global study of the phenomenon, published in 1999, though notes some scattered national and subnational literature prior to that date. During the initial two decades, great expansion of the research on shadow education brought more depth and stronger awareness of commonalities and differences in different cultures. From initial mapping and identification of factors shaping demand came work on ecosystems with deeper sociological and economic analyses, together with greater attention to research methods. The agenda ahead will need to keep up with changing times, e.g., through the impact of technology, and develop stronger interdisciplinarity to explore additional domains. It will also need continued attention to definitions and methods.","[{""name"": ""Wei Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Curriculum and Instruction (ICI) Centre for International Research in Supplementary Tutoring (CIRIST) Faculty of Education East China Normal University (ECNU) Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Bray"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education Centre for International Research in Supplementary Tutoring (CIRIST) East China Normal University (ECNU) Shanghai China"", ""Faculty of Education UNESCO Chair in Comparative Education The University of Hong Kong China""]}]","[""10.1108/S1479-3679(2013)0000022007"", ""10.1515/9780804790482"", ""10.3102/01623737023001001"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-1260-6"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4304-5"", ""10.1177/2096531119890142"", ""10.1086/706776"", ""10.5353/th_b5610944"", ""10.1353/sof.2010.0105"", ""10.1353/sof.2010.0105"", ""10.1007/978-981-4451-27-7_3"", ""10.1080/02188791.2015.1064356"", ""10.1086/383073"", ""10.1007/s40299‐013‐0069‐x"", ""10.1080/01596306.2018.1461063"", ""10.1023/A:1021374811658"", ""10.1353/sof.2010.0063"", ""10.1080/17508487.2019.1708765"", ""10.1080/02680939.2018.1458995"", ""10.1007/978-94-6209-237-2_4"", ""10.1086/671346"", ""10.1007/BF00367916"", ""10.1086/648186"", ""10.18296/cm.0027"", ""10.1080/00220272.2019.1568583"", ""10.1086/659142"", ""10.1007/s12564‐009‐9064‐6"", ""10.1177/016146810710900507"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3534829"", ""10.30926/ecnuroe2018010304"", ""10.3224/ijree.v6i1.04"", ""10.1080/02188791.2014.969194"", ""10.15345/iojes.2017.03.004"", ""10.4000/ries.3120"", ""10.1146/annurev‐soc‐081715‐074341"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-40317-5_24"", ""10.2307/132321"", ""10.35362/rie642367"", ""10.1007/s12564‐012‐9236‐7"", ""10.1108/S1479-3679(2013)0000022012"", ""10.1080/01596306.2015.1061976"", ""10.1086/229942"", ""10.1080/09500693.2016.1147661"", ""10.54676/VVRO7638"", ""10.1007/s12564‐009‐9065‐5"", ""10.1596/0-8213-6170-8"", ""10.1080/02188791.2017.1345719"", ""10.3402/edui.v5.24058"", ""10.1080/02188791.2014.960798"", ""10.1177/2096531119840868"", ""10.1080/02680939.2016.1219769"", ""10.4324/9781315694382-30""]",['Social Sciences'],['Demography'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02294-z,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Anxiety, perceived stress and coping strategies in nursing students: a cross-sectional, correlational, descriptive study","Abstract Background For many nursing students, clinical training represents a stressful experience. The levels of stress and anxiety may vary during students’ educational training, depending on their ability to adopt behavioral strategies for coping with stress, and other factors. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between anxiety, perceived stress, and the coping strategies used by nursing students during their clinical training. Methods A cross-sectional correlational descriptive study. The sample consisted of 190 nursing students enrolled in the Nursing Faculty of Ciudad Real University in Spain. Participants provided data on background characteristics and completed the following instruments: the Perceived Stress Scale; the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Coping Behavior Inventory. Relationships between scores were examined using Spearman’s rho. Results The mean age of participants was 20.71 ± 3.89 years (range 18–46 years). Approximately half of the students (47.92%) indicated a moderate level of stress with a mean Perceived Stress Scale score of 22.78 (±8.54). Senior nursing students perceived higher levels of stress than novice students. The results showed a significant correlation for perceived stress and state anxiety (r = 0.463, p &lt; .000) and also for trait anxiety (r = 0.718, p &lt; .000). There was also a significant relationship between the total amount of perceived stress and the following domains of the coping behavior inventory: problem solving (r = −.452, p &lt; .01), self-criticism (r = .408 p &lt; .01), wishful thinking (r = .459, p &lt; .01), social support(r = −.220, p &lt; .01), cognitive restructuring (r = −.375, p &lt; .01), and social withdrawal (r = .388, p &lt; .01). In the current study, the coping strategy most frequently used by students was problem-solving, followed by social support and cognitive restructuring. Conclusions Nursing students in our study presented a moderate level of stress, in addition there was a significant correlation with anxiety. Nursing teachers and clinical preceptors/mentors should be encouraged to develop programs to help prepare nursing students to cope with the challenges they are about to face during their clinical placements.","[{""name"": ""María Dolores Onieva-Zafra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juan José Fernández-Muñoz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elia Fernández-Martínez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francisco José García-Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ana Abreu-Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""María Laura Parra-Fernández"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/20009666.2016.1270806"", ""10.1016/j.ienj.2014.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2017.05.007"", ""10.3109/09638237.2016.1139067"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2014.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2012.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2015.01.022"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.02.015"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.01.018"", ""10.4040/jkan.2019.49.4.495"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05183.x"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2018.05.027"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2004.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2004.05.004"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02674.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2007.11.003"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2000.02251.x"", ""10.1080/09638237.2016.1244721"", ""10.1017/S1138741600006004"", ""10.1007/BF01173478"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1133-2"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2017.11.029"", ""10.1111/inm.12054"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2013.02.021"", ""10.1111/ppc.12223"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.01.029"", ""10.1111/jpm.12273"", ""10.1080/10376178.2015.1010259"", ""10.1016/j.wombi.2017.03.004"", ""10.3928/01484834-20150814-07"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.02.003""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

On the one hand, the impact of AI in the field of education is addressed from the perspective of the Sustainable Development Goals (specifically, SDG4) of the UNESCO 2030 Agenda, describing the opportunities for its use by teachers and students. On the other hand, there is an emphasis on the uncertainties caused by the fears of some who think, for example, that AI robots will replace human teachers. The methodology used is based on a documentary review, supported by reports and studies conducted by researchers as well as institutions and organizations committed to the development of AI and its capacity for action in the educational field, and the ethical questions that experts and organizations around the world are raising. The results seek to influence and deepen the ethical implications that AI can have in the educational field. Finally, some critical questions about the ethics and challenges of AI in education are proposed, concluding with the need to add proposals with new research and political actions which could lead to the creation of an ethical observatory of AI for education. El artículo analiza y reflexiona sobre aspectos coyunturales de la ética en el uso de los sistemas de Inteligencia Artificial (IA) en contextos educativos. Se aborda, por un lado, el impacto de la IA en el campo de la Educación, desde la perspectiva de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (concretamente, ODS4) de la Agenda 2030 de la UNESCO, describiendo las oportunidades en su uso por parte de docentes y estudiantes. Por otro, se hace hincapié en las incertidumbres, sobrevenidas por los temores de algunos que piensan, por ejemplo, que los robots de IA reemplazarán a los profesores humanos. La metodología utilizada se basa en la revisión documental que parte de informes y estudios de investigadores, así como de instituciones y organismos comprometidos con el desarrollo de la Inteligencia Artificial y de su capacidad de acción en el ámbito educativo, para, a partir de ahí, abordar las cuestiones éticas que se vienen planteando por parte de expertos y de organizaciones de todo el mundo. Los resultados obtenidos buscan incidir y profundizar en las implicaciones éticas que la Inteligencia Artificial puede tener en el ámbito educativo. Finalmente, se proponen algunas cuestiones clave de la ética y los retos de la IA en la educación concluyéndose en la necesidad de sumar propuestas con nuevas investigaciones y acciones políticas, retos que podrían materializarse con la creación de un observatorio ético de IA para la educación.","[{""name"": ""Jesús-Miguel Flores-Vivar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francisco-José García-Peñalvo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.14201/eks20151614457"", ""10.54988/cv.2022.1.1022"", ""10.3916/C65-2020-04"", ""10.4185/RLCS-2022-1534"", ""10.14201/eks.20327"", ""10.5944/ried.25.2.32320"", ""10.5772/intechopen.96498"", ""10.5209/esmp.66993"", ""10.1016/j.future.2018.09.011"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00239-1"", ""10.52188/jpfs.v5i1.224"", ""10.1109/MRA.2016.2636372"", ""10.1007/s40593-014-0028-6"", ""10.1787/589b283f-en"", ""10.18371/fcaptp.v2i33.207246"", ""10.3390/joitmc8010004"", ""10.31235/osf.io/vx4zr"", ""10.31921/doxacom.n29a8"", ""10.1177/1729881418825186""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Grounded in critical race theory and approaches to discourse study including narrative inquiry, life history, and autoethnography, counter-narratives have found a home in multicultural education, culturally sensitive pedagogy, and other approaches to teaching for diversity. This chapter provides a systematic literature review that explores the place of counter-narratives in educational pedagogy and research. Based on our thematic analysis, we argue that the potential of counter-narratives in both pedagogy and research has been limited due to the lack of a unified methodology that can result in transformative action for educational equity. The chapter concludes by proposing critical counter-narrative as a transformative methodology that includes three key components: (1) critical race theory as a model of inquiry, (2) critical reflection and generativity as a model of praxis that unifies the use of counter-narratives for both research and pedagogy, and (3) transformative action for the fundamental goal of educational equity for people of color.","[{""name"": ""Richard Miller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katrina Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Nevada, Las Vegas""]}, {""name"": ""Arnetha F.

10.1007/s11423-019-09729-5,ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,0401 Education,Applying collaborative cognitive load theory to computer-supported collaborative learning: towards a research agenda,"AbstractResearch on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has traditionally investigated how student-, group-, task-, and technological characteristics affect the processes and outcomes of collaboration. On the other hand, cognitive load theory has traditionally been used to study individual learning processes and to investigate instructional effects that are present during individual learning (e.g., expertise reversal effect). In this contribution we will argue that cognitive load theory can be applied to CSCL. By incorporating concepts such as collective working memory (i.e., individuals share the burden of information processing), mutual cognitive interdependence (i.e., individuals learn about each other’s expertise and become dependent on their partners’ expertise), and transaction costs (i.e., the burden placed on individuals working memory capacity when communicating and coordinating collaborative activities), collaborative cognitive load theory (CCLT) can be used to formulate testable hypotheses for pressing issues in CSCL research. The aim of this paper is to develop a research agenda to guide future CSCL research from a CCLT perspective. We highlight how variables associated with student-, group-, task-, and technological characteristics may be investigated using CCLT. We also address important steps CSCL research needs to make with respect to the measurement of variables and the methodologies used to analyze data.","[{""name"": ""Jeroen Janssen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul A.

10.1002/tesq.580,TESOL QUARTERLY,0401 Education,"An Exploration of Language Teacher Reflection, Emotion Labor, and Emotional Capital","In this article the researchers explore the notion of emotional capital in relation to language teachers’ emotion labor and the role of reflection in understanding their emotional experiences. They draw on interview narratives with teachers (N = 25) working in higher education institutions in the United States and United Kingdom. During these interview conversations, the researchers elicited accounts of teachers’ emotionally charged experiences that arise as part of their ongoing, mundane teaching practice and how they respond to these situations. The researchers argue that as language teachers struggle to orient to the feeling rules of their institutions, they develop the capacity to perform the emotions that they believe are expected of them. This capacity is further shaped through their reflective practice, as both individual reflection and collaborative reflection with colleagues. The researchers thus analyze how language teachers’ accruing emotional capital, developed through emotion labor and reflective activity, can be converted into social and cultural capital. The authors also point to how language teachers’ emotional capital is entangled in power relations and thus requires careful scrutiny.","[{""name"": ""Christina Gkonou"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Essex Colchester United Kingdom""]}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth R.

10.1186/s40594-020-00242-3,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,"""Looking at Myself in the Future"": how mentoring shapes scientific identity for STEM students from underrepresented groups","Abstract Background Mentorship has been well-established in the literature as fostering scientific identity and career pathways for underrepresented minority students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Mentorship is prioritized by programs that aim to increase diversity and support future leadership in STEM fields, but in-depth understanding of mentorship in these contexts remains limited. Drawing on qualitative interview data, we sought to understand the relationship between mentoring and scientific identity among a diverse sample of 24 students in one such program, in order to inform program development. Results Qualitative analysis of the data revealed that mentorship, especially research mentorship, was common and played a role in formation of scientific identity. Students with research mentors tended to say they strongly identified as scientists, whereas those who lacked research mentorship varied in their level of scientific identity. In interviews, research-mentored students described mentors as colleagues who gave them opportunities to grow and as examples to look up to. Students valued mentors with whom they identified on the basis of demographic similarity or shared values, as well as those who challenged them in their academic and research endeavors. Conclusions Our analysis highlights how different mentoring experiences can contribute to development of future STEM leadership. We discuss implications for practice, including the need for tailored mentoring approaches and research-focused mentoring, and offer several recommendations for research and programming.","[{""name"": ""Kaitlyn Atkins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bryan M.

10.1186/s12909-020-02242-x,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,The role of 3D printed models in the teaching of human anatomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Abstract Background Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an emerging technology widely used in medical education. However, its role in the teaching of human anatomy needs further evaluation. Methods PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, SpringerLink, and Nature databases were searched systematically for studies published from January 2011 to April 2020 in the English language. GRADEprofiler software was used to evaluate the quality of literature. In this study, a meta-analysis of continuous and binary data was conducted. Both descriptive and statistical analyses were used. Results Comparing the post-training tests in neuroanatomy, cardiac anatomy, and abdominal anatomy, the standardized mean difference (SMD) of the 3D group and the conventional group were 1.27, 0.37, and 2.01, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). For 3D vs. cadaver and 3D vs. 2D, the SMD were 0.69 and 1.05, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). For answering time, the SMD of the 3D group vs. conventional group was – 0.61 (P &lt; 0.05). For 3D print usefulness, RR = 2.29(P &lt; 0.05). Five of the six studies showed that satisfaction of the 3D group was higher than that of the conventional group. Two studies showed that accuracy of answering questions in the 3D group was higher than that in the conventional group. Conclusions Compared with students in the conventional group, those in the 3D printing group had advantages in accuracy and answering time. In the test of anatomical knowledge, the test results of students in the 3D group were not inferior (higher or equal) to those in the conventional group. The post-training test results of the 3D group were higher than those in the cadaver or 2D group. More students in the 3D printing group were satisfied with their learning compared with the conventional group. The results could be influenced by the quality of the randomized controlled trials. In a framework of ethical rigor, the application of the 3D printing model in human anatomy teaching is expected to grow further.","[{""name"": ""Zhen Ye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aishe Dun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hanming Jiang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cuifang Nie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shulian Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tao Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jing Zhai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/d41586-018-07853-5"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-102292-4.00020-5"", ""10.18192/uojm.v6i1.1515"", ""10.1177/1553350615607641"", ""10.1098/rsos.150643"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2018.05.006"", ""10.1002/ase.1703"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016891"", ""10.1186/s13018-018-0976-x"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2018.07.012"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.06.033"", ""10.1002/ase.1847"", ""10.1177/2150135114528721"", ""10.1002/ase.1475"", ""10.3402/meo.v20.29847"", ""10.1016/j.avsg.2018.04.038"", ""10.2741/e844"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-00647-1"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100"", ""10.18433/J3SQ0B"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-5-13"", ""10.1111/obr.12977"", ""10.1038/srep11570"", ""10.1002/ase.1573"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-0889-0"", ""10.1111/chd.12486"", ""10.21037/atm.2018.09.59"", ""10.1002/ase.1718"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2018.01.215"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2019.01.204"", ""10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.lb124"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1293-0"", ""10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2019.08.1443"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.02.031"", ""10.1007/s12565-014-0257-7"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0191328"", ""10.1093/cid/cix777"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.04.006"", ""10.1177/0194599816678372"", ""10.1002/ase.1851"", ""10.4066/AMJ.2015.2567"", ""10.1186/s12938-016-0236-4"", ""10.1002/ase.1538""]","['Engineering', 'Medicine', 'Dentistry']","['Surgery', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'General Dentistry']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.78), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7342), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7246), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7141), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7138)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.7328), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6867)]]"

Exploring the capacity of this sector to adapt in the state of uncertainty has become more significant than ever. In this paper, we critically reflect on our experience of teaching urban design research methods online during the early COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. This is an exploratory case study with a qualitative approach with an aim to inform resilient practices of teaching in the face of public health emergencies. Drawing on the experience of teaching the Research Methods and Techniques subject during lockdown, we discuss the rapid transition from face-to-face to online teaching and point to the challenges and opportunities in relation to the learning and teaching activities, assessment and feedback, and digital platforms. This paper concludes by outlining some key considerations to inform the development of more adaptive and resilient approaches to online teaching in the context of unprecedented global health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that it is critical to move beyond fixed pedagogical frameworks to harness the productive capacities of adaptive teaching.","[{""name"": ""Nastaran Peimani"", ""affiliation"": [""Welsh School of Architecture, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3NB, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Hesam Kamalipour"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Geography and Planning, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3WA, UK""]}]","[""10.1002/hbe2.191"", ""10.1016/j.ijedro.2020.100012"", ""10.46328/ijtes.v4i4.111"", ""10.1002/hbe2.218"", ""10.1002/hbe2.201"", ""10.1007/s12528-018-9179-z"", ""10.4324/9780203864265"", ""10.1002/9781118269558"", ""10.4324/9780203079690"", ""10.5040/9781474235952"", ""10.1080/17508487.2020.1737556"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00155-y"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1813180"", ""10.46328/ijonse.32"", ""10.1007/s10758-020-09454-6"", ""10.1108/IDD-09-2020-0114"", ""10.1007/s10734-020-00561-y"", ""10.3390/educsci10110301"", ""10.4135/9789351507741"", ""10.4135/9781848608191"", ""10.4135/9781412957397"", ""10.1057/udi.2015.28"", ""10.1080/17549175.2014.909518"", ""10.4324/9781315309163"", ""10.5822/978-1-61091-525-0"", ""10.4324/9780203067635"", ""10.1080/13574809.2015.1092378"", ""10.1080/13574809.2015.1092377"", ""10.3390/su11154163"", ""10.3390/su11174807"", ""10.1057/s41289-020-00145-3"", ""10.4236/cus.2015.34031"", ""10.1016/j.ccs.2015.10.003"", ""10.3390/su12083495"", ""10.18848/2154-8676/CGP/v08i01/19-30"", ""10.4324/9780203962947"", ""10.3102/0034654307313795"", ""10.4324/9780203465066"", ""10.1080/03098265.2020.1807478"", ""10.15694/mep.2020.000102.1"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-01135-9"", ""10.4324/9780203079690"", ""10.1002/9780470774298""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

We collected data from 324 students learning English as a foreign language. Structural equation modeling results showed that (a) the promotion focus positively predicted ideal selves, whereas the prevention focus negatively predicted ought selves; (b) ideal self/own predicted enjoyment positively and anxiety negatively, ought self/other and ideal self/other predicted anxiety positively, and ought self/own positively predicted vigilant L2 use; (c) enjoyment predicted eager L2 use positively and vigilant L2 use negatively, whereas anxiety predicted vigilant L2 use positively; and finally (d) eager L2 use positively and vigilant L2 use negatively predicted achievement. The findings suggest that a promotion‐oriented approach to language learning and teaching might lead to more adaptive motivational, emotional, and behavioral patterns, which in turn contribute to language learning success.

10.1186/s12909-021-02546-6,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Medical artificial intelligence readiness scale for medical students (MAIRS-MS) - development, validity and reliability study","AbstractBackgroundIt is unlikely that applications of artificial intelligence (AI) will completely replace physicians. However, it is very likely that AI applications will acquire many of their roles and generate new tasks in medical care. To be ready for new roles and tasks, medical students and physicians will need to understand the fundamentals of AI and data science, mathematical concepts, and related ethical and medico-legal issues in addition with the standard medical principles. Nevertheless, there is no valid and reliable instrument available in the literature to measure medical AI readiness. In this study, we have described the development of a valid and reliable psychometric measurement tool for the assessment of the perceived readiness of medical students on AI technologies and its applications in medicine.MethodsTo define medical students’ required competencies on AI, a diverse set of experts’ opinions were obtained by a qualitative method and were used as a theoretical framework, while creating the item pool of the scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were applied.ResultsA total of 568 medical students during the EFA phase and 329 medical students during the CFA phase, enrolled in two different public universities in Turkey participated in this study. The initial 27-items finalized with a 22-items scale in a four-factor structure (cognition, ability, vision, and ethics), which explains 50.9% cumulative variance that resulted from the EFA. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient was 0.87. CFA indicated appropriate fit of the four-factor model (χ2/df = 3.81, RMSEA = 0.094, SRMR = 0.057, CFI = 0.938, and NNFI (TLI) = 0.928). These values showed that the four-factor model has construct validity.ConclusionsThe newly developed Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS) was found to be valid and reliable tool for evaluation and monitoring of perceived readiness levels of medical students on AI technologies and applications.Medical schools may follow ‘a physician training perspective that is compatible with AI in medicine’ to their curricula by using MAIRS-MS. This scale could be benefitted by medical and health science education institutions as a valuable curriculum development tool with its learner needs assessment and participants’ end-course perceived readiness opportunities.","[{""name"": ""Ozan Karaca"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S.

Although diverse materials and designs have been proposed for magnetic soft robots with programmable shape transformation, it is still challenging to produce strong actuation by a small magnetic field. Inspired by arthropod species, magnetic soft millirobots with joint structures by 3D printing hydrogels have been developed. The joints can turn the bending deformation into the folding deformation, with the jointed region deforming locally. Different from homogeneous bending deformation, such local deformation allows larger motions of robots and reduces the overall energy consumption at the same time. Through experiments and numerical simulations, it is shown that the magnetic arthropod millirobots are capable of performing multimodal locomotion and programmed shape transformation, such as move, flip, catch, carry, and release. Finally, ex vivo experiments of removing a foreign object from porcine organs (e.g., aorta, stomach, and intestine) are presented to demonstrate the potential surgery application of magnetic arthropod millirobots.","[{""name"": ""Bonan Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures Department of Engineering Mechanics Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an 710049 China""]}, {""name"": ""Rong Jia"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures Department of Engineering Mechanics Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an 710049 China""]}, {""name"": ""Hang Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures Department of Engineering Mechanics Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an 710049 China""]}, {""name"": ""Xi Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures Department of Engineering Mechanics Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an 710049 China""]}, {""name"": ""Kai Tan"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures Department of Engineering Mechanics Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an 710049 China""]}, {""name"": ""Qian Deng"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Engineering Structural Analysis and Safety Assessment Department of Engineering MechanicsSchool of Aerospace Engineering Huazhong University of Science and Technology  Wuhan 430074 China""]}, {""name"": ""Jingda Tang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures Department of Engineering Mechanics Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an 710049 China""]}]","[""10.1002/adfm.202010918"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aax7329"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.abc8191"", ""10.1002/adfm.202004975"", ""10.1038/s41578-018-0001-3"", ""10.1088/2399-7532/abcb0c"", ""10.1088/2516-1091/ab22d5"", ""10.1073/pnas.2022090118"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-10549-7"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-12679-4"", ""10.1126/sciadv.abe8436"", ""10.1002/adma.202006191"", ""10.1016/j.eml.2021.101263"", ""10.1016/j.eml.2020.101023"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.abb9822"", ""10.1109/LRA.2019.2898040"", ""10.1038/nature25443"", ""10.1002/adfm.202101825"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0185-0"", ""10.1002/adma.201906657"", ""10.1038/s43246-020-00067-1"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aav4494"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b13840"", ""10.1039/C9RA01775E"", ""10.1002/adma.202102113"", ""10.1002/adma.202100336"", ""10.1002/adfm.201909202"", ""10.1002/aisy.202000186"", ""10.1016/j.jmps.2018.10.008"", ""10.1063/1.1712836"", ""10.1111/brv.12168"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3049469"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aan1544"", ""10.1177/0954406215597713"", ""10.1038/s41578-018-0009-8"", ""10.1021/am508621s"", ""10.1039/C8TB00568K"", ""10.1073/pnas.1608193113"", ""10.1063/1.361565"", ""10.1002/adfm.201901721"", ""10.1021/ma2016248"", ""10.1021/acsami.0c01453"", ""10.1016/j.jmps.2020.104045"", ""10.1115/1.4047291"", ""10.1038/s41598-021-91890-0"", ""10.1007/s00384-015-2364-x"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1710-5""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Engineering']","['Condensed Matter Physics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0702 物理学', 0.731), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7181)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

To meet the needs of healthcare in the twenty-first century, competent leaders will be increasingly important across all health professions, including allied health, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, and medicine. Consequently, incorporation of leadership training and development should be part of all health professional curricula. A new type of leader is emerging: one who role models the balance between autonomy and accountability, emphasises teamwork, and focuses on improving patient outcomes. Healthcare education leaders are required to work effectively and collaboratively across discipline and organisational boundaries, where titles are not always linked to leadership roles.

This study introduced a task-based voice chatbot called “Ellie”, newly developed by the researchers, and examined the appropriateness of its task design and performance as an English conversation partner and students’ perceptions on using it in EFL class. Korean EFL learners (N = 314) aged 10–15 years performed three speaking tasks with Ellie in their school classroom. The participants took 9.63 turns per session on average using the first 1,000-word band, indicating that the chatbot highly encouraged students to engage in conversation, which rarely occurs in general EFL classes in Korea. The high task success rates (88.3%) showed the design appropriateness of both L2 tasks and operational intents in terms of users’ successful understanding and completeness of the given chatbot tasks. The participants’ responses to the survey not only supported the positive potential of the chatbot in EFL settings but also revealed limitations to be resolved. Future suggestions for advancing and implementing AI chatbots in EFL classrooms are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Hyejin Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Heyoung Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jang Ho Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dongkwang Shin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S0958344008000815"", ""10.1093/applin/22.1.27"", ""10.1145/3284179.3284309"", ""10.1075/lllt.32.06jon"", ""10.15858/engtea.72.1.201703.159"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.045"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511667206.026"", ""10.14705/rpnet.2018.26.815"", ""10.2307/3588028"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139524681"", ""10.1145/365153.365168"", ""10.1080/09588220701489374"", ""10.3745/PKIPS.Y2017M04A.958"", ""10.1109/CCWC.2018.8301734"", ""10.3138/cmlr.63.1.59"", ""10.1631/FITEE.1700826"", ""10.1080/09588220500442772"", ""10.1017/S0958344001000829a""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13325,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Human and artificial intelligence collaboration for socially shared regulation in learning,"AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) has generated a plethora of new opportunities, potential and challenges for understanding and supporting learning. In this paper, we position human and AI collaboration for socially shared regulation (SSRL) in learning. Particularly, this paper reflects on the intersection of human and AI collaboration in SSRL research, which presents an exciting prospect for advancing our understanding and support of learning regulation. Our aim is to operationalize this human‐AI collaboration by introducing a novel trigger concept and a hybrid human‐AI shared regulation in learning (HASRL) model. Through empirical examples that present AI affordances for SSRL research, we demonstrate how humans and AI can synergistically work together to improve learning regulation. We argue that the integration of human and AI strengths via hybrid intelligence is critical to unlocking a new era in learning sciences research. Our proposed frameworks present an opportunity for empirical evidence and innovative designs that articulate the potential for human‐AI collaboration in facilitating effective SSRL in teaching and learning.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicFor collaborative learning to succeed, socially shared regulation has been acknowledged as a key factor.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful and potentially disruptive technology that can reveal new insights to support learning.It is questionable whether traditional theories of how people learn are useful in the age of AI.What this paper addsIntroduces a trigger concept and a hybrid Human‐AI Shared Regulation in Learning (HASRL) model to offer insights into how the human‐AI collaboration could occur to operationalize SSRL research.Demonstrates the potential use of AI to advance research and practice on socially shared regulation of learning.Provides clear suggestions for future human‐AI collaboration in learning and teaching aiming at enhancing human learning and regulatory skills.Implications for practice and/or policyEducational technology developers could utilize our proposed framework to better align technological and theoretical aspects for their design of adaptive support that can facilitate students' socially shared regulation of learning.Researchers and practitioners could benefit from methodological development incorporating human‐AI collaboration for capturing, processing and analysing multimodal data to examine and support learning regulation.","[{""name"": ""Sanna Järvelä"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Education and Psychology University of Oulu Oulu Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Andy Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Education and Psychology University of Oulu Oulu Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Allyson Hadwin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Leadership Studies University of Victoria British Columbia Victoria Canada""]}]","[""10.1109/MC.2020.2996587"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.025"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100021"", ""10.1007/s11409‐017‐9178‐x"", ""10.1177/2059799118790743"", ""10.1080/10494820.2016.1232278"", ""10.22318/cscl2023.280974"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2019.2939399"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027447"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2022.102050"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.041"", ""10.1007/s11409‐022‐09304‐z"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-08076-0"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.007"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3120557"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-52237-7_20"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100001"", ""10.1007/s11845‐021‐02695‐z"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.101268"", ""10.1111/bjet.12917"", ""10.4324/9781315617572-13"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.04.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65291-3_15"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2023.107737"", ""10.1080/00461520.2015.1075400"", ""10.1080/00461520.2019.1670064"", ""10.1111/bjet.12861"", ""10.4324/9781315617572-44"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2017.01.009"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aam5410"", ""10.1111/bjet.12876"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100070"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.05.003"", ""10.1111/bjet.13280"", ""10.1080/0960085X.2020.1816144"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2023.107650"", ""10.1007/s11412‐023‐09387‐z"", ""10.1075/arcl.6.05pan"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126401"", ""10.1007/s40593‐016‐0110‐3"", ""10.51388/20.500.12265/106"", ""10.1007/s40593‐013‐0004‐6"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100060"", ""10.1111/bjet.12993"", ""10.1007/s11409‐020‐09224‐w"", ""10.1111/jcal.12263"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-1428-6_728"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-39583-8_4"", ""10.1038/s42256‐020‐00280‐0"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2008.03.001"", ""10.1177/10464964221137524"", ""10.1109/HRI.2019.8673313"", ""10.1007/978‐3‐642‐13437‐1_92"", ""10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.04.034"", ""10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.imavis.2011.07.002""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1002/cae.22255,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Computational thinking in programming with scratch in primary schools: A systematic review,"AbstractComputer programming is being introduced in educational curricula, even at the primary school level. One goal of this implementation is to teach computational thinking (CT), which is potentially applicable in various computational problem‐solving situations. However, the educational objective of CT in primary schools is somewhat unclear: curricula in various countries define learning objectives for topics, such as computer science, computing, programming or digital literacy but not for CT specifically. Additionally, there has been confusion in concretely and comprehensively defining and operationalising what to teach, learn and assess about CT in primary education even with popular programming akin to Scratch. In response to the growing demands of CT, by conducting a literature review on studies utilising Scratch in K–9, this study investigates what kind of CT has been assessed in Scratch at the primary education level. As a theoretical background for the review, we define a tangible educational objective for introducing CT comprehensively in primary education and concretise the fundamental skills and areas of understanding involved in CT as its “core educational principles”. The results of the review summarise Scratch programming contents that students can manipulate and activities in which they can engage that foster CT. Moreover, methods for formatively assessing CT via students' Scratch projects and programming processes are explored. The results underpin that the summarised “CT‐fostering” programming contents and activities in Scratch are vast and multidimensional. The next steps for this study are to refine pedagogically meaningful ways to assess CT in students' Scratch projects and programming processes.","[{""name"": ""Janne Fagerlund"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Teacher Education University of Jyväskylä  Jyväskylä Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Päivi Häkkinen"", ""affiliation"": [""Finnish Institute for Educational Research University of Jyväskylä  Jyväskylä Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Mikko Vesisenaho"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Teacher Education University of Jyväskylä  Jyväskylä Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Jouni Viiri"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Teacher Education University of Jyväskylä  Jyväskylä Finland""]}]","[""10.1145/1922681.1922682"", ""10.1145/1929887.1929905"", ""10.1145/273133.274308"", ""10.1111/jcal.12266"", ""10.1007/s11092-008-9068-5"", ""10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450296"", ""10.1145/2998438"", ""10.1145/2157136.2157223"", ""10.1145/2445196.2445304"", ""10.1145/3017680.3017760"", ""10.1145/3137065.3137086"", ""10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943005"", ""10.1109/EDUCON.2015.7096023"", ""10.1145/3017680.3017723"", ""10.1145/3027385.3029440"", ""10.3102/0013189X12463051"", ""10.5040/9781350057142.ch-003"", ""10.1145/3183377.3183396"", ""10.1111/cobi.12541"", ""10.1109/FIE.2016.7757410"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.004"", ""10.1080/08993408.2016.1231784"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.12.010"", ""10.1145/1734263.1734383"", ""10.1145/2787622.2787716"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.09.012"", ""10.1609/icwsm.v4i1.14028"", ""10.1145/1352135.1352260"", ""10.1145/1868358.1868363"", ""10.1145/2713609.2713610"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.14"", ""10.1145/1999747.1999796"", ""10.1080/08993408.2013.832022"", ""10.1109/VLHCC.2016.7739695"", ""10.4018/IJWLTT.2017100106"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-6528-7_6"", ""10.1145/2676723.2677244"", ""10.1145/2493394.2493403"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.09.003"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71483-7_15"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.003"", ""10.1145/2999541.2999542"", ""10.1145/3159450.3159507"", ""10.1007/s10639-015-9412-6"", ""10.15388/infedu.2018.08"", ""10.1145/1118178.1118215"", ""10.1109/VLHCC.2011.6070404"", ""10.1145/2462476.2462479""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Software', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The author begins by tracing a line of theoretical and empirical work that both informs and complicates our understanding of digital literacy and, more specifically, digital reading. Then, a heuristic is proposed to systematically organize, label, and define a multifaceted set of increasingly complex terms, concepts, and practices that characterize the spectrum of digital reading experiences. Research that informs this heuristic is used to illustrate how more precision in defining digital reading can promote greater clarity across research methods and advance a more systematic study of promising digital reading practices. Finally, the author discusses implications for assessment, research, practice, and policy.","[{""name"": ""Julie Coiro"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Rhode Island Kingston USA""]}]","[""10.1080/00461520.2012.722511"", ""10.1558/cj.v24i3.531-559"", ""10.1007/s11145-018-9904-z"", ""10.1177/0031721717734184"", ""10.1080/07370008.2011.636495"", ""10.1075/swll.17"", ""10.1109/MC.2012.111"", ""10.1002/trtr.1560"", ""10.4324/9781315627496-1"", ""10.1007/s11145-012-9371-x"", ""10.1598/RRQ.44.1.1"", ""10.4324/9780203131268"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.035"", ""10.3102/0002831217701694"", ""10.1177/1086296X11421979"", ""10.1598/RRQ.42.2.2"", ""10.1002/JAAL.00065"", ""10.1177/2381336919870285"", ""10.4324/9781315627496-27"", ""10.11114/jets.v1i2.101"", ""10.1177/0741932510381651"", ""10.1007/s11528-008-0112-6"", ""10.1177/1086296X10397872"", ""10.1111/jar.12562"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2018.09.003"", ""10.1080/00140139208967394"", ""10.1002/jaal.391"", ""10.1177/002205741619600303"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-9667-9.ch001"", ""10.1002/RRQ.027"", ""10.3102/0002831219831041"", ""10.1016/1041-6080(90)90022-9"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9395-7"", ""10.17645/mac.v7i2.1959"", ""10.1017/S0958344006000711"", ""10.1007/BF02299682"", ""10.1002/9781394260201"", ""10.1002/TRTR.01090"", ""10.1080/00940771.2019.1603803"", ""10.4324/9781315887104"", ""10.1007/s11145-019-09944-9"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09897-0"", ""10.1007/BF03652036"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.033"", ""10.1177/1086296X18784640"", ""10.1002/trtr.1223"", ""10.1080/08957340802558326"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.005"", ""10.1598/RRQ.34.4.5"", ""10.56021/9780801848377"", ""10.1598/RT.64.1.2"", ""10.1080/19345747.2015.1116035"", ""10.1016/j.compcom.2009.09.001"", ""10.2190/DVAP-DE23-3XMV-9MXH"", ""10.17645/mac.v7i2.1987"", ""10.1080/07380569.2019.1601957"", ""10.1598/0710.42"", ""10.1002/9781118914069.ch5"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.01.007"", ""10.1080/00461520.2017.1328309"", ""10.1080/00461520.2018.1505514"", ""10.1017/S0267190511000110"", ""10.1177/2381336917719254"", ""10.2307/j.ctvhktjh6.12"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2012.12.002"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139164603"", ""10.1598/RRQ.37.2.6"", ""10.1080/01638539609544975"", ""10.3102/0034654310364401"", ""10.1111/jedm.12117"", ""10.1080/00220670009598705"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.08.014"", ""10.1080/00094056.2015.1001680"", ""10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u"", ""10.1080/00140130802170387"", ""10.1598/RRQ.40.1.7"", ""10.1787/9789264239555-en"", ""10.1787/9789264281820-8-en"", ""10.1007/s11409-007-9008-7"", ""10.1080/02702711.2012.664250"", ""10.1007/s10567-006-0006-0"", ""10.4324/9781410603791"", ""10.4324/9781410603791"", ""10.1111/ldrp.12028"", ""10.1207/s15326950dp4003_1"", ""10.1075/swll.17.04sal"", ""10.1353/aad.2004.0016"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49077-9"", ""10.1080/07294360.2019.1544111"", ""10.1080/00220973.2016.1143794"", ""10.3102/0034654317722961"", ""10.1352/1944-7558-124.4.374"", ""10.1002/jaal.947"", ""10.1080/01443410.2010.538039"", ""10.4324/9781351256728"", ""10.3390/educsci9020099"", ""10.1177/0013164407305592"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-1915-9"", ""10.58680/la201930091"", ""10.1002/trtr.1438"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-5912-2.ch001"", ""10.1007/s11423-019-09646-7""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Library and Information Sciences', 'Education', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7648), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7497)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000004441,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,The Otolaryngology Residency Program Preference Signaling Experience,"Problem In the 2021 residency application cycle, the average otolaryngology applicant applied to more than half of programs. Increasing application numbers make it difficult for applicants to stand out to programs of interest and for programs to identify applicants with sincere interest. Approach As part of the 2021 Match, otolaryngology applicants could participate in a preference signaling process, signaling up to 5 programs of particular interest at the time of application submission. Programs received a list of applicants who submitted signals to consider during interview offer deliberations. Applicants and program directors completed surveys to evaluate the signaling process and assess the impact of signals on interview offers. Outcomes All otolaryngology residency programs participated in the signaling process. In total, 611 students submitted applications for otolaryngology residency programs, 559 applicants submitted a Match list including an otolaryngology program, and 558 applicants participated in the signaling process. The survey response rate was 42% for applicants (n = 233) and 52% for program directors (n = 62). The rate of receiving an interview offer was significantly higher from signaled programs (58%) than from both nonsignaled programs (14%; P &lt; .001) and the comparative nonsignal program (23%; P &lt; .001) (i.e., the program an applicant would have signaled given a sixth signal). This impact was consistent across the spectrum of applicant competitiveness. Applicants (178, 77%) and program directors (53, 91%) strongly favored continuing the program. Next Steps Many specialties face high residency application numbers. Programs have difficulty identifying applicants with sincere interest, and applicants face limited opportunities to identify programs of particular interest. Applicants to these specialties may benefit from a preference signaling process like that in otolaryngology. Additional evaluation is needed to determine the impact of signals across racial and demographic lines and to validate these early outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Steven D.

10.1111/bjet.13009,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Reasons associated with preservice teachers' intention to use immersive virtual reality in education,"AbstractThe recent interest in the use of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in education seems to correspond with the increased affordability, accessibility and functionality of IVR hardware and software. IVR has the potential to enhance immersion, improve spatial capabilities, promote empathy, increase motivation and possibly improve learning outcomes. However, the extent to which teachers capitalise on these potentials in the future depends their perceptions of IVR and their behavioural intentions to use it. Accordingly, this study aimed to identify relevant factors and influences relating to preservice teachers’ behavioural intention to use IVR, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that UTAUT2 provided a suitable model to describe preservice teachers’ perceptions of IVR on all dimensions (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, habit and behavioural intention), with hedonic motivation receiving the highest scores and habit scoring the lowest. Interview responses revealed the reasons for the substantial variation in preservice teacher perceptions, which depended on a range of external‐ (“first‐order”), internal‐ (“second‐order”) and design (“third‐order”)‐related issues. Implications for schools, educational leaders and teacher education are discussed. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Immersive virtual reality (IVR) can offer numerous benefits for educators, though there are several issues that teachers need to overcome to use IVR effectively. A range of external, internal or design related factors can impact on teacher propensity to use technology in the classroom. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model (UTAUT2) has been applied to analysing behavioural intentions to use various technologies in education, but not Immersive Virtual Reality. What this paper adds Preservice teachers rated hedonic motivation (enjoyment) highest and habit lowest, which was different to other technology acceptance studies. A range of external barriers (access, logistics and support), internal barriers (attitudes, experience) and design issues (technical skills, ideas for pedagogically meaningful tasks) constrained intentions to use IVR. Validation of the UTAUT2 model applied to a novel technology (IVR) and cohort (preservice teachers), with the rare inclusion of qualitative findings to add explanatory power. Implications for practice and/or policy There is opportunity for teacher education programmes and school systems to leverage the enjoyment factor as a means of realising other benefits of IVR (visualisation, empathy and retention). Teachers need to be provided with access to devices, professional learning, technical guidance, time and a supportive school and policy environment to become confident and capable users of IVR. In order for teachers (and students) to become effective designers with IVR they not only require technical assistance but also support to understand how IVR can be used in pedagogically meaningful ways.","[{""name"": ""Matt Bower"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dorothy DeWitt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jennifer W.

Despite significant advances in the field and successful demonstration of a wide range of applications, microrobots have yet to become the preferred choice outside a laboratory environment. After introducing available microrobotic propulsion and control mechanisms, microrobots that are manufactured and powered by light are focused herein. Referring to pioneering works and recent interesting examples, light is presented not only as a fabrication tool, by means of two‐photon polymerization direct laser writing, but also as an actuator for microrobots in both hard and soft stimuli–responsive polymers. In this scenario, a number of challenges that yet prevent polymeric light‐powered microrobots from reaching their full potential are identified, whereas potential solutions to overcome said challenges are suggested. As an outlook, a number of real‐world applications that light‐powered microrobots should be particularly suited for are mentioned, together with the advances needed for them to achieve such purposes. An interdisciplinary approach combining materials science, microfabrication, photonics, and data science should be conducive to the next generation of microrobots and will ultimately foster the translation of microrobotic applications into the real world.","[{""name"": ""Ada‐Ioana Bunea"", ""affiliation"": [""National Centre for Nano Fabrication and Characterization (DTU Nanolab) Technical University of Denmark  Ørsted Plads 347 Lyngby 2800 Kgs.

10.1007/s10639-020-10319-9,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Impact of technostress on academic productivity of university students,"AbstractThere has been increasing interest among researchers to understand the negative effects of technology, in the last two decades. Technostress or stress induced due to technology is extensively reported in the literature, among working professionals. Even though there has been an increased proliferation of digital devices in academia, there is a dearth of studies examining the prevalence of technostress and its impact among students. This study examines the prevalence of technostress among the younger population, in the age group of 18–28 years. Using a sample of 673 Indian private university students, this study cross-validated the technostress instrument. Increased use of technology in higher education has compelled students to complete all their academic work, including assessments, using technology. Technology-enhanced learning applications such as learning management systems, MOOCs and digital exam devices require students to develop ICT skills. The study also investigates the impact of technostress on the academic productivity of students. Findings reveal that the technostress instrument is valid to be used in the academic context, with minor modifications, and students experienced moderate levels of technostress.

10.1186/s41239-024-00453-6,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Generative AI and the future of higher education: a threat to academic integrity or reformation? Evidence from multicultural perspectives,"AbstractIn recent years, higher education (HE) globally has witnessed extensive adoption of technology, particularly in teaching and research. The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) further accelerates this trend. However, the increasing sophistication of GenAI tools has raised concerns about their potential to automate teaching and research processes. Despite widespread research on GenAI in various fields, there is a lack of multicultural perspectives on its impact and concerns in HE. This study addresses this gap by examining the usage, benefits, and concerns of GenAI in higher education from a multicultural standpoint. We employed an online survey that collected responses from 1217 participants across 76 countries, encompassing a broad range of gender categories, academic disciplines, geographical locations, and cultural orientations. Our findings revealed a high level of awareness and familiarity with GenAI tools among respondents. A significant portion had prior experience and expressed the intention to continue using these tools, primarily for information retrieval and text paraphrasing. The study emphasizes the importance of GenAI integration in higher education, highlighting both its potential benefits and concerns. Notably, there is a strong correlation between cultural dimensions and respondents’ views on the benefits and concerns related to GenAI, including its potential as academic dishonesty and the need for ethical guidelines. We, therefore, argued that responsible use of GenAI tools can enhance learning processes, but addressing concerns may require robust policies that are responsive to cultural expectations. We discussed the findings and offered recommendations for researchers, educators, and policymakers, aiming to promote the ethical and effective integration of GenAI tools in higher education.","[{""name"": ""Abdullahi Yusuf"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nasrin Pervin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marcos Román-González"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jik.2023.100333"", ""10.1080/1097198X.2004.10856383"", ""10.3390/fi15080260"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100068"", ""10.1111/1748-8583.12524"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00408-3"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00411-8"", ""10.14742/ajet.7526"", ""10.1007/s10956-023-10039-y"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00392-8"", ""10.3389/frai.2023.1093712"", ""10.1007/s00607-023-01181-x"", ""10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102642"", ""10.1177/1470595803003003006"", ""10.1007/s10758-023-09684-4"", ""10.1016/0263-2373(89)90075-3"", ""10.22521/edupij.2023.123.2"", ""10.1007/s10209-022-00930-7"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-11834-1"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100156"", ""10.4018/jicthd.2009040104"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100790"", ""10.1016/j.ijedro.2023.100296"", ""10.3389/fsurg.2022.862322"", ""10.1007/s13132-023-01433-3"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-12114-8"", ""10.2501/IJMR-2017-039"", ""10.1016/j.jval.2011.06.003"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00404-7"", ""10.1007/s10755-023-09686-1"", ""10.1111/bjet.13425"", ""10.1186/s41239-024-00446-5"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2018.06.017"", ""10.1080/10494820.2015.1122635"", ""10.1186/s40561-023-00237-x"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100147"", ""10.1016/j.chbah.2023.100005"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00420-7""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Safety Research', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1002/rev3.3202,REVIEW OF EDUCATION,0401 Education,Dropping out of university: a literature review,"This study provides a comprehensive review of the phenomenon of students dropping out from tertiary education. Student withdrawal is the result of a long decision‐making process and complex interaction between several determinants. We first provide an overview of definitions, theoretical models and perspectives of dropping out. Referring to previous theoretical and empirical evidence from a wide range of disciplines, we then focus on a detailed discussion of determinants affecting the decisions of students to drop out. There are three main reasons for students to leave the higher education system without a degree. These are 1) the national education system, e.g., the country’s financing policy, 2) the higher education institutions, e.g., the type of institution or teaching quality, and 3) the students themselves, with this last aspect subdivided into a) pre‐study determinants, such as the secondary school type, and b) study‐related aspects, such as working while studying. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for further research, especially the application of modern data mining techniques on comprehensive data sets covering a wide range of relevant determinants which may lead to new insights into the dropping out process. The results will provide helpful tools for universities wishing to implement early warning systems and to support students at risk, at an early stage of their study.","[{""name"": ""Andreas Behr"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Duisburg‐Essen Essen Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Marco Giese"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Duisburg‐Essen Essen Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Herve D.

Therefore, evaluating their toxic potential is a primary requirement for regulatory purposes and for the safer development of nanomedicines. In this review, to aid the understanding of nano–bio interactions from environmental and health and safety perspectives, the potential, reality, challenges, and future advances that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) present are described. Herein, AI and ML algorithms that assist in the reporting of the minimum information required for biomaterial characterization and aid in the development and establishment of standard operating procedures are focused. ML tools and ab initio simulations adopted to improve the reproducibility of data for robust quantitative comparisons and to facilitate in silico modeling and meta‐analyses leading to a substantial contribution to safe‐by‐design development in nanotoxicology/nanomedicine are mainly focused. In addition, future opportunities and challenges in the application of ML in nanoinformatics, which is particularly well‐suited for the clinical translation of nanotherapeutics, are highlighted. This comprehensive review is believed that it will promote an unprecedented involvement of AI research in improvements in the field of nanotoxicology and nanomedicine.","[{""name"": ""Ajay Vikram

Many instructors, however, have found developing effective online lessons in a very short period of time very stressful and difficult. This study describes how we successfully addressed this crisis by transforming two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes with the help of a cloud-based video conferencing app. As in a conventional flipped course, in a fully online flipped course students are encouraged to complete online pre-class work. But unlike in the conventional flipped approach, students do not subsequently meet face-to-face in physical classrooms, but rather online. This study examines the effect of fully online flipped classrooms on student learning performance in two stages. In Stage One, we explain how we drew on the 5E framework to design two conventional flipped classes. The 5E framework consists of five phases—Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. In Stage Two, we describe how we transformed the two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes. Quantitative analyses of students’ final course marks reveal that the participants in the fully online flipped classes performed as effectively as participants in the conventional flipped learning classes. Our qualitative analyses of student and staff reflection data identify seven good practices for videoconferencing-assisted online flipped classrooms.","[{""name"": ""Khe Foon Hew"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chengyuan Jia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Donn Emmanuel Gonda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shurui Bai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1609406919874596"", ""10.1023/A:1023606425452"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103819"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9633-7"", ""10.1073/pnas.1821936116"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1144-z"", ""10.1177/1525822X05282260"", ""10.1145/2556288.2557207"", ""10.1177/2332858419870489"", ""10.1007/s40299-012-0016-2"", ""10.1002/jee.20293"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.08.002"", ""10.1007/BF02505024"", ""10.1080/08841233.2017.1347122"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.001"", ""10.4054/DemRes.2018.39.22"", ""10.1186/2193-1801-2-455"", ""10.1007/s40692-019-00142-8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103789"", ""10.1145/3302261.3236697"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.05.003""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.12900,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,The use of augmented reality to foster conceptual knowledge acquisition in STEM laboratory courses-Theoretical background and empirical results,"AbstractLearning with hands‐on experiments can be supported by providing essential information virtually during lab work. Augmented reality (AR) appears especially suitable for presenting information during experimentation, as it can be used to integrate both physical and virtual lab work. Virtual information can be displayed in close spatial proximity to the correspondent components in the experimentation environment, thereby ensuring a basic design principle for multimedia instruction: the spatial contiguity principle. The latter is assumed to reduce learners' extraneous cognitive load and foster generative processing, which supports conceptual knowledge acquisition. For the present study, a tablet‐based AR application has been developed to support learning from hands‐on experiments in physics education. Real‐time measurement data were displayed directly above the components of electric circuits, which were constructed by the learners during lab work. In a two group pretest–posttest design, we compared university students' (N = 50) perceived cognitive load and conceptual knowledge gain for both the AR‐supported and a matching non‐AR learning environment. Whereas participants in both conditions gave comparable ratings for cognitive load, learning gains in conceptual knowledge were only detectable for the AR‐supported lab work.","[{""name"": ""Kristin Altmeyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Kapp"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Thees"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sarah Malone"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jochen Kuhn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roland Brünken"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.11.002"", ""10.1109/MC.2012.111"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.02.017"", ""10.30819/4726"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.023"", ""10.1126/science.1230579"", ""10.1088/1361-6404/aae3ce"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.1.010103"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.04.001"", ""10.1002/sce.10106"", ""10.1119/1.4928350"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.010119"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.002"", ""10.1007/s10956-018-9762-0"", ""10.1119/1.5084931"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1"", ""10.1109/TLT.2016.2554115"", ""10.1111/bjet.12716"", ""10.3758/s13428-013-0334-1"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2013.12.001"", ""10.1007/S40037-015-0192-X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511816819.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811678"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_6"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.91.4.638"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139547369.016"", ""10.1007/s10648-019-09473-5"", ""10.1007/s10956-007-9057-3"", ""10.1007/s00779-013-0747-y"", ""10.1109/TLT.2013.37"", ""10.1007/s10648-018-9435-9"", ""10.1088/1361-6404/aaa8fb"", ""10.1119/perc.2018.pr.Strzys"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4"", ""10.1207/s1532690xci1203_1"", ""10.1023/A:1022193728205"", ""10.1007/s10648-019-09465-5"", ""10.1007/s10648-005-3951-0"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.4.010108"", ""10.1159/000097684"", ""10.1119/1.4931717"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.13.010108""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

Previous investigations showed that the underprediction was primarily related to nonlinear hydrodynamic loading, so two new validation campaigns were performed to separately examine the different hydrodynamic load components. In this paper, we validate a variety of tools against this new test data, focusing on the ability to accurately model the low-frequency loads on a semisubmersible floater when held fixed under wave excitation and when forced to oscillate in the surge direction. However, it is observed that models providing better load predictions in these two scenarios do not necessarily produce a more accurate motion response in a moored configuration.","[{""name"": ""A N Robertson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Gueydon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E Bachynski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Jonkman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Alarcón"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E Amet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Beardsell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Bonnet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""B Boudet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Brun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Z Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Féron"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Forbush"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Galinos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Galvan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Gilbert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Gómez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""V Harnois"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Haudin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Z Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Le Dreff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Leimeister"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Lemmer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""H Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Mckinnon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""I Mendikoa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Moghtadaei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Netzband"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Oh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Pegalajar-Jurado"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Q Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K Ruehl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Schünemann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""H Shin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Y Si"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Surmont"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Trubat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Qwist"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Wohlfahrt-Laymann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.10.333"", ""10.1002/we.2377"", ""10.1016/j.marstruc.2019.02.008"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.09.059"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.106605""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"
10.1002/rev3.3292,REVIEW OF EDUCATION,0401 Education,Formative assessment and feedback for learning in higher education: A systematic review,"AbstractFeedback is an integral part of education and there is a substantial body of trials exploring and confirming its effect on learning. This evidence base comes mostly from studies of compulsory school age children; there is very little evidence to support effective feedback practice at higher education, beyond the frameworks and strategies advocated by those claiming expertise in the area. This systematic review aims to address this gap. We review causal evidence from trials of feedback and formative assessment in higher education. Although the evidence base is currently limited, our results suggest that low stakes‐quizzing is a particularly powerful approach and that there are benefits for forms of peer and tutor feedback, although these depend on implementation factors. There was mixed evidence for praise, grading and technology‐based feedback. We organise our findings into several evidence‐grounded categories and discuss the next steps for the field and evidence‐informed feedback practice in universities. Context and implicationsRationale for this studyTo gain a better understanding of effective formative assessment and feedback approaches in higher education (HE). To promote a more evidence‐informed approach to teaching and learning in universities.Why the new findings matterThe findings highlight a small number of promising strategies for formative assessment and feedback in HE. They also draw attention to a lack of (quality) evidence in this area overall.Implications for policy‐makers and practitionersUniversities and their regulators/funders should be encouraging and supporting more, high‐quality research in this important area. Researchers in the field also need to look to developing more ambitious, higher‐quality studies which are likely to provide robust, causal conclusions about academic effectiveness (or other outcomes). Those involved in teaching and learning in university should use the findings to inform evidence‐informed approaches to formative assessment and feedback and to challenge approaches which do not appear to have foundations in strong evidence. Students could be made more aware of teaching and learning approaches that are likely to support their academic progress.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Morris"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Education Studies University of Warwick  Coventry UK""]}, {""name"": ""Thomas Perry"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education University of Birmingham  Birmingham UK""]}, {""name"": ""Lindsey Wardle"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education Durham University  Durham UK""]}]","[""10.1007/s10648-012-9210-2"", ""10.1016/j.labeco.2015.02.002"", ""10.1002/j.2333-8504.2011.tb02241.x"", ""10.1080/02602938.2012.691462"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.015"", ""10.1111/mbe.12243"", ""10.1177/0092055X15578033"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2011.07.009"", ""10.1152/advan.00052.2015"", ""10.1007/s11092-014-9208-z"", ""10.1177/1529100612453266"", ""10.3102/0034654312474350"", ""10.1002/cae.21950"", ""10.1080/02602938.2019.1697424"", ""10.4324/9781315456898"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02412"", ""10.1037/a0023219"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.010134"", ""10.1016/j.lcsi.2015.12.001"", ""10.1177/1469787412467125"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.119.2.254"", ""10.1002/cae.21869"", ""10.1037/a0017841"", ""10.1037/xap0000063"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.11.028"", ""10.1186/s12909-015-0318-1"", ""10.1080/02602931003786559"", ""10.1080/03075070600572090"", ""10.1080/02602938.2019.1600186"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0079774"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2020.1752619"", ""10.1007/s10639-016-9571-0"", ""10.1002/bs.3830280103"", ""10.1177/1469787415589627"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00829"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01693.x"", ""10.1007/BF00117714"", ""10.1080/0969595980050104"", ""10.1080/23752696.2018.1425096"", ""10.1037/bul0000098"", ""10.1177/1745691615569000"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-8126-4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8527.2006.00332.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.07.020"", ""10.1080/00313831.2011.628693"", ""10.1080/00220973.2015.1134420"", ""10.1002/acp.1630"", ""10.4324/9780203710463"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2011.03.001"", ""10.1017/9781316832134.003"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03087"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2008.06.005""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1108/ET-04-2020-0096,EDUCATION AND TRAINING,0401 Education,Factors impacting entrepreneurial intentions among university students in Saudi Arabia: testing an integrated model of TPB and EO,"PurposeThis research intends to contribute to the literature of entrepreneurial intentions through determining the factors impacting the entrepreneurial intentions among students in different academic programs. This is in order to enhance and improve entrepreneurship-related procedures within relevant universities.Design/methodology/approachThe study was conducted by a structured survey questionnaire on 261 students in the University of Hail. The questionnaire was developed based on previous studies. The proposed hypotheses were tested by the use of the structured equation modeling (SEM) via using Amos software.FindingsThe results of the current study support the theoretical integration of the model as most of the hypotheses have been accepted. The results of the survey also show that attitudes toward behavior, self-efficacy, autonomy, risk-taking, pro-activeness and competitive aggressiveness are expressively related with entrepreneurial intention. Yet, social norms and innovativeness are not considerably connected with entrepreneurial intention.Research limitations/implicationsThis study seeks to contribute to the relevant literature by integrating the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the entrepreneurial orientation model (EO). This is in order to identify the factors impacting the intention of entrepreneurship among Saudi university students. As the case in many studies, this present study has some limitations. The main limitation lies in that it would not be possible to generalize the study's findings. This is due to the fact the research is the outcome of examining and studying one Saudi university. Therefore, it would be better to conduct similar studies in other Saudi universities in order to generalize the findings of the study.Practical implicationsThe study's results could be of value to policymakers and university administrators in Saudi Arabia universities by which they could be enabled to allocate resources, develop strategies and provide all requirements for the sake of improving entrepreneurial skills among university students. This comprehensive model can be used as a tool for planning and prioritizing resources in bid for providing the required support as this support would reinforce the entrepreneurial opportunity of university students. As such, students would have better thinking about entrepreneurial work and thus would be assisted in achieving their professional goals and the broader goal of nation building.Originality/valueSince today's youth are viewed as the potential future entrepreneurs, they should be encouraged to achieve the Saudi Kingdom's goals through creating suitable employment opportunities for them by supporting entrepreneurship. Therefore, pointing out the factors impacting the entrepreneurial intention of students will contribute to developing the field of entrepreneurship among young people in Saudi Arabic in general. In addition, realized outcomes would create an exciting new knowledge with regard to the entrepreneurial intention among the youth at the university level.","[{""name"": ""Yaser Hasan Salem Al-Mamary"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Abdulrab"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed A.

10.1186/s41239-020-00191-5,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Digital divide among higher education faculty,"AbstractDigital divide centers on access to various dimensions of information and communication technology (ICT) including physical access, motivation, skills, and actual usage of digital technologies. This divide tends to be even wider in the context of developing countries. Yet, there is a lack of literature on the digital divide among the faculty who teach in higher education settings. Thus, as a preliminary effort, by using a 57-item Faculty’s ICT Access (FICTA) scale, we investigated the digital inequalities (at the physical, motivational, skills, and usage levels) among Pakistani faculty in respect of their personal and positional categories. We also examined the relationship between faculty’s instructional usage of ICT and other dimensions of their ICT access. The findings revealed that there were significant differences in the faculty’s access to technology at the four levels in respect of their personal and positional categories. Further, the findings of the study shed light on the theoretical implications of the framework of successive kinds of ICT access suggested by van Dijk (The deepening divide: inequality in the information society, 2005).","[{""name"": ""Kamal Ahmed Soomro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ugur Kale"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Reagan Curtis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mete Akcaoglu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Malayna Bernstein"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.14742/ajet.1291"", ""10.1080/07303084.2017.1331643"", ""10.1177/0266666914529294"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00185.x"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.027"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.023"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.02.001"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2015.1051490"", ""10.4018/ijea.2013070103"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2016.10.004"", ""10.1007/s10639-015-9419-z"", ""10.1007/s11528-016-0057-0"", ""10.1177/0266666907087698"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-1083-6_5"", ""10.1007/s10639-017-9599-9"", ""10.1080/09523987.2015.1095522"", ""10.30935/cedtech/6100"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004"", ""10.4135/9781452229812"", ""10.1007/s10639-013-9272-x""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Communication', 'Gender Studies', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

Current memristive crossbar architectures demonstrate the implementation of neuromorphic computing paradigms, although they are unable to emulate typical features of biological neural networks such as high connectivity, adaptability through reconnection and rewiring, and long‐range spatio‐temporal correlation. Herein, self‐organizing memristive random nanowire (NW) networks with functional connectivity able to display homo‐ and heterosynaptic plasticity is reported thanks to the mutual electrochemical interaction among memristive NWs and NW junctions. In particular, it is shown that rewiring and reweighting effects observed in single NWs and single NW junctions, respectively, are responsible for structural plasticity of the network under electrical stimulation. Such biologically inspired systems allow a low‐cost realization of neural networks that can learn and adapt when subjected to multiple external stimuli, emulating the experience‐dependent synaptic plasticity that shape the connectivity and functionalities of the nervous system that can be exploited for hardware implementation of unconventional computing paradigms.","[{""name"": ""Gianluca Milano"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Applied Science and Technology Politecnico di Torino  C.so Duca degli Abruzzi 24 10129 Torino Italy"", ""Advanced Materials Metrology and Life Science Division INRiM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica)  Strada delle Cacce 91 10135 Torino Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Giacomo Pedretti"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano and IU.NET  Piazza L. da Vinci 32 20133 Milano Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Matteo Fretto"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Materials Metrology and Life Science Division INRiM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica)  Strada delle Cacce 91 10135 Torino Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Luca Boarino"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Materials Metrology and Life Science Division INRiM (Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica)  Strada delle Cacce 91 10135 Torino Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Fabio Benfenati"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Synaptic Neuroscience and Technology Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia  Largo Rosanna Benzi, 10 16132 Genova Italy"", ""IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino  Largo Rosanna Benzi, 10 16132 Genova Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Daniele Ielmini"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano and IU.NET  Piazza L. da Vinci 32 20133 Milano Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Ilia Valov"", ""affiliation"": [""JARA – Fundamentals for Future Information Technology  52425 Jülich Germany"", ""Peter-Grünberg-Institut (PGI 7) Forschungszentrum Jülich  Wilhelm-Johnen-Straße 52425 Jülich Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Carlo Ricciardi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Applied Science and Technology Politecnico di Torino  C.so Duca degli Abruzzi 24 10129 Torino Italy""]}]","[""10.1038/nature03010"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0180-5"", ""10.1038/s41928-018-0023-2"", ""10.1038/s41928-019-0270-x"", ""10.1038/s41563-019-0291-x"", ""10.1002/adma.201103053"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-05517-6"", ""10.1063/1.5037817"", ""10.1039/c2jm35064e"", ""10.1002/aelm.201800909"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-04886-2"", ""10.1002/adma.201502868"", ""10.1039/C6NR06276H"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-51330-6"", ""10.1063/1.5140579"", ""10.1162/netn_a_00128"", ""10.1021/acsaelm.9b00218"", ""10.1021/acsnano.5b05469"", ""10.1002/smll.201602581"", ""10.1088/0957-4484/22/28/289502"", ""10.1038/nphys2188"", ""10.1021/nl202160c"", ""10.1039/C8NR08551J"", ""10.1038/ncomms5232"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aaw8438"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-04-01370.2001"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2017.02.047"", ""10.1146/annurev.physiol.64.092501.114547"", ""10.1002/adma.201902761"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-07979-0"", ""10.1038/nmat4756"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-07330-7"", ""10.1038/35036191"", ""10.1002/adma.201503202"", ""10.1038/nature25747"", ""10.1038/s41563-018-0248-5"", ""10.1063/1.4963830"", ""10.1063/1.5111083"", ""10.1002/adfm.201806646"", ""10.1016/j.neunet.2019.03.005""]","['Engineering', 'Neuroscience']","['Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7525), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7489)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.7821/naer.2023.7.1458,JOURNAL OF NEW APPROACHES IN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0401 Education,Use of ChatGPT at University as a Tool for Complex Thinking: Students' Perceived Usefulness,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are transforming the approach to education. In particular, ChatGPT’s potential to process large amounts of data and learn from user interactions makes it a beneficial resource for students, albeit with some reluctance from some teachers. This study aimed to explore the acceptance of ChatGPT by university students. The researchers administered an online survey to 400 Spanish university students aged 18–64 (M = 21.80; SD = 6.40). The results of the methodological approach based on the UTAUT2 model for technology adoption showed that: 1) gender was not a determining variable in any construct while the experience of use was a factor conditioning a higher score on all constructs; 2) experience, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit were influential in behavioral intention to use ChatGPT; 3) facilitating conditions, habit, and behavioral intention were conditioning factors in user behavior. Finally, this report discusses the findings and practical implications of the work and recommends some good uses for ChatGPT.","[{""name"": ""José-María Romero-Rodríguez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""María-Soledad Ramírez-Montoya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mariana Buenestado-Fernández"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fernando Lara-Lara"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/bmjsem-2023-001568"", ""10.11591/ijere.v11i4.22561"", ""10.1002/9781118619179"", ""10.4324/9780203805534"", ""10.6018/edumed.556511"", ""10.53761/1.20.3.02"", ""10.1097/INF.0000000000003852"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2023.102642"", ""10.3916/C61-2019-01 10.3916/C61-2019-01"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101535"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2022.993935"", ""10.7821/naer.2023.1.1240"", ""10.14201/eks.31279"", ""10.1016/j.neuroscience.2023.02.008"", ""10.3390/risks11020040"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.1111/bjet.12905"", ""10.1371/journal.pdig.0000198"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100790"", ""10.1093/BIOMET/57.3.519"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2022.103537"", ""10.1016/j.accpm.2023.101209"", ""10.1101/2023.02.19.23286155"", ""10.1186/s13054-023-04380-2 10.1186/s13054-023-04380-2"", ""10.1177/1460458219874641"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2019.101324"", ""10.3200/JOER.98.1.5-13"", ""10.1038/d41586-022-04397-7"", ""10.1038/d41586-023-00340-6"", ""10.37467/revhuman.v18.4862"", ""10.1186/s40561-023-00237-x"", ""10.1016/j.synbio.2023.02.004"", ""10.1007/s10916-023-01910-x"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.2307/41410412""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Decision Sciences']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"
10.3102/0013189X211017495,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,Students' Civic Online Reasoning: A National Portrait,"Are today’s students able to discern quality information from sham online? In the largest investigation of its kind, we administered an assessment to 3,446 high school students. Equipped with a live internet connection, the students responded to six constructed-response tasks. The students struggled on all of them. Asked to investigate a site claiming to “disseminate factual reports” on climate science, 96% never learned about the organization’s ties to the fossil fuel industry. Two thirds were unable to distinguish news stories from ads on a popular website’s home page. More than half believed that an anonymously posted Facebook video, shot in Russia, provided “strong evidence” of U.S. voter fraud. Instead of investigating the organization or group behind a site, students were often duped by weak signs of credibility: a website’s “look,” its top-level domain, the content on its About page, and the sheer quantity of information it provided. The study’s sample reflected the demographic profile of high school students in the United States, and a multilevel regression model explored whether scores varied by student characteristics. Findings revealed differences in student abilities by grade level, self-reported grades, locality, socioeconomic status, race, maternal education, and free/reduced-price lunch status. Taken together, these findings reveal an urgent need to prepare students to thrive in a world in which information flows ceaselessly across their screens.","[{""name"": ""Joel Breakstone"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University, Stanford, CA""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Smith"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University, Stanford, CA""]}, {""name"": ""Sam Wineburg"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University, Stanford, CA""]}, {""name"": ""Amie Rapaport"", ""affiliation"": [""Gibson Consulting Group, Austin, TX""]}, {""name"": ""Jill Carle"", ""affiliation"": [""Gibson Consulting Group, Austin, TX""]}, {""name"": ""Marshall Garland"", ""affiliation"": [""Gibson Consulting Group, Austin, TX""]}, {""name"": ""Anna Saavedra"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA""]}]","[""10.1177/1077695812469802"", ""10.1080/07370008.2011.636495"", ""10.1177/0031721718762419"", ""10.37016/mr-2020-56"", ""10.1002/jaal.448"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2005272"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-120709-145346"", ""10.1177/1745691616635594"", ""10.23860/JMLE-2020-12-2-6"", ""10.1177/1529100620946707"", ""10.1145/3201064.3201095"", ""10.1037/a0016644"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103711"", ""10.1080/00933104.2017.1416320"", ""10.1111/bjep.12279"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01488.x"", ""10.1177/0002764213489015"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00351.x"", ""10.1177/0961000618764258"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.08.003"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3048994"", ""10.1177/016146811912101102""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Communication']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

Antidepressants are commonly used to treat depression. Objective The study aimed to provide an update on the evidence on the effects of antidepressants compared with placebo. Should antidepressants be used for adults with major depressive disorder? Study selection We searched the Cochrane Library, BMJ Best Practice and PubMed up to June 2019 with the search terms ‘depression’ and ‘antidepressants’ targeting reviews published in English since 1990. Findings Several reviews have assessed the effects of antidepressants compared with placebo for depression. Generally, all the previous reviews show that antidepressants seem to have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but the size of the effect has questionable importance to most patients. Antidepressants seem to have minimal beneficial effects on depressive symptoms and increase the risk of both serious and non-serious adverse events. Conclusions The benefits of antidepressants seem to be minimal and possibly without any importance to the average patient with major depressive disorder. Antidepressants should not be used for adults with major depressive disorder before valid evidence has shown that the potential beneficial effects outweigh the harmful effects.","[{""name"": ""Janus Christian Jakobsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Gluud"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Irving Kirsch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/s41598-018-21243-x"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.4602"", ""10.1016/S0924-9338(99)80239-9"", ""10.1787/health_glance-2017-graph181-en"", ""10.1002/da.20519"", ""10.1111/aas.13109"", ""10.1080/13651501.2017.1306082"", ""10.1177/0269881115581093"", ""10.1177/0706743716659417"", ""10.1177/0004867415617657"", ""10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.151"", ""10.1001/jama.2009.1943"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045"", ""10.1016/S0895-4356(03)00044-1"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2012.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.cct.2015.05.005"", ""10.1136/bmj.332.7549.1080"", ""10.1016/j.cct.2006.10.012"", ""10.1186/s12888-016-1173-2"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2163"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2015.08.021"", ""10.1136/bmj.b2700"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-157-6-201209180-00537"", ""10.1093/aje/kwx344"", ""10.1136/bmj.39465.451748.AD"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32802-7"", ""10.1093/ije/dyu115"", ""10.1136/bmj.e1119"", ""10.1503/cmaj.120744"", ""10.1002/14651858.MR000033.pub3"", ""10.1136/bmj.b3244"", ""10.1136/bmj.320.7249.1574"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08071027"", ""10.1037/cns0000164"", ""10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2044"", ""10.1111/acps.12886"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.115.173906"", ""10.4088/JCP.17r11470"", ""10.4088/JCP.v64n0204"", ""10.4088/PCC.v03n0105"", ""10.1258/ijsa.2008.008386"", ""10.1136/bmj.h3190"", ""10.1159/000370338"", ""10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.08.027"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8"", ""10.1136/bmj.c1468"", ""10.1177/0706743716659418"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2016.01.036"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0041778"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014820"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009834"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.105.020040"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007848"", ""10.4088/PCC.18m02340""]","['Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Social Psychology', 'Pharmacology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1007 药学', 0.768), ('1008 中药学', 0.754)]]"

Method The research methodology used in this work is of a bibliometric nature. Specifically, an academic performance analysis and a co-word analysis has been carried out. The term STEAM was analyzed in the Web of Science (WoS) database. The WoS programs Analyze Results, Creation Citation Report, and SciMAT were used. A total of 1116 manuscripts were analyzed. Results The results show that studies in the field education of STEAM began in 2006 and have continued uninterruptedly up to the present day, although interest generated in the scientific community has been irregular. Conclusions It can be concluded that STEAM studies have not had an established and robust line of research over time, although it can be observed that the trends in this aspect are focused on the scientific branch of education. In addition, the topics of study on STEAM include points related to gender differences, the influence of STEAM on people of different races, the skills developed by students, and training teachers to implement teaching and learning processes with STEAM.","[{""name"": ""José-Antonio Marín-Marín"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Antonio-José Moreno-Guerrero"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Dúo-Terrón"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesús López-Belmonte"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3991/ijet.v15i02.11537"", ""10.13189/ujer.2019.071213"", ""10.3390/educsci10120384"", ""10.1080/2331186X.2018.1507306"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-2334-5"", ""10.1007/s11217-014-9454-z"", ""10.1163/9789004421585"", ""10.1086/708642"", ""10.1007/BF02019280"", ""10.17163/alt.v15n1.2020.04"", ""10.3390/brainsci10120985"", ""10.3390/brainsci10121018"", ""10.3390/brainsci11010074"", ""10.12795/pixelbit.73672"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1761838"", ""10.1007/s10763-017-9832-4"", ""10.1007/s10763-018-9922-y"", ""10.1163/9789004421585_008"", ""10.3991/ijep.v5i2.4458"", ""10.1186/s40561-020-00132-9"", ""10.3390/educsci10030070"", ""10.1111/ssm.12400"", ""10.1177/1028315319888468"", ""10.3916/C66-2021-03"", ""10.1002/cae.22382"", ""10.25267/Rev_Eureka_ensen_divulg_cienc.2021.v18.i1.1802"", ""10.1063/1.4995107"", ""10.1007/s10833-017-9311-2"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.may.22"", ""10.1186/s40594-017-0094-z"", ""10.3390/su12062279"", ""10.33225/jbse/20.19.908"", ""10.3390/educsci9030184"", ""10.3390/educsci10080198"", ""10.15388/infedu.2020.03"", ""10.1002/cae.22365"", ""10.1007/s11412-020-09337-z"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2016.1263a"", ""10.4324/9781351175586-16"", ""10.1007/s10956-020-09885-x"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3008572"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1859546"", ""10.3390/electronics10030291"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.01.013"", ""10.6209/JORIES.201909_64(3).0004"", ""10.1145/3304221.3319786"", ""10.3390/educsci10090239"", ""10.21125/inted.2020.0645"", ""10.12691/education-7-7-8"", ""10.3916/C55-2018-08"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.ene.03"", ""10.3390/ijerph17082753"", ""10.3390/fi12080124"", ""10.12795/revistafuentes.2021.v23.i1.12050"", ""10.3916/C68-2021-09"", ""10.33828/sei.v31.i3.7"", ""10.14483/23448350.14526"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2018.10.002"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9602-z"", ""10.1093/sysbio/45.3.380"", ""10.6018/red.410121"", ""10.1002/cae.22373"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1823856"", ""10.1128/jmbe.v19i1.1360"", ""10.1002/jee.20112"", ""10.3390/su13031481"", ""10.17811/msg.30.1.2018.43-54"", ""10.5204/jld.v9i2.274"", ""10.33225/pec/20.78.423"", ""10.1063/1.5019491"", ""10.1109/TE.2019.2957711"", ""10.2760/12297"", ""10.1111/ssm.12403"", ""10.46328/ijemst.1017"", ""10.1007/s11192-020-03387-8""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Demography']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)]]"
10.1108/IJSHE-12-2019-0353,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,SDG 4 in higher education: challenges and opportunities,"Purpose The purpose of this case study is to focus on the role of higher education in the realisation of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, discussing both challenges and opportunities. Drawing on the example of The University of the West Indies (UWI) School of Education (SOE) (Mona Campus in Jamaica), this paper illustrates how higher education can move SDG 4 forward in a realistic and significant way. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the literature and case study experiences implementing education for sustainable development-related activities within a SOE, opportunities and challenges regarding SDG 4 and higher education institutions (HEIs) are identified and outlined. The SOE at the UWI campus is used as an illustrative case study to highlight the ways in which HEIs can drive SDG 4 through teaching, programme and course development, research and outreach activities. Findings Based on the literature examined, along with the case study, the paper argues that HEIs must help to shape and lead the SDG 4 agenda by being integrally involved and no longer watching from the side lines. A framework to aid HEIs in achieving outcomes associated with SDG 4 is then proffered. The intent is that this will not only help shape discourse but also shape actions, as the demand for higher education increases across the globe. Originality/value This paper uses a Caribbean regional HEI as the basis for the framework proposed to aid HEIs in achieving SDG 4 outcomes.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003998,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Professional Stigma of Mental Health Issues: Physicians Are Both the Cause and Solution,"After a medical student prompted medical faculty to tell their stories of depression and related mental health issues, the author wrote this article with the aim of decreasing the stigma of mental illness and encouraging treatment, as needed, in the medical profession. The professional culture of the house of medicine not only mimics society in attributing stigma to people with mental health issues but may also contribute to high rates of suicide in the ranks of health care professionals by leading to a delay in seeking treatment. Acculturation accelerates in the first year of medical school such that medical students experience an increase in burnout and depressive symptoms from prematriculation levels. It follows that faculty have a responsibility to improve the learning environment. Survey data from medical faculty at the author’s institution showed that depression decreased respondents’ willingness to seek mental health treatment because of the stigma and issues of access to help. Faculty attitudes toward mental health issues, including reluctance to admit having such issues, may be conveyed to medical students in the hidden curriculum that teaches them to keep depression hidden. Moreover, the fear of mental disorders is manifested in licensing and privileging applications under the guise of patient safety, contributing to a culture of shame and silence. As creators and guardians of this professional culture, medical faculty and other physicians must be the ones who change it. The same faculty who play a part in causing and perpetuating stigma related to mental health issues have the power to derive and enact some of the solutions. In addition to giving voice to a personal experience of mental health issues, this article offers suggestions for normalizing moderate to severe depression as a medical disorder, decreasing the stigma of mental health issues, and encouraging faculty to seek treatment.","[{""name"": ""Kirk J.

10.1111/flan.12461,FOREIGN LANGUAGE ANNALS,0401 Education,Language anxiety and the online learner,"AbstractForeign language classroom anxiety is a construct that has been investigated since the 1980s, yet few studies have examined language anxiety in the context of the online learning environment. In this literature review, the following guiding questions were examined: (a) What is foreign language classroom anxiety? (b) What are the research findings on language anxiety among online learners? (c) What can instructors do to help alleviate their online students' perceived levels of language anxiety? In addition to an exploration of the guiding questions, the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale, which was developed by Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986), is described in detail as well as how language educators can use it as a tool in their own classrooms to measure their students' perceived language anxiety levels. The pedagogical implications include recommended techniques and interventions for helping online language learners feel less isolated, less anxious, and more connected to their teacher and to their peers. Given the large number of students who are currently engaged in online or remote language learning due to COVID‐19, it is important to consider how affective factors, such as anxiety, can impede learning outcomes. Furthermore, language educators and their students were required to transition rapidly to the online environment without sufficient time or preparation for it, which is an additional cause of stress for both students and instructors alike. The article concludes with suggestions for future research on online language anxiety.","[{""name"": ""Victoria Russell"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Modern and Classical Languages Valdosta State University  Valdosta Georgia""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-4781.1994.tb02026.x"", ""10.1111/j.1944-9720.2004.tb02200.x"", ""10.1080/00223980.1975.9915748"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2005.00275.x"", ""10.1111/flan.12460"", ""10.1111/modl.12084"", ""10.21832/9781783091218"", ""10.2307/3586302"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.1988.tb04190.x"", ""10.1111/j.1944-9720.1996.tb01248.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.1986.tb05256.x"", ""10.1075/lllt.14.22jon"", ""10.1017/S0272263100012560"", ""10.1111/j.1467-1770.1994.tb01103.x"", ""10.1080/03637757009375677"", ""10.1111/0023-8333.00112"", ""10.1111/flan.12457"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.1992.tb02573.x"", ""10.1111/j.1944-9720.2009.01009.x"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.07.002"", ""10.4324/9780429426483"", ""10.1111/0026-7902.00016"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.46.4.929"", ""10.1111/j.1944-9720.2000.tb01995.x"", ""10.1111/j.1944-9720.2007.tb03201.x"", ""10.1558/cj.v23i1.49-78"", ""10.1037/h0027806"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2013.12032.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1186/s41239-022-00372-4,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Integration of artificial intelligence performance prediction and learning analytics to improve student learning in online engineering course,"AbstractAs a cutting-edge field of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) that depends on advanced computing technologies, AI performance prediction model is widely used to identify at-risk students that tend to fail, establish student-centered learning pathways, and optimize instructional design and development. A majority of the existing AI prediction models focus on the development and optimization of the accuracy of AI algorithms rather than applying AI models to provide student with in-time and continuous feedback and improve the students’ learning quality. To fill this gap, this research integrated an AI performance prediction model with learning analytics approaches with a goal to improve student learning effects in a collaborative learning context. Quasi-experimental research was conducted in an online engineering course to examine the differences of students’ collaborative learning effect with and without the support of the integrated approach. Results showed that the integrated approach increased student engagement, improved collaborative learning performances, and strengthen student satisfactions about learning. This research made contributions to proposing an integrated approach of AI models and learning analytics (LA) feedback and providing paradigmatic implications for future development of AI-driven learning analytics.","[{""name"": ""Fan Ouyang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mian Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luyi Zheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Liyin Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pengcheng Jiao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/cogs.12787"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.007"", ""10.1177/0735633120969216"", ""10.1109/TLT.2019.2912167"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103999"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106595"", ""10.1007/s11412-016-9234-6"", ""10.1007/s12528-021-09298-8"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.08.233"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100002"", ""10.1007/s11412-014-9193-8"", ""10.1111/bjet.13233"", ""10.1108/IJILT-04-2020-0046"", ""10.1080/00207720412331303651"", ""10.1109/MIS.2007.71"", ""10.1007/s40593-020-00229-9"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100001"", ""10.1007/s10462-022-10155-y"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.1999.tb00445.x"", ""10.1007/s42452-019-0884-7"", ""10.1007/s12528-022-09321-6"", ""10.1186/s41239-022-00347-5"", ""10.1111/bjet.12861"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.09.005"", ""10.1007/3-540-44566-8_35"", ""10.1073/pnas.1900370116"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113596"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01057.x"", ""10.1177/1609406917733847"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100020"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2018.02.002"", ""10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826192"", ""10.1111/bjet.12879"", ""10.1111/bjet.12875"", ""10.1145/2460296"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2021.06.064"", ""10.4018/JCIT.2021010101"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103676"", ""10.1186/s41239-022-00349-3"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.106189"", ""10.1016/j.future.2022.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103599"", ""10.1177/0735633118757015"", ""10.1109/TLT.2021.3107349"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100008"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.01.003"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

10.21449/ijate.1101295,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS IN EDUCATION,0401 Education,Comparison of Normality Tests in Terms of Sample Sizes under Different Skewness and Kurtosis Coefficients,"This study aims to compare normality tests in different sample sizes in data with normal distribution under different kurtosis and skewness coefficients obtained simulatively. To this end, firstly, simulative data were produced using the MATLAB program for different skewness/kurtosis coefficients and different sample sizes. The normality analysis of each data type was conducted using the MATLAB program and ten different normality tests; namely, (Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) Test, KS Stephens Modification, KS Marsaglia, KS Lilliefors Modification, Anderson-Darling Test, Cramer- Von Mises Test, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Shapiro-Francia Test, Jarque-Bera Test, and D’Agostino &amp;amp; Pearson Test). As a result of the analyses conducted according to ten different normality tests, it was found that normality tests were not affected by the sample size when the skewness and kurtosis coefficients were equal to or close to zero; however, in cases where the skewness and kurtosis coefficients moved away from zero, it was found that normality tests are affected by the sample size, and such tests tend to give significant results. Therefore, in large samples, it may be suggested that critical values for skewness and kurtosis coefficients’ z-scores as proposed by Kim (2013) and Mayers (2013) or the histogram graphs be used.","[{""name"": ""Süleyman DEMİR"", ""affiliation"": [""SAKARYA UNIVERSITY""]}]","[""10.1214/aoms/1177729437"", ""10.1080/01621459.1954.10501232"", ""10.14527/9786053644644"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02077.x"", ""10.1093/biomet/60.3.613"", ""10.1080/00031305.1986.10475419"", ""10.1016/S0167-9473(02)00074-9"", ""10.1093/biomet/48.1-2.151"", ""10.2307/1403192"", ""10.5395/rde.2013.38.1.52"", ""10.7465/jkdi.2016.27.5.1399"", ""10.1080/01621459.1967.10482916"", ""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140546"", ""10.18637/jss.v008.i18"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.105.1.156"", ""10.21449/ijate.656077"", ""10.22237/jmasm/1509496200"", ""10.1080/01621459.1972.10481232"", ""10.1201/9780203753064-4"", ""10.1080/01621459.1974.10480196"", ""10.1093/biomet/52.3-4.591"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177730256"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-5525-8"", ""10.1080/00949655.2010.520163""]",['Mathematics'],['Statistics and Probability'],"[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"
10.1186/s41239-021-00269-8,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Chatbot to improve learning punctuation in Spanish and to enhance open and flexible learning environments,"AbstractThe objective of this article is to analyze the didactic functionality of a chatbot to improve the results of the students of the National University of Distance Education (UNED / Spain) in accessing the university in the subject of Spanish Language. For this, a quasi-experimental experiment was designed, and a quantitative methodology was used through pretest and posttest in a control and experimental group in which the effectiveness of two teaching models was compared, one more traditional based on exercises written on paper and another based on interaction with a chatbot. Subsequently, the perception of the experimental group in an academic forum about the educational use of the chatbot was analyzed through text mining with tests of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), pairwise distance matrix and bigrams. The quantitative results showed that the students in the experimental group substantially improved the results compared to the students with a more traditional methodology (experimental group / mean: 32.1346 / control group / mean: 28.4706). Punctuation correctness has been improved mainly in the usage of comma, colon and periods in different syntactic patterns. Furthermore, the perception of the students in the experimental group showed that they positively value chatbots in their teaching–learning process in three dimensions: greater “support” and companionship in the learning process, as they perceive greater interactivity due to their conversational nature; greater “feedback” and interaction compared to the more traditional methodology and, lastly, they especially value the ease of use and the possibility of interacting and learning anywhere and anytime.","[{""name"": ""Esteban Vázquez-Cano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Santiago Mengual-Andrés"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eloy López-Meneses"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.36902/sjesr-vol3-iss1-2020(165-177)"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.03.051"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.05.001"", ""10.1109/TLT.2017.2682084"", ""10.1613/jair.4135"", ""10.1162/coli.2006.32.1.13"", ""10.3758/s13428-011-0183-8"", ""10.5209/rced.61934"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2015.09.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-60747-4_19"", ""10.18178/ijmerr.7.5.528-533"", ""10.1017/S0958344008000815"", ""10.1515/text-2014-0018"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.88.4.715"", ""10.1007/BF03651853"", ""10.1017/S0269888917000029"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.023"", ""10.7238/elc.chatbots.2018"", ""10.5477/cis/reis.136.91"", ""10.1109/ICIEV.2013.6572650"", ""10.1515/bsaft-2017-0003"", ""10.12937/ejsise.13.1"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.004"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2010.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.02.026"", ""10.1093/joc/jqy026"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09863-w"", ""10.18178/ijmerr.8.5.813-818"", ""10.1109/IEEM.2017.8289883"", ""10.1111/bjet.12657"", ""10.1007/s40593-015-0065-9"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.114.1.1"", ""10.1145/3064663.3064672"", ""10.1007/s11409-010-9056-2"", ""10.1186/s13673-017-0089-2"", ""10.1007/s10209-019-00666-x"", ""10.14742/ajet.5583"", ""10.24331/ijere.415824"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.020"", ""10.1111/jcal.12240"", ""10.1145/3350768.3352456"", ""10.1186/s40561-018-0079-5"", ""10.3895/rts.v16n39.10213"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.46.10.1086"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.74.2.166"", ""10.1145/3330430.3333643"", ""10.2190/ec.49.1.a"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.02.015"", ""10.1080/09588220902920284"", ""10.7759/cureus.5307"", ""10.1109/MIC.2018.2889231"", ""10.1631/FITEE.1700826"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103862"", ""10.1057/9781137412263.0009"", ""10.5944/openpraxis.12.1.1063"", ""10.1007/s40593-013-0007-3"", ""10.14705/rpnet.2018.26.854"", ""10.12738/est.2014.4.2012"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v14i3.1430"", ""10.1007/s12528-018-9189-x"", ""10.32628/CSEIT1952171"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2007.09.003"", ""10.1145/365153.365168"", ""10.5465/AMBPP.2018.15903abstract""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1002/sce.21581,SCIENCE EDUCATION,0401 Education,Can science literacy help individuals identify misinformation in everyday life?,"AbstractCertain science‐related topics elicit persistent public controversy, such as routine childhood vaccinations and anthropogenic climate change. Many people are misinformed about the scientific facts underlying these issues. In response, science educators have called for improvements in the public's science literacy, but it is not clear which components of science literacy would help individuals identify misinformation. In this position paper, we examine this issue and make two arguments. First, we unpack the construct of science literacy to the seven components identified by the National Academies, and argue that four of these components are most likely to help individuals identify misinformation in everyday life: (a) Understanding of scientific practices; (b) Identifying and judging appropriate scientific expertise, (c) Epistemic knowledge, and (d) Dispositions and habits of mind, for example, inquisitiveness and open‐mindedness. We also show that three of these four components are not commonly used in definitions of science literacy. Second, we posit that two opposite reasons explain why misinformation is so intractable: on the one hand, that individuals uncritically accept most information, even if it is false, and on the other hand, that they reject information that contradicts their worldview, even if it is true. Consequently, we argue that inculcating intellectual virtues, such as open‐mindedness, should be central to imparting science literacy and propose some implications for educational practice. Lastly, we point out some limitations of our arguments and offer recommendations for further research.","[{""name"": ""Aviv J.

This study aims to investigate the importance of social interaction on the effectiveness of online learning during the pandemic when social distancing norms are in place.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses the partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, a nonparametric method based on total variance, using the SmartPLS software 3.0. The data were collected using the snowball sampling technique from the students who were learning online due to the pandemic COVID-19 and asked them to forward the survey link in their network.FindingsThe results suggested that social interaction has a positive significant impact on the effectiveness of online learning. However, this effect is reduced in the presence of social distance norms as people give more importance to continuous learning and to saving lives rather than socializing in the online environment.Originality/valueThe study will be helpful for instructors and educational institutes to formalize the strategies to enhance social interaction in online learning and analyze their pedagogy to improve effectiveness.","[{""name"": ""Hasnan Baber"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s12528-011-9043-x"", ""10.1080/01587919.2018.1553562"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2016.1232752"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.63.4.596"", ""10.20448/journal.509.2020.73.285.292"", ""10.1002/hbe2.191"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2004.03.017"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.11.001"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-156-3-201202070-00005"", ""10.1111/dsji.12097"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4609.2006.00114.x"", ""10.1177/002224378101800313"", ""10.1207/s15389286ajde1903_2"", ""10.1080/09500790.2010.547016"", ""10.1108/EBR-11-2018-0203"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.09.026"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09863-w"", ""10.1080/14703290252934603"", ""10.1111/jcal.12005"", ""10.1186/s12889-015-2336-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2013.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2013.10.001"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30190-0"", ""10.1037/a0030258"", ""10.1080/08923648909526659"", ""10.1080/01587910500081269"", ""10.1080/08923640009527052"", ""10.1145/286238.286255"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.03.007"", ""10.1177/0047239520977798"", ""10.1108/02632770410527815"", ""10.1111/j.0007-1013.2004.00389.x"", ""10.1093/socpro/spu002"", ""10.1108/AEDS-12-2016-0095"", ""10.1037/a0018963"", ""10.1186/s12889-018-5302-3"", ""10.1007/s12008-018-0510-8"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2006.10.005"", ""10.1108/AEDS-07-2017-0061"", ""10.1145/986213.986216"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.096""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1186/s12909-021-02909-z,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Online learning during COVID-19 produced equivalent or better student course performance as compared with pre-pandemic: empirical evidence from a school-wide comparative study,"Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic forced dental schools to close their campuses and move didactic instruction online. The abrupt transition to online learning, however, has raised several issues that have not been resolved. While several studies have investigated dental students’ attitude towards online learning during the pandemic, mixed results have been reported. Additionally, little research has been conducted to identify and understand factors, especially pedagogical factors, that impacted students’ acceptance of online learning during campus closure. Furthermore, how online learning during the pandemic impacted students’ learning performance has not been empirically investigated. In March 2020, the dental school studied here moved didactic instruction online in response to government issued stay-at-home orders. This first-of-its-kind comparative study examined students’ perceived effectiveness of online courses during summer quarter 2020, explored pedagogical factors impacting their acceptance of online courses, and empirically evaluated the impact of online learning on students’ course performance, during the pandemic. Method The study employed a quasi-experimental design. Participants were 482 pre-doctoral students in a U.S dental school. Students’ perceived effectiveness of online courses during the pandemic was assessed with a survey. Students’ course grades for online courses during summer quarter 2020 were compared with that of a control group who received face-to-face instruction for the same courses before the pandemic in summer quarter 2019. Results Survey results revealed that most online courses were well accepted by the students, and 80 % of them wanted to continue with some online instruction post pandemic. Regression analyses revealed that students’ perceived engagement with faculty and classmates predicted their perceived effectiveness of the online course. More notably, Chi Square tests demonstrated that in 16 out of the 17 courses compared, the online cohort during summer quarter 2020 was equally or more likely to get an A course grade than the analogous face-to-face cohort during summer quarter 2019. Conclusions This is the first empirical study in dental education to demonstrate that online courses during the pandemic could achieve equivalent or better student course performance than the same pre-pandemic in-person courses. The findings fill in gaps in literature and may inform online learning design moving forward.","[{""name"": ""Meixun Zheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Bender"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cindy Lyon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s00134-005-2561-0"", ""10.1097/00001888-200603000-00002"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0579.2011.00680.x"", ""10.1007/s10459-012-9368-x"", ""10.24059/olj.v19i3.484"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0691-4"", ""10.21815/JDE.017.051"", ""10.1080/10872981.2019.1666538"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2003.67.4.tb03644.x"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2004.68.9.tb03840.x"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2010.74.5.tb04901.x"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2011.75.5.tb05084.x"", ""10.1002/jdd.12234"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02266-3"", ""10.1111/eje.12624"", ""10.1002/jdd.12404"", ""10.1111/jopr.13301"", ""10.1002/jdd.12413"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0246584"", ""10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2766"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05704"", ""10.1002/jdd.12339"", ""10.1002/jdd.12469"", ""10.1111/eje.12589"", ""10.1002/jdd.12236"", ""10.1177/0272431693013001002"", ""10.1002/1520-6807(199301)30:1<79::AID-PITS2310300113>3.0.CO;2-X"", ""10.22492/ije.5.2.05"", ""10.24059/olj.v23i2.1488"", ""10.1111/ajo.13249"", ""10.4324/9780203095959"", ""10.1002/jdd.12163"", ""10.1590/1807-3107bor-2020.vol34.0083"", ""10.1111/eje.12561"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977"", ""10.5688/ajpe7782"", ""10.1007/s12098-020-03327-7"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02208-z"", ""10.24059/olj.v25i1.2474"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02312-0"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042378"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.09.003"", ""10.3102/0034654309333844"", ""10.25304/rlt.v28.2319"", ""10.24059/olj.v19i4.561"", ""10.1590/s1678-4634201710173240"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-7-23"", ""10.1080/01421590701784349""]","['Dentistry', 'Psychology', 'Medicine']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'General Dentistry']","[[('1003 口腔医学', 0.78), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7342), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7246), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7141), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7138)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.7328), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6867)]]"
10.1186/s41239-021-00316-4,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Flipped classrooms in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings and future research recommendations,"AbstractFlipped classroom (FC) approaches have gotten substantial attention in the last decade because they have a potential to stimulate student engagement as well as active and collaborative learning. The FC is generally defined as a strategy that flips the traditional education setting, i.e., the information transmission component of a traditional face-to-face lecture is moved out of class time. The FC relies on technology and is therefore suitable for online or blended learning, which were predominant forms of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020–July 2021). In this paper we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies that covered online FC approaches in higher education during the pandemic. We analyzed 205 publications in total and 18 in detail. Our research questions were related to the main findings about the success of implementation of online FC and recommendations for future research. The findings indicated that those who had used FC approaches in face-to-face or blended learning environments more successfully continued to use them in online environments than those who had not used it before. The SLR opened possible questions for future research, such as the effectiveness of the FC for different courses and contexts, the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement, and students’ data protection. It pointed to the need to examine different aspects of online delivery of the FC more comprehensively, and with more research rigor.","[{""name"": ""Blaženka Divjak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bart Rienties"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francisco Iniesto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Petra Vondra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mirza Žižak"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/07294360.2014.934336"", ""10.17060/ijodaep.2017.n1.v4.1055"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.021"", ""10.22219/jiz.v3i2.12514"", ""10.3991/ijet.v15i24.14017"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2016.1251a"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2021.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2015.12.010"", ""10.18260/1-2--22585"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0085-7"", ""10.3102/00346543211019122"", ""10.1080/14703290701602748"", ""10.1111/medu.13616"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9633-7"", ""10.3390/su13105336"", ""10.37074/jalt.2020.3.1.7"", ""10.1007/s00066-020-01712-x"", ""10.31341/jios.41.1.2"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2020.07.020"", ""10.1097/NNE.0000000000000554"", ""10.3390/educsci11050211"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2021.03.052"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2021.106713"", ""10.1080/15391523.2020.1847220"", ""10.1080/00220480009596759"", ""10.1108/ITSE-08-2020-0137"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00881"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00632"", ""10.1109/EITT50754.2020.00041"", ""10.1002/jee.20293"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.08.002"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0101-6"", ""10.1109/TLT.2018.2868673"", ""10.1213/ANE.0000000000005333"", ""10.1109/TE.2013.2249066"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.3390/educsci10080205"", ""10.5465/ambpp.2021.15358abstract"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.05.001"", ""10.1787/83c41957-en"", ""10.3390/educsci10100292"", ""10.3390/info11100483"", ""10.1534/genetics.112.141754"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.02.074"", ""10.1186/s12893-021-01203-5"", ""10.1007/s40692-019-00142-8"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/699/1/012026"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100314"", ""10.38069/edenconf-2021-ac0051"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1817761"", ""10.1080/09588221.2019.1584117"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.05.003"", ""10.1145/3442481.3442512"", ""10.1109/ICISE51755.2020.00153""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"
10.1111/medu.14152,MEDICAL EDUCATION,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Effective virtual patient simulators for medical communication training: A systematic review,"AbstractContextDespite the growing use of virtual patients (VPs) in medical education, few studies have explored the features and effectiveness of VP‐based medical communication skills training. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the design and evaluation of VP‐based medical communication skills training systems in order to identify features of successful cases.MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we searched four databases for studies published between 2006 and 2018. Using a refined classification scheme, we extracted data on instructional design (scenario and instructional intervention), technological design (modality and interaction), and evaluation (user experience, learning effectiveness and evaluator). We assessed the quality of studies using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and the QualSyst standard assessment criteria.ResultsA total of 14 studies were included for review. Of these, 85.7% (n = 12) were quantitative and 71.4% (n = 10) involved undergraduate students. The most common VP training scenario was history taking followed by the delivery of bad news. Diverse instructional interventions, including tutorials, learning activities, and feedback, were embedded in the VPs. The first‐person perspective animated within‐screen size VP was a popular technological feature. Most evaluations concerned the reality of simulation (for user experience) and skill in expressing empathy (as a learning outcome). Of the eight comparative studies, half reported significant attitude or skill improvements in the VP group. The distinct features of VPs shown to be effective were well‐designed instructional interventions (eg, a pre‐activity with a protocol‐informed tutorial), and post‐activity (eg, debrief or reflection), scaffolding and human feedback, but not system feedback.ConclusionsEvidence‐based VP training can enable students to gain communication skills in a safe and affordable learning environment. Elaborate technology alone cannot guarantee effective learning, but evidence‐based instructional interventions can facilitate its optimal use and bring about better learning outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Jihyun Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Dental Education School of Dentistry Seoul National University Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Hyungsin Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Smart Experience Design Graduate School of Techno Design Kookmin University Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Kwan Hoon Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Dental Research Institute School of Dentistry Seoul National University Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Daeun Jung"", ""affiliation"": [""Educational Psychology and Learning Systems Florida State University Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Tanisha Jowsey"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Medical and Health Sciences Education University of Auckland Auckland New Zealand""]}, {""name"": ""Craig S.

The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clock–extension offers; more opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid overburdening women faculty with additional service work. Together, these strategies will contribute to the development of a more equitable workforce capable of transformative medical discovery and care.","[{""name"": ""Nicole C.

10.1002/sce.21605,SCIENCE EDUCATION,0401 Education,The trouble with STEAM and why we use it anyway,"AbstractAs an emerging field of theory, research, and practice, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) has received attention for its efforts to incorporate the arts into the rubric of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) learning. In particular, many informal educators have embraced it as an inclusive and authentic approach to engaging young people with STEM. Yet, as with many nascent fields, the conceptualization and usage of STEAM is somewhat ambivalent and weakly theorized. On the one hand, STEAM offers significant promise through its focus on multiple ways of knowing and new pathways to equitable learning. On the other hand, it is often deployed in theory, pedagogy, and practice in ambiguous or potentially problematic ways toward varying ends. This paper attempts to disentangle some of the key tensions and contradictions of the STEAM concept as currently operationalized in educational research, policy, and practice. We pay particular attention to the transformative learning potential supported by contexts where STEAM is conceptualized as both pedagogical and mutually instrumental. That is, neither STEM nor arts are privileged over the other, but both are equally in play. We link the possibilities suggested by this approach to emerging theories for understanding how designing for and surfacing epistemic practices linked to the relevant disciplines being integrated into STEAM programs may point the way toward resolving tensions in inter‐ and transdisciplinary learning approaches.","[{""name"": ""Sam Mejias"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Design Strategies, Parsons School of Design New York New York USA"", ""Department of Media and Communications London School of Economics and Political Science London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Naomi Thompson"", ""affiliation"": [""Counseling and Educational Psychology Department Indiana University Bloomington Indiana USA""]}, {""name"": ""Raul Mishael Sedas"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Education University of California, Irvine Irvine California USA""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Rosin"", ""affiliation"": [""Guerilla Science and Department of Math and Science Pratt Institute Brooklyn New York USA""]}, {""name"": ""Elisabeth Soep"", ""affiliation"": [""YR Media Oakland California USA""]}, {""name"": ""Kylie Peppler"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Informatics and Education University of California, Irvine Irvine California USA""]}, {""name"": ""Joseph Roche"", ""affiliation"": [""Science Gallery at Trinity College Dublin Dublin Ireland""]}, {""name"": ""Jen Wong"", ""affiliation"": [""Guerilla Science and Science Gallery at King's College London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Mairéad Hurley"", ""affiliation"": [""Science Gallery at Trinity College Dublin Dublin Ireland""]}, {""name"": ""Philip Bell"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Education University of Washington Seattle Washington USA""]}, {""name"": ""Bronwyn Bevan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Education University of Washington Seattle Washington USA""]}]","[""10.1007/s10763-012-9388-2"", ""10.1080/10632913.2017.1296392"", ""10.1086/445993"", ""10.1007/s11422-018-9870-4"", ""10.1111/cobi.12173"", ""10.1002/sce.20392"", ""10.1159/000345322"", ""10.1080/01930826.2017.1392223"", ""10.1080/00043125.2012.11519167"", ""10.1162/leon_a_01835"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25101-7_3"", ""10.1080/09500693.2012.664293"", ""10.1145/3141798.3141809"", ""10.1080/10508406.2019.1591411"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2017.09.010"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226099088.001.0001"", ""10.1002/sce.21558"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.013.398"", ""10.4236/ce.2017.814152"", ""10.1109/TALE.2014.7062556"", ""10.1080/10400419.2018.1488195"", ""10.1080/10632913.2017.1292973"", ""10.1080/00043125.2010.11519062"", ""10.1002/sce.21271"", ""10.22323/2.17030801"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-93743-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-56185-1"", ""10.1038/451522a"", ""10.1080/00043125.2014.11519293"", ""10.5642/steam.20140102.15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59545-0"", ""10.30707/JSTE48.1Herschbach"", ""10.1080/00043125.2018.1414534"", ""10.4324/9780203202395"", ""10.15346/hc.v3i1.10"", ""10.22323/2.15030205"", ""10.3102/0091732X10383211"", ""10.2307/j.ctvxw3q7f"", ""10.1002/sce.3730770306"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2013.09.317"", ""10.1080/10508406.2017.1336022"", ""10.1080/0042098032000136192"", ""10.1080/00043125.2016.1224873"", ""10.1080/09518398.2014.916006"", ""10.1080/00393541.2014.11518922"", ""10.1002/sce.21522"", ""10.1007/s10798-015-9333-0"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1502_1"", ""10.1007/BF00311065"", ""10.1073/pnas.1820266116"", ""10.4324/9780203458563"", ""10.1080/10508406.2017.1314215"", ""10.1080/095006999290570"", ""10.1080/21548455.2020.1727587"", ""10.1177/0263276415592245"", ""10.1080/10632913.2017.1316331"", ""10.1177/0306312716663047"", ""10.1111/ssm.12201"", ""10.1007/BF01405730"", ""10.18848/1836-6236/CGP/v08i03/21-30"", ""10.1080/10598650.2017.1407908"", ""10.1088/0031-9120/51/4/045007"", ""10.1162/LEON_e_00161"", ""10.1162/IJLM_a_00075"", ""10.4324/9780203420065"", ""10.1128/jmbe.v19i1.1360"", ""10.1002/sce.21555"", ""10.1080/03080188.2017.1381223"", ""10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/03187-9"", ""10.1007/s11191-011-9425-5"", ""10.1080/10665684.2018.1439786"", ""10.1162/LEON_a_00377"", ""10.2307/j.ctt2204pqp.9"", ""10.4324/9780203774977-19"", ""10.1080/14926156.2016.1166294"", ""10.1080/02783193.2018.1434712"", ""10.1080/00043125.2012.11519191"", ""10.14697/jkase.2012.32.6.1072"", ""10.1007/s11422-014-9578-z""]","['Environmental Science', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Information Systems and Management']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)]]"
10.3102/0013189X19898690,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,Reassessing Disparities in Online Learner Student Engagement in Higher Education,"Online learning is the fastest growing segment in U.S. higher education and is increasingly adopted in public and private not-for-profit institutions. While the impact of online learning on educational outcomes is becoming more clear, the literature on its connection with student engagement is sparse. Student engagement measures identify key aspects of the learning process that can improve learning and outcomes like retention and achievement. The few studies investigating the link between online learning and student engagement found positive benefits for online learners compared to face-to-face learners in terms of perceived academic challenge, learning gains, satisfaction, and better study habits. On the other hand, face-to-face learners reported higher levels of environment support, collaborative learning, and faculty interaction. However, these studies did not effectively account for the differences in background characteristics like age, time spent working or caring for dependents, and enrollment status. Further, they did not consider the increasingly large population of students who enroll in both online and face-to-face courses. In our study, we used propensity score matching on the 2015 National Survey of Student Engagement data to account for the disparities in these groups’ demographics variables. After matching, we found that some of the previous literature’s differences diminish or disappear entirely. This suggests differences in supportive environments and learning strategies have more to do with online student characteristics than learning mode. However, online learning still falls well below other modes in terms of collaborative learning and interaction with faculty.","[{""name"": ""Justin Paulsen"", ""affiliation"": [""Indiana University, Bloomington, IN""]}, {""name"": ""Alexander C.

Space robots have been deployed in space science experiments, extravehicular operations, and deep space exploration. The application of space robots undoubtedly reduces the risk and cost of space activities. Traditional space robots primarily utilize rigid structures, resulting in limited degrees of freedom, which restricts their operational capabilities. In contrast, soft robots with greater flexibility and robustness may be used for future space exploration. Soft robots applied in space environments must overcome significant challenges associated with ultrahigh vacuum, microgravity, extreme temperatures, and high‐energy radiation. Herein, a comprehensive analysis of the key advantages of soft robots is presented based on the special requirements of the space environments for soft robots. Furthermore, brief insights into how soft robots must be changed in terms of their design, modeling, fabrication, sensing, and control to adapt to space environments are discussed. Specifically, soft robot scenarios with potential space application value are introduced. Finally, opinions regarding the potential directions of soft space robots are provided.","[{""name"": ""Yongchang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System Harbin

10.3390/educsci11080403,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Higher Education Students' Perceptions of Online Learning during COVID-19-A Comparative Study,"The pandemic and subsequent ‘lockdowns’ dramatically changed the educational landscape of higher education institutions. Before-COVID-19, traditional universities had choices in pedagogical practice, which included a variety of teaching delivery modes. Overnight, a single mode of delivery became the only option for traditional higher education institutions. All services migrated to digital platforms, leading to a period of “emergency eLearning”. The full impact of this sudden shift to digital platforms on all cohorts of students is still unclear. A measure of disruption to the normal student learning experience, especially for those attending traditional universities, was inevitable. Moreover, this disruption was varied depending on the University’s country and the country’s lockdown logistics. This international, comparative, quantitative research project investigated and explored higher education students’ perceptions of emergency eLearning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences of students at universities in three countries were evaluated in terms of four dimensions: (1) home learning environment, (2) engagement, (3) participation preference, and (4) impact on learning skills. The research revealed significant differences between the participating universities students’ experiences. The most important differences were in the ‘home learning environment’, followed by ‘engagement’ and the perception of ‘impact on learning skills’. The differences in the ‘home learning environment’ can be attributed to the differing economic and digital development of the surveyed countries: South Africa, Wales, and Hungary. Finally, different cultural backgrounds suggest a noticeable difference in student engagement, participation, and learning skills.","[{""name"": ""Desireé J.

10.1186/s12909-020-02343-7,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Attitudes and concerns of undergraduate university health sciences students in Croatia regarding complete switch to e-learning during COVID-19 pandemic: a survey,"Abstract Background Croatia has closed all educational institutions after 32 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed and switched to exclusive e-learning. Health sciences university students may have been particularly affected with this change due to a lack of practical education. It is not known how health sciences students and schools have adjusted to exclusive e-learning. This study aimed to explore attitudes and concerns of health sciences students in Croatia regarding the complete switch to e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Eligible participants were students from 9 institutions offering university-level health sciences education in Croatia enrolled in the academic year 2019/2010, and participating in e-learning. Data were collected with a questionnaire distributed via email during April/May 2020. Results A total of 2520 students (aged 25.7 ± 7.7 years) responded to the questionnaire (70.3% response rate). General satisfaction with exclusive e-learning was rated with average grade of 3.7 out of 5. Compared with previous education, exclusive e-learning was rated with average grade of 3.2 out of 5. Compared to classroom learning, equal or higher motivation to attend exclusive e-learning was reported by 64.4% of participants. With a longer duration of exclusive e-learning, equal or higher motivation was reported by 65.5% of participants. Less than half of the students indicated they felt deprived or concerned due to the lack of practical lessons. Most participants indicated that in the future, they would prefer to combine classic classroom and e-learning (N = 1403; 55.7%). Conclusions Most health sciences students were satisfied with the exclusive e-learning, as well as their personal and institutional adjustment to it. Students’ feedback can help institutions to improve the exclusive e-learning experience for students in the time of the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Livia Puljak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marta Čivljak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ana Haramina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Snježana Mališa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dalibor Čavić"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dinko Klinec"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diana Aranza"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jasna Mesarić"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nataša Skitarelić"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sanja Zoranić"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dijana Majstorović"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marijana Neuberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Štefica Mikšić"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kata Ivanišević"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/medu.14164"", ""10.1002/ase.1970"", ""10.3390/ijerph17155519"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02208-z"", ""10.1007/BF03032712"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2009.06.002"", ""10.1080/00098655.2016.1191311"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.5227"", ""10.1186/s12874-020-01047-2"", ""10.1111/medu.14268"", ""10.1111/medu.14283"", ""10.1002/ase.1968"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.12.020""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The results showed that these future graduates had an upper intermediate level of competence in information and digital literacy, and communication and collaboration, but a lower intermediate level in terms of digital content creation, particularly in the creation and dissemination of multimedia content using different tools. Two student profiles were identified for time spent online: those who dedicated a lot of their time to gaming or interacting on social media, and those who used most of their online time to searching for information and completing academic work.","[{""name"": ""Eloy López-Meneses"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fabrizio Manuel Sirignano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Esteban Vázquez-Cano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""José Manuel Ramírez-Hurtado"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Gender Studies', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.12955,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,The role of informal digital learning of English and L2 motivational self system in foreign language enjoyment,"AbstractThis interdisciplinary research examines how Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) and the L2 Motivational Self System (consisting of the ideal L2 self and the ought‐to L2 self) are linked with Foreign Language Enjoyment (FLE). Together, these are flourishing research areas in computer‐assisted language learning, second language acquisition and positive psychology. Using a purposive sampling technique, three cohorts of English‐as‐a‐foreign‐language learners (N = 661) are surveyed in South Korea: middle school (n = 173), high school (n = 374) and university students (n = 114). Results of hierarchical regression analyses show that IDLE and the ideal L2 self are significantly predictive of all groups’ FLE, while the ought‐to L2 self predicts only middle school students’ FLE. These results suggest that students’ engagement in extramural digital activities and their motivational mindset (shaped through different socio‐educational contexts) may have influenced their emotions in learning their target language. Informed by these results, teachers can help increase students’ L2 learning enjoyment by supporting their language learning in out‐of‐class digital settings as well as promoting their ideal L2 self‐images. Concurrently, teachers and parents can enhance younger learners’ enjoyment of learning L2—especially in test‐oriented Asian contexts—by setting higher L2 learning expectations.","[{""name"": ""Ju Seong Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kilryoung Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-1770.1975.tb00115.x"", ""10.1111/j.1741-3729.2012.00754.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2013.12036.x"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2018.8.1.1"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2014.4.2.5"", ""10.1177/1362168817692161"", ""10.21832/9781847691293-003"", ""10.4324/9781315779553"", ""10.1002/9781119472384"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.56.3.218"", ""10.1037/h0083787"", ""10.21832/9781783097722"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.94.3.319"", ""10.14400/JDC.2017.15.6.315"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.1986.tb05256.x"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.02.017"", ""10.1016/j.system.2017.11.005"", ""10.1002/tesq.171"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1535509"", ""10.1111/bjet.12599"", ""10.14742/ajet.5177"", ""10.1002/tesq.422"", ""10.1080/01434632.2019.1614187"", ""10.1016/j.system.2018.06.004"", ""10.21832/9781783095360"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.41.9.954"", ""10.21832/9781847697042"", ""10.1007/s10902-004-1278-z"", ""10.1177/0033688214561621"", ""10.1159/000289026"", ""10.1177/1362168819846597"", ""10.1037//0003-066X.55.1.5"", ""10.1057/9781137414885"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-46048-6"", ""10.21832/9781847691293-005"", ""10.1080/01443410601066669"", ""10.1016/j.system.2013.12.022"", ""10.1016/j.system.2018.11.003""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1002/tea.21644,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING,0401 Education,"The context dependence of physics identity: Examining the role of performance/competence, recognition, interest, and sense of belonging for lower and upper female physics undergraduates","AbstractWhile there is a growing body of work that examines disciplinary identity development, unlike qualitative work in this area, quantitative research has not fully incorporated the importance of different contexts, nor has it uniquely focused on underrepresented groups (in this case, women in physics). This study examines how the constructs posited by prior work as important for physics identity, as well as an additional theorized construct, may interrelate and affect female students' physics identity differently depending on the context. Context in this study refers to two different experiential levels in college. The constructs examined include performance/competence, recognition, and interest, as well as sense of belonging. In particular, we used structural equation modeling to examine the effect that these constructs have on the physics identity of two groups of female physics undergraduates: first year students and senior year students. The results reveal that the relationship of the theorized constructs with physics identity vary between the two groups as well as compared to prior research with broad college student populations (not just physics majors). Unlike broad college student populations, for our sample of female physics undergraduates, interest did not have a direct effect on physics identity while sense of belonging was significant only for senior year students. These results exemplify the importance of examining context or different types of student experiences when studying disciplinary identity development rather than generalizing previous frameworks to all contexts.","[{""name"": ""Zahra Hazari"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Teaching &amp; Learning Florida International University  Miami Florida USA"", ""STEM Transformation Institute Florida International University  Miami Florida USA"", ""Department of Physics Florida International University  Miami Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Deepa Chari"", ""affiliation"": [""Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education Tata Institute of Fundamental Research  Mumbai India""]}, {""name"": ""Geoff Potvin"", ""affiliation"": [""STEM Transformation Institute Florida International University  Miami Florida USA"", ""Department of Physics Florida International University  Miami Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Eric Brewe"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics and School of Education Drexel University  Philadelphia Pennsylvania USA""]}]","[""10.3102/0002831216678379"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.010121"", ""10.3102/0002831212458142"", ""10.1080/10508400903530044"", ""10.1002/tea.1041"", ""10.1002/tea.20006"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1033776"", ""10.1002/tea.20237"", ""10.1002/tea.21224"", ""10.1002/tea.21150"", ""10.1007/s11422-015-9723-3"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.010109"", ""10.1111/cdev.12363"", ""10.1080/09540253.2011.565040"", ""10.1080/09540250802213081"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020117"", ""10.1002/sce.20096"", ""10.3102/0034654309332562"", ""10.1080/10508400902797958"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.3200/JEXE.75.3.203-220"", ""10.3102/0091732X025001099"", ""10.1002/jee.20118"", ""10.1007/s11422-012-9447-6"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020120"", ""10.1119/1.5055325"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.6.010107"", ""10.1002/tea.20363"", ""10.1002/sce.20223"", ""10.1002/tea.21214"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.010132"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(200003)84:2<180::AID-SCE3>3.0.CO;2-X"", ""10.1002/sce.20483"", ""10.1007/BF03173559"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.020148"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.5.010101"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020110"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.020137"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.1.2.130"", ""10.1207/s15327906mbr3202_5"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.9.020121"", ""10.1145/3365571"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020105"", ""10.1525/sp.2005.52.4.593"", ""10.1002/tea.21417"", ""10.25148/etd.FIDC004054"", ""10.1002/tea.21268"", ""10.1080/00461520902832392"", ""10.18637/jss.v048.i02"", ""10.1007/BF02296192"", ""10.1002/tea.21050"", ""10.1119/1.5003737"", ""10.1080/03057260802681847"", ""10.1002/tea.20406"", ""10.1002/sce.21535"", ""10.1063/1.4789737"", ""10.4324/9780203118924"", ""10.1002/sce.20253"", ""10.1002/tea.21123"", ""10.12930/0271-9517-19.2.5"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020114"", ""10.1187/cbe.13-12-0241"", ""10.1002/tea.21449""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Safety Research']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

10.1111/medu.14268,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Medical students' preference for returning to the clinical setting during the COVID-19 pandemic,"AbstractObjectivesThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has led to widespread disruptions in the clinical education of medical students. In managing students’ return to the clinical setting, medical schools face the challenge of balancing education, service and risk considerations. To compound this challenge, medical students may prefer not to re‐enter during a period of great uncertainty, leading to substantive downstream sequelae on individual, institutional and national levels. Understanding students’ views on resuming clinical experiences, therefore, is an important consideration. The purpose of this study was to assess medical students’ preference for re‐entering the clinical setting during the COVID‐19 pandemic and to explore personal and environmental characteristics associated with that preference.MethodsWe conducted an electronic survey of currently enrolled medical students at the Duke‐NUS Medical School, less than a month into the COVID‐19 pandemic. Survey items were aligned with a conceptual framework related to medical students’ preference for returning to the clinical setting. The framework consisted of three domains: (a) non‐modifiable demographic information; (b) factors thought to be modifiable through the course of medical education, including burnout, tolerance for ambiguity, motivation and professionalism, and (c) students’ perception of COVID‐19 infection risk to self.ResultsApproximately one‐third (n=63) of 179 students preferred not to return to the clinical setting. Results of a multivariable analysis indicated that compared to this group, the two‐thirds (n=116) of students favouring return showed evidence of greater autonomous (or internal) motivation, a greater sense of professional responsibility and a lower self‐perception of harbouring risk to patients.ConclusionsStudents’ preference on returning to the clinical environment stems from the interplay of several key factors, and is substantively associated with perceptions of professional responsibility and their own potential risk to the health care system. Mindfully considering and addressing these issues may help medical schools in their preparation for returning students to the clinical setting.","[{""name"": ""Scott Compton"", ""affiliation"": [""Duke‐NUS Medical School Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Shiva Sarraf‐Yazdi"", ""affiliation"": [""Duke‐NUS Medical School Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Felicia Rustandy"", ""affiliation"": [""Duke‐NUS Medical School Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Lalit Kumar Radha Krishna"", ""affiliation"": [""Duke‐NUS Medical School Singapore""]}]","[""10.1001/jama.2020.2467"", ""10.46945/bpj.10.1.03.01"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.5227"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.3972"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.499"", ""10.1097/00005650-199311000-00002"", ""10.1093/her/cyl148"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.9406"", ""10.1023/A:1012606722230"", ""10.1001/jama.1987.03400140086030""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Gender Studies', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02164-8,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Healthcare providers perspectives on compassion training: a grounded theory study,"Abstract Background There is little concrete guidance on how to train current and future healthcare providers (HCPs) in the core competency of compassion. This study was undertaken using Straussian grounded theory to address the question: “What are healthcare providers’ perspectives on training current and future HCPs in compassion?” Methods Fifty-seven HCPs working in palliative care participated in this study, beginning with focus groups with frontline HCPs (n = 35), followed by one-on-one interviews with HCPs who were considered by their peers to be skilled in providing compassion (n = 15, three of whom also participated in the initial focus groups), and end of study focus groups with study participants (n = 5) and knowledge users (n = 10). Results Study participants largely agreed that compassionate behaviours can be taught, and these behaviours are distinct from the emotional response of compassion. They noted that while learners can develop greater compassion through training, their ability to do so varies depending on the innate qualities they possess prior to training. Participants identified three facets of an effective compassion training program: self-awareness, experiential learning and effective and affective communication skills. Participants also noted that healthcare faculties, facilities and organizations play an important role in creating compassionate practice settings and sustaining HCPs in their delivery of compassion. Conclusions Providing compassion has become a core expectation of healthcare and a hallmark of quality palliative care.

10.1007/s10639-020-10167-7,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,An account of EFL learners' self-efficacy and gender in the Flipped Classroom Model,"AbstractEmerging technologies and mobile devices have enabled improved quality of learning outcomes in the field of language learning. With the opportunities provided by innovative, emerging tools, traditional ways of learning have been enhanced. The flipped classroom is one of the innovative learning models that have appeared in language learning in the last decade. The current study was carried out to investigate the difference that the flipped classroom made on students’ self-efficacy and gender. 58 participants with an intermediate proficiency level in English were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: experimental (flipped classroom) and control (traditional) group. The participants employed the Self-Efficacy Survey before and after the intervention of flipped classroom. The results demonstrated a significant increase in self-efficacy scores of the experimental group. When gender was analyzed separately, the females in the experimental group were found to have greater improvements in self-efficacy than their male colleagues in the experimental group when utilizing the flipped classroom practice. In the light of the results, students, especially female students can increase their individual confidence in producing specific or requested performance in language learning while engaged in the flipped classroom.","[{""name"": ""Ehsan Namaziandost"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fidel Çakmak"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.32861/ellr.59.164.172"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2010.07.010"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191"", ""10.1002/cae.21622"", ""10.1002/cae.22176"", ""10.1111/bjet.12278"", ""10.1080/10447318.2018.1543082"", ""10.1007/s11423-013-9305-6"", ""10.3991/ijet.v13i02.7816"", ""10.1007/s11528-013-0698-1"", ""10.1080/03098265.2010.501552"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2004.01.006"", ""10.1017/S0958344013000013"", ""10.1080/2331186X.2019.1638147"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1504083"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.01.031"", ""10.17507/tpls.0806.17"", ""10.1080/09588221.2014.967701"", ""10.1002/tesq.328"", ""10.1080/09588221.2015.1111910"", ""10.1007/s10956-011-9351-y"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.05.006"", ""10.1002/tesq.372"", ""10.1177/000494411205600205"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.2011.00091.x"", ""10.14738/assrj.53.4328"", ""10.1080/2331186X.2018.1560601"", ""10.18178/ijiet.2018.8.4.1052"", ""10.1016/j.iree.2014.08.003"", ""10.1177/0092055X11418685"", ""10.32996/ijllt.v2i5.618"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.02.056"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.52.6.613"", ""10.1177/0956797617741719"", ""10.1007/s10984-012-9108-4"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0135-4"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v10i2.598"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-1882-2.ch002"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1144574""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1093/elt/ccab072,ELT JOURNAL,0401 Education,Activity-induced boredom in online EFL classes,"Abstract The concept of boredom has recently attracted the attention of researchers in L2 education. As most of the available literature has focused on traditional, in-person classes, very little is known about how L2 students experience this aversive emotion in online classes, especially those prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To fill this gap, this large-scale, qualitative study surveys the opinion of 240 demographically versatile English major students from twenty-five universities in Iran to identify the activity types that are more likely to induce boredom in online classes. Thematic analysis of data, collected through open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews and analysed through MAXQDA software, revealed ten different activity types which were boredom-inducing due to their non-engaging or cognitively (un)demanding nature. The findings are then discussed in light of relevant theories of boredom, and suggestions are given for making these activities less boring in online classes.","[{""name"": ""Ali Derakhshan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mariusz Kruk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mostafa Mehdizadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mirosław Pawlak"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/tesq.387"", ""10.1016/j.system.2021.102556"", ""10.1111/flan.12452"", ""10.1111/flan.12460"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.549653"", ""10.1111/modl.12693"", ""10.1016/j.system.2021.102469"", ""10.1177/1362168820914004"", ""10.1007/s10648-006-9029-9"", ""10.1093/elt/ccs079""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1111/medu.14295,MEDICAL EDUCATION,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,'Whispers and shadows': A critical review of the professional identity literature with respect to minority physicians,"AbstractObjectivesProfessional identity formation (PIF) is a growing area of research in medical education. However, it is unclear whether the present research base is suitable for understanding PIF in physicians considered to be under‐represented in medicine (URM). This meta‐ethnography examined the qualitative PIF literature from 2012 to 2019 to assess its capacity to shine light on the experiences of minoritised physicians.MethodsData were gathered using a search of six well‐known medical education journals for the term ‘professional identit*’ in titles, keywords, abstracts and subheadings, delineated with the date range of 2012‐2019. All non‐relevant abstracts were removed and papers were then further reduced to those that focused only on learners’ experiences. This left 67 articles in the final dataset, which were analysed using a collaborative approach among a team of researchers. The team members used their professional expertise as qualitative researchers and personal experiences as minoritised individuals to synthesise and interpret the PIF literature.ResultsFour conceptual categories were identified as impacting PIF: Individual versus Sociocultural Influences; the Formal versus the Hidden Curriculum; Institutional versus Societal Values; and Negotiation of Identity versus Dissonance in Identity. However, a major gap was identified; only one study explored experiences of PIF in URM physicians and there was an almost complete absence of critical stances used to study PIF. Combined, these findings suggest that PIF research is building on existing theories without questioning their validity with reference to minoritised physicians.ConclusionsFrom a post‐colonial perspective, the fact that race and ethnicity have been largely absent, invisible or considered irrelevant within PIF research is problematic. A new line of inquiry is needed, one that uses alternative frameworks, such as critical theory, to account for the ways in which power and domination influence PIF for URM physicians in order to foreground how larger sociohistorical issues influence and shape the identities of minoritised physicians.","[{""name"": ""Tasha R.

10.1002/sce.21588,SCIENCE EDUCATION,0401 Education,"""Estoy Explorando Science"": Emergent bilingual students problematizing electrical phenomena through translanguaging","AbstractAs science education continues to embrace science‐as‐practice, equitable science learning environments must value and leverage emergent bilingual students' ways of communicating. This study investigates the translanguaging practices of a group of elementary‐aged emergent bilingual students while they problematized electrical phenomena. Building on asset‐oriented theories for supporting student learning, I utilize translanguaging as a theoretical and pedagogical lens for understanding how emergent bilingual students leverage their full semiotic repertoires for productive disciplinary engagement. The study took place in an out‐of‐school program focused on creating opportunities for students to problematize electrical phenomena, specifically electrical resistance. I present a close analysis of students constructing models of electric flow through a circuit and how electrical resistance regulates that flow. The findings also include evidence that students engaged in different kinds of translanguaging practices when problematizing electrical phenomena and co‐constructing knowledge with each other and the instructor. Specifically, students drew from and used multiple linguistic and nonlinguistic semiotic resources for communicating their models. Finally, the findings suggest that the instructor's pedagogical moves and own translanguaging practices implicitly signaled to students when and how to participate in translanguaging practices themselves. The findings emphasize the importance of desettling what counts as productive forms of communication in science for elementary‐aged emergent bilingual students by eschewing pedagogical models that police discursive boundaries. Therefore, equitable science learning environments must create opportunities for emergent bilingual students to leverage their full semiotic repertoires for meaning‐making, by inviting and valuing multiple languages and gestures.","[{""name"": ""Enrique Suárez"", ""affiliation"": [""Teacher Education and Curriculum Studies University of Massachusetts Amherst Massachusetts""]}]","[""10.58680/la201425001"", ""10.58680/la20042908"", ""10.1159/000345322"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep3904_6"", ""10.1002/tea.21257"", ""10.1080/14790718.2017.1315809"", ""10.1080/10350330.2018.1521355"", ""10.1002/tea.20228"", ""10.1002/tea.20255"", ""10.3102/0013189X032001009"", ""10.1207/S1532690XCI2101_1"", ""10.1080/01434632.2019.1592181"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(200005)84:3<287::AID-SCE1>3.0.CO;2-A"", ""10.4324/9780203978023"", ""10.3102/0091732X07309371"", ""10.1119/1.1614813"", ""10.1207/S1532690XCI2004_1"", ""10.21832/9781783090815-016"", ""10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.149"", ""10.1002/sce.20263"", ""10.3102/0091732X030001001"", ""10.1002/j.1545-7249.2009.tb00172.x"", ""10.4324/9781315695242"", ""10.1057/9781137385765_4"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01208.x"", ""10.1598/JAAL.44.8.3"", ""10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01397-2"", ""10.1002/tea.21310"", ""10.1016/S0378-2166(99)00096-X"", ""10.1007/s11191-017-9884-4"", ""10.1002/tesq.443"", ""10.1598/RRQ.43.2.3"", ""10.58680/rte20065110"", ""10.3102/0013189X032005019"", ""10.17763/haer.65.3.r16146n25h4mh384"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls0401_2"", ""10.1007/s10972-016-9491-2"", ""10.1002/sce.21248"", ""10.3102/00028312032003465"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1080/00405841.2011.607379"", ""10.3102/0013189X027004012"", ""10.1002/tea.3660320804"", ""10.3102/0013189X13480524"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2010.07.035"", ""10.1093/applin/amx039"", ""10.1080/00131911.2011.628748"", ""10.1080/07370008.2014.1000490"", ""10.58680/rte201012743"", ""10.1080/15427587.2014.871622"", ""10.1080/13670050.2014.939138"", ""10.1088/0031-9120/35/6/306"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226514642.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11217-007-9071-1"", ""10.1002/sce.21305"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139519526.041"", ""10.1353/con.1994.0003"", ""10.1002/sce.21452"", ""10.1080/0263514830010108"", ""10.1515/applirev-2015-0014"", ""10.1007/s10956-012-9428-2"", ""10.1080/03057260508560216"", ""10.1080/10508406.2010.491752"", ""10.1080/1049482940040204"", ""10.3102/00346543071003365"", ""10.1002/sce.20264"", ""10.1002/adma.201101328"", ""10.1080/10508406.2013.778204"", ""10.1002/tea.20311"", ""10.1007/s10649-008-9161-1"", ""10.1007/s11422-013-9522-7"", ""10.1080/15348431.2014.944704"", ""10.1002/sce.21112"", ""10.1080/15427587.2011.545759"", ""10.1002/tea.21415"", ""10.1002/sce.20232"", ""10.17763/0017-8055.86.2.206"", ""10.1002/tea.1017"", ""10.1080/1046560X.2018.1529520""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003555,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,"When a Specialty Becomes ""Women's Work"": Trends in and Implications of Specialty Gender Segregation in Medicine","The gender composition of physician specialties varies dramatically with some becoming increasingly female predominant while others remain overwhelmingly male. In their analysis of physician workforce data, the authors demonstrate that despite large increases in the number of female physicians over 4 decades, the degree of gender segregation between specialties has not declined. The authors describe lessons from the highly gender-segregated U.S. workforce as a whole to understand these demographic patterns in the physician workforce. Echoing U.S. workforce findings, women physicians are becoming overrepresented in certain specialties, and this appears to be associated with a relative decline in earnings for physicians in these specialties over time. The authors found a strong negative relationship between the proportion of female physicians in a specialty and its mean salary, with gender composition explaining 64% of the variation in salaries among the medical specialties. Female physicians face biases in the workplace and fall behind male peers in leadership attainment, academic advancement, and earnings. Tenacious gender stereotypes and the conflation of gender and status contribute to these biases and reinforce occupational gender segregation. The clustering of women in certain specialties means these specialties will be disproportionately affected by gender bias. Recognizing the consequences of gender demographics within physician specialties is important to maintain the strong and diverse physician workforce needed to support the health care needs of the populations who depend on these specialties for care.","[{""name"": ""Elaine Pelley"", ""affiliation"": [""E.

The goal of these synthetics is to swim like natural micro‐organisms through biological environments and perform complex tasks such as drug delivery and microsurgery. Extensive efforts in the past several decades have focused on generating propulsion at the microscopic scale, which has engendered a variety of artificial microswimmers based on different physical and physicochemical mechanisms. Yet, these major advancements represent only the initial steps toward successful biomedical applications of microswimmers in realistic scenarios. A next step is to design “smart” microswimmers that can adapt their locomotion behaviors in response to environmental factors. Herein, recent progress in the development of microswimmers with intelligent behaviors is surveyed in three major areas: 1) adaptive locomotion across different media, 2) tactic behaviors in response to environment stimuli, and 3) multifunctional swimmers that can perform complex tasks. The emerging technologies and novel approaches used in developing these “smart” microswimmers, which enable them to display behaviors similar to biological cells, are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Alan C.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003717,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Medical Education's Wicked Problem: Achieving Equity in Assessment for Medical Learners,"Despite a lack of intent to discriminate, physicians educated in U.S. medical schools and residency programs often take actions that systematically disadvantage minority patients. The approach to assessment of learner performance in medical education can similarly disadvantage minority learners. The adoption of holistic admissions strategies to increase the diversity of medical training programs has not been accompanied by increases in diversity in honor societies, selective residency programs, medical specialties, and medical school faculty. These observations prompt justified concerns about structural and interpersonal bias in assessment. This manuscript characterizes equity in assessment as a “wicked problem” with inherent conflicts, uncertainty, dynamic tensions, and susceptibility to contextual influences. The authors review the underlying individual and structural causes of inequity in assessment. Using an organizational model, they propose strategies to achieve equity in assessment and drive institutional and systemic improvement based on clearly articulated principles. This model addresses the culture, systems, and assessment tools necessary to achieve equitable results that reflect stated principles. Three components of equity in assessment that can be measured and evaluated to confirm success include intrinsic equity (selection and design of assessment tools), contextual equity (the learning environment in which assessment occurs), and instrumental equity (uses of assessment data for learner advancement and selection and program evaluation).

10.7821/naer.2021.1.616,JOURNAL OF NEW APPROACHES IN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0401 Education,"Digital Rights, Digital Citizenship and Digital Literacy: What's the Difference?","Abstract Using digital media is complicated. Invasions of privacy, increasing dataveillance, digital-by-default commercial and civic transactions and the erosion of the democratic sphere are just some of the complex issues in modern societies. Existential questions associated with digital life challenge the individual to come to terms with who they are, as well as their social interactions and realities. In this article, we identify three contemporary normative responses to these complex issues –digital citizenship, digital rights and digital literacy. These three terms capture epistemological and ontological frames that theorise and enact (both in policy and everyday social interactions) how individuals learn to live in digitally mediated societies. The article explores the effectiveness of each in addressing the philosophical, ethical and practical issues raised by datafication, and the limitations of human agency as an overarching goal within these responses. We examine how each response addresses challenges in policy, everyday social life and political rhetoric, tracing the fluctuating uses of these terms and their address to different stakeholders. The article concludes with a series of conceptual and practical ‘action points’ that might optimise these responses to the benefit of the individual and society.","[{""name"": ""Luci Pangrazio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julian Sefton-Green"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780429242595"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7893.003.0002"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1gk0941"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11805.001.0001"", ""10.1177/2053951718786316"", ""10.1177/1354856513482090"", ""10.1177/2053951714528481"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2011.00474.x"", ""10.1177/1461444816686318"", ""10.1177/1461444816686328"", ""10.1177/1461444816686327"", ""10.1177/1461444814543995"", ""10.1080/08900523.2014.863124"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7428.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203728918"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1707223"", ""10.1177/1461444818799523"", ""10.1007/s10758-018-9384-x"", ""10.4324/9781351046794"", ""10.1080/13562517.2019.1696301 10.1080/13562517.2019.1696301"", ""10.4324/9780203516133"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.013.1005"", ""10.1177/0894439303262580"", ""10.1300/J399v01n04_03"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-48865-7""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

El objetivo de investigación se centra en conocer la incidencia que ejercen en el nivel de competencia digital algunos factores inherentes a la función docente: sexo, edad, experiencia, etapa educativa y nivel de formación. Se ha empleado un diseño cuantitativo sustentado en un enfoque descriptivo y correlacional, con una muestra de 520 docentes españoles de las etapas de infantil, primaria y secundaria. Se empleó un cuestionario validado para medir la competencia digital y otro cuestionario ad hoc para los datos sociodemográficos y formativos. Los resultados revelan que las mujeres disponen de mayor nivel en la creación de contenidos digitales que los hombres, los cuales destacan en la resolución de problemas; existe una relación inversamente proporcional entre edad y nivel competencial; la experiencia mejora el nivel de seguridad digital; la etapa incide en el nivel de información y alfabetización, comunicación y creación de contenidos; el nivel de formación continua es directamente proporcional al nivel competencial. Se concluye que los factores inherentes a la práctica educativa indicen significativamente en el nivel de competencia digital docente. Knowing the factors that affect the digital teaching competence is essential for schools to develop training plans tailored to the needs of current students. The research objective is focused on knowing the incidence that some factors inherent to the teaching function have on the level of digital competence: sex, age, experience, educational stage and level of training. A quantitative design based on a descriptive and correlational approach has been used, with a sample of 520 Spanish teachers from the infant, primary and secondary stages. A validated questionnaire was used to measure digital competence and another ad hoc questionnaire for sociodemographic and formative data. The results reveal that women have a higher level of digital content creation than men, which stand out in solving problems; there is an inversely proportional relationship between age and competence level; the experience improves the level of digital security; the stage affects the level of information and literacy, communication and content creation; The level of continuing education is directly proportional to the competence level. It is concluded that the factors inherent in educational practice significantly indicate the level of digital teaching competence.","[{""name"": ""Santiago Pozo Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesús López Belmonte"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Manuel Fernández Cruz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juan Antonio L´ópez Núñez"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

10.1111/medu.14364,MEDICAL EDUCATION,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Synchronous distance education vs traditional education for health science students: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"AbstractContextSynchronous distance education (SDE) has been widely used for health science students in recent years. This study examined the effectiveness and acceptance of SDE compared with traditional education for health science students and explored the potential moderators that could impact the pooled results.MethodsA systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from January 2000 to March 2020 searched on nine electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The outcomes measured were knowledge, skills with objective assessments and overall satisfaction with subjective evaluations. The pooled results were calculated using random‐model effects, and moderators were explored through meta‐regression.ResultsA total of seven RCTs with 594 participants were included. At the post‐test level, the pooled effect size of knowledge acquisitions (SMD 0.12, 95% CI −0.07‐0.32) showed insignificant difference between the SDE and traditional education groups (P = .207), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 17.6%). Subgroup analyses observed no factors that significantly impacted the pooled results of knowledge acquisition at the post‐test levels (P for interaction &gt; 0.05). Knowledge gains from pretest to post‐test in SDE groups also did not differ significantly between groups (SMD 0.15, 95% CI −0.22‐0.53; P = .428). The pooled effect size of skills (SMD 0.02, 95% CI −0.24‐0.28; P = .735) was similarly insignificant. The pooled effect size of overall satisfaction (SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.38‐0.83; P &lt; .001) significantly favoured SDE over traditional education. Incorporating two‐group studies without randomisations did not significantly change the overall results of knowledge acquisition at the post‐test level (SMD −0.002, 95% CI −0.11‐0.10; P = .994), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 61.9%).ConclusionsSynchronous distance education was not significantly different from traditional education in effectiveness and had higher satisfaction ratings. Our findings might provide indications for adoptions of online remote education in health science education centres.","[{""name"": ""Liyun He"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Na Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Lingling Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Fan Ping"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Wei Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Qi Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuxiu Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Huijuan Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Huabing Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Endocrinology Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of National Health Commission Peking Union Medical College Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103789"", ""10.1111/medu.13200"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03466.x"", ""10.1152/advan.00108.2019"", ""10.1152/advan.00113.2016"", ""10.1080/10401334.2013.797344"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2019.05.009"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-14-45"", ""10.1007/s00405-014-3326-6"", ""10.3102/00346543074003379"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.1001/jama.298.9.1002"", ""10.1136/bmj.l4898"", ""10.1136/bmj.39489.470347.AD"", ""10.1001/jama.2011.1234"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-14-135"", ""10.1097/00001888-200506000-00005"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2003.01586.x"", ""10.2214/AJR.19.21131"", ""10.1007/s12098-012-0742-8"", ""10.1002/ase.1776"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0175117"", ""10.1177/1742271X14567173"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2014.78.10.tb05820.x"", ""10.1002/ase.1465"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2013.77.6.tb05525.x"", ""10.1002/ase.1347"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2013.77.12.tb05643.x"", ""10.5688/ajpe758150"", ""10.1258/jtt.2011.110811"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2013.03.005"", ""10.1080/10401334.2010.512539"", ""10.1080/10401330709336616"", ""10.5688/aj700110"", ""10.1016/j.amjsurg.2004.04.012"", ""10.1007/s10926-006-9047-y"", ""10.1080/1357628031000116907"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.018"", ""10.1111/bjet.12558"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2014.11.006"", ""10.1111/medu.14177"", ""10.1111/medu.14181"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003441"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003540"", ""10.1111/medu.14192"", ""10.1126/science.abb5793"", ""10.1111/medu.14194""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Point‐LIO has two key novelties. The first one is a point‐by‐point LIO framework that updates the state at each LiDAR point measurement. This framework allows an extremely high‐frequency odometry output, significantly increases the odometry bandwidth, and fundamentally removes the artificial in‐frame motion distortion. The second one is a stochastic process‐augmented kinematic model which models the IMU measurement as an output. This new modeling method enables accurate localization and reliable mapping for aggressive motions even with inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements saturated in the middle of the motion. Various real‐world experiments are conducted for performance evaluation. Overall, Point‐LIO is capable to provide accurate, high‐frequency odometry (4–8 kHz) and reliable mapping under severe vibrations and aggressive motions with high angular velocity (75 rad s−1) beyond the IMU measuring ranges. Furthermore, an exhaustive benchmark comparison is conducted. Point‐LIO achieves consistently comparable accuracy and time consumption. Finally, two example applications of Point‐LIO are demonstrated, one is a racing drone and the other is a self‐rotating unmanned aerial vehicle, both have aggressive motions.","[{""name"": ""Dongjiao He"", ""affiliation"": [""MaRS Laboratory Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Hong Kong  Pokfulam Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Wei Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""MaRS Laboratory Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Hong Kong  Pokfulam Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Nan Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""MaRS Laboratory Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Hong Kong  Pokfulam Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Fanze Kong"", ""affiliation"": [""MaRS Laboratory Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Hong Kong  Pokfulam Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Chongjian Yuan"", ""affiliation"": [""MaRS Laboratory Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Hong Kong  Pokfulam Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Fu Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""MaRS Laboratory Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Hong Kong  Pokfulam Hong Kong""]}]","[""10.1177/0278364908091366"", ""10.1109/TRO.2006.886264"", ""10.1002/rob.21842"", ""10.1109/LRA.2021.3101877"", ""10.1177/0278364917696568"", ""10.1002/rob.20147"", ""10.1002/rob.20255"", ""10.3390/mi11050456"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2021.3058173"", ""10.1109/LRA.2021.3070251"", ""10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197567"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793511"", ""10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561364"", ""10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197440"", ""10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341176"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-71151-1_34"", ""10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967704"", ""10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636763"", ""10.1109/LRA.2021.3064227"", ""10.1109/LRA.2021.3060721"", ""10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9811605"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-40686-7_22"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2013.6630700"", ""10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967880"", ""10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636655"", ""10.1002/rob.21504"", ""10.1002/rob.21614"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2018.8461000"", ""10.1109/IROS.2015.7353368"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794429"", ""10.1109/TRO.2020.3018641"", ""10.1109/TAES.2021.3135234"", ""10.3390/s150716710"", ""10.3390/s140711805"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989739"", ""10.1109/IROS.2016.7759267"", ""10.1109/IROS.2018.8594463"", ""10.1109/TRO.2016.2597321"", ""10.1109/TIE.2023.3237872"", ""10.1109/9.250476"", ""10.1007/s10514-012-9293-0"", ""10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341406"", ""10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196526"", ""10.1109/IROS.2013.6696528""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Environmental Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

10.1007/s10734-020-00500-x,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Mapping the scattered field of research on higher education. A correlated topic model of 17,000 articles, 1991-2018","AbstractParallel to the increasing level of maturity of the field of research on higher education, an increasing number of scholarly works aims at synthesising and presenting overviews of the field. We identify three important pitfalls these previous studies struggle with, i.e. a limited scope, a lack of a content-related analysis, and/or a lack of an inductive approach. We take these limitations into account by analysing the abstracts of 16,928 articles on higher education between 1991 and 2018. To investigate this huge collection of texts, we apply topic models, which are a collection of automatic content analysis methods that allow to map the structure of large text data. After an in-depth discussion of the topics differentiated by our model, we study how these topics have evolved over time. In addition, we analyse which topics tend to co-occur in articles. This reveals remarkable gaps in the literature which provides interesting opportunities for future research. Furthermore, our analysis corroborates the claim that the field of research on higher education consists of isolated ‘islands’. Importantly, we find that these islands drift further apart because of a trend of specialisation. This is a bleak finding, suggesting the (further) disintegration of our field.","[{""name"": ""Stijn Daenekindt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeroen Huisman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01621459.2015.1051182"", ""10.1177/1028315317710093"", ""10.1214/07-AOAS114"", ""10.1002/asi.23329"", ""10.1007/BF01383735"", ""10.1080/03075079.2014.977858"", ""10.1007/s11192-016-2228-3"", ""10.1057/hep.2014.31"", ""10.2307/2112203"", ""10.1080/07294360.2012.690369"", ""10.1080/13562517.2012.658554"", ""10.1007/s10734-010-9404-9"", ""10.1080/13600800802558833"", ""10.1007/s11162-010-9166-3"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2013.08.004"", ""10.1080/07448481.2010.483706"", ""10.1073/pnas.0307752101"", ""10.1093/pan/mps028"", ""10.1080/13562510903186824"", ""10.1007/s10734-013-9695-8"", ""10.1057/hep.2013.30"", ""10.1023/B:IHIE.0000018911.00811.5c"", ""10.1353/rhe.1998.0004"", ""10.1111/hequ.12015"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.646258"", ""10.1080/07294360.2012.751864"", ""10.1007/s11162-016-9418-y"", ""10.1353/csd.2005.0061"", ""10.1023/A:1015573429956"", ""10.1177/0306312707086190"", ""10.1080/07294360.2012.642846"", ""10.1080/07294360.2012.719283"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2013.10.001"", ""10.1007/s10734-008-9173-x"", ""10.1111/ajps.12103"", ""10.1177/1749975518764861"", ""10.1007/s10734-018-0230-9"", ""10.1177/0098628314562683"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2015.1035523"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-08-2012-0075"", ""10.1007/s10734-005-2429-9"", ""10.1080/07294360.2012.750275"", ""10.1007/s10734-014-9718-0"", ""10.1080/07294360.2017.1389858"", ""10.5040/9781474283779"", ""10.1353/csd.0.0080"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36809-7""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['General Social Sciences', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)]]"

This study investigated the relationship between students’ academic success and online interaction and participation and explored their class attendance (synchronous virtual classes and/or watching the recorded virtual classes) in the online study mode of an enabling program at Southern Cross University in Australia. The Preparing for Success at SCU Program equips students with study skills for success at university. The data were retrieved from usage information data provided by the Blackboard Learn learning management system. The results show that it is important for students to attend class, but it does not necessarily make a difference whether students attend synchronous virtual classes or watch the recordings of the virtual classes. A significant relationship was found between academic success and the number of hours students participated in and interacted with the online learning system. Academic success may be increased by providing various options for students to participate and interact online, and to attend classes synchronously or asynchronously. The flexibility of online education can enable students to be successful in their studies. The inclusion of varied activities is therefore recommended to increase academic success in online education.","[{""name"": ""Johanna Elizabeth Nieuwoudt"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The emerging stream of academic literature on “go green” adds a new perspective to the deep-rooted conception of entrepreneurship. The objective of green entrepreneurship is to follow the traditional concepts of entrepreneurship but also brings the additional potential for society and the environment. The present paper is designed to study the impact of personality traits and university green entrepreneurial support on green entrepreneurial intentions along with the moderating role of environmental values.Design/methodology/approachThe data are collected by using the survey method, and the five-point Likert scale is used for this purpose. The statistical techniques applied to the dataset were confirmatory factor analysis and partial least square structural equation modeling.FindingsThe results revealed that personality traits are positively and significantly associated with green entrepreneurial intention, but risk-averse students depict insignificant results towards green entrepreneurial intention. Also, university green entrepreneurial support results in positive green entrepreneurial intention. Environmental values also strengthen the association.Originality/valuePreviously, researchers emphasized the entrepreneurial intentions for the sake of improving the economy, decreasing unemployment and promoting small ventures, but none focused on the green aspects of entrepreneurship. To date, we still lack knowledge regarding students' green entrepreneurial intentions and how personality traits and green support affect the intention. The focus of the present study is to sustain nature and ecosystems through green entrepreneurship by providing directions and economic and noneconomic gains for investors, entrepreneurs, students, universities and societies.","[{""name"": ""Wasim Qazi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jawaid Ahmed Qureshi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Syed Ali Raza"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Komal Akram Khan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Asif Qureshi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.02.016"", ""10.1080/13583883.2014.999110"", ""10.1080/15350770903288795"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.02.006"", ""10.1002/job.4030140202"", ""10.1108/17561391211200948"", ""10.1108/RIBS-03-2017-0022"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.11.034"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2010.07.007"", ""10.1177/0013916514554695"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2016-0024"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.143"", ""10.2753/MTP1069-6679160402"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2013.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.07.122"", ""10.1177/00139160021972829"", ""10.1080/13504851.2015.1071462"", ""10.1080/23251042.2019.1690725"", ""10.1080/09585192.2013.781528"", ""10.1007/s11187-017-9933-z"", ""10.1108/13620430710756762"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.420"", ""10.1002/hrm.21792"", ""10.1108/WJEMSD-07-2015-0029"", ""10.1007/s10668-012-9382-4"", ""10.1108/JRME-04-2018-0023"", ""10.1108/IJIS-02-2017-0017"", ""10.1108/14626001211250144"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.031"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-07-2017-0114"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1080/08276331.2018.1551459"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2018.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.01.065"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.07.013"", ""10.1007/s11187-017-9935-x"", ""10.2753/MTP1069-6679190202"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2010.01.002"", ""10.1002/mde.2844"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8"", ""10.1080/14703297.2018.1427611"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.08.004"", ""10.1007/s11187-005-5603-7"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.07.109"", ""10.1002/ijop.12209"", ""10.1108/JIC-09-2018-0168"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.12.004"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00033-0"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00250"", ""10.1108/ET-08-2019-267"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-05-2018-0336"", ""10.1108/JEEE-10-2015-0058"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2015-0092"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2019.04.005"", ""10.1007/s10551-009-0358-8"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1365359"", ""10.1186/s40497-018-0109-3"", ""10.1108/SD-09-2018-0182"", ""10.1108/13552551211253937"", ""10.1108/BL-10-2018-0045"", ""10.1504/IJBIS.2018.089113"", ""10.1080/15256480.2017.1359729"", ""10.1108/JEEE-05-2013-0014"", ""10.1177/0735633116667357"", ""10.1108/JARHE-05-2019-0105"", ""10.1093/icc/dtm023"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12090"", ""10.1007/978-81-322-2086-2_11"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00426.x"", ""10.1108/JEEE-04-2019-0040"", ""10.1007/s11365-008-0091-2"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.07.004"", ""10.1108/13552551111139656"", ""10.2307/248922"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.02.034"", ""10.1007/s11423-019-09650-x"", ""10.1108/14676371111148018"", ""10.5367/000000009787414271"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2010.10.003"", ""10.1007/s10734-015-9946-y"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-416550-2.50007-8"", ""10.1007/s11365-020-00649-y"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-08-2016-0248"", ""10.1108/GM-08-2018-0105"", ""10.1111/etap.12230"", ""10.1007/s11187-018-0111-8""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Business and International Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

This paper explores the multifaceted impact of GAI on academic work, with a focus on student life and, in particular, the implications for international students. While GAI, exemplified by models like ChatGPT, has the potential to revolutionize education, concerns about academic integrity have arisen, leading to debates on the use of AI detection tools. This essay highlights the difficulties in reliably detecting AI-generated content, raising concerns about potential false accusations against students. It also discusses biases within AI models, emphasizing the need for fairness and equity in AI-based assessments with a particular emphasis on the disproportionate impact of GAI on international students, who already face biases and discrimination. It also highlights the potential for AI to mitigate some of these challenges by providing language support and accessibility features. Finally, this essay acknowledges the disruptive potential of GAI in higher education and calls for a balanced approach that addresses both the challenges and opportunities it presents by emphasizing the importance of AI literacy and ethical considerations in adopting AI technologies to ensure equitable access and positive outcomes for all students. We offer a coda to Ng et al.’s AI competency framework, mapped to the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy, through a lens of cultural competence with AI as a means of supporting educators to use these tools equitably in their teaching.","[{""name"": ""Tom Farrelly"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Health & Social Sciences, Munster Technological University, V92 CX88 Tralee, Co.

We conducted a sequential mixed-methods study based on Moore’s interaction framework for distance education. We administered a questionnaire to 313 students engaging in emergency online learning in low-resource settings to examine their perceptions of different engagement strategies. Our results showed that student–content engagement strategies, e.g., screen sharing, summaries, and class recordings, are perceived as the most effective, closely followed by student–teacher strategies, e.g., Q and A sessions and reminders. Student–student strategies, e.g., group chat and collaborative work, are perceived as the least effective. The perceived effectiveness of engagement strategies varies based on the students’ gender and technology access. To support instructors, instructional designers, and researchers, we propose a 10-level guide for engaging students during emergency online classes in low-resource settings.","[{""name"": ""Victoria Abou-Khalil"", ""affiliation"": [""Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8315, Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Samar Helou"", ""affiliation"": [""Global Center for Medical Engineering and Informatics, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Eliane Khalifé"", ""affiliation"": [""Business School, Saint Joseph University, Beirut 17-5208, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""MeiRong Alice Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate Institute of Digital and Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei 106, Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Rwitajit Majumdar"", ""affiliation"": [""Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8315, Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Hiroaki Ogata"", ""affiliation"": [""Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8315, Japan""]}]","[""10.20944/preprints202007.0027.v1"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105194"", ""10.1080/15391523.2017.1314780"", ""10.1023/A:1018708813711"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.89.1.29"", ""10.3102/00346543074001059"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.2005.00199.x"", ""10.1002/jdd.12339"", ""10.1080/0309877X.2017.1281887"", ""10.1093/elt/cct063"", ""10.1370/afm.1740"", ""10.1080/08923648909526659"", ""10.3102/0034654309333844"", ""10.24059/olj.v22i1.1092"", ""10.1007/s11528-016-0110-z"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.10.003"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v17i3.2293"", ""10.24059/olj.v22i2.1369"", ""10.14742/ajet.635"", ""10.1080/02680513.2011.611685"", ""10.1145/3392561.3394646"", ""10.1080/09523987.2017.1362795"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.4135/9781071878781"", ""10.21037/qims-20-714"", ""10.1080/01587919.2018.1520041"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2019.1631367"", ""10.20944/preprints202008.0246.v1"", ""10.1007/s11218-017-9381-2"", ""10.1080/1047621032000092968"", ""10.1002/ejsp.2420150303"", ""10.3390/languages4030071"", ""10.1080/1359866X.2019.1601837"", ""10.1038/466029a""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Solutionism has long been prevalent in efforts to improve education at all levels, including medical education.ThesisEducational design research (EDR) is a genre of research that features the gaining of in‐depth understanding of a problem before any prototype solution is designed and tested. It is different from other forms of scientific inquiry because it is committed to the simultaneous development of both theoretical insights and practical solutions, together with stakeholders. This approach is powerful for theory building because it privileges ecologically valid studies that embrace the complexity of investigating learning in authentic (as opposed to laboratory) settings. When conducted well, both the research process and its outcomes generate valuable contributions to practice.PreviewThis article constitutes an expository essay on EDR, comprised of three movements. First, the approach is defined, its origins are presented, and its characteristics are described. Second, a generic model for conducting EDR is offered, and illustrated with examples from the field of medical education. Third, pathways towards advancing this form of inquiry are discussed, including ways to address inherent challenges and limitations, as well as recommendations for the medical education community. Although EDR is no panacea, this article illustrates how it can serve medical education research in a wide variety of geographic and disciplinary contexts.","[{""name"": ""Susan McKenney"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Teacher Development (ELAN) Faculty of Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences University of Twente Enschede the Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Thomas C.

10.1111/bjet.12905,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,The adoption of a social learning system: Intrinsic value in the UTAUT model,"AbstractThe purpose of this study is to identify the determinants of the intention to use and the effective use of a learning management system that integrates social learning tools. Data were collected through an online questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques. As our theoretical lens, we adapted the original unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology model by extending it with intrinsic value construct. As such, this research allowed for the first time testing an extended version of the unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology model in a social learning context. Our results show that facilitating conditions and intrinsic value variables explained the behavioral intention to use a learning management system that integrates social media technology and that facilitating conditions variable predicted use behavior. Our research findings suggest fostering both students’ enjoyment and interest in using social learning technologies for education and offering them facilitating conditions to strengthen technology adoption. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Universities know that students are accustomed to use social media for personal purposes. Teachers are trying to integrate social media tools into learning management systems. There is little knowledge about what makes students’ willing to use social media tools for learning. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology is an approved model that explains the intention to use and the effective use of technology. What this paper adds The paper identifies the determinants that make students’ willing to use a learning management system in which a social media tool is embedded. Apart from the main determinants of the unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology model, intrinsic value—defined as the feeling of both enjoyment and interest from performing an activity—explains behavioral intention and use behavior toward social media systems. Implications for practice and/or policy The paper concludes with advices for decision makers in universities who want to integrate social learning tools in learning management systems: They have to pay attention to not only the social media system’s functionalities, but also to how the system can be enjoyable and interesting to use. They have to think about offering better facilitating conditions to students—like user manuals, an online FAQ, discussion forums, training sessions, or personal human support—to strengthen the adoption of social learning systems.","[{""name"": ""Hager Khechine"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benoit Raymond"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marc Augier"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0266666915597546"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.17705/1jais.00122"", ""10.1057/ejis.2014.10"", ""10.1016/j.im.2008.02.003"", ""10.2307/249688"", ""10.17705/1CAIS.04436"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00945.x"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1177/002224378802500207"", ""10.1287/mnsc.40.4.440"", ""10.1016/j.im.2007.03.005"", ""10.28945/4022"", ""10.28945/1994"", ""10.1002/cjas.1381"", ""10.1007/s40692-017-0086-5"", ""10.1007/s12528-013-9069-3"", ""10.1163/15691497-12341364"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.026"", ""10.1287/isre.2.3.192"", ""10.17705/1CAIS.03923"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-25813-8_5"", ""10.1177/0047239518766654"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v18i1.2645"", ""10.1016/j.im.2013.07.005"", ""10.1057/palgrave.fsm.4770132"", ""10.1287/isre.6.2.144"", ""10.2307/249443"", ""10.1057/ejis.2012.1"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.09.002"", ""10.15215/aupress/9781927356470.01"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.17705/1jais.00428"", ""10.1080/1097198X.2010.10856507"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1015"", ""10.1108/JEIM-09-2014-0088""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Media Technology']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"
10.1007/s10734-022-00822-y,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Rethinking authentic assessment: work, well-being, and society","AbstractThis article seeks a deeper understanding of the concept of authentic assessment which ensures it does not become another educational buzzword, slowly diminishing in real meaning. I consider the origins of the term in the US schooling sector, and how it has developed over time, and in different countries, to today focus in higher education largely on real world tasks. There is, however, I argue, a common conflation of real world with the world of work. Little of this literature actually engages with the rich philosophical debates on authenticity, and in this article, I suggest that this deeper understanding of authenticity can enable us to build on existing work on authentic assessment to develop a more holistic and richer concept that will be more beneficial to individual students and to the larger society of which they are part. I argue that we should move from thinking in terms of either the so-called real world, or the world of work, to focus our justification for authentic assessment on its social value (which encompasses but is not limited to its economic value). To achieve this aim, I suggest we move from simply focusing on the authentic task to considering why that task matters? This then enables a shift from the student in isolation to the student as a member of society. Senses of achievement can become richer, thus enhancing the students’ sense of self, self-worth, and well-being.","[{""name"": ""Jan McArthur"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/02602938.2019.1639613"", ""10.1063/1.5016009"", ""10.1080/02602938.2013.819566"", ""10.5040/9781350157279"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0027-7"", ""10.1007/BF00138871"", ""10.1093/acref/9780198735304.001.0001"", ""10.1080/02602930600679050"", ""10.4324/9780203964309"", ""10.1177/1541344603001003003"", ""10.3102/0013189X018001032"", ""10.4324/9780203969670"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2016.08.002"", ""10.1080/07294360.2019.1581140"", ""10.1007/s11007-007-9050-9"", ""10.1515/9781400880270"", ""10.1017/9781108946216"", ""10.1007/BF02504676"", ""10.1007/s10734-006-9005-9"", ""10.1080/0729436980170304"", ""10.1177/0001699304048668"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521816602.014"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1565.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10734-020-00570-x"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1165659"", ""10.1080/13562517.2019.1613637"", ""10.1080/0260293980230404"", ""10.1080/01587919.2021.1920206"", ""10.1080/02602938.2012.751963"", ""10.1007/s10734-004-2534-1"", ""10.4324/9781315712802"", ""10.1007/s10734-010-9394-7"", ""10.1080/02602930120063466"", ""10.1080/0260293042000188267"", ""10.20853/32-6-2982"", ""10.7203/relieve.26.1.17089"", ""10.1080/02602938.2021.1958748"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0020-1"", ""10.1515/9781503626539"", ""10.1080/00131729808983805"", ""10.1080/02602930600805192"", ""10.1080/0260293980230406"", ""10.1080/02602938.2021.1887811"", ""10.1007/BF00138394"", ""10.1080/01421599880904"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2021.101030"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1582015"", ""10.3390/educsci11090534"", ""10.1080/02580136.2019.1616920"", ""10.1080/02602938.2010.527916"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.12093"", ""10.1023/A:1024761820500"", ""10.1177/2041386620930063"", ""10.1080/02602938.2017.1412396"", ""10.1080/00131857.2013.795110"", ""10.1007/BF00154467"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1516730"", ""10.1080/0260293980230408"", ""10.1080/00405849309543572"", ""10.4324/9781315134642""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

The present study aims to explore the applicability of one global framework of motivation to integrate different perspectives. We investigated how adaptive interactions between learners’ motivations for value, truth, and control effectiveness, and contextual factors led to varying motivational trajectories and patterns of emergent stability at different stages of the language‐learning experiences of 6 Iranian graduate students learning English in the United States. Using a retrospective‐longitudinal design, quasi‐narrative accounts of key phases of the learners’ language‐learning histories were documented through interviews. These data were analyzed following an analytic inductive approach to identify the main events within different contexts, themes associated with each setting, and other bottom‐up conceptual categories. Using a process‐tracing procedure our results showed that dynamic processes and adaptive or competitive interactions between value‐, control‐, and truth‐related motivations and the context in which they emerged resulted in specific motivational trajectories that shaped these learners’ language‐learning choices and experiences. We discuss the contribution of these novel frameworks for understanding the complex motivational development of language learners.","[{""name"": ""MOSTAFA PAPI"", ""affiliation"": [""Florida State University School of Teacher Education  1114 W.

Examining the causes and consequences of generative AI usage among university students,"AbstractWhile the discussion on generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, is making waves in academia and the popular press, there is a need for more insight into the use of ChatGPT among students and the potential harmful or beneficial consequences associated with its usage. Using samples from two studies, the current research examined the causes and consequences of ChatGPT usage among university students. Study 1 developed and validated an eight-item scale to measure ChatGPT usage by conducting a survey among university students (N = 165). Study 2 used a three-wave time-lagged design to collect data from university students (N = 494) to further validate the scale and test the study’s hypotheses. Study 2 also examined the effects of academic workload, academic time pressure, sensitivity to rewards, and sensitivity to quality on ChatGPT usage. Study 2 further examined the effects of ChatGPT usage on students’ levels of procrastination, memory loss, and academic performance. Study 1 provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the ChatGPT usage scale. Furthermore, study 2 revealed that when students faced higher academic workload and time pressure, they were more likely to use ChatGPT. In contrast, students who were sensitive to rewards were less likely to use ChatGPT. Not surprisingly, use of ChatGPT was likely to develop tendencies for procrastination and memory loss and dampen the students’ academic performance.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000004963,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Competencies for the Use of Artificial Intelligence-Based Tools by Health Care Professionals,"Purpose The expanded use of clinical tools that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) methods has generated calls for specific competencies for effective and ethical use. This qualitative study used expert interviews to define AI-related clinical competencies for health care professionals. Method In 2021, a multidisciplinary team interviewed 15 experts in the use of AI-based tools in health care settings about the clinical competencies health care professionals need to work effectively with such tools. Transcripts of the semistructured interviews were coded and thematically analyzed. Draft competency statements were developed and provided to the experts for feedback. The competencies were finalized using a consensus process across the research team. Results Six competency domain statements and 25 subcompetencies were formulated from the thematic analysis. The competency domain statements are: (1) basic knowledge of AI: explain what AI is and describe its health care applications; (2) social and ethical implications of AI: explain how social, economic, and political systems influence AI-based tools and how these relationships impact justice, equity, and ethics; (3) AI-enhanced clinical encounters: carry out AI-enhanced clinical encounters that integrate diverse sources of information in creating patient-centered care plans; (4) evidence-based evaluation of AI-based tools: evaluate the quality, accuracy, safety, contextual appropriateness, and biases of AI-based tools and their underlying data sets in providing care to patients and populations; (5) workflow analysis for AI-based tools: analyze and adapt to changes in teams, roles, responsibilities, and workflows resulting from implementation of AI-based tools; and (6) practice-based learning and improvement regarding AI-based tools: participate in continuing professional development and practice-based improvement activities related to use of AI tools in health care. Conclusions The 6 clinical competencies identified can be used to guide future teaching and learning programs to maximize the potential benefits of AI-based tools and diminish potential harms.","[{""name"": ""Regina G.

10.1007/s12564-021-09716-7,ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW,0401 Education,Acceptance of and satisfaction with online educational classes through the technology acceptance model (TAM): the COVID-19 situation in Korea,"AbstractThis study examines the current state of acceptance of online classes using the technology acceptance model. The background of the study is the turning point in Korean education in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and speculation about changes in the post-COVID educational environment. To measure the acceptance rate of online classes, a survey was conducted on a total of 313 university students taking online classes. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results of the study are as follows: First, the perceived ease of use of online classes showed a positive effect on perceived usefulness. Second, both the perceived ease of use and usefulness of online classes showed a positive effect on educational satisfaction. Third, both the perceived usefulness and satisfaction showed a positive effect on the acceptance intention of online education. However, the perceived ease of use did not have a positive effect on acceptance intention. These results suggest that satisfaction with online education can be further improved by developing online classes that are easy to use, focusing on the features that are frequently used by university students. In addition, universities should continuously provide training and advice to increase students’ perceived usefulness of online classes.","[{""name"": ""Jee-Hoon Han"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hye Ji Sa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3250951"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2014.09.003"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1298088"", ""10.1111/j.1743-498X.2012.00627.x"", ""10.1108/03090569710176655"", ""10.1007/BF02723327"", ""10.1002/hbe2.191"", ""10.2307/3250921"", ""10.1002/cae.22318"", ""10.31308/KSSM.23.4.2"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102186"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70304-9"", ""10.23949/kjpe.2017.07.56.4.35"", ""10.1504/IJBIS.2013.053214"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1080/01587919.2011.565496"", ""10.11648/j.ajtas.20160501.11"", ""10.17705/1jais.00008"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2006.03.009"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2013.857431"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.11.012"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.004"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.1997.tb01315.x"", ""10.21719/IJTMS.33.4.4"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2006.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.im.2006.05.003"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(03)00125-5"", ""10.1016/j.elerap.2010.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2006.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.im.2004.04.003"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.1.2.130"", ""10.29333/ejmste/8240"", ""10.1016/j.ijedro.2020.100012"", ""10.1007/s11528-011-0469-9"", ""10.1016/j.im.2005.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2015.05.006"", ""10.1108/09684880010325600"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.62.4.480"", ""10.1177/002224378001700405"", ""10.1086/209358"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2008.00294.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijedro.2020.100011"", ""10.1016/j.im.2006.10.007"", ""10.1287/isre.8.3.240"", ""10.1016/j.im.2003.08.009"", ""10.1016/S0022-4359(96)90014-7"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007"", ""10.29333/pr/7947"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5414.2006.00136.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926"", ""10.1108/09564230310500192"", ""10.1080/01587919.2020.1724768"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3555520"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00126-3""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003192,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,What Does Context Have to Do With Anything? A Study of Professional Identity Formation in Physician-Trainees Considered Underrepresented in Medicine,"Purpose Research on professional identity formation has largely ignored how race, ethnicity, and the larger sociohistorical context work to shape medical students’ professional identity. Researchers investigated how physician-trainees considered underrepresented in medicine (URM) negotiate their professional identity within the larger sociohistorical context that casts them in a negative light. Method In this qualitative study, 14 black/African American medical students were recruited from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University and Emory University College of Medicine between September 2018 and April 2019. Using constructive grounded theory and Swann’s model of identity negotiation, the authors analyzed interview data for how students negotiate their racial and professional identities within medical education. Results The results indicated that URM students were aware of the negative stereotypes ascribed to black individuals and the potential for the medical community to view them negatively. In response, students employed identity cues and strategies to bring the community’s perceptions in line with how they perceived themselves—black and a physician. Specifically, students actively worked to integrate their racial and professional identities by “giving back” to the African American community. Community-initiated mentoring from non-URM physicians helped to reify students’ hope that they could have a racialized professional identity. Conclusions Race, ethnicity, and the larger sociohistorical context is often overlooked in professional identity formation research, and this omission has resulted in an underappreciation of the challenges URM physicians’ experience as they develop a professional identity. Within the context of this study, findings demonstrated that black/African American physicians negotiated the formation of professional identity within a challenging sociohistorical context, which should be given greater consideration in related research.","[{""name"": ""Tasha R.

10.1002/rev3.3197,REVIEW OF EDUCATION,0401 Education,Systematic literature review of primary-secondary transitions: International research,"A systematic literature review of international empirical research was conducted to understand the impact of primary‒secondary transition on children’s experiences, outcomes and protective/risk factors. The review covered the period 2008‒2018 and met the gap in previous literature reviews. Using the EPPI‐Centre approach, authors included 96 studies in the review. Synthesis of the findings suggested that, in the main, perceived and real relationships with teachers and peers led to positive or negative experiences. Pupils and parents were primarily concerned with changes in relationships during the transition from primary to secondary school. Some studies reported that transition can also have a positive effect on opportunities for establishing new friendships. There was a decline in educational and wellbeing outcomes, and there was a link between the two. However, we cannot say with any confidence whether this impact on outcomes was as a result of the transition to secondary school, and whether it was sustained over time. Protective and risk factors were related to the child and significant others in their ecosystem. There were contradictory findings about the impact of organisational and educational systems. A limited number of studies examined the differential impact of transitions on children with additional support needs. This review is the first to bring together various aspects of transitions and as a result provides some unique insights and makes an original contribution. It became clear that it is difficult to predict the impact of interactions between experiences, outcomes and factors, given the gaps in existing literature. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy, practice and future research.","[{""name"": ""Divya Jindal‐Snape"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Dundee Dundee Scotland""]}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth F.

The artificial visual systems used in industrial production and domestic daily life rely significantly on cameras and image‐processing components for live monitoring and target identifying. They, however, often suffer from bulky volume, high energy consumption, and more critically, lack of adaptive responsiveness under extreme lighting conditions and thus possible mortal visual disability of flash blinding or nyctalopia for applications such as auto‐piloting. Herein, it is demonstrated that perovskite switchable photovoltaic devices are used to effectively construct all‐in‐one sensory neural network. Arising from the spontaneous and electric field‐induced ion‐migration effect, the photoresponsivity of the perovskite device can be reconfigured over the wide range of 540–1270%, which not only allows high‐fidelity adaptive image sensing of the visual information but also acts as updatable synaptic weight to enable the sensor array for performing machine‐learning tasks. With the bioinspired electronic pupil regulation function achieved through adjustable photoresponsivity of the perovskite sensor array, a proof‐of‐concept adaptive machine vision system with a maximum 263% enhancement of the object recognition accuracy for compact, mobile yet delay‐sensitive applications is demonstrated.","[{""name"": ""Qilai Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""National Key Laboratory of

10.14742/ajet.6749,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Sentiment evolution with interaction levels in blended learning environments: Using learning analytics and epistemic network analysis,"Sentiment evolution is a key component of interactions in blended learning. Although interactions have attracted considerable attention in online learning contexts, there is scant research on examining sentiment evolution over different interactions in blended learning environments. Thus, in this study, sentiment evolution at different interaction levels was investigated from the longitudinal data of five learning stages of 38 postgraduate students in a blended learning course. Specifically, text mining techniques were employed to mine the sentiments in different interactions, and then epistemic network analysis (ENA) was used to uncover sentiment changes in the five learning stages of blended learning. The findings suggested that negative sentiments were moderately associated with several other sentiments such as joking, confused, and neutral sentiments in blended learning contexts. Particularly in relation to deep interactions, student sentiments might change from negative to insightful ones. In contrast, the sentiment network built from social-emotion interactions shows stronger connections in joking-positive and joking-negative sentiments than the other two interaction levels. Most notably, the changes of co-occurrence sentiment reveal the three periods in a blended learning process, namely initial, collision and sublimation, and stable periods. The results in this study revealed that students’ sentiments evolved from positive to confused/negative to insightful.","[{""name"": ""Changqin Huang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhongmei Han"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ming Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xizhe Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wenzhu Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Physics and Astronomy', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The primary physics codes of ExaWind are Nalu-Wind and OpenFAST. Nalu-Wind is a wind-focused computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code that is coupled to the whole-turbine simulation code OpenFAST. The ExaWind environment was created under U.S. Department of Energy funding to achieve the highest-fidelity simulations of wind turbines and wind farms to date, with the goal of enabling disruptive changes to turbine and plant design and operation. Innovation will be gleaned through better understanding of the complex flow dynamics in wind farms, including wake evolution and the impact of wakes on downstream turbines and turbulent flow from complex terrain. High-fidelity predictive simulations employ hybrid turbulence models, geometry/boundary-layer-resolving CFD meshes, atmospheric turbulence, nonlinear structural dynamics, and fluid-structure interaction. While there is an emphasis on very high-fidelity simulations (e.g., blade resolved with full fluid-structure coupling), the ExaWind environment supports lower-fidelity modeling capabilities including actuator-line and -disk methods. Important in the development of ExaWind codes is that the codes scale well on today’s largest petascale supercomputers and on the next-generation platforms that will enable exascale computing.","[{""name"": ""M A Sprague"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Ananthan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Vijayakumar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Robinson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/1089014.1089021"", ""10.1142/S0129626414420055"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2018.01.007"", ""10.1175/1520-0469(1984)041<2052:ALESMF>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1002/we.2101"", ""10.5194/wes-2-443-2017"", ""10.2514/2.7555"", ""10.1115/1.1436090"", ""10.1002/we.64"", ""10.1115/1.1624088"", ""10.1002/we.529""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"
10.1111/jcal.12579,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,Evaluating the effectiveness of blended learning using the ARCS model,"AbstractWhile the educational disruption caused by the Covid‐19 pandemic underscores the importance of blended learning in higher education, research on the effectiveness of blended learning is still inconclusive. Drawing from the motivational design model of the ARCS (i.e., attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction), this study attempts to fill the gap to evaluate effectiveness of blended learning from a multi‐dimensional perspective. Participants were randomly assigned into three experimental groups (i.e., face‐to‐face, pure online, and blended). A questionnaire survey was administered in each group after the trial courses. The data was analysed by using the one‐way ANOVA with post hoc tests. The results showed that blended learning outperformed pure online learning in enhancing students' attention, confidence, and satisfaction perceptions. Additionally, blended learning had a higher level of satisfaction perception than face‐to‐face learning. Follow‐up interviews were also conducted to provide an in‐depth understanding of how blended learning motivated students during the learning process. Considering that blended learning may become a new normal in higher education after the Covid‐19 pandemic, the findings of the present study provide evidences to support the effectiveness of the blended learning approach in addressing students' motivational needs.","[{""name"": ""Long Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Business Administration Zhejiang Gongshang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Chei Sian Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information Nanyang Technological University  Singapore""]}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2013.10.035"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2012.00490.x"", ""10.1111/jcal.12351"", ""10.1002/pam.21728"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.cmpb.2005.02.007"", ""10.5539/ies.v3n3p36"", ""10.1515/libri-2015-0010"", ""10.1111/bjet.12243"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1643303"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103610"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.10.019"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.03.020"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0087-5"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2020/15138"", ""10.1007/s10763-004-6828-7"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2004.02.001"", ""10.4324/9780203803738.ch21"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.09.003"", ""10.24059/olj.v19i2.523"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.992"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2014.05.001"", ""10.1080/14703297.2016.1237371"", ""10.7763/IJIET.2016.V6.788"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2005.00582.x"", ""10.1080/08923640802224451"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v16i5.2222"", ""10.1177/001316447603600412"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.05.005"", ""10.1111/jan.12509"", ""10.1002/tl.7804"", ""10.1080/1358165042000283084"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.02.021"", ""10.1108/OIR-09-2016-0274"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.03.019"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.10.023"", ""10.1177/0735633118757732"", ""10.1108/OIR-06-2019-0203"", ""10.1177/016146811311500307"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1035358"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.10.011"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.12.003"", ""10.1108/PM-04-2013-0026"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103701"", ""10.1126/science.aav7958"", ""10.5171/2019.121518"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.03.003"", ""10.1111/jcal.12083"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.009"", ""10.1111/jcal.12423"", ""10.1007/s40692-020-00164-7"", ""10.1109/ISET.2017.57"", ""10.1007/s11162-015-9378-7"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v16i2.2032"", ""10.1108/AJIM-10-2019-0290"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1750195""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1002/rrq.298,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,Emergent Bilingual Students and Digital Multimodal Composition: A Systematic Review of Research in Secondary Classrooms,"AbstractWith increasing cultural and linguistic diversity in today’s classrooms, a growing body of research continues to explore the varied ways in which digital tools and multiple modalities can tap into emergent bilingual students’ academic and linguistic strengths. To understand the empirical landscape of this growing research, the authors systematically reviewed the literature on emergent bilinguals and digital multimodal composition in secondary classrooms. Through an inductive approach, the authors analyzed 70 studies to understand key findings and characteristics of the extant research. Five main themes of findings emerged across the research. First, a majority of studies illustrated how digital multimodal composing supports emergent bilingual students’ identity expression. With expanded opportunities to share ideas through multiple modes, students used their projects to bridge transnational identities, (re)present themselves, and communicate in empowering ways. Second, nearly half of the studies emphasized how the integration of digital multimodal projects can reshape classrooms by challenging language ideologies, transforming the classroom as a locus for social justice, and expanding temporal and spatial boundaries as students compose for multiple audiences. Third, many studies demonstrated how emergent bilinguals develop as designers and leverage the unique semiotic resources of multiple modes when composing. Fourth, approximately a third of the studies showed how multimodal composition offers emergent bilinguals opportunities to expand their existing linguistic repertoires. Finally, a quarter of the studies illustrated the potential of multiple modes to mediate learning during composing processes.

10.3390/educsci13010088,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Digital Learning and Digital Institution in Higher Education,"Higher education institutions are going through major changes in their education and operations. Several influences are driving these major changes. Digital transformation, online courses, digital-navy students, operational costs, and micro and nano degrees are just some examples of these influences. Digital technologies show a range of tools selected to include formalized learning environments in teaching in higher education, and students utilize these tools to promote their learning. The Industrial Revolution 4.0’s technological growth has penetrated higher education institutions (HEIs), forcing them to deal with the digital transformation (DT) in all of its dimensions. As they enable us to characterize the various interrelationships among stakeholders in a digitally enabled context of teaching and learning, applying digital transformation techniques to the education sector is an emerging field that has attracted attention recently. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the distinguishing features of the digital transformation implementation process that has occurred at higher education institutions. In addition, how digital learning can be seen as part of the ecosystem of modern higher education. Further study is necessary to determine how higher education institutions can comprehend digital transformation and meet the demands imposed by the fourth Industrial Revolution.","[{""name"": ""Mamdouh Alenezi"", ""affiliation"": [""Software Engineering and Disruptive Innovation (SEDI), College of Computer and Information Sciences, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia""]}]","[""10.4324/9780429286797-7"", ""10.3390/s20113291"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-76908-0_26"", ""10.1109/FIE.2018.8658844"", ""10.21125/inted.2019.0445"", ""10.1071/AH16294"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49700-6_37"", ""10.1109/ITMQIS.2018.8525021"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0130-1"", ""10.21125/inted.2018.2348"", ""10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737328"", ""10.1109/PTES.2018.8604207"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91743-6_23"", ""10.1109/ETTLIS.2018.8485258"", ""10.4324/9781003008637-4"", ""10.22215/timreview/1217"", ""10.1080/14697017.2021.1929406"", ""10.34190/ejel.19.3.2168"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-08172-9_5"", ""10.3390/educsci12110784"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9780-9"", ""10.55056/cte.231"", ""10.46502/issn.1856-7576/2022.16.03.8"", ""10.1080/09523980701491682"", ""10.2304/elea.2008.5.4.418"", ""10.1080/02607471003651870"", ""10.1080/07377363.2011.568830"", ""10.1177/1469787408100196"", ""10.13189/ujer.2020.080826"", ""10.1080/01587919.2011.610293"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0087-5"", ""10.1002/sce.20404"", ""10.21037/atm.2018.11.32"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.015"", ""10.1109/LWMOOCS47620.2019.8939651"", ""10.13189/ujer.2017.051306"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.004"", ""10.2505/4/sc15_053_01_80"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120030"", ""10.1108/S1479-358X20150000011008"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-20877-0_45"", ""10.24191/ajue.v17i3.14514"", ""10.1080/03075079.2015.1007946"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00260-3"", ""10.1108/IJPPM-09-2016-0193"", ""10.3390/educsci11120770""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003907,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Wellness-Centered Leadership: Equipping Health Care Leaders to Cultivate Physician Well-Being and Professional Fulfillment,"These are challenging times for physicians. Extensive changes in the practice environment have altered the nature of physicians’ interactions with patients and their role in the health care delivery system. Many physicians feel as if they are “cogs in the wheel” of austere corporations that care more about productivity and finances than compassion or quality. They often do not see how the strategy and plan of their organization align with the values of the profession. Despite their expertise, they frequently do not feel they have a voice or input in the operational plan of their work unit, department, or organization. At their core, the authors believe all of these factors represent leadership issues. Many models of leadership have been proposed, and there are a number of effective philosophies and approaches. Here, the authors propose a new integrative model of Wellness-Centered Leadership (WCL). WCL includes core skills and qualities from the foremost leadership philosophies along with evidence on the relationship between leadership and physician well-being and distills them into a single framework designed to cultivate leadership behaviors that promote engagement and professional fulfillment. The 3 elements of WCL are: care about people always, cultivate individual and team relationships, and inspire change. A summary of the mindset, behaviors, and outcomes of the elements of the WCL model is presented, and the application of the elements for physician leaders is discussed. The authors believe that learning and developing the skills that advance these elements should be the aspiration of all health care leaders and a foundational focus of leadership development programs. If cultivated, the authors believe that WCL will empower individual and team performance to address the current problems faced by health care organizations as well as the iterative innovation needed to address challenges that may arise in the decades to come.","[{""name"": ""Tait Shanafelt"", ""affiliation"": [""T.

For the last many years, it has been mainly used as a part of face to face teaching. Assessment is an essential part of teaching and learning, as it establishes the achievement of course learning outcomes by the students. Computer-based assessment is in place for a long time now, however, online assessments have been less practiced. This is because of the issues of validity, reliability and dishonesty. During the COVID 19 pandemic, the educational environment has taken a paradigm shift in many medical schools, both nationally and internationally. This situation demands a method of assessment that is safe, valid, reliable, acceptable, feasible and fair. This paper describes the different formats of online assessment and their application in formative and summative assessments during and after the COVID 19 pandemic.&#x0D; doi: https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2795&#x0D; How to cite this:Khan RA, Jawaid M.

10.1186/s12909-020-1964-5,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Revisiting the trajectory of medical students' empathy, and impact of gender, specialty preferences and nationality: a systematic review","Abstract Background Empathy allows a physician to understand the patient’s situation and feelings and respond appropriately. Consequently, empathy gives rise to better diagnostics and clinical outcomes. This systematic review investigates the level of empathy among medical students across the number of educational years and how this level relates to gender, specialty preferences, and nationality. Method In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the authors conducted a systematic search of studies published between February 2010 and March 2019 investigating the level of empathy among medical students. The databases PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched. Studies employing quantitative methodologies and published in English or Scandinavian language and examining medical students exclusively were included. Results Thirty studies were included of which 24 had a cross-sectional and 6 a longitudinal study design. In 14 studies, significantly lower levels of empathy were reported by increase in the number of educational years. The remaining 16 studies identified both higher, mixed and unchanged levels. In 18 out of 27 studies it was reported that females had higher empathy scores than males. Only three out of nine studies found an association between empathy scores and specialty preferences. Nine out of 30 studies reported a propensity towards lower mean empathy scores in non-Western compared to Western countries. Conclusion The results revealed equivocal findings concerning how the empathy level among medical students develops among medical students across numbers of educational years and how empathy levels are associated with gender, specialty preferences, and nationality. Future research might benefit from focusing on how students’ empathy is displayed in clinical settings, e.g. in clinical encounters with patients, peers and other health professionals.","[{""name"": ""Freja Allerelli Andersen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ann-Sofie Bering Johansen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jens Søndergaard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christina Maar Andersen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elisabeth Assing Hvidt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3889/oamjms.2018.361"", ""10.1093/fampra/cmu080"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2016.12.003"", ""10.1016/0277-9536(90)90188-X"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2013.12.007"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182086fe1"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2133.2001.04445.x"", ""10.1177/0163278704267037"", ""10.1136/bmj.322.7290.865"", ""10.1001/jama.293.9.1100"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2005.04.007"", ""10.1097/00005650-199504000-00007"", ""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123134"", ""10.1007/s11606-005-0102-8"", ""10.1007/s10459-016-9704-7"", ""10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x"", ""10.3109/01421590903199668"", ""10.5350/DAJPN2014270404"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2013.802296"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318221e615"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d281dc"", ""10.1111/tct.12608"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100"", ""10.1111/jebm.12141"", ""10.1093/aje/kwi042"", ""10.1007/s10459-012-9390-z"", ""10.1177/2150131917716233"", ""10.5116/ijme.5412.e641"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.644600"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2017.14.33"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-12-34"", ""10.1007/s11606-009-1193-4"", ""10.1016/j.mjafi.2014.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.encep.2018.05.003"", ""10.5116/ijme.572f.115f"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1120-7"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.714881"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.956058"", ""10.1080/14739879.2011.11494022"", ""10.19082/7101"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.715783"", ""10.1159/000348300"", ""10.1111/medu.13398"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2004.01911.x"", ""10.1080/01421590500069744"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2006.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.02.001"", ""10.1080/00223891.2010.528484"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181ed4c47"", ""10.1007/s11606-006-0039-6"", ""10.1111/medu.13344"", ""10.1186/s12909-015-0425-z"", ""10.5116/ijme.55e6.0d44"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2010.531158"", ""10.1186/1747-5341-3-10"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181b17e55"", ""10.1001/archinte.168.17.1853"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181b180d4"", ""10.1111/medu.12806""]",['Medicine'],"['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

The first model is an extension of the Park model, which explicitly incorporates turbulence, both the ambient atmospheric turbulence and the turbulence generated in the wake itself. This Turbulence Optimized Park model is better equipped to describe wake recovery over long distances such as between wind farms, where the wake expansion slows down as the turbine-generated turbulence decays. The second model is a first version of a full engineering wind farm blockage model. In the same vein as the wake model it adds blockage contributions from the individual wind turbines to form an aggregated wind farm scale blockage effect that can be incorporated directly into the park power curve and annual energy calculations. The wake model and the blockage model describe downstream and upstream turbine interaction effects, respectively. They are coupled as the outputs of one model are the inputs to the other model and vice versa. We describe how this coupling is achieved through an iterative process. We give early stage examples of the validation of the two models and discuss how they might be further validated and improved in the future.","[{""name"": ""Nicolai Gayle Nygaard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Søren Trads Steen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lina Poulsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesper Grønnegaard Pedersen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/en8065413"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-20389-y"", ""10.5194/wes-5-29-2020"", ""10.3390/rs12030462"", ""10.1002/we.2484"", ""10.3390/en11061609"", ""10.1002/we.2413"", ""10.3390/en10122164"", ""10.1002/we.408"", ""10.1007/s10546-019-00473-0"", ""10.1002/we.1863"", ""10.1002/we.512"", ""10.5194/wes-4-287-2019"", ""10.1016/0167-6105(88)90037-2"", ""10.1002/we.2257""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

With the potential to store numerous values in I–V pinched hysteresis, memristors (memory resistors) have emerged as alternatives to existing CMOS‐based computing systems. Herein, four types of memristive devices, namely, resistive switching, phase‐change, spintronics, and ferroelectric tunnel junction memristors, are explored. The application of these devices to a crossbar array (CBA), which is a novel concept of integrated architecture, is a step toward the realization of ultradense electronics. Exploiting the fascinating capabilities of memristive devices, computing systems can be developed with novel computing paradigms, in which large amounts of data can be stored and processed within CBAs. Looking further ahead, the ways in which memristors could be incorporated in neuromorphic computing systems along with various artificial intelligence algorithms are established. Finally, perspectives and challenges that memristor technology should address to provide excellent alternatives to existing computing systems are discussed. The infinite potential of memristors is the key to unlock new computing paradigms, which pave the way for next‐generation computing systems.","[{""name"": ""In Hyuk Im"", ""affiliation"":

We highlight many general pitfalls of ML model interpretation, such as using interpretation techniques in the wrong context, interpreting models that do not generalize well, ignoring feature dependencies, interactions, uncertainty estimates and issues in high-dimensional settings, or making unjustified causal interpretations, and illustrate them with examples. We focus on pitfalls for global methods that describe the average model behavior, but many pitfalls also apply to local methods that explain individual predictions. Our paper addresses ML practitioners by raising awareness of pitfalls and identifying solutions for correct model interpretation, but also addresses ML researchers by discussing open issues for further research.","[{""name"": ""Christoph Molnar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gunnar König"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julia Herbinger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Timo Freiesleben"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susanne Dandl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian A.

Whereas teacher subjectivity has been pushed to the margins of recent conversations about teacher education—and has therefore narrowed our understanding of the ideological and practical affordances and constraints of practice-based teacher education—we show that it must be centered in teacher education and understood as fundamental to all teachers’ embodied practice. We draw from literature exploring critical Whiteness studies, raciolinguistics, poststructural understandings of teacher subjectivity, the experiences of teachers of Color and practice-based teacher education. By showing how a raciolinguicized teacher subjectivity has been marginalized, we simultaneously argue for the centrality of the role of subjectivity in shaping teaching and, therefore, in defining critical dimensions of what and how novice teachers need to learn.","[{""name"": ""Julia R.

Course satisfaction levels were much lower after courses moved online, and students recounted an array of barriers to their continued learning. More than 1 in 6 students experienced frequent internet connectivity issues and/or hardware and software problems severe enough to interfere with their ability to continue learning in their courses. Students from all backgrounds struggled to stay motivated and missed getting immediate instructor feedback and collaborating with their fellow students. Students of color and students from lower-income households experienced more challenges than did non-Hispanic White students and students from higher-income households. However, even with the challenges of an unplanned shift to remote learning, a majority of students were at least somewhat satisfied with their learning in the course after COVID, and satisfaction was higher for those courses using more of the practices recommended for effective online instruction.","[{""name"": ""Barbara Means"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julie Neisler"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

For the quantitative phase, 1006 and 605 EFL university students were chosen respectively from Chinese and Iranian universities, and for the qualitative phase, sub-groups of 43 Chinese and 34 Iranian participants were selected. Three close-ended scales and semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Results of confirmatory factor analysis approved the factor structure and validity of the three scales. Results of correlation and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analyses indicated the positive associative/predictive role of perceived teacher caring and confirmation in Chinese and Iranian students’ WTAC. The independent samples t-tests results showed significant differences in perceptions of caring, confirmation, and WTAC, with Chinese participants significantly outperforming Iranians. Frequency counts of qualitative data revealed that both Chinese and Iranian students believed in the facilitative role of confirmation and caring in WTAC. Further content analysis of the data through MAXQDA presented four themes of teacher-, student-, context, and task-related factors, among which the teacher-related factors theme and its teacher interpersonal factors sub-theme were deemed very influential by Chinese and Iranian students in predicting WTAC.","[{""name"": ""Yongliang Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Derakhshan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Different ways are suggested in literature to use for checking normality. Skewness and kurtosis values are one of them. However, there is no consensus which values indicated a normal distribution. Therefore, the effects of different criteria in terms of skewness values were simulated in this study. Specifically, the results of t-test and U-test are compared under different skewness values. The results showed that t-test and U-test give different results when the data showed skewness. Based on the results, using skewness values alone to decide about normality of a dataset may not be enough. Therefore, the use of non-parametric tests might be inevitable.","[{""name"": ""Fatih ORCAN"", ""affiliation"": [""Trabzon Üniversitesi""]}]","[""10.1201/9780429258589"", ""10.6018/analesps.30.1.135911"", ""10.1027/1614-2241/a000057"", ""10.3758/s13428-016-0814-1"", ""10.17679/iuefd.16250801"", ""10.1007/BF02293811"", ""10.5812/ijem.3505"", ""10.3102/00346543042003237"", ""10.13189/ujm.2017.050601"", ""10.5395/rde.2013.38.1.52"", ""10.1207/s15328007sem1201_1"", ""10.1590/1677-5449.041117"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01899"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-12-81"", ""10.1002/pon.4501"", ""10.1016/j.jcomdis.2015.08.002"", ""10.1080/03610920600853308"", ""10.13189/ujer.2018.060920""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Generally, the actuated magnetic robot can be classified into two categories: tethered devices like intravascular microcatheters and untethered devices like helical swimmers. Among these, the tethered devices have a long history and good clinical application prospects, considering their high‐dose delivery and easy removal after the procedure. As an evolution of traditional continuum medical devices, the integration with magnetic actuation provides them with better scalability and improved dexterity. Although rapidly developed in the last two decades, the field of tethered magnetic robots requires further advancements in terms of design, fabrication, modeling, and control, especially for clinical applications. Herein, the recent progress of magnetically actuated continuum medical robots is focused on, intending to offer readers a comprehensive survey of the state‐of‐the‐art technologies and an information collection for future system design.","[{""name"": ""Zhengxin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering The Chinese University of Hong Kong  Hong Kong 999077 Hong

10.1186/s12909-020-1925-z,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Low priority of obesity education leads to lack of medical students' preparedness to effectively treat patients with obesity: results from the US medical school obesity education curriculum benchmark study,"Abstract Background Physicians are currently unprepared to treat patients with obesity, which is of great concern given the obesity epidemic in the United States. This study sought to evaluate the current status of obesity education among U.S. medical schools, benchmarking the degree to which medical school curricula address competencies proposed by the Obesity Medicine Education Collaborative (OMEC). Methods Invitations to complete an online survey were sent via postal mail to 141 U.S. medical schools compiled from Association of American Medical Colleges. Medical school deans and curriculum staff knowledgeable about their medical school curriculum completed online surveys in the summer of 2018. Descriptive analyses were performed. Results Forty of 141 medical schools responded (28.4%) and completed the survey. Only 10.0% of respondents believe their students were “very prepared” to manage patients with obesity and one-third reported that their medical school had no obesity education program in place and no plans to develop one. Half of the medical schools surveyed reported that expanding obesity education was a low priority or not a priority. An average of 10 h was reported as dedicated to obesity education, but less than 40% of schools reported that any obesity-related topic was well covered (i.e., to a “great extent”). Medical students received an adequate education (defined as covered to at least “some extent”) on the topics of biology, physiology, epidemiology of obesity, obesity-related comorbidities, and evidence-based behavior change models to assess patient readiness for counseling (range: 79.5 to 94.9%). However, in approximately 30% of the schools surveyed, there was little or no education in nutrition and behavioral obesity interventions, on appropriate communication with patients with obesity, or pharmacotherapy. Lack of room in the curriculum was reported as the greatest barrier to incorporating obesity education. Conclusions Currently, U.S. medical schools are not adequately preparing their students to manage patients with obesity. Despite the obesity epidemic and high cost burden, medical schools are not prioritizing obesity in their curricula.","[{""name"": ""W. Scott Butsch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert F.

10.1186/s12909-020-02302-2,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Factors affecting the acceptance of blended learning in medical education: application of UTAUT2 model,"Abstract Background Blended learning is a new approach to improving the quality of medical education. Acceptance of blended learning plays an important role in its effective implementation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate and determine the factors that might affect students’ intention to use blended learning. Methods In this cross-sectional, correlational study, the sample consisted of 225 Iranian medical sciences students. The theoretical framework for designing the conceptual model was the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Venkatesh et al. (2012) proposed UTAUT2 as a framework to explain a person’s behavior while using technology. Data were analyzed using SPSS-18 and AMOS-23 software. Structural equation modeling technique was used to test the hypotheses. Results The validity and reliability of the model constructs were acceptable. Performance Expectance (PE), Effort Expectance (EE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Conditions (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Price Value (PV) and Habit (HT) had a significant effect on the students’ behavioral intention to use blended learning. Additionally, behavioral intention to use blended learning had a significant effect on the students’ actual use of blended learning (β = 0.645, P ≤ 0.01). Conclusion The study revealed that the proposed framework based on the UTAUT2 had good potential to identify the factors influencing the students’ behavioral intention to use blended learning. Universities can use the results of this study to design and implement successful blended learning courses in medical education.","[{""name"": ""Seyyed Mohsen Azizi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nasrin Roozbahani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alireza Khatony"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/s12909-017-1057-2"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1315-y"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-13-169"", ""10.7556/jaoa.2017.041"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2018.01.021"", ""10.4304/jltr.4.1.176-185"", ""10.14742/ajet.3100"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0223767"", ""10.1344/der.2019.36.190-206"", ""10.2196/jmir.4807"", ""10.1152/advan.00076.2019"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.642831"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0716-z"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-14-47"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9748-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14657-2_26"", ""10.7903/ijcse.1086"", ""10.1177/0047239515618464"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01652"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.1108/JIEB-09-2016-0032"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.02.002"", ""10.4103/jehp.jehp_32_18"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.07.037"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-55032-4_14"", ""10.14742/ajet.4432"", ""10.3991/ijet.v12i10.7258"", ""10.1155/2015/603747"", ""10.2307/25148817"", ""10.1186/s41239-016-0034-x"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2017.10.002"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1831-4"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.015"", ""10.1177/0266666915597546"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/953/1/012086"", ""10.4066/AMJ.2011.73"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9508-8"", ""10.19082/3862"", ""10.1111/ijn.12131"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02536"", ""10.2196/13127"", ""10.14742/ajet.585""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Education', 'Communication']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003800,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Entrustment Decision Making: Extending Miller's Pyramid,"The iconic Miller’s pyramid, proposed in 1989, characterizes 4 levels of assessment in medical education (“knows,” “knows how,” “shows how,” “does”). The frame work has created a worldwide awareness of the need to have different assessment approaches for different expected outcomes of education and training. At the time, Miller stressed the innovative use of simulation techniques, geared at the third level (“shows how”); however, the “does” level, assessment in the workplace, remained a largely uncharted area. In the 30 years since Miller’s conference address and seminal paper, much attention has been devoted to procedures and instrument development for workplace-based assessment. With the rise of competency-based medical education (CBME), the need for approaches to determine the competence of learners in the clinical workplace has intensified. The proposal to use entrustable professional activities as a framework of assessment and the related entrustment decision making for clinical responsibilities at designated levels of supervision of learners (e.g., direct, indirect, and no supervision) has become a recent critical innovation of CBME at the “does” level. Analysis of the entrustment concept reveals that trust in a learner to work without assistance or supervision encompasses more than the observation of “doing” in practice (the “does” level). It implies the readiness of educators to accept the inherent risks involved in health care tasks and the judgment that the learner has enough experience to act appropriately when facing unexpected challenges. Earning this qualification requires qualities beyond observed proficiency, which led the authors to propose adding the level “trusted” to the apex of Miller’s pyramid.","[{""name"": ""Olle ten Cate"", ""affiliation"": [""O. ten Cateis professor of medical education and senior scientist, Center for Research and Development of Education, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Carol Carraccio"", ""affiliation"": [""C.

10.1111/bjet.13020,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Effects of learning physics using Augmented Reality on students' self-efficacy and conceptions of learning,"AbstractThe Augmented Reality (AR)‐based learning environment not only provides educators with novel ways to present learning materials but also give learners the opportunity to spontaneously interact with the material. Previous studies have shown that AR has many advantages in education; however, few focuses on the mechanisms behind promoting inquiry motivation, such as the effect of AR on learners’ self‐efficacy and conceptions of learning. This study developed an AR‐based wave‐particle duality learning application, “AROSE,” to explore the effect of AR technology on students’ self‐efficacy and conceptions of learning physics. A quasi‐experimental study method was used, and 98 high school students aged between 16 and 18 were randomly assigned to experimental and control group. After a 4‐week intervention, it was found that integrating AR technology into physics classrooms can (1) significantly enhance students’ physics learning self‐efficacy, as indicated by understanding of concepts, higher‐level cognitive skills, practice and communication; (2) guide students to be more inclined to higher‐level conceptions of learning physics rather than lower ones; and (3) stimulates students’ motivation to learn more deeply.","[{""name"": ""Su Cai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Changhao Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tao Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Enrui Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jyh‐Chong Liang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.054"", ""10.1016/0146-6402(78)90002-4"", ""10.1080/10494820.2016.1181094"", ""10.1111/bjet.12718"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.018"", ""10.1080/09500693.2011.558131"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2010.10.003"", ""10.1007/s10956-008-9119-1"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.01.027"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2005.08.009"", ""10.1007/s11858‐014‐0590‐2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103635"", ""10.1080/095006900290000"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.04.001"", ""10.1007/s10055‐019‐00379‐9"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.09.004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.02.018"", ""10.1111/bjet.12904"", ""10.1080/13504622.2014.911247"", ""10.1080/13504622.2014.911247"", ""10.1119/1.19122"", ""10.1145/3290605.3300774"", ""10.1109/TLT.2013.37"", ""10.1080/0950069042000230776"", ""10.1007/s10956-014-9494-8"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2017.01.008"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.101.2.248"", ""10.1007/s11412-012-9156-x"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.158""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Information Systems', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

(2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis?Design and settingSystematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework.Main outcome measuresMeasures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods.Results38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test. For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management.ConclusionsEvidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.","[{""name"": ""David Jarrom"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lauren Elston"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jennifer Washington"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Prettyjohns"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kimberley Cann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susan Myles"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Groves"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.15557/PiMR.2020.0006"", ""10.1059/0003-4819-155-8-201110180-00009"", ""10.1186/s12874-019-0724-x"", ""10.1128/jcm.00461-20"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa344"", ""10.1097/CM9.0000000000000820"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa310"", ""10.1080/22221751.2020.1762515"", ""10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.052"", ""10.1002/jmv.25800"", ""10.1016/j.puhe.2020.04.009"", ""10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.065"", ""10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.022"", ""10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.019"", ""10.1515/cclm-2020-0473"", ""10.1038/s41591-020-0897-1"", ""10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.051"", ""10.1002/jmv.25904"", ""10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.050"", ""10.1002/jmv.25919"", ""10.1080/22221751.2020.1756699"", ""10.1093/infdis/jiaa229"", ""10.1148/radiol.2020201343"", ""10.1080/22221751.2020.1756698"", ""10.1128/JCM.00798-20"", ""10.3390/ijms21082826"", ""10.1128/JCM.00783-20"", ""10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045"", ""10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.005"", ""10.1128/JCM.00310-20"", ""10.1002/jmv.25825"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa416"", ""10.1164/rccm.202003-0572LE"", ""10.1515/cclm-2020-0187"", ""10.1016/j.cca.2020.03.009"", ""10.1128/JCM.00721-20"", ""10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.023"", ""10.1128/JCM.00776-20"", ""10.1016/S2468-1253(20)30083-2"", ""10.1002/jmv.25725"", ""10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.012"", ""10.1002/jmv.25742"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1443"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30970-3"", ""10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.14.2000433"", ""10.1172/jci.insight.137662"", ""10.1038/s41564-020-0713-1"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.4958"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2009316 [published Online First: 2020/04/14]"", ""10.1148/radiol.2020200432"", ""10.1016/j.rmed.2020.105980"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa459"", ""10.1111/all.14316""]",['Medicine'],['Infectious Diseases'],"[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)]]"

After briefly sketching the theoretical contexts for work on this topic, in this paper we present six design principles for instruction that enhances language for mathematics learning. We then review the research that provides an empirical foundation for these principles, (a) concerning the design of learning environments to enhance language for mathematics learning and (b) on teaching practices (including teacher moves and classroom norms) involved in the enactment of those designed learning environments. Without claiming completeness, this review of the state of development and research shows that some aspects of design and instruction that enhance language for mathematics learning have been well researched, whereas research gaps for other aspects persist.","[{""name"": ""Kirstin Erath"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jenni Ingram"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Judit Moschkovich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susanne Prediger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10288457.2015.1089677"", ""10.1007/BF00230986"", ""10.1007/s10649-019-09908-4"", ""10.1016/j.jmathb.2018.02.007"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2011.08.003"", ""10.1163/9789087901639"", ""10.3102/01623737025002119"", ""10.1080/09669760.2014.900476"", ""10.1007/s10649-016-9681-z"", ""10.3102/0034654318798093"", ""10.1007/s13138-019-00153-z"", ""10.1007/s10649-006-0400-z"", ""10.1007/s10857-015-9313-z"", ""10.1163/9789463512121_003"", ""10.4324/9780429260889-12"", ""10.1007/s10649-018-9830-7"", ""10.1037/e643702011-001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-02240-6_30"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00803a"", ""10.1007/s10857-012-9224-1"", ""10.5951/mathteaceduc.1.2.0181"", ""10.1002/berj.3444"", ""10.1080/10508406.2019.1573730"", ""10.1163/9789463512121"", ""10.1080/14794802.2019.1615980"", ""10.1007/s10649-015-9625-z"", ""10.1007/s10649-018-9873-9"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2015.1009365"", ""10.1080/14794802.2015.1098562"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0717-0"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0720-5"", ""10.1002/tesq.183"", ""10.1007/s10857-018-9418-2"", ""10.3102/0013189X13480524"", ""10.1007/s10763-019-09966-3"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0732-1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511620652.009"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1502_2"", ""10.2167/le678.0"", ""10.3102/978-0-935302-43-1_27"", ""10.1207/S15327833MTL04023_5"", ""10.21423/jume-v6i1a204"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0730-3"", ""10.1016/j.jmathb.2015.01.005"", ""10.1525/aeq.1993.24.4.04x0063k"", ""10.1007/978-94-6300-782-5_3"", ""10.4324/9781315113562-15"", ""10.1007/s11858-018-0997-2"", ""10.1007/s11858-014-0610-2"", ""10.1080/10986065.2021.1919817"", ""10.1007/s13138-015-0075-z"", ""10.1007/s13138-019-00155-x"", ""10.1007/s13394-013-0079-2"", ""10.1080/10573560601158461"", ""10.1007/s10763-017-9857-8"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc.47.5.0505"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2011.12.013"", ""10.1007/s11858-018-01016-6"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00806a"", ""10.2307/749205"", ""10.1007/s13394-016-0174-2"", ""10.1016/j.lcsi.2012.12.006"", ""10.1002/berj.3007"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609664.008"", ""10.1080/10986060802229675"", ""10.1007/s10763-019-09969-0"", ""10.1007/s10857-015-9304-0"", ""10.1080/10986065.2017.1259786"", ""10.1080/13670050608668639"", ""10.1007/s11858-018-0980-y"", ""10.1007/s10649-019-09901-x"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc.27.4.0458"", ""10.5951/mathteacmiddscho.18.3.0156"", ""10.1016/j.jmathb.2012.06.002"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0701-8""]","['Mathematics', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003719,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Climate Change and the Practice of Medicine: Essentials for Resident Education,"Despite calls for including content on climate change and its effect on health in curricula across the spectrum of medical education, no widely used resource exists to guide residency training programs in this effort. This lack of resources poses challenges for training program leaders seeking to incorporate evidence-based climate and health content into their curricula. Climate change increases risks of heat-related illness, infections, asthma, mental health disorders, poor perinatal outcomes, adverse experiences from trauma and displacement, and other harms. More numerous and increasingly dangerous natural disasters caused by climate change impair delivery of care by disrupting supply chains and compromising power supplies. Graduating trainees face a knowledge gap in understanding, managing, and mitigating these many-faceted consequences of climate change, which—expected to intensify in coming decades—will influence both the health of their patients and the health care they deliver. In this article, the authors propose a framework of climate change and health educational content for residents, including how climate change (1) harms health, (2) necessitates adaptation in clinical practice, and (3) undermines health care delivery. The authors propose not only learning objectives linked to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies for resident education but also learning formats and assessment strategies in each content area. They also present opportunities for implementation of climate and health education in residency training programs. Including this content in residency education will better prepare doctors to deliver anticipatory guidance to at-risk patients, manage those experiencing climate-related health effects, and reduce care disruptions during climate-driven extreme weather events.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Pass Philipsborn"", ""affiliation"": [""R.P.

This practice has been criticized as a misuse of multiple regression analysis. As a remedy, I highlight the use of dominance analysis and random forests, a machine learning technique, in this method showcase article for accurately determining predictor importance in multiple regression analysis. To demonstrate the utility of dominance analysis and random forests, I reproduced the results of an empirical study and applied these analytical procedures. The results reconfirmed that multiple regression analysis should always be accompanied by dominance analysis and random forests to identify the unique contribution of individual predictors while considering correlations among predictors. I also introduce a web application for facilitating the use of dominance analysis and random forests among second language researchers.","[{""name"": ""Atsushi Mizumoto"", ""affiliation"": [""Kansai University""]}]","[""10.1037/apl0000361"", ""10.1023/A:1010933404324"", ""10.1037/0033‐2909.114.3.542"", ""10.1186/s40537‐020‐00327‐4"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2020.100729"", ""10.1177/1470785319859794"", ""10.1017/S0261444819000430"", ""10.1080/09588221.2019.1572017"", ""10.18637/jss.v017.i01"", ""10.1002/wics.1346"", ""10.1016/j.system.2015.05.008"", ""10.1080/00401706.2000.10485983"", ""10.1037/13621-008"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-7138-7"", ""10.21832/9781847696991"", ""10.4324/9781315870908-7"", ""10.1207/S15327906MBR3501_1"", ""10.5688/ajpe6501"", ""10.1080/09296174.2017.1421498"", ""10.18637/jss.v036.i11"", ""10.1080/15434303.2020.1844205"", ""10.4324/9781315870908-4"", ""10.21105/joss.01903"", ""10.1111/lang.12115"", ""10.1177/1094428104266017"", ""10.3233/MAS‐2010‐0172"", ""10.3102/1076998612458319"", ""10.1177/0049124101030002004"", ""10.1111/lang.12378"", ""10.1075/lllt.51.10mar"", ""10.1093/applin/amv025"", ""10.7275/5FEX‐B874"", ""10.1017/S0267190520000057"", ""10.1177/1094428113493929"", ""10.1111/lang.12104"", ""10.1177/1745691612462588"", ""10.1126/science.aac4716"", ""10.1093/applin/amu001"", ""10.1111/modl.12509"", ""10.1017/S0272263116000231"", ""10.1080/00273171.2014.905766"", ""10.1007/s10869‐010‐9204‐3"", ""10.1007/s10869‐014‐9351‐z""]",['Mathematics'],['Statistics and Probability'],"[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"
10.1039/d0rp00053a,CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,0401 Education,Belonging in general chemistry predicts first-year undergraduates' performance and attrition,"Feeling a sense of belonging in a learning environment can have positive effects on student success. The impact of this psychosocial variable on undergraduates’ achievement and retention has been demonstrated in STEM disciplines, especially for women within physical sciences where large disparities in gender representation persist. The current study explores the relationship between belonging and student success in undergraduate chemistry, where greater gender parity has recently emerged. In particular, this research investigates the belonging of first-year students enrolled in a two-semester General Chemistry course sequence. The study begins by examining whether students’ early sense of belonging in the course, indexed by two survey measures (perceived belonging, belonging uncertainty) varies depending on their demographics and academic preparation. The belonging measures are then used as predictors of performance in General Chemistry 1 and 2 and attrition from one semester to the next. Paralleling research in other STEM disciplines, the results show that female students, especially those from underrepresented minority groups, reported lower belonging and higher uncertainty than male students within the first weeks of the course. After accounting for demographics, preparation, and participation in a course supplemental program, the belonging measures predicted performance and attrition for all students. These findings suggest that course-level belonging in General Chemistry can have practical consequences for student success, and early disparities in belonging may have downstream effects on the retention of women and other groups underrepresented in STEM. Strategies for creating an inclusive and engaging environment that supports the success of all students are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Angela Fink"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Integrative Research on Cognition"", ""Learning, and Education"", ""Washington University in St. Louis"", ""St. Louis"", ""USA""]}, {""name"": ""Regina F.

While initial implementations focused on skills and knowledge for college and career readiness, more recent framings include situated computational thinking (identity, participation, creative expression) and critical computational thinking (political and ethical impacts of computing, justice). This expansion reflects a revaluation of what it means for learners to be computationally-literate in the 21st century. We review the current landscape of K–12 computing education, discuss interactions between different framings of computational thinking, and consider how an encompassing framework of computational literacies clarifies the importance of computing for broader K–12 educational priorities as well as key unresolved issues.","[{""name"": ""Yasmin B.

In addition, improved training and patient outcomes have been demonstrated for diverse care teams. However, prioritizing graduate medical education (GME) diversity and inclusion efforts can be challenging and unidimensional diversity initiatives typically result in failure. Little literature exists regarding actionable steps to promote diversity in GME. Building on existing literature and the authors’ experiences at different institutions, the authors propose a 5-point inclusive recruitment framework for diversifying GME training programs. This article details each of the 5 steps of the framework, which begins with strong institutional support by setting diversity as a priority. Forming a cycle, the other 4 steps are seeking out candidates, implementing inclusive recruitment practices, investing in trainee success, and building the pipeline. Practical strategies for each step and recommendations for measurable outcomes for continued support for this work are provided. The proposed framework may better equip colleagues and leaders in academic medicine to prioritize and effectively promote diversity and inclusion in GME at their respective institutions.","[{""name"": ""Alda Maria R.

As part of the appraisal, researchers use explicit methods to assess risk of bias in the results’ from included studies that contribute to the review’s findings, to improve our confidence in the review’s conclusions. Randomised controlled trials included in Cochrane Reviews have used a specific risk of bias tool to assess these included studies since 2008. In 2019, a new version of this tool, Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2), was launched to improve its usability and to reflect current understanding of how the causes of bias can influence study results. Cochrane implemented RoB 2 in a phased approach, with users of the tool informing guidance development. This paper highlights learning for all systematic reviewers (Cochrane and non-Cochrane) from the phased implementation, highlighting differences between the original version of the tool and RoB 2, consideration of reporting systematic review protocols or full review reports that have used RoB 2, and some tips shared by authors during the pilot phase of the implementation.","[{""name"": ""Ella Flemyng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Theresa Helen Moore"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isabelle Boutron"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julian PT Higgins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Asbjørn Hróbjartsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Camilla Hansen Nejstgaard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerry Dwan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1001/jama.282.11.1054"", ""10.1136/bmj.d5928"", ""10.1186/2046-4053-3-37"", ""10.1186/s13643-016-0259-8"", ""10.1136/bmj.l4898"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2022.09.003"", ""10.1136/bmj.n160"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.09.021"", ""10.1136/bmjebm-2019-111230"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1411""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It is variably highly expressed in many hematological malignancies, providing protection from cell death induced by oncogenic and external stresses. Venetoclax is the first selective BCL2 inhibitor, and the first of a new class of anticancer drug (BH3-mimetics) to be approved for routine clinical practice, currently in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To help understand the potential and limitations of this therapy, this brief review will touch on the history of development of venetoclax, dissect its mechanism of action, and summarize critical evidence for its approved use in the management of patients with CLL and AML. It will also consider recent data on mechanisms of resistance and explore concepts pertinent to its future development based on key lessons learned to date.","[{""name"": ""Andrew W.

10.1111/modl.12791,MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL,0401 Education,"The Research-Practice Dialogue in Second Language Learning and Teaching: Past, Present, and Future","AbstractThis article explores ways in which a dialogue between researchers and practitioners can be bidirectional, effective, and beneficial for the two professional communities. We suggest concrete directions for second language (L2) research: (a) a collaborative mindset, (b) the nature of research, (c) venues for dialogue, and (d) institutional support. First, we argue that we, researchers and teachers alike, can develop a collaborative mindset and understand that the dialogue is established by equal contributions and benefits. Second, we discuss that if a researcher's intention is to impact practice, they need to consider the practice relevance of their studies. We propose practice‐based research, in which practitioners and researchers work together for development and implementation of research. Third, we explore venues where reciprocal contributions may be explored, including teacher‐training programs, professional development workshops, and university–school collaborations. Finally, we share our hopes that institutions (universities and schools) will provide support for researchers and practitioners that would help create and facilitate reciprocal relationships, such as time release and promotive incentives. Overall, we argue that researchers shoulder the lion's share of responsibility in paving a path for a productive research–practice dialogue in the future.","[{""name"": ""Masatoshi Sato"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad Andres Bello Department of English  Fernández Concha 700, Las Condes Santiago 7550000 Chile""]}, {""name"": ""Shawn Loewen"", ""affiliation"": [""Michigan State University  B255 Wells Hall, 619 Red Cedar Road East Lansing MI 48824""]}]","[""10.1111/modl.12793"", ""10.18806/tesl.v35i2.1288"", ""10.3102/0013189x12465334"", ""10.1080/09650792.2020.1842779"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2003.06.001"", ""10.1111/j.1741‐5446.2006.00241.x"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6809-3_52"", ""10.1080/09658416.1994.9959844"", ""10.1093/elt/52.4.273"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2006.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.system.2011.07.009"", ""10.1002/tesq.56"", ""10.1080/13803610701626127"", ""10.1177/2F1362168814563200"", ""10.3102/0013189x018001032"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02899-2_52"", ""10.1111/modl.12321"", ""10.1080/02607476.2015.1105536"", ""10.1093/reseval/rvt028"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2012.08.001"", ""10.2307/3587196"", ""10.3102/0013189x16631750"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120284"", ""10.1007/s10833‐009‐9107‐0"", ""10.1080/03054985.2017.1389713"", ""10.1111/modl.12796"", ""10.1075/lllt.52"", ""10.3102/0013189x032001005"", ""10.1111/1468‐0009.12184"", ""10.1332/174426415x14399903490979"", ""10.14221/ajte.2016v41n7.1"", ""10.1017/S0272263197001058"", ""10.1017/S0261444809990139"", ""10.1080/17501220802158958"", ""10.1186/1748‐5908‐3‐49"", ""10.3102/0091732x020001003"", ""10.1080/02607476.2018.1516351"", ""10.1080/13664530.2014.900517"", ""10.1017/S0261444819000430"", ""10.1080/00131881.2019.1677168"", ""10.1044/2018_PERS‐ST‐2018‐0005"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2020.103033"", ""10.3102/0013189x13520289"", ""10.12691/education‐7‐1‐7"", ""10.1002/j.1545‐7249.2007.tb00064.x"", ""10.1057/9781137446671"", ""10.1016/j.polsoc.2010.03.001"", ""10.1080/02671522.2018.1452965"", ""10.1016/S0742‐051X(97)00035‐8"", ""10.3102/00346543062002129"", ""10.1080/17501229.2013.800077"", ""10.1080/13803610701640235"", ""10.1080/13540602.2016.1211523"", ""10.1075/aral.18.1.01kra"", ""10.1111/0026‐7902.00071"", ""10.3102/0013189x032004013"", ""10.1017/S0261444814000408"", ""10.1080/02607476.2019.1639267"", ""10.1080/03055698.2019.1570083"", ""10.1177/1362168818776674"", ""10.1111/modl.12799"", ""10.1002/rev3.3001"", ""10.1093/applin/6.2.173"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-40322-3_1"", ""10.1177/1362168818776667"", ""10.1111/j.1468‐2273.2010.00467.x"", ""10.1111/modl.12426"", ""10.1111/lang.12337"", ""10.1111/j.1540‐4781.2006.00383.x"", ""10.1075/tblt.8.08mcd"", ""10.1093/elt/44.2.102"", ""10.1007/s11528‐020‐00486‐4"", ""10.1080/02607476.2017.1256040"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1637846"", ""10.1080/03057640500319065"", ""10.1080/10508406.2017.1404404"", ""10.4324/9781315105642"", ""10.1002/tesq.509"", ""10.1007/s10734‐020‐00595‐2"", ""10.1093/elt/ccx034"", ""10.1080/07294360.2020.1815662"", ""10.1080/19345747.2017.1379576"", ""10.1111/lang.12292"", ""10.1332/174426514x13976529631798"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0283-7"", ""10.1177/1362168812436903"", ""10.1111/modl.12795"", ""10.1332/174426420x15868720780747"", ""10.1017/S0272263100009967"", ""10.1177/0267658311431373"", ""10.1300/J394v05n01_11"", ""10.1017/S0267190510000115"", ""10.1080/1743727X.2016.1170476"", ""10.1177/2332858417705370"", ""10.2307/3587198"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐9922.2011.00663.x"", ""10.1002/tesq.517"", ""10.1111/modl.12794"", ""10.1080/00461520.2020.1794871"", ""10.1080/10508406.2013.778204"", ""10.1093/elt/ccy048"", ""10.4324/9781351190558"", ""10.1075/lllt.52.03sat"", ""10.1093/applin/amab079"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.06.005"", ""10.1177/1362168820923582"", ""10.1080/03075079.2018.1504910"", ""10.1111/lang.12001"", ""10.1080/095183998236467"", ""10.1111/modl.12797"", ""10.1111/1467-9620.00296"", ""10.1017/S0261444800012799"", ""10.1075/lllt.52.10spa"", ""10.1111/modl.12792"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐9922.2010.00562.x"", ""10.2307/40264529"", ""10.1080/02619768.2011.643398"", ""10.1080/21568235.2016.1224674"", ""10.1332/174426414x14043807774174"", ""10.1007/s10639‐019‐09999‐9"", ""10.1073/pnas.1521897113"", ""10.1017/S0267190500200020"", ""10.1017/S027226311500025X""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1186/s40594-020-00236-1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Evidence of STEM enactment effectiveness in Asian student learning outcomes,"AbstractThis study used a systematic review and meta-analysis as a method to investigate whether STEM enactment in Asia effectively enhances students’ learning outcomes. Verifiable examples of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, effectively being applied in Asia, are presented in this study. The study involved 4768 students from 54 studies. Learning outcomes focused on the students’ academic learning achievement, higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), and motivation. The analysis results of effect sizes showed that the STEM enactments in Asia were effective at a moderate level (0.69 [0.58, 0.81 of 95% CI]) of improving students’ learning outcomes. Sequentially, the effectiveness of STEM enactment starts from students’ higher-order thinking skills, moves to students’ academic learning achievement, and ends with the motivation. In addition, STEM enactments in Asia were carried out with several variations where STEM integrated with project-based learning was preferred. The recommendations of this study include a combination of the learning approach, learning orientation, and duration of instruction, all of which contribute to the STEM enactment effectiveness and maximize results in STEM education. Some practical implications, such as the central role of the teacher during the STEM enactment, are extensively discussed. This study supports that STEM education is a universally crucial tool which effectively prepares students from various national and cultural backgrounds, across Asia, toward improved learning outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Bevo Wahono"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pei-Ling Lin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chun-Yen Chang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.26822/iejee.2018438141"", ""10.6007/IJARBSS/v8-i7/4421"", ""10.1007/s10798-016-9385-9"", ""10.18404/ijemst.71338"", ""10.14527/pegegog.2018.012"", ""10.33225/jbse/15.14.641"", ""10.29333/ejmste/94314"", ""10.1057/9781137535467"", ""10.7763/IJIET.2016.V6.779"", ""10.7746/jkros.2013.8.1.058"", ""10.15267/keses.2015.34.2.194"", ""10.1080/03634529009378813"", ""10.3390/su10093040"", ""10.4324/9780203771587"", ""10.4324/9780203029053"", ""10.1080/00131857.2016.1233092"", ""10.1007/s10763-014-9526-0"", ""10.12973/tused.10153a"", ""10.1109/WEEF.2017.8467111"", ""10.1186/s41039-016-0039-z"", ""10.4135/9781412985031"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2014.1072a"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2015.1390a"", ""10.14689/ejer.2015.60.15"", ""10.15294/jpii.v5i1.5797"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-16390-1_7"", ""10.1086/598845"", ""10.1007/s10984-017-9255-8"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2018.09.001"", ""10.1007/s40299-018-0424-z"", ""10.1007/s42330-019-00050-0"", ""10.29303/jpft.v4i2.809"", ""10.15294/JPE.V7I1.21382"", ""10.1186/s40594-019-0176-1"", ""10.1186/s40594-020-00207-6"", ""10.1007/s10798-018-9488-6"", ""10.4018/ijdet.2014010104"", ""10.18517/ijaseit.8.4-2.6801"", ""10.1002/sce.21522"", ""10.1080/03057267.2014.984506"", ""10.1166/asl.2016.8111"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2278-5"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2013.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.lcsi.2019.02.004"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1097/1/012147"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638"", ""10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530096"", ""10.18844/cjes.v13i1.3322"", ""10.22237/jmasm/1257035100"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00667a"", ""10.1080/02568543.2010.487393"", ""10.1186/2193-1801-4-8"", ""10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943069"", ""10.1063/1.5019536"", ""10.36681/tused.2020.22"", ""10.1080/0309877042000298859"", ""10.20897/ejsteme/85525"", ""10.1063/1.5019544"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-44383-6_7"", ""10.15345/iojes.2018.05.012"", ""10.3390/su11040950"", ""10.33225/jbse/19.18.63"", ""10.14687/jhs.v13i3.3876"", ""10.33225/jbse/18.17.200"", ""10.18844/cjes.v13i3.3457""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

10.1002/ase.1959,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,An Alternative Method for Anatomy Training: Immersive Virtual Reality,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of immersive three‐dimensional (3D) interactive virtual reality (VR) on anatomy training in undergraduate physical therapy students. A total of 72 students were included in the study. The students were randomized into control (n = 36) and VR (n = 36) group according to the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, sex, and Purdue Spatial Visualization Test Rotations (PSVT‐R). Each student completed a pre‐intervention and post‐intervention test, consisting of 15 multiple‐choice questions. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, Kolb Learning Style Inventory distribution, and the PSVT‐R (P &gt; 0.05). The post‐test scores were significantly higher compared to pre‐test scores in both the VR group (P &lt; 0.001) and the control group (P &lt; 0.001). The difference between the pre‐test and post‐test results was found to be significantly higher in favor of the VR group (P &lt; 0.001). In this study, anatomy training with a 3D immersive VR system was found to be beneficial. These results suggest that VR systems can be used as an alternative method to the conventional anatomy training approach for health students.","[{""name"": ""Ramazan Kurul"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Faculty of Health Sciences Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Bolu Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Muhammed Nur Ögün"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Neurology Faculty of Medicine Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Bolu Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Ayşe Neriman Narin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Faculty of Health Sciences Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Bolu Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Şebnem Avci"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Faculty of Health Sciences Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Bolu Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Beyza Yazgan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Faculty of Health Sciences Gazi University Ankara Turkey""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.09.012"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.11.002"", ""10.1097/01.OPX.0000156307.95086.6"", ""10.1093/neuros/nyz003"", ""10.1016/j.jaapos.2007.06.003"", ""10.36834/cmej.36587"", ""10.1007/s00897970138a"", ""10.1002/ase.1913"", ""10.1002/ase.1864"", ""10.1002/acp.1000"", ""10.1080/15391523.2005.10782453"", ""10.1136/qshc.2004.009886"", ""10.5115/acb.2015.48.3.205"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.05.002"", ""10.1002/bjs.4407"", ""10.1152/advan.00047.2011"", ""10.15273/dmj.Vol37No1.3861"", ""10.1001/archoto.2009.68"", ""10.1002/ase.1757"", ""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.01.026"", ""10.3928/01484834-20150916-05"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.07.054"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.009"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2017.09.011"", ""10.1002/ase.1655"", ""10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.020275"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.07.010"", ""10.1002/ca.22675"", ""10.1007/s10648-012-9215-x"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2012.76.11.tb05412.x"", ""10.1002/ca.23292"", ""10.1002/ase.1696"", ""10.14742/ajet.3840"", ""10.2196/mental.5801"", ""10.1159/000163038"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02611.x"", ""10.1007/s00330-017-5271-4"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2018.05.004"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.1995.tb00148.x"", ""10.1016/j.jcrs.2010.05.020"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04273.x"", ""10.1002/ase.1438"", ""10.1016/j.ecns.2019.09.006"", ""10.11124/JBISRIR-2016-003164"", ""10.1002/ase.139"", ""10.1002/ase.1507"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2018.01.006"", ""10.1016/0278-2626(90)90037-O"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2011.75.11.tb05198.x"", ""10.1002/ase.1928""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Surgery', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

To achieve long‐term retention time, correlating the synaptic responses with the microstructures of polymer semiconductor is an imperative step. It is shown that synaptic plasticity in ion‐gel‐gated organic synaptic transistors (IGOSTs) can be modulated by controlling the microstructure of organic semiconductors and that long‐term memory retention can be significantly prolonged by increasing their crystallinity. The crystallinity of poly(3‐hexylthiophene‐2,5‐diyl) (P3HT) films that are spun‐cast on bare and self‐assembled monolayer is systematically controlled, before and after thermal treatments. Long‐term retention tends to extend, as the crystallinity increases. To evaluate synaptic current decay behaviors, it is suggested that the relaxation is a result of de‐doping of the polymer semiconductor over time. The recognition of handwritten digits is simulated and a high classification accuracy (&gt;92%) is achieved with IGOSTs including high crystalline P3HT film. The study provides fundamental information about the effects of polymer microstructure on synaptic plasticity of IGOSTs, which may be applicable in neuromorphic electronics.","[{""name"": ""Gyeong-Tak Go"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Seoul National University (SNU)  Seoul 08826 Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yeongjun Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Seoul National University (SNU)  Seoul 08826 Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Dae-Gyo Seo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Seoul National University (SNU)  Seoul 08826 Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Mingyuan Pei"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering Inha University  Incheon 22212 Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Wanhee Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Seoul National University (SNU)  Seoul 08826 Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Hoichang Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering Inha University  Incheon 22212 Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Tae-Woo Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Seoul National University (SNU)  Seoul 08826 Republic of Korea"", ""Institute of Engineering Research Research Institute of Advanced Materials Nano Systems Institute (NSI) Seoul National University (SNU)  Seoul 08826 Republic of Korea"", ""School of Chemical and Biological Engineering Seoul National University (SNU)  Seoul 08826 Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00553"", ""10.1126/science.aao0098"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aat7387"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b12092"", ""10.1038/nmat4856"", ""10.1002/adma.201906899"", ""10.1021/nl904092h"", ""10.1002/inf2.12012"", ""10.1088/1361-6463/aade3f"", ""10.1002/adma.201506363"", ""10.1002/adma.201600820"", ""10.1002/adma.201502719"", ""10.1016/j.orgel.2017.05.017"", ""10.1002/adma.201503674"", ""10.1038/s41928-018-0103-3"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104035"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aar6018"", ""10.1109/TED.2019.2928888"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b08866"", ""10.1063/1.4938553"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790840"", ""10.1002/adma.201704729"", ""10.1002/admt.201800589"", ""10.1038/nmat3722"", ""10.1016/j.tsf.2009.07.060"", ""10.1063/1.2734387"", ""10.1002/adfm.201701791"", ""10.1002/adfm.201803687"", ""10.1038/nmat4918"", ""10.1021/ja0708767"", ""10.1039/jm9920200903"", ""10.1002/aelm.201900008"", ""10.1021/jp3024233"", ""10.1021/je800678e"", ""10.1002/smll.201701193"", ""10.1039/C3RA47064D"", ""10.1002/polb.22310"", ""10.1002/adfm.200400017"", ""10.1021/ma047415f"", ""10.1002/polb.23022"", ""10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00581"", ""10.1002/1616-3028(20020916)12:9<587::AID-ADFM587>3.0.CO;2-T"", ""10.1002/adfm.201101583"", ""10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00968"", ""10.1021/jp901426e"", ""10.1002/cphc.201601221"", ""10.1021/cm049617w"", ""10.1117/1.601176"", ""10.1002/adma.200701069"", ""10.1109/TED.2015.2439635"", ""10.1088/1361-6463/aabe70"", ""10.1002/adma.201604310"", ""10.1038/s41563-017-0001-5"", ""10.1021/ja9029957""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience', 'Polymers and Plastics', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7525), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7489)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1111/eje.12453,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,1003 Stomatology; 0401 Education,'Evaluation of the introduction of a dental virtual simulator on the performance of undergraduate dental students in the pre-clinical operative dentistry course',"AbstractIntroductionVirtual reality‐based platforms are becoming increasingly popular in education. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of undergraduate dental students with the introduction of the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) within the pre‐clinical curriculum in the direct restoration module of the operative dentistry course using manual and digital methods.MethodsThirty‐two randomly selected year 2 undergraduate students were divided into two groups: group 1, exposed to the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) and group 2, no exposure to VR. All students were then evaluated in carrying out a Class I preparation in a single‐blinded fashion. All preparations were evaluated by three assessors using a traditional manual approach and a digital software. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using chi‐square test (alpha = 0.05).ResultsThe number of students who performed satisfactory preparations was more in group 1 (12/16), compared to group 2 (7/16). The percentage of satisfactory domains was significantly higher in group 1, compared to group 2, both in the manual evaluation (83.9% (94/112) and 59.8% (67/112) in groups 1 and 2, respectively) and in the digital evaluation (85.7% (96/112) and 55.4% (62/112) in groups 1 and 2, respectively) (P &lt; .05). There was no significant difference between the manual and digital methods of evaluation with regard to the percentage of satisfactory or unsatisfactory preparations (P &gt; .05).ConclusionsThe use of the Moog Simodont dental trainer (VR) significantly improved the satisfactory performance of students. The virtual reality simulator may be a valuable adjunct in the undergraduate direct restorations course and for remedial student.","[{""name"": ""Sukhdeep Murbay"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dentistry The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR""]}, {""name"": ""Jeffrey Wen Wei Chang"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dentistry The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR""]}, {""name"": ""Shadow Yeung"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dentistry The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR""]}, {""name"": ""Prasanna Neelakantan"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Dentistry The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR""]}]","[""10.1007/s10916-016-0459-8"", ""10.1017/S0001924000004231"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01428"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0579.2012.00770.x"", ""10.1016/j.sdentj.2017.02.001"", ""10.1097/SIH.0000000000000059"", ""10.1111/eje.12152"", ""10.1111/eje.12027"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2014.78.4.tb05715.x"", ""10.1111/jicd.12065"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2013.77.11.tb05620.x"", ""10.1111/eje.12023"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0579.2004.00345.x"", ""10.1038/sj.bdj.2015.881"", ""10.1034/j.1600-0579.2003.00309.x""]","['Dentistry', 'Medicine']","['Ophthalmology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Dentistry']","[[('1003 口腔医学', 0.78), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7342), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7246), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7141), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7138)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7343), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7292)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.7328), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6867)]]"

10.1002/ase.1941,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,The Effect of Stereoscopic Augmented Reality Visualization on Learning Anatomy and the Modifying Effect of Visual-Spatial Abilities: A Double-Center Randomized Controlled Trial,"Monoscopically projected three‐dimensional (3D) visualization technology may have significant disadvantages for students with lower visual‐spatial abilities despite its overall effectiveness in teaching anatomy. Previous research suggests that stereopsis may facilitate a better comprehension of anatomical knowledge. This study evaluated the educational effectiveness of stereoscopic augmented reality (AR) visualization and the modifying effect of visual‐spatial abilities on learning. In a double‐center randomized controlled trial, first‐ and second‐year (bio)medical undergraduates studied lower limb anatomy with stereoscopic 3D AR model (n = 20), monoscopic 3D desktop model (n = 20), or two‐dimensional (2D) anatomical atlas (n = 18). Visual‐spatial abilities were tested with Mental Rotation Test (MRT), Paper Folding Test (PFT), and Mechanical Reasoning (MR) Test. Anatomical knowledge was assessed by the validated 30‐item paper posttest. The overall posttest scores in the stereoscopic 3D AR group (47.8%) were similar to those in the monoscopic 3D desktop group (38.5%; P = 0.240) and the 2D anatomical atlas group (50.9%; P = 1.00). When stratified by visual‐spatial abilities test scores, students with lower MRT scores achieved higher posttest scores in the stereoscopic 3D AR group (49.2%) as compared to the monoscopic 3D desktop group (33.4%; P = 0.015) and similar to the scores in the 2D group (46.4%; P = 0.99). Participants with higher MRT scores performed equally well in all conditions. It is instrumental to consider an aptitude–treatment interaction caused by visual‐spatial abilities when designing research into 3D learning. Further research is needed to identify contributing features and the most effective way of introducing this technology into current educational programs.","[{""name"": ""Katerina Bogomolova"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Surgery Leiden University Medical Center Leiden The Netherlands"", ""Center for Innovation of Medical Education Leiden University Medical Center Leiden The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Ineke J.M. van der Ham"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Neuropsychology Leiden University Leiden The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Mary E.W.

10.1111/bjet.13054,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Peer feedback or peer feedforward? Enhancing students' argumentative peer learning processes and outcomes,"AbstractThis study compared the effects of support for peer feedback, peer feedforward and their combination on students’ peer learning processes, argumentative essay quality and domain‐specific learning. Participants were 86 BSc students who were randomly divided over 43 dyads. These dyads, in a two‐factorial experimental design, were assigned to four conditions including: peer feedback (n = 22), peer feedforward (n = 22), mixed (n = 20) and control group (n = 22) conditions. An online peer feedback environment named EduTech was designed which allowed us to implement various types of support in the form of question prompts. In this online environment, students were asked to write an argumentative essay on a controversial topic, to engage in peer learning processes and to revise their essay. Overall, the results showed that students in the three experimental conditions (peer feedback, peer feedforward and their combination) benefited more than students in the control group condition (without any support) in term of peer learning processes, argumentative essay quality and domain‐specific learning. However, there was no significant difference among the three experimental conditions. This implies that peer feedforward can be as important as peer feedback in collaborative learning environments which is often neglected both in theory and practice. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic? Writing argumentative essays is a common practice for higher education students in various disciplines which deal with controversial issues. Writing argumentative essay requires solid argumentation strategies which makes it a challenging task for higher education students. Additional instructional support is needed to help students write high‐quality argumentative essays. What this paper adds? Peer learning is a promising instructional strategy for improving students’ argumentative essay writing and learning. Online support in the form of question prompts to guide students during peer learning can improve their argumentative essay writing and learning. Next to the peer feedback, peer feedforward is also a promising instructional approach to support students’ argumentative essay writing and learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Given the positive effects of peer learning processes, the use of peer feedback and peer feedforward should be given more attention by teachers to support students write high‐quality argumentative essays for controversial issues. Teachers and educational designers should not only provide opportunities for students to engage in peer feedback processes (how I am doing?) but also in peer feedforward processes (where to next?).","[{""name"": ""Saeed Latifi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Omid Noroozi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ebrahim Talaee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jeap.2010.05.001"", ""10.1080/02602938.2013.870531"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2005.02.004"", ""10.2307/1495109"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1447645"", ""10.1111/j.1365‐2729.2007.00191.x"", ""10.1111/jcal.12096"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1545896"", ""10.1186/s41239‐016‐0017‐y"", ""10.1080/00461520903213600"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip4101_6"", ""10.1080/14703297.2019.1687005"", ""10.1177/0741088303257507"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.08.010"", ""10.1046/j.0266‐4909.2001.00198.x"", ""10.1080/13562510600680582"", ""10.1177/0033688206071316"", ""10.1016/j.system.2004.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2006.01.003"", ""10.1007/s11251-008-9053-x"", ""10.1080/03075070600572090"", ""10.1080/02602938.2013.795518"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.06.004"", ""10.1080/14703297.2016.1208112"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.08.009"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.05.002"", ""10.1080/14703297.2018.1431143"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1543200"", ""10.1007/s10648-017-9400-z"", ""10.1002/bmb.20981"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2013.10.005"", ""10.1007/s11251‐015‐9353‐x"", ""10.1177/1362168812459151"", ""10.1093/elt/cci003"", ""10.1002/tesj.123"", ""10.1007/s11251-011-9174-5"", ""10.1007/s11412-007-9028-y"", ""10.1080/01443410500345172"", ""10.1080/00405840802577569"", ""10.1016/S1060-3743(00)00022-9"", ""10.1080/00219266.2018.1472132"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.09.003"", ""10.1037/11193-000"", ""10.1016/j.jeap.2011.11.001"", ""10.1177/0033688206071316"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2008.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.017""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13425,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Investigation of the moderation effect of gender and study level on the acceptance and use of generative AI by higher education students: Comparative evidence from Poland and Egypt,"AbstractThis study delves into the implications of incorporating AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, in higher education contexts. With a primary focus on understanding the acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT among university students, the research utilizes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as the guiding framework. The investigation probes into four crucial constructs of UTAUT—performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions—to understand their impact on the intent and actual use behaviour of students. The study relies on data collected from six universities in two countries and assessed through descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling techniques, and also takes into account participants' gender and study level. The key findings show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence significantly influence behavioural intention. Furthermore, behavioural intention, when considered alongside facilitating conditions, influences actual use behaviour. This research also explores the moderating impact of gender and study level on the relationships among these variables. The results not only augment our comprehension of technology acceptance in the context of AI tools but also provide valuable input for formulating strategies that promote effective incorporation of ChatGPT in higher education. The study underscores the need for effective awareness initiatives, bespoke training programmes, and intuitive tool designs to bolster students' perceptions and foster the wider adoption of AI tools in education.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic ChatGPT is a tool that is quickly gaining worldwide recognition. ChatGPT helps with writing essays and solving assignments. ChatGPT raises ethical concerns about authorship, plagiarism and ethics. What this paper adds This study explores students' acceptance of ChatGPT as an aid in their education, which has not been studied previously. We used the extended Unified Technology Acceptance and Use of Technology theory to test what factors mostly influence the use of ChatGPT by students. We conducted a multiple study in Poland and Egypt based on sampling strategy from six universities. Implications for practice and/or policy ChatGPT is a global game changer and should be incorporated into study programmes. The limitations of ChatGPT should be well explained and known since it is prone to making mistakes. Higher education teachers should be aware of ChatGPT's capabilities.","[{""name"": ""Artur Strzelecki"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Informatics University of Economics in Katowice  Katowice Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Sara ElArabawy"", ""affiliation"": [""Business Department The British University in Egypt  Cairo Egypt""]}]","[""10.1016/0749‐5978(91)90020‐T"", ""10.1007/s10639‐021‐10758‐y"", ""10.1007/s10639‐021‐10701‐1"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957206"", ""10.1016/j.jjimei.2022.100092"", ""10.1108/IJILT‐05‐2021‐0070"", ""10.1007/s10639‐020‐10317‐x"", ""10.1186/s40561‐021‐00164‐9"", ""10.1186/s12909‐020‐02302‐2"", ""10.1111/1467‐9566.13008"", ""10.1080/14703297.2023.2190148"", ""10.53761/1.20.3.02"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-36272-9_13"", ""10.1111/j.1559‐1816.1992.tb00945.x"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.022"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-32827-8_2"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2014.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.csda.2014.07.008"", ""10.1007/s10796‐017‐9774‐y"", ""10.1007/s11423‐016‐9508‐8"", ""10.1007/s12599‐023‐00834‐7"", ""10.1111/bjet.13006"", ""10.2753/MTP1069‐6679190202"", ""10.1007/s11747‐014‐0403‐8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103761"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.02.001"", ""10.30191/ETS.202304_26(2).0014"", ""10.1108/JTF‐02‐2023‐0038"", ""10.1109/ICDAMT.2017.7904962"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.1007/s10639‐018‐09858‐z"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100790"", ""10.1108/LHTN‐01‐2023‐0009"", ""10.1002/asi.24750"", ""10.1016/j.cogr.2023.06.001"", ""10.1111/bjet.13232"", ""10.1007/s10639‐020‐10157‐9"", ""10.53761/1.20.02.07"", ""10.5539/ies.v6n7p157"", ""10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.9"", ""10.1108/ITSE‐11‐2018‐0092"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57413-4_15"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2209881"", ""10.1287/isre.6.2.144"", ""10.2307/249443"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.1080/10494820.2013.806932"", ""10.1177/21582440211055721"", ""10.1108/ITSE‐09‐2018‐0065""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13029,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Investigating the effect of teaching as a generative learning strategy when learning through desktop and immersive VR: A media and methods experiment,"AbstractImmersive virtual reality (IVR) simulations for education have been found to increase affective outcomes compared to traditional media, but the effects on learning are mixed. As reflection has previously shown to enhance learning in traditional media, we investigated the efficacy of appropriate reflection exercises for IVR. In a 2 × 2 mixed‐methods experiment, 89 (61 female) undergraduate biochemistry students learned about the electron transport chain through desktop virtual reality (DVR) and IVR (media conditions). Approximately, half of each group engaged in a subsequent generative learning strategy (GLS) of teaching in pairs (method conditions). A significant interaction between media and methods illustrated that the GLS of teaching significantly improved transfer (d = 1.26), retention (d = 0.60) and self‐efficacy (d = 0.82) when learning through IVR, but not DVR. In the second part of the study, students switched media conditions and the experiment was repeated. This time, significant main effects favoring the IVR group on the outcomes of intrinsic motivation (d = 0.16), perceived enjoyment (d = 0.94) and presence (d = 1.29) were observed, indicating that students preferred IVR after having experienced both media conditions. The results support the view that methods enable media that affect learning and that the GLS of teaching is specifically relevant for IVR. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Previous research has found a media effect with Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in education leading to better motivational outcomes compared to less immersive media, but effects on learning outcomes are mixed. There is evidence that Generative Learning Strategies (GLSs) such as summarizing and enacting can increase learning in IVR. There is also evidence that some instructional methods, such as pretraining, may be beneficial for learning in IVR. What this paper adds Evidence that the GLS of teaching improves self‐efficacy, retention and transfer in educational IVR. An interaction effect between media (DVR/IVR) and method (GLS/no‐GLS) on self‐efficacy, retention and transfer supporting the theoretical view that method enables media. No difference in perceived enjoyment, motivation and presence for students who were new to learning through these media (DVR/IVR), but differences became significant when students learned through the other media first with students preferring IVR. Implications for practice and/or policy Since IVR learning experiences can be highly engaging and also cognitively demanding, it is beneficial to introduce reflection exercises after an IVR learning experience to ensure that students reflect over the material and integrate it with their long‐term memory. One effective solution is to engage students in the GLS of teaching after an IVR simulation, thereby prompting them to select relevant information, organize it into a coherent structure and elaborate on it by incorporating it with their existing knowledge.","[{""name"": ""Sara Klingenberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria L.

This survey-based study examines student readiness for online learning in 2018, through the dimensions of importance and confidence as measures of readiness. An instrument with four subscales of competencies (online student attributes, time management, communication, and technical) that measures student readiness for online learning (SROL) was developed. Reliability of student responses to an online readiness instrument and factors related to student perception are examined. Descriptive statistics and item level means for the competencies are provided. Two repeated measures ANOVAs with one-within subject factor (four subscales for importance and competency) were conducted. Online student attributes, time management, and technical competencies were rated high for importance compared to communication competencies. Students were confident in online student attributes and technical competencies compared to time management and communication. Data was also analyzed based on demographic differences. MANOVA showed significant differences based on the race (white and non-white) of the students and course format (asynchronous, synchronous, and blended) on their perceptions of online learning competencies.","[{""name"": ""Florence Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brandy Stamper"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claudia Flowers"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Communication', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Recently, there has been a research focus on the application of AI in education, where it has great potential. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on AI in education is therefore necessary. This article considers its usage and applications in Latin American higher education institutions. After identifying the studies dedicated to educational innovations brought about by the application of AI techniques, this review examines AI applications in three educational processes: learning, teaching, and administration. Each study is analyzed for the AI techniques used, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, the AI tools and algorithms that are applied, and the main education topic. The results reveal that the main AI applications in education are: predictive modelling, intelligent analytics, assistive technology, automatic content analysis, and image analytics. It is further demonstrated that AI applications help to address important education issues (e.g., detecting students at risk of dropping out) and thereby contribute to ensuring quality education. Finally, the article presents the lessons learned from the review concerning the application of AI technologies in higher education in the Latin American context.","[{""name"": ""Sdenka Zobeida Salas-Pilco"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuqin Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_440_19"", ""10.33271/nvngu/2021-3/148"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44263-7_5"", ""10.4067/S0718-33052020000400668"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20454-9_28"", ""10.1007/s00779-021-01582-9"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2019.1646378"", ""10.18608/hla17.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44263-7_3"", ""10.4067/S0718-50062020000100093"", ""10.1177/0013124516630599"", ""10.16925/2357-6014.2020.02.03"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988510"", ""10.1007/s11277-018-5246-z"", ""10.1109/INTERCON.2018.8526411"", ""10.1109/SIITME.2018.8599203"", ""10.1037/cou0000190"", ""10.4067/S0718-50062020000500233"", ""10.23919/CISTI49556.2020.9141108"", ""10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00048"", ""10.1108/IJILT-03-2020-0032"", ""10.4067/S0718-50062020000100127"", ""10.15174/au.2013.468"", ""10.5753/cbie.sbie.2018.1623"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/862/4/042046"", ""10.5430/wje.v9n4p30"", ""10.24215/18509959.22.e06"", ""10.1109/ICEDEG.2017.7962521"", ""10.1145/3366424.3383110"", ""10.21071/psye.v11i3.13947"", ""10.3390/app9153084"", ""10.20511/pyr2019.v7n2.255"", ""10.1109/CSASE48920.2020.9142069"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2018.07.042"", ""10.6007/IJARBSS/v8-i1/3838"", ""10.1016/j.infsof.2008.09.009"", ""10.2196/20678"", ""10.1007/s11747-016-0496-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31787-4_1"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-0595-9_2"", ""10.1109/IWSSIP48289.2020.9145230"", ""10.4067/S0718-50062017000300007"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919343"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00224-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-85001-2_4"", ""10.20853/32-5-2599"", ""10.3390/e23040485"", ""10.1186/s41039-017-0062-8"", ""10.1111/bjet.12952"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.515531"", ""10.1109/IWSSIP48289.2020.9145203"", ""10.1109/BRACIS.2019.00084"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44263-7"", ""10.1080/01587919.2019.1656153"", ""10.4018/978-1-7998-4963-6"", ""10.1109/INCISCOS.2017.28"", ""10.1109/LACLO49268.2019.00071"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.002"", ""10.1109/TLA.2018.8447376"", ""10.1007/s11192-016-2166-0"", ""10.1590/0101-7438.2019.039.02.0261"", ""10.1177/0739456X17723971""]",['Computer Science'],['Computer Science Applications'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Herein, a modular microfluidic synthesis strategy, integrated with an artificial intelligence (AI)‐guided decision‐making agent for intelligent navigation through the complex colloidal synthesis universe of LHP QDs with 10 individually controlled synthesis parameters and an accessible parameter space exceeding 2 × 107, is introduced. Utilizing the developed autonomous microfluidic experimentation strategy within a global learning framework, the optimal formulation of LHP QDs is rapidly identified through a two‐step colloidal synthesis and postsynthesis halide exchange reaction, for 10 different emission colors in less than 40 min per desired peak emission energy. Using two in‐series microfluidic reactors enables continuous bandgap engineering of LHP QDs via in‐line halide exchange reactions without the need for an intermediate washing step.

10.1186/s12909-021-02584-0,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on dental education: online experience and practice expectations among dental students at the University of Jordan,"Abstract Background The quarantine associated with the COVID-19 pandemic forced dental schools to suspend their clinical training and to shift to distant learning methods. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of quarantine on the self-perceived preparedness of dental graduates and to explore the efficacy of online education from students’ perspectives. Methods The questionnaire distributed to dental students comprised of two main sections. The first part covered the online education experience, and the second part measured the level of self-perceived preparedness for a range of cognitive, communication and professional skills. Results The survey yielded a response rate of 72%. The majority of students (77%) agreed that they missed educational experiences as a result of the lockdown. More than half of them felt less motivated to follow-up with distant e-learning and believed that online assessment is not a good method for evaluation. A high percentage of the students (66%) thought that online group discussions had a positive value while 67% preferred online lectures compared to theatre lectures. Majority of students particularly 5th year (78.7%) (p &lt; 0.001) stated that the quarantine increased their collaboration with their colleagues. According to 87% of students, the experience most negatively affected was their clinical training. In general, students showed satisfactory self-perceived preparedness related to a range of attributes and professional skills. Conclusions The data showed that students partially appreciated the online system, whereas they did not consider it a substitute for face to face clinical practice. The overall self-perceived preparedness level was promising; however students had reservations regarding independent practice following graduation.","[{""name"": ""Susan Hattar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abeer AlHadidi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Faleh A.

A mixed‐method approach was used to obtain an overall understanding of students' experiences with this immersive technology in an elementary classroom. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 27 elementary‐school students through presence surveys and reflection papers. Statistical analyses were performed to compare immersive VFTs with traditional VFTs regarding students' virtual presence. Further, an inductive content analysis was performed to analyze reflection papers. The results showed an overall enhancement in virtual presence with the use of immersive VFTs. However, students felt that learning was not favorable with HMDs. The result of this study provides practical implications for the use of immersive VFTs in classroom settings.","[{""name"": ""Insook Han"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/0144929X.2016.1212931"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2016.1232754"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00246"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.10.034"", ""10.1145/985921.986048"", ""10.1007/s11528-016-0102-z"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2005.00477.x"", ""10.1007/s11423-010-9163-4"", ""10.1080/01587910600789571"", ""10.1145/950566.950595"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9577-y"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.09.017"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00900.x"", ""10.1007/s10639-017-9676-0"", ""10.1080/00220671.2013.832999"", ""10.1162/105474600566952"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.06.006"", ""10.1080/08832323.2017.1308308"", ""10.1162/105474601300343612"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-45153-4_35"", ""10.1119/1.4905824"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9581-2"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2017.12.007"", ""10.1089/109493103322278772"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_11"", ""10.1016/j.cag.2017.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.94.3.598"", ""10.1089/109493102761022832"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.01.009"", ""10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939283"", ""10.1109/WEVR.2016.7859536"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-0563-3_30"", ""10.1162/105474601300343603"", ""10.1162/pres.1993.2.3.221"", ""10.1046/j.0266-4909.2001.00222.x"", ""10.1201/b17360-3"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00812.x"", ""10.1177/1098214005283748"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_38"", ""10.1080/03098265.2014.1003798"", ""10.1111/bjet.12231"", ""10.1162/105474698565686"", ""10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.01.005""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

A meta-analysis on the effects of computer-supported collaboration scripts","AbstractScripting computer-supported collaborative learning has been shown to greatly enhance learning, but is often criticized for hindering learners’ agency and thus undermining learners’ motivation. Beyond that, what makes some CSCL scripts particularly effective for learning is still a conundrum. This meta-analysis synthesizes the results of 53 primary studies that experimentally compared the effect of learning with a CSCL script to unguided collaborative learning on at least one of the variables motivation, domain learning, and collaboration skills. Overall, 5616 learners enrolled in K-12, higher education, or professional development participated in the included studies. The results of a random-effects meta-analysis show that learning with CSCL scripts leads to a non-significant positive effect on motivation (Hedges’ g = 0.13), a small positive effect (Hedges’ g = 0.24) on domain learning and a medium positive effect (Hedges’ g = 0.72) on collaboration skills. Additionally, the meta-analysis shows how scaffolding single particular collaborative activities and scaffolding a combination of collaborative activities affects the effectiveness of CSCL scripts and that synergistic or differentiated scaffolding is hard to achieve. This meta-analysis offers the first counterevidence against the widespread criticism that CSCL scripts have negative motivational effects. Furthermore, the findings can be taken as evidence for the robustness of the positive effects on domain learning and collaboration skills.","[{""name"": ""Anika Radkowitsch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Freydis Vogel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Fischer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s40593-013-0012-6"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.10.025"", ""10.1007/s11251-010-9148-z"", ""10.3102/0034654316670999"", ""10.1002/9780470743386"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.001"", ""10.1080/10494820.2017.1333010"", ""10.1007/s10763-015-9681-y"", ""10.3102/0034654318791584"", ""10.1111/j.1756-8765.2008.01005.x"", ""10.1080/00461520.2014.965823"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.09.002"", ""10.1007/BF02505022"", ""10.1007/s11251-005-1277-4"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7"", ""10.1080/08993408.2010.539069"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9827-7_1"", ""10.1080/01621459.2000.10473905"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2004.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.03.001"", ""10.1080/00461520.2012.748005"", ""10.1007/s11412-011-9129-5"", ""10.1080/07370000903014352"", ""10.1007/s11412-013-9180-5"", ""10.1007/s11412-010-9083-7"", ""10.3102/10769986006002107"", ""10.1111/medu.12778"", ""10.1136/bmj.327.7414.557"", ""10.1348/000709900157967"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.015"", ""10.1080/00461520.2012.748006"", ""10.1080/00461520903433539"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.100284"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-36949-5_2"", ""10.1007/s10648-008-9095-2"", ""10.1007/s11412-018-9277-y"", ""10.1007/s10648-006-9007-2"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.09.021"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2014.01.003"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.37.6.822"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.05.004"", ""10.1080/10494820.2017.1372483"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103691"", ""10.1111/jcal.12241"", ""10.1177/1088868311417243"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.10.033"", ""10.1177/1745691616662243"", ""10.1007/s11251-017-9411-7"", ""10.1007/BF03173006"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2012.10.002"", ""10.1007/s11412-012-9162-z"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.08.013"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2015.04.009"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.02.006"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-85098-1_5"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1402_2"", ""10.1007/s11412-008-9054-4"", ""10.1007/s11412-012-9146-z"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_03"", ""10.1037/a0012801"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527920"", ""10.1007/s11412-007-9016-2"", ""10.1007/s11251-013-9274-5"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9619-5"", ""10.1177/014920639101700104"", ""10.1007/s11412-017-9260-z"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.48.6.1467"", ""10.1007/s11412-007-9028-y"", ""10.1007/s11251-011-9174-5"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-03362-3_16"", ""10.1177/1046496409332928"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.067"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2004.00083.x"", ""10.1026/0033-3042.59.3.150"", ""10.1080/10508400701193697"", ""10.1007/s11251-013-9286-1"", ""10.18637/jss.v036.i03"", ""10.1007/s11251-016-9380-2"", ""10.1007/s10648-016-9361-7"", ""10.1007/s11412-011-9124-x"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2011.05.001"", ""10.1007/s11251-004-2322-4"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-36949-5_12"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9827-7_10"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.08.007"", ""10.1007/s11412-017-9267-5"", ""10.1007/s10648-010-9136-5"", ""10.1111/j.1469-7610.1976.tb00381.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.09.012"", ""10.1002/j.2333-8504.2008.tb02136.x""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Current education has largely failed to meet the challenges of this world. Grounded in a new analysis of the goals of epistemic education, we argue for new directions in instruction. Our analysis specifies three components of epistemic cognition that education should address: epistemic aims, ideals, and reliable processes. Apt epistemic performance of these components has five interwoven aspects: cognitive engagement in epistemic performance, adapting performance to diverse contexts, metacognitive regulation and understanding of performance, caring and enjoyment, and participation in performance with others. Using this framework, we show how three emblematic “post-truth” problems stem from specific breakdowns in these five aspects. We then use this analysis to argue for new directions in curriculum, instruction, and research that are needed to promote successful epistemic performance in the “post-truth” landscape.","[{""name"": ""Clark A.

The review synthesises findings from 13 selected papers, encompassing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of ChatGPT's implementation in K‐12 education, implications for various stakeholders, and practical recommendations. It is highlighted that ChatGPT could empower educators through curriculum, lesson planning, materials generation, differentiation, and optimising student learning experience through personalised learning. However, concerns regarding academic integrity and output quality must be addressed. The paper provides pedagogical recommendations and ethical considerations to utilise ChatGPT better. It contributes to the ongoing discourse about AI, particularly ChatGPT's role in K‐12 education, further inspiring future research and educational practices and facilitating the effective integration of ChatGPT into K‐12 educational settings where collaboration arises as a key role, in particular under the approach of co‐design for learning.","[{""name"": ""Peng Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Doctoral School Universitat de les Illes Balears  Palma Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Gemma Tur"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Applied Pedagogy and Educational Psychology Universitat de les Illes Balears  Palma Spain""]}]","[""10.3390/bdcc7030124"", ""10.30935/cedtech/13417"", ""10.23919/MIPRO57284.2023.10159734"", ""10.30935/cedtech/13176"", ""10.1080/1360144X.2011.568690"", ""10.3390/ai4020021"", ""10.35542/osf.io/mrz8h"", ""10.31219/osf.io/9ge8m"", ""10.21556/edutec.2020.74.1761"", ""10.1080/00940771.2023.2189862"", ""10.36941/ajis‐2021‐0077"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2023.20.1"", ""10.54055/ejtr.v34i.3169"", ""10.3390/admsci13070157"", ""10.1037/a0022711"", ""10.1109/OJCS.2023.3260732"", ""10.3390/educsci13040410"", ""10.56397/JARE.2023.07.08"", ""10.3390/educsci13070733"", ""10.1111/bjet.12861"", ""10.1108/LHTN‐01‐2023‐0009"", ""10.1177/08943184231169753"", ""10.1109/TTS.2023.3267382"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0195687"", ""10.1145/3563359.3596996"", ""10.46743/2160‐3715/2018.3030"", ""10.59670/jns.v33i.434"", ""10.1186/s13643‐016‐0384‐4"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.47772/IJRISS.2023.7623"", ""10.36227/techrxiv.21789434"", ""10.21556/edutec.2020.74.1799"", ""10.1186/s41182‐019‐0165‐6"", ""10.7759/cureus.37281"", ""10.1186/s40561‐023‐00237‐x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10377-8_13"", ""10.1155/2020/2904861""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Medicine']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Surgery', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.3390/educsci11030118,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,"A Worldwide Journey through Distance Education-From the Post Office to Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Realities, and Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Surprisingly, distance education is quite an old concept. Its origins date back to the first correspondence-based course, which took place via the postal service in Boston, USA, in the 18th century. Rapid technological developments, especially in video and audio streaming, have increased the availability of such courses and moved learning into the virtual world. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are witnessing an accelerated revolution in the learning process, as nearly all forms of education have been shifted online. Will this have a destructive effect on the human psyche? Is humanity sufficiently aware and ready for such a dramatic change? Will we return to physical in-classroom studies, or is remote distance education set to become the new norm? In particular, in medicine, computer science, fine arts, or architectural design, such a rapid change in the way students learn can be quite challenging. In this paper, we provide an overview of the history of distance learning, taking into account teachers’ and students’ points of view in both secondary and higher education.","[{""name"": ""Agnieszka Pregowska"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Fundamental Technological Research, Polish Academy of Sciences, Pawinskiego 5B, 02 106 Warsaw, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Karol Masztalerz"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Science and Engineering, The University of Manchester, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Magdalena Garlińska"", ""affiliation"": [""National Center for Research and Development, Nowogrodzka 47a Str., 00 695 Warsaw, Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Magdalena Osial"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, Pasteura 1 Str., 02 093 Warsaw, Poland""]}]","[""10.20533/iji.1742.4712.2014.0110"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.453"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.07.154"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2013.12.011"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-04636-0"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2020.08.014"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.723"", ""10.1016/j.jneb.2016.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.jneb.2020.02.020"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.09.021"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2018.1549596"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14484-4"", ""10.1016/S0097-8493(02)00112-7"", ""10.1016/j.amsu.2020.09.036"", ""10.1177/0047239520934018"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101317"", ""10.1080/1364557032000119616"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.03.013"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1123"", ""10.1186/s12874-018-0611-x"", ""10.1515/eletel-2015-0031"", ""10.1080/0158791820030207"", ""10.4324/9780203018569"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-5787-9"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-5787-9"", ""10.1080/01587910500168868"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v2i2.62"", ""10.1007/BF00898030"", ""10.1080/0260293870120207"", ""10.1007/BF02768649"", ""10.1109/TE.1961.4322215"", ""10.1145/61975.66916"", ""10.2307/249607"", ""10.3917/flux.047.0084"", ""10.15241/whs.10.1.40"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-5787-9"", ""10.3390/educsci10090215"", ""10.1186/s12916-020-01577-y"", ""10.1016/j.bjps.2019.09.034"", ""10.1111/medu.14261"", ""10.1109/MCG.2005.139"", ""10.1038/nrn1651"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-46877-3"", ""10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355"", ""10.1109/38.963459"", ""10.3390/app10020636"", ""10.1109/MCSE.2020.2971188"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106316"", ""10.1109/THMS.2020.2984746"", ""10.36681/tused.2020.13"", ""10.1016/j.cpm.2019.12.008"", ""10.23919/CISTI49556.2020.9141049"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-87781-3_15"", ""10.1145/3338147.3338174"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2020.151463"", ""10.1111/medu.13843"", ""10.1111/medu.13849"", ""10.1053/j.jvca.2017.12.006"", ""10.1001/jama.2017.20800"", ""10.3390/su12219116"", ""10.1177/0194599820933599"", ""10.3390/info9020031"", ""10.1007/s10389-020-01391-z"", ""10.1007/s10758-020-09470-6"", ""10.30935/cedtech/9583"", ""10.17220/ijpes.2021.8.1.278"", ""10.3390/su12187737"", ""10.3390/joitmc7010017"", ""10.1002/9781118736494.ch10"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61780-0_7"", ""10.1162/daed_a_01769"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00155-y"", ""10.15215/aupress/9781771991339.01"", ""10.4018/978-1-59904-376-0""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

Drawing on this knowledge, researchers have proffered recommendations for how to teach these two literacy skills. Although such recommendations are aimed at closing the gap between research and practice, they often fail to take into account the reciprocal relation that exists between reading and writing. Writing and writing instruction improve students’ reading and vice versa. Theory and evidence that support this reciprocal relation are presented, and implications for the scientific study of reading and writing, policy, and practice are offered, including the proposal that the sciences of reading and writing need to be better integrated.","[{""name"": ""Steve Graham"", ""affiliation"": [""Arizona State University  Tempe USA""]}]","[""10.1037/13273-017"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3501_5"", ""10.1007/s11145-013-9494-8"", ""10.1080/00461520.2018.1481406"", ""10.3102/0091732X18821125"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-38811-9_19"", ""10.17763/haer.81.4.t2k0m13756113566"", ""10.3102/0034654320914744"", ""10.1002/rrq.194"", ""10.3102/0034654317746927"", ""10.1007/s11145-014-9517-0"", ""10.1007/s11145-012-9386-3"", ""10.1111/ldrp.12091"", ""10.1177/0741088384001002003""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/ejed.12770,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Modelling Generative AI Acceptance, Perceived Teachers' Enthusiasm and Self-Efficacy to English as a Foreign Language Learners' Well-Being in the Digital Era","ABSTRACTAs artificial intelligence (AI) has been integrated into foreign language (FL) education, learners' well‐being is influenced by various factors, including technological, personal and contextual elements. However, few studies explored how external and internal factors jointly shape FL learners' well‐being in the era of generative AI. To fill this gap, this study explores the effects of generative AI acceptance, perceived teachers' enthusiasm and self‐efficacy on FL learners' well‐being by investigating 613 university learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). The structural equation modelling results reveal that (1) generative AI acceptance positively predicts EFL learners' well‐being and self‐efficacy; (2) perceived teachers' enthusiasm does not predict learners' well‐being and positively predicts EFL learners' self‐efficacy; and (3) the self‐efficacy for receptive skills mediates the relationship between generative AI acceptance/perceived teachers' enthusiasm and EFL learners' well‐being, whereas self‐efficacy for productive skills does not play the mediation role. This research broadens the understanding of the antecedents of EFL learners' well‐being and extends the application of self‐efficacy theory in the AI‐driven educational environment, providing significant pedagogical implications.","[{""name"": ""Fangwei Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chinese as a Second Language Peking University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yongliang Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Foreign Studies North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power  Zhengzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Haijing Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chinese Language Studies The Education University of Hong Kong  Hong Kong China""]}]","[""10.17507/tpls.1305.21"", ""10.1515/iral‐2023‐0051"", ""10.1080/09588221.2023.2246519"", ""10.1177/136216882093319"", ""10.61969/jai.1337500"", ""10.1007/BF01663995"", ""10.46303/cuper.2023.2"", ""10.1177/1362168822113496"", ""10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100171"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2024.104394"", ""10.47852/bonviewIJCE42022495"", ""10.3390/su12166597"", ""10.1007/978‐3‐031‐17299‐1_2630"", ""10.1016/j.system.2022.102890"", ""10.1007/s40299‐023‐00745‐x"", ""10.1177/13621688211014538"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2014.4.2.5"", ""10.1177/1362168817692161"", ""10.1080/09588221.2021.1879162"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02899-2_36"", ""10.4324/9781315779553"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1332002"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1001283"", ""10.22111/IJALS.2020.5725"", ""10.1016/j.system.2024.103254"", ""10.1080/02188791.2024.2305173"", ""10.1007/s40299‐019‐00463‐3"", ""10.1177/13621688241239764"", ""10.14746/ssllt.2022.12.2.4"", ""10.1002/tesq.3142"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.763234"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2207187"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.02.017"", ""10.31532/InterdiscipEducPsychol.3.1.003"", ""10.1007/s10648‐015‐9354‐y"", ""10.1080/17501229.2019.1579218"", ""10.4324/9781315695990"", ""10.1075/itl.21031.kut"", ""10.1504/IJMLO.2014.067029"", ""10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100174"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2020.101435"", ""10.1177/00336882231165060"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2024.104143"", ""10.1201/9780367821654-11"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2024.104233"", ""10.1007/978‐3‐031‐15273‐3_55"", ""10.1016/j.system.2023.103193"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.781118"", ""10.1111/modl.12544"", ""10.1016/j.system.2020.102352"", ""10.1016/j.system.2007.01.003"", ""10.1111/ejed.12663"", ""10.1111/j.1944‐9720.2006.tb02266.x"", ""10.1109/79.543975"", ""10.4324/9780429203114"", ""10.1002/tesq.3253"", ""10.1111/ejed.12624"", ""10.1007/s10936‐023‐09974‐z"", ""10.21832/9781783092574‐015"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2020.101860"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2023.101302"", ""10.1016/B978-012750053-9/50003-6"", ""10.1080/17501229.2024.2309539"", ""10.1080/10573569.2022.2096517"", ""10.1016/j.system.2020.102221"", ""10.4324/9780429468339-11"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"", ""10.1186/1477‐7525‐5‐63"", ""10.23887/ijll.v4i1.30225"", ""10.1080/01434632.2022.2092625"", ""10.1007/s12144‐023‐05546‐5"", ""10.3390/bs14080629"", ""10.3390/educsci14050496"", ""10.3389/feduc.2022.1010889"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.731721"", ""10.1016/j.lmot.2024.102014"", ""10.1007/s40299‐023‐00750‐0"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2024.108353"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1261955"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v25i3.7708"", ""10.5539/elt.v14n10p70"", ""10.1016/j.system.2023.103096"", ""10.2147/PRBM.S400137"", ""10.1007/s40299‐023‐00780‐8"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2024.108337"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2024.104582"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2022.100687"", ""10.1080/10447318.2023.2288730"", ""10.1016/j.cexr.2023.100018"", ""10.1186/s41239‐019‐0171‐0"", ""10.1016/j.system.2024.103259"", ""10.1177/13621688231216199"", ""10.1086/651257"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.796728"", ""10.1007/s10639‐024‐12763‐3"", ""10.1111/ejed.12643""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"
10.1002/rrq.352,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,How the Science of Reading Informs 21st-Century Education,"ABSTRACTThe science of reading should be informed by an evolving evidence base built on the scientific method. Decades of basic research and randomized controlled trials of interventions and instructional routines have formed a substantial evidence base to guide best practices in reading instruction, reading intervention, and the early identification of at‐risk readers. The recent resurfacing of questions about what constitutes the science of reading is leading to misinformation in the public space that may be viewed by educational stakeholders as merely differences of opinion among scientists. The authors’ goals in this article were to revisit the science of reading through an epistemological lens to clarify what constitutes evidence in the science of reading, and to offer a critical evaluation of the evidence provided by the science of reading. To this end, the authors summarize those things that they believe have compelling evidence, promising evidence, or a lack of compelling evidence. The authors conclude with a discussion of areas of focus that they believe will advance the science of reading to meet the needs of all students in the 21st century.","[{""name"": ""Yaacov Petscher"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sonia Q.

The themes can be summarized as teaching approaches, goals, relations to practices outside mathematics education, teacher professional development, technology, affect, equity, and assessment. During the pandemic (November 2020), we asked respondents:Has the pandemic changed your view on the themes of mathematics education research for the coming decade? If so, how?Many of the 108 respondents saw the importance of their original themes reinforced (45), specified their initial responses (43), and/or added themes (35) (these categories were not mutually exclusive). Overall, they seemed to agree that the pandemic functions as a magnifying glass on issues that were already known, and several respondents pointed to the need to think ahead on how to organize education when it does not need to be online anymore. We end with a list of research challenges that are informed by the themes and respondents’ reflections on mathematics education research.","[{""name"": ""Arthur Bakker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jinfa Cai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Linda Zenger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3102/0034654311404435"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2018.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.09.001"", ""10.1007/s10649-006-7099-8"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2016.08.003"", ""10.1111/curi.12015"", ""10.1016/j.caeo.2020.100016"", ""10.18352/studium.10203"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-05389-9"", ""10.1080/0020739x.2020.1807069"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6352.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10763-016-9758-2"", ""10.1007/s10649-020-10008-x"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc-2020-0165"", ""10.1007/s11858-019-01045-9"", ""10.1207/s15327833mtl0803_6"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc.40.1.0040"", ""10.1007/s10649-016-9696-5"", ""10.1007/s11858-018-1007-4"", ""10.1080/00220272.2018.1537376"", ""10.1007/s10649-020-10019-8"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01185-3"", ""10.4324/9781315684758"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-62408-8"", ""10.4324/9780429290343"", ""10.1007/s10763-017-9814-6"", ""10.1007/s10649-018-9865-9"", ""10.1080/13603116.2014.908966"", ""10.2307/749619"", ""10.1080/10508406.2011.528319"", ""10.1080/10986065.2012.717379"", ""10.1007/s10649-021-10029-0"", ""10.5040/9781472547385"", ""10.21423/jume-v3i2a95"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-20487-7_2"", ""10.1787/20769679"", ""10.1007/s10649-018-9834-3"", ""10.1007/s10649-019-09913-7"", ""10.1007/s10649-018-9854-z"", ""10.1007/s10649-020-09973-0"", ""10.3102/0013189x028007004"", ""10.1007/s11858-017-0864-6"", ""10.1007/s10649-005-4818-5"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc.46.2.0134"", ""10.1007/s13394-021-00371-0"", ""10.1080/0305764042000332489"", ""10.1007/BF01273911"", ""10.1016/j.jmathb.2021.100865""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Statistics and Probability', 'Applied Mathematics']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0701 数学', 0.7285), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7193)]]"

Leadership perspectives on edtech in a COVID-19 reality,"AbstractThe edtech community has promoted claims that digital education enhances access, learning, and collaboration. The COVID-19 pandemic tested these claims like never before, as higher education systems seemingly overnight had to move teaching online. Through a sequential mixed-method approach, we investigated how 85 higher education leaders in 24 countries experienced this rapid digital transformation. Through their experiences, we identified the multiple and overlapping factors that contribute to an institution’s ability to realize the potential of digital education, in terms of access, learning and collaboration, whilst highlighting deeply rooted inequalities at the individual, institutional and system level. Drawing on these empirics, we put forth recommendations for closing the digital divides and pathways forward. Higher education leaders are uniquely positioned to move beyond the emergency adoption of online learning towards inclusive, long-term visions for digital education, which emphasize collaboration over individual gain.","[{""name"": ""Melissa Laufer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anne Leiser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bronwen Deacon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paola Perrin de Brichambaut"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benedikt Fecher"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Kobsda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Friedrich Hesse"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/s41239-018-0104-3"", ""10.5334/jime.565"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0095-0"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0130-1"", ""10.5281/zenodo.4362664"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-36119-8_3"", ""10.3278/6004797w"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.207"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0109-y"", ""10.3102/0034654318791584"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v18i5.3096"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-36119-8_5"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1171300"", ""10.1108/IJILT-04-2020-0051"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-36119-8_10"", ""10.1080/01587919.2018.1520044"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-36119-8_2"", ""10.55847/ef.v1i2.519"", ""10.1177/002205741319300303"", ""10.1007/s11412-008-9056-2"", ""10.1177/1028315312475090"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00238-7"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1696362"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-36119-8_23"", ""10.1080/17439884.2019.1666873"", ""10.11114/ijsss.v5i6.2330"", ""10.1080/17439884.2015.1012523"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.07.008"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6699.001.0001""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/jcal.12528,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,"Virtual reality in problem-based learning contexts: Effects on the problem-solving performance, vocabulary acquisition and motivation of English language learners","AbstractLearning a foreign language requires interaction with language input while involved in a task. Given that problem‐based learning (PBL) offers hands‐on application in realistic contexts, and that virtual reality (VR) enables learners to interact with multiple modalities of information, this study examines how the integration of VR technology into PBL contexts affects students' motivation for, problem‐solving during, and vocabulary acquisition in learning English as a foreign language (EFL). A total of 84 engineering majors who enrolled in a course of English for specific purposes were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. Students in the experimental group participated in a VR‐assisted PBL context, in which they were to view a PBL scenario using VR technology and then to create VR videos about solving the given problems. Those in the control group participated in a PBL context without the use of VR technology for viewing and solving the identical scenario. After the intervention, all the students wrote a problem‐solving analysis, took a vocabulary knowledge test, completed a learning motivation questionnaire, and participated in individual interviews. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group in terms of vocabulary acquisition, and were more motivated to learn English related to their future careers, whereas there was no significant difference in the problem‐solving performance of the two groups. Implications of these findings highlight the value of engaging EFL learners in immersive environments for contextualized learning through the integrated use of VR and PBL.","[{""name"": ""Ching‐Huei Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Education and Technology National Changhua University of Education  Changhua Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Hsiu‐Ting Hung"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology  Kaohsiung Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Hui‐Chin Yeh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Applied Foreign Languages National Yunlin University of Science and Technology  Douliu Taiwan""]}]","[""10.1007/s10055-019-00381-1"", ""10.1177/108056999806100207"", ""10.7575/aiac.alls.v.8n.6p.58"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2007.04.003"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.1986.tb01386.x"", ""10.2134/jae1989.0032"", ""10.1111/bjet.12790"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.08.004"", ""10.1016/S0959-4752(02)00025-7"", ""10.4324/9780203864739"", ""10.1007/s10734-008-9165-x"", ""10.4324/9781410604989"", ""10.1002/tesq.174"", ""10.1177/001698629203600405"", ""10.1007/s40692-020-00169-2"", ""10.1023/B:EDPR.0000034022.16470.f3"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2016.38"", ""10.20319/pijss.2017.32.19071927"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2008.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.11.010"", ""10.1002/tesj.238"", ""10.22219/jpbi.v4i2.5804"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9569-y"", ""10.1177/1094428105284919"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46778-8_3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.1016/j.system.2020.102336"", ""10.4324/9781003021810"", ""10.21009/1.06102"", ""10.5539/elt.v6n3p125"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1765392"", ""10.5539/ijel.v7n4p128"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103778"", ""10.26418/jeltim.v1i1.27788"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2017.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.012"", ""10.1080/01434632.2015.1071828"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-5490-7_2"", ""10.1017/9781108856218.002"", ""10.7771/1541-5015.1649"", ""10.1111/bjet.12388"", ""10.1017/S0958344017000350"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1734625""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Physiology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"
10.1007/s10639-020-10239-8,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Understanding digitalization and educational change in school by means of activity theory and the levels of learning concept,"AbstractAs shown in research and practice digitalization processes are many times limited to implementation of digital technologies without pedagogical and organizational change. In this study it is argued for a broader perspective on the concept of digitalization, viewing it as a process involving change and transformation in different stages and several organizational levels. Based on cultural–historical activity theory and the concept of levels of learning, this study will elaborate on the concept of digitalization as well as how schools are dealing with digital and educational change. Two schools known for their large-scale digitalization processes are analyzed. In the analysis, it is indicated that the object of digitalization harbors an idea that influence how digitalization is planned for and enacted within the school organization. How schools conceptualized—what is theoretically and practically meant by digitalization—influence how they plan their budget, professional development, and organizational change. With this backdrop, it is a concluded need for explicit discussions and conceptual clarifications on what digitalization is and what it involves in different school contexts.","[{""name"": ""Fanny Pettersson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.021"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.04.004"", ""10.1007/s10639-015-9456-7"", ""10.1108/09578231311304661"", ""10.1080/13639080020028747"", ""10.1111/bjet.12425"", ""10.1080/07380569.2015.1004274"", ""10.1108/IJILT-11-2018-0126"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.11.015"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2014.942750"", ""10.1007/978-94-6300-648-4_6"", ""10.1111/jcal.12196"", ""10.1007/s10833-016-9271-y"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.006"", ""10.1080/10494820903484429"", ""10.1007/s10639-015-9398-0"", ""10.18261/issn.1891-943x-2016-03-02"", ""10.18261/ISSN1891-943X-2011-04-05"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00684.x"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2014.945275"", ""10.18261/ISSN1891-943X-2015-Jubileumsnummer-08"", ""10.18848/1832-3669/CGP/v04i04/55913"", ""10.30935/cedtech/6132"", ""10.1007/s10639-017-9649-3"", ""10.7577/seminar.2976"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.016"", ""10.1007/s11423-009-9137-6""]",['Computer Science'],['Information Systems'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"
10.1111/medu.14672,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Peer-assisted learning in medical education: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"AbstractObjectivesThe prevalence of peer‐assisted learning (PAL) featuring alongside the core medical curriculum is increasing; however, the evidence base for PAL's efficacy on academic performance is limited. This systematic review of randomised studies of PAL in medical school sets out to assess the impact of PAL on academic outcomes in medical school and evaluate whether PAL confers a benefit in specific educational contexts.MethodsA literature search was conducted across MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science and Education Research Complete. Titles and abstracts were screened, and records were selected following strict eligibility criteria. Following full‐text assessment for eligibility, two reviewers independently extracted data from the final selection of records and a meta‐analysis was performed. Studies were classified using a modified version of Kirkpatrick's levels of learning. Student test scores were standardised by calculating the standardised mean difference (SMD).ResultsTwenty‐seven randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion, and twenty‐one provided sufficient and complete data to enable meta‐analysis. There was a significant improvement in the academic performance of medical students who received PAL compared with those in the control group (SMD = 0.52 [95% confidence interval 0.18–0.85]; p = .003). The impact of PAL was greater amongst clinical medical students (SMD = 0.63; p = .02) than preclinical medical students (SMD = 0.39; p = .08) and when used for teaching practical skills (SMD = 0.69; p = .001) compared with theory (SMD = −0.11; p = .21). Students taught by PAL also achieved better results in assessments conducted more than four weeks after course completion (SMD = 1.20; p = .04). [Correction added on 8 November 2020 after first publication. The data values in the Results section have been corrected in this version.]ConclusionsMedical students experiencing PAL benefit in terms of academic performance, relative to those not receiving PAL. PAL is of greatest value in the clinical stages of training and for practical skills. The long‐term outcomes of PAL remain a priority for future research.","[{""name"": ""Clarissa Brierley"", ""affiliation"": [""Warwick Medical School University of Warwick  Coventry UK""]}, {""name"": ""Leila Ellis"", ""affiliation"": [""Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust  Torquay UK""]}, {""name"": ""Emily Roisin Reid"", ""affiliation"": [""Warwick Medical School University of Warwick  Coventry UK""]}]","[""10.1007/s10459-006-9049-8"", ""10.1007/BF00138870"", ""10.4324/9781410603678"", ""10.3402/meo.v21.30974"", ""10.1080/01421590220134060"", ""10.1111/medu.12475"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.01954.x"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-14-115"", ""10.1080/01421590500156186"", ""10.1097/00001888-199905000-00051"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.1990.tb02449.x"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181f53273"", ""10.1097/00001888-199406000-00004"", ""10.1080/0142159031000136743"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00460.x"", ""10.1080/10401330701364551"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0566-8"", ""10.1111/tct.12001"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2015.1112888"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00135"", ""10.1186/s12916-014-0143-0"", ""10.1080/01421590600902976"", ""10.1136/bmj.d5928"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.1997.012003177.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-1331.2008.02317.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03557.x"", ""10.1080/01421590701682550"", ""10.21315/mjms2020.27.5.10"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-14-135"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1241-z"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-13-165"", ""10.1007/s00464-019-06944-2"", ""10.1016/j.accpm.2016.11.007"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2015.1105940"", ""10.3109/01421590903414245"", ""10.1016/j.ajog.2011.01.038"", ""10.1080/0142159031000136752"", ""10.1007/s00068-017-0819-1"", ""10.1111/jpc.13937"", ""10.1007/s00068-019-01298-9"", ""10.1007/s00586-011-2140-8"", ""10.1093/rheumatology/keq166"", ""10.34190/EJEL.20.18.1.004"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03252.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03107.x"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-0939-7"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-9-55"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2010.02.008"", ""10.1080/01421590701583816"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2015.01.023"", ""10.1155/2013/930901"", ""10.1080/10401330701798337"", ""10.1080/01443410500345172"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2005.02191.x"", ""10.1097/00001888-199612000-00021"", ""10.1001/jama.296.9.1094"", ""10.1001/jama.282.9.867"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028800"", ""10.7554/eLife.24260"", ""10.5116/ijme.5aa3.e2a6""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Family Practice', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

This study aims to explore the determinants of students’ intention towards e-library services usage amid the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper reviews the technology-oriented individual attitude based on four dimensions of the technology readiness 2.0 index factors, which affect medical students’ perspectives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors provided a self-administered questionnaire to medical students to investigate their e-library adoption attitude during the COVID-19 crisis. The authors distributed 542 questionnaires, received 361 complete responses and analyzed the data through path modeling/partial least squares structural equations modeling technique (PLS-SEM) with the smart PLS software version 3.3.3. The structural equation-modelling tool permits the estimation of results. RESULTS: The main finding revealed that medical students have a positive and explicit approach to use the services available at the e-library. Technology use and online services helped students continue their educational needs in the advent of the current pandemic COVID-19. Attitude and subjective norms have significant influence and are strong predictors of intention. However, due to inadequate support for the government side, the perceived behavioural control has an insignificant impact on intention. This paper indicated one of the pioneers investigating the determinants of e-library adoption among medical students based on technology-oriented personality traits, employing the four dimensions of the technology readiness 2.0 index during the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION: The study's findings provide useful insight that offers valuable insights to implement specific strategies from the government officials to address medical students’ uncertainties and increase the technology adoption amid the COVID-19 pandemic in medical education for developing nations.","[{""name"": ""Taufik Edi Rahmat"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Economics and Business, Fakultas Ekonomi dan Bisnis Universitas Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa, Serang, Banten, Indonesia""]}, {""name"": ""Saqlain Raza"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Management Sciences, Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (SZABIST), Islamabad, Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Hasan Zahid"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Management Sciences, Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Jaffar Abbas"", ""affiliation"": [""Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai China, and School of Media and Communication, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China""]}, {""name"": ""Fatimah Azzahraa Mohd Sobri"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Technology Management and Logistics, College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia, 06010 UUM Sintok, Kedah Darul Aman, Malaysia""]}, {""name"": ""Shehla Najib Sidiki"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Management Sciences, Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (SZABIST), Karachi, Pakistan""]}]","[""10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102279"", ""10.1016/j.im.2019.103208"", ""10.1016/j.lisr.2021.101074"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106140"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2019.102103"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2018.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.future.2020.10.026"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-822807-4.00007-5"", ""10.1016/j.socec.2020.101647"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2019.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105315"", ""10.24869/psyd.2020.32"", ""10.1002/gps.5423"", ""10.1186/s12992-020-00654-4"", ""10.1016/j.lisr.2019.100969"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2021.102154"", ""10.4103/jehp.jehp_148_20"", ""10.3390/su11061683"", ""10.1080/23311975.2017.1338842"", ""10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004772"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115236"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120511"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113497"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101247"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102346"", ""10.1016/j.eujim.2021.101304"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2019.102072"", ""10.1016/j.crbeha.2020.100011"", ""10.1016/j.ieri.2012.06.044"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2014.02.007"", ""10.2147/RMHP.S284313"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2018.11.012"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102397"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102174"", ""10.1186/s13690-021-00594-4"", ""10.1177/0272684X20965811"", ""10.1108/JIEB-09-2016-0032"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.756"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2004.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102235"", ""10.3390/ijerph18031259"", ""10.1016/j.crbeha.2021.100033"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2021.102390"", ""10.5367/000000003322776299"", ""10.1177/0020764020939984"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106552"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119906"", ""10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2766"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001596"", ""10.1108/DLP-04-2020-0023"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102298"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102280"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2019.102097"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2016.07.001"", ""10.4103/jehp.jehp_316_20"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00778"", ""10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100159"", ""10.1002/gps.5423"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102256"", ""10.3390/su11113039"", ""10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01194"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102278"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2018.07.071"", ""10.1186/s12916-020-01876-4"", ""10.3390/su12083480"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000645"", ""10.1177/1094670514539730"", ""10.1108/EBR-10-2013-0128"", ""10.3390/resources8030128"", ""10.1080/23311975.2021.1880253"", ""10.3390/su11113006"", ""10.3390/bs9030030"", ""10.4103/jehp.jehp_171_20"", ""10.1093/biomet/61.1.101"", ""10.3390/su12166520"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5"", ""10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029"", ""10.29333/ejmste/8240"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00130-7"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.3151"", ""10.3390/su12125052"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2021.626134"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.769175""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science']","['Management Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1002/ase.1912,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,Neuroanatomy Learning: Augmented Reality vs. Cross-Sections,"Neuroanatomy education is a challenging field which could benefit from modern innovations, such as augmented reality (AR) applications. This study investigates the differences on test scores, cognitive load, and motivation after neuroanatomy learning using AR applications or using cross‐sections of the brain. Prior to two practical assignments, a pretest (extended matching questions, double‐choice questions and a test on cross‐sectional anatomy) and a mental rotation test (MRT) were completed. Sex and MRT scores were used to stratify students over the two groups. The two practical assignments were designed to study (1) general brain anatomy and (2) subcortical structures. Subsequently, participants completed a posttest similar to the pretest and a motivational questionnaire. Finally, a focus group interview was conducted to appraise participants’ perceptions. Medical and biomedical students (n = 31); 19 males (61.3%) and 12 females (38.7%), mean age 19.2 ± 1.7 years participated in this experiment. Students who worked with cross‐sections (n = 16) showed significantly more improvement on test scores than students who worked with GreyMapp‐AR (P = 0.035) (n = 15). Further analysis showed that this difference was primarily caused by significant improvement on the cross‐sectional questions. Students in the cross‐section group, moreover, experienced a significantly higher germane (P = 0.009) and extraneous cognitive load (P = 0.016) than students in the GreyMapp‐AR group. No significant differences were found in motivational scores. To conclude, this study suggests that AR applications can play a role in future anatomy education as an add‐on educational tool, especially in learning three‐dimensional relations of anatomical structures.","[{""name"": ""Dylan J.H.A.

10.1186/s12909-020-02012-9,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Mapping clinical reasoning literature across the health professions: a scoping review,"Abstract Background Clinical reasoning is at the core of health professionals’ practice. A mapping of what constitutes clinical reasoning could support the teaching, development, and assessment of clinical reasoning across the health professions. Methods We conducted a scoping study to map the literature on clinical reasoning across health professions literature in the context of a larger Best Evidence Medical Education (BEME) review on clinical reasoning assessment. Seven databases were searched using subheadings and terms relating to clinical reasoning, assessment, and Health Professions. Data analysis focused on a comprehensive analysis of bibliometric characteristics and the use of varied terminology to refer to clinical reasoning. Results Literature identified: 625 papers spanning 47 years (1968–2014), in 155 journals, from 544 first authors, across eighteen Health Professions. Thirty-seven percent of papers used the term clinical reasoning; and 110 other terms referring to the concept of clinical reasoning were identified. Consensus on the categorization of terms was reached for 65 terms across six different categories: reasoning skills, reasoning performance, reasoning process, outcome of reasoning, context of reasoning, and purpose/goal of reasoning. Categories of terminology used differed across Health Professions and publication types. Discussion Many diverse terms were present and were used differently across literature contexts. These terms likely reflect different operationalisations, or conceptualizations, of clinical reasoning as well as the complex, multi-dimensional nature of this concept. We advise authors to make the intended meaning of ‘clinical reasoning’ and associated terms in their work explicit in order to facilitate teaching, assessment, and research communication.","[{""name"": ""Meredith E.

Data were collected from 226 Japanese senior high school EFL students. Data sources included a practice version of the TOEFL Junior Standard test, the Listening Vocabulary Levels Test, the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire, memory recall tests, attentional control tests, and a study‐generated questionnaire measuring topical knowledge. Scores from these instruments were examined using structural equation modeling. The results showed that vocabulary knowledge had the strongest total effect on listening performance. Topical knowledge and attentional control also had direct effects. Only metacognitive awareness had an indirect effect on listening comprehension through topical knowledge. The findings indicate that differences in domain‐specific knowledge, particularly vocabulary knowledge, are the most important for predicting listening comprehension.","[{""name"": ""Matthew P.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000004528,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Future of Nursing Education,"Nursing is the largest health profession, with nearly 4 million providers practicing across acute, primary, and public health care settings. In response to the pandemic, nursing schools halted on-site course delivery and redesigned programs to attenuate risks to students and faculty. Key challenges faced by schools included financial cutbacks, rapid increases in online learning technology, maintaining student academic progression, disruption to clinical learning opportunities, and meeting accreditation standards, while addressing the stress and loss experienced by faculty, staff, and students. Despite challenges, nursing organizations provided guidance for decision making, new learning resources, and faculty development opportunities. Schools of nursing leveraged their resources to redesign nursing curricula, strengthen partnerships for student clinical experiences, and address needs of the community. Nursing education will look different from its prepandemic profile in the future. Lessons learned during the pandemic point to gaps in nursing education, particularly related to disaster and public health preparedness, health equity, and technology. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing’s new Essentials—standards for professional nursing education—were finalized during the pandemic and reflect these lessons. The need for nurse scientists to conduct emergency response research was made evident. The importance of strong academic–practice partnerships was highlighted for rapid communication, flexibility, and responses to dynamic environments. For the future, nursing education and practice must collaborate to ensure that students and practicing nurses are prepared to address emergencies and pandemics, as well as the needs of vulnerable populations.","[{""name"": ""Cynthia A.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000004563,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Impact of Mentoring on Academic Career Success for Women in Medicine: A Systematic Review,"Purpose Research has shown that barriers to career success in academic medicine disproportionately affect women. These barriers include inadequate mentoring, which may perpetuate the underrepresentation of women in senior leadership positions. The purpose of this review was to summarize the qualitative and quantitative evidence of the impact of mentoring on women’s career outcomes and to inform future interventions to support the promotion and retention of women in academic medicine. Method The authors conducted a systematic review of original research published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals through March 20, 2020. Search terms related to mentorship, women, and academic medicine. The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Current Contents Connect via Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. They excluded studies not specifically addressing women and those without gender-stratified outcomes. They extracted and analyzed the following data: study design, population, sample size, response rate, participant age, percentage of women, mentoring prevalence, and outcomes. Results Of 2,439 citations identified, 91 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 65 quantitative and 26 qualitative studies. Mentoring was associated with objective and subjective measures of career success. Women perceived mentorship to be more valuable to their career development yet were more likely to report having no mentor. Additionally, women were more likely to report lower levels of research productivity, less career satisfaction, and greater barriers to promotion. Qualitative results indicated that women had less access to informal mentoring and family responsibilities had a greater effect on their career outcomes. Professional networking, female mentors, and relational aspects of mentoring were common themes. Conclusions This review examined gender disparities in mentoring and the impact on research productivity, promotion success, and career satisfaction for women in academic medicine. Institution-supported mentoring programs are needed to facilitate identification of appropriate mentors and promotion of a more equitable academic career environment for women.","[{""name"": ""Mary R.

10.3390/educsci12110784,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Higher Education Future in the Era of Digital Transformation,"A significant number of educational stakeholders are concerned about the issue of digitalization in higher educational institutions (HEIs). Digital skills are becoming more pertinent throughout every context, particularly in the workplace. As a result, one of the key purposes for universities has shifted to preparing future managers to address issues and look for solutions, including information literacy as a vital set of skills. The research of educational technology advances in higher education is now being discussed and debated, with various laws, projects, and tactics being offered. Digital technology has been a part of the lives of today’s children from the moment they are born. There are still many different types of digital divisions that exist in our society, and they affect the younger generation and their digital futures. Today’s students do not have the same level of preparation for the technology-rich society they will have. Universities and teaching should go through a significant digital transformation to fulfill the demands of today’s generation and the fully digitized world they will be living in. The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly and unexpectedly compelled HEIs and the educational system to engage in such a shift. In this study, we investigate the digital transformation brought about by COVID-19 in the fundamental education of the younger generation. Additionally, the study investigates the various digital divides that have emerged and been reinforced, as well as the potential roadblocks that have been reported along the way. In this paper, the study suggests that research into information management must better address students, their increasingly digitalized everyday lives, and basic education as key focus areas.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Akour"", ""affiliation"": [""Software Engineering and Disruptive Innovation (SEDI), College of Computer and Information Sciences, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Mamdouh Alenezi"", ""affiliation"": [""Software Engineering and Disruptive Innovation (SEDI), College of Computer and Information Sciences, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia""]}]","[""10.15294/jne.v7i1.26385"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-12-2018-0136"", ""10.3390/educsci11120770"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-822144-0.00036-7"", ""10.1177/0170840620970728"", ""10.3390/su13137074"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2022.101581"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.12.163"", ""10.3390/info12110479"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2016.11.007"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2011.312"", ""10.5815/ijmecs.2017.02.01"", ""10.17718/tojde.285719"", ""10.1080/14703297.2016.1180255"", ""10.1111/bjet.12469"", ""10.1177/09504222211029796"", ""10.1002/ajcp.12206"", ""10.2991/aebmr.k.200502.082"", ""10.3991/ijet.v15i23.18807"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2013.02.006"", ""10.1108/ICT-04-2013-0023"", ""10.1093/wbro/lkv019"", ""10.1080/10409289.2010.497450"", ""10.1108/MEDAR-01-2018-0260"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0130-1"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-06-2020-0118"", ""10.1016/S0360-1315(03)00012-5"", ""10.4018/978-1-7998-3820-3.ch012"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1303_2"", ""10.1186/s12909-021-02834-1"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1665324"", ""10.1177/0022487120949842"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.04.200"", ""10.1002/chp.20001"", ""10.1177/1942775116658635"", ""10.1080/15391523.2016.1175856"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.05.016"", ""10.1257/aer.90.2.415"", ""10.1108/13527590110395621"", ""10.1108/JOCM-06-2020-0163"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00155-y"", ""10.4324/9780203830918"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44897-4"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.616059""]",['Computer Science'],['Information Systems'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

However, research indicates the level of access does not always match the level of need. To address disparities, it is essential to identify factors influencing access.MethodWe propose a framework where access to EI is conceptualised as aprocessthat includes three main phases. A narrative review examined potential barriers, facilitators and modifiers of access for each phase.ResultsThe process of access to EI includes the following: 1) recognition of need, 2) identification or diagnosis and 3) EI provision or receipt. Several factors affecting access to EI for each phase were identified, related to the family, services, the intersection between family and services, and the context.ConclusionA broad range of factors appear to influence the process of access to EI for this population. Our framework can be used in future research investigating access. Broad implications for policy, practice and future research to improve access to EI are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Suzi J.

10.1007/s10758-020-09489-9,TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING,0401 Education,Effectiveness of VR Head Mounted Displays in Professional Training: A Systematic Review,"AbstractOver the past decade, virtual reality (VR) has re-emerged as a popular technology trend. This is mainly due to the recent investments from technology companies that are improving VR systems while increasing consumer access and interest. Amongst many applications of VR, one area that is particularly promising is for pedagogy. The immersive, experiential learning offered by VR provides new training and learning opportunities driven by the latest versions of affordable, highly immersive and easy to use head mounted display (HMD) systems. VR has been tested as a tool for training across diverse settings with varying levels of success in the past. However, there is a lack of recent review studies that investigates the effectiveness, advantages, limitations, and feasibility of using VR HMDs in training. This review aims to investigate the extent to which VR applications are useful in training, specifically for professional skill and safety training contexts. In this paper, we present the results from a systematic review of the effectiveness of VR-based simulation training from the past 30 years. As a secondary aim, the methodological trends of application and practical challenges of implementing VR in training curriculum were also assessed. The results suggest that there is generally high acceptance amongst trainees for VR-based training regardless of the technology limitations, usability challenges and cybersickness. There is evidence that VR is useful for training cognitive skills, such as spatial memory, learning and remembering procedures and psychomotor skills. VR is also found to be a good alternative where on the job training is either impossible or unsafe to implement. However, many training effectiveness studies reviewed lack experimental robustness due to limited study participants and questionable assessment methods. These results map out the current known strengths and weaknesses of VR HMDs and provide insight into required future research areas as the new era of VR HMD’s evolve.","[{""name"": ""Sathiya kumar Renganayagalu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Steven C.

10.1007/s10643-021-01203-3,EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION JOURNAL,0401 Education,Early Childhood Educators' Wellbeing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"AbstractThe importance of Early Childhood (EC) educators’ wellbeing has been brought into sharp focus during the COVID-19 pandemic, as educators have navigated numerous additional stressors while providing education and care services for some children and ongoing support for many others learning at home. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on EC educators’ wellbeing and educator-child relationships, as growing evidence shows the influence of these factors on children’s developmental outcomes.In July 2020, members of a Research Network of EC Professionals—who previously identified educator wellbeing as a priority issue—were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey included two published, validated scales: the Early Childhood Professional Wellbeing scale (ECPW) and the Student–Teacher Relationship Scale (modified). Survey items about educators’ experiences during the pandemic were also included. Two hundred and thirty-two EC educators from across Australia completed the survey, mostly from Victoria where lockdowns were most severe. Linear regression analysis demonstrated stronger professional wellbeing was associated with less conflict in educator-child relationships and lower risk of staff turnover. This was more likely to be experienced by senior or more experienced staff. Although a negative impact of COVID-19 was reported, ECPW scores were relatively high, and organizational structures supporting professional wellbeing were most strongly associated with lower risk of turnover (r = 0.63, p &lt; 0.001). Findings highlight that supporting EC educators’ wellbeing is essential for workforce retention, and for promoting quality educator-child relationships which are central to young children’s learning and development.","[{""name"": ""Patricia Eadie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Penny Levickis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lisa Murray"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jane Page"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Catriona Elek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amelia Church"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09645292.2017.1366425"", ""10.1080/09669760.2019.1605885"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02626"", ""10.1108/HE-11-2013-0062"", ""10.1080/10409289.2016.1168227"", ""10.1111/mono.12236"", ""10.1126/science.1248429"", ""10.1080/03004430.2016.1180516"", ""10.1080/10409289.2016.1102017"", ""10.1177/183693911504000310"", ""10.1007/s40723-015-0005-z"", ""10.1177/1463949118772573"", ""10.1257/jep.27.2.109"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2015.11.001"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00301"", ""10.3316/informit.675313221536539"", ""10.1007/s12671-014-0312-4"", ""10.1037/edu0000187"", ""10.1037/a0035720"", ""10.3316/informit.675331854507798"", ""10.5723/kjcs.2018.39.3.127"", ""10.1007/s10643-015-0744-z"", ""10.3102/0034654319855619"", ""10.2224/sbp.8409"", ""10.1080/03057925.2017.1283979"", ""10.1007/s13158-020-00264-6"", ""10.1080/02568543.2019.1705446"", ""10.1787/301005d1-en"", ""10.1177/1836939119855542"", ""10.1007/s10212-010-0025-6"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0167660"", ""10.1353/foc.2016.0016"", ""10.1353/foc.2016.0015"", ""10.1080/10409289.2016.1127088"", ""10.1542/peds.2011-2663"", ""10.1787/f9b2e53f-en"", ""10.1515/ijdhd-2016-0037"", ""10.1080/02568543.2016.1214652"", ""10.1007/s10833-020-09382-3"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2016.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2014.08.008"", ""10.1177/183693911403900213"", ""10.3102/0034654315626801""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1186/s41239-020-00223-0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Big data in education: a state of the art, limitations, and future research directions","Abstract Big data is an essential aspect of innovation which has recently gained major attention from both academics and practitioners. Considering the importance of the education sector, the current tendency is moving towards examining the role of big data in this sector. So far, many studies have been conducted to comprehend the application of big data in different fields for various purposes. However, a comprehensive review is still lacking in big data in education. Thus, this study aims to conduct a systematic review on big data in education in order to explore the trends, classify the research themes, and highlight the limitations and provide possible future directions in the domain. Following a systematic review procedure, 40 primary studies published from 2014 to 2019 were utilized and related information extracted. The findings showed that there is an increase in the number of studies that address big data in education during the last 2 years. It has been found that the current studies covered four main research themes under big data in education, mainly, learner’s behavior and performance, modelling and educational data warehouse, improvement in the educational system, and integration of big data into the curriculum. Most of the big data educational researches have focused on learner’s behavior and performances. Moreover, this study highlights research limitations and portrays the future directions. This study provides a guideline for future studies and highlights new insights and directions for the successful utilization of big data in education.","[{""name"": ""Maria Ijaz Baig"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Liyana Shuib"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elaheh Yadegaridehkordi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700294"", ""10.1080/0969594X.2018.1441807"", ""10.1145/2538862.2538949"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.future.2018.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.10.023"", ""10.1108/ict-10-2016-0069"", ""10.1108/ijem-08-2017-0199"", ""10.1016/j.jvlc.2016.03.002"", ""10.1108/LR-06-2015-0061"", ""10.1109/CTS.2013.6567203"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.03.004"", ""10.1108/ict-08-2014-0059"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.033"", ""10.1177/0165551518789880"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2017.03.003"", ""10.1177/0165551518789880"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.09.026"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-7501-6.ch018"", ""10.1016/j.compag.2017.09.037"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.03.085"", ""10.1109/BigMM.2016.70"", ""10.1016/s2212-5671(15)01712-8"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.11.011"", ""10.1145/3284179.3284206"", ""10.1007/10257-017-0362-y"", ""10.1016/j.petlm.2018.11.001"", ""10.1109/ISCAIE.2018.8405502"", ""10.1016/j.bdr.2019.03.001"", ""10.1109/FIE.2017.8190688"", ""10.1007/s11704-017-6498-6"", ""10.1145/3027385.3029445"", ""10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2015.178"", ""10.1177/2158244015584379"", ""10.1016/j.cobeha.2017.11.006"", ""10.1145/3134302.3134335"", ""10.1109/ICSSSM.2015.7170149"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.07.061"", ""10.1109/confluence.2017.7943148"", ""10.1016/j.ipm.2018.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2017.12.134"", ""10.1108/idd-09-2018-0043"", ""10.1080/17439884.2014.921628"", ""10.1016/j.future.2018.06.046"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.jaccedu.2016.12.008"", ""10.1145/3197091.3205834"", ""10.1177/0013161x18799439"", ""10.1109/ICASI.2017.7988114"", ""10.1080/0144929x.2018.1502355"", ""10.1016/j.future.2019.04.020"", ""10.1177/2332858416657002"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2015.12.019"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.522"", ""10.1016/j.agsy.2017.01.023"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2017.11.004"", ""10.1080/17517575.2018.1442934"", ""10.1177/1326365x16673168"", ""10.1016/j.future.2018.08.040"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.08.007"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2018.1441984""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science']","['Information Systems', 'Management Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1186/s40594-022-00352-0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,"A social cognitive perspective on gender disparities in self-efficacy, interest, and aspirations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM): the influence of cultural and gender norms","Abstract Background The underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields is well documented in developed countries, and yet public discussion of gender disparities in STEM in China is still in its nascent stage. Endorsement of traditional gender role beliefs and conformity to social norms are pertinent to Chinese culture, which may even exacerbate the gender disparities in STEM engagement. Grounded in social cognitive career theory, the present study drew on a national sample of secondary school students (N = 3020) in China to estimate gender disparities in self-efficacy, interest, and aspirations in STEM and examine how cultural and gender norms influence STEM engagement. Results The proposed sequential mediation model was supported, in which girls were more likely to show lower levels of self-efficacy than boys; this was associated with lower interest in STEM and lower motivation to pursue STEM careers. The results also supported the moderating effect of traditional gender role beliefs and found that gender differences in self-efficacy, interest, and aspirations in STEM were more apparent among students who strongly endorsed stereotypical views of male and female roles. Conclusions The findings provide important implications for efforts to improve girls’ access to STEM education through curriculum enrichment and out-of-school time programs to bridge the gender gap in STEM. Access to female role models and gender-responsive pedagogy is also essential to boost girls’ self-efficacy in STEM and eradicate traditional gender role beliefs among all students.","[{""name"": ""Randolph C.

10.1111/ejed.12527,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION,0401 Education,Towards hybrid human-AI learning technologies,"AbstractEducation is a unique area for application of artificial intelligence (AI). In this article, the augmentation perspective and the concept of hybrid intelligence are introduced to frame our thinking about AI in education. The involvement of quadruple helix stakeholders (i.e., researchers, education professionals, entrepreneurs, and policymakers) is necessary to understand the opportunities and challenges of different educational use cases from an integrated point of view. To facilitate a meaningful dialogue, a common language about AI in education is needed. This article outlines elements of such a common language. The detect‐diagnose‐act framework is used to describe the core functions of AI in education. The six levels of automation model is introduced to develop our thinking about the roles of AI, learners, and teachers in educational arrangements. In this model, the transition of control between teacher and technology is articulated at different levels and related to the augmentation perspective. Finally, the future of AI in education is discussed using self‐regulated learning as an example. The proposed common language will help to support a coordinated development of an interdisciplinary dialogue between quadruple helix stakeholders to strengthen meaningful application of AI for learning and teaching.","[{""name"": ""Inge Molenaar"", ""affiliation"": [""National Education Lab AI, Behavioural Science Institute, Faculty of Social Sciences Radboud University  Nijmegen Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1109/MC.2020.2996587"", ""10.4324/9781315736419"", ""10.1038/s41598‐020‐60011‐8"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0637-6"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.025"", ""10.1007/s40593‐016‐0105‐0"", ""10.1787/f54ea644-en"", ""10.1080/10508406.2013.836653"", ""10.1007/s11409-007-9009-6"", ""10.1145/3027385.3029463"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170409"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100002"", ""10.1177/14749041211041793"", ""10.1007/s10676-022-09645-y"", ""10.1111/bjet.12829"", ""10.1007/s12599‐019‐00595‐2"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.041"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.001"", ""10.1007/s11409‐022‐09304‐z"", ""10.1007/s11409‐022‐09291‐1"", ""10.1080/01443410.2018.1495829"", ""10.1007/s11528‐014‐0822‐x"", ""10.1111/ejed.12533"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-52237-7_20"", ""10.18608/jla.2019.62.3"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.101268"", ""10.3390/s21237869"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170421"", ""10.1145/3448139.3448179"", ""10.1080/17439884.2021.1876725"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-36119-8_12"", ""10.14786/flr.v8i4.641"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1931346"", ""10.3102/0034654315581420"", ""10.14324/RFA.05.1.03"", ""10.1109/TLT.2018.2868673"", ""10.1007/s11423‐020‐09793‐2"", ""10.13109/buer.2021.74.3.249"", ""10.1016/j.tine.2021.100163"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100070"", ""10.1787/2cc25e37-en"", ""10.1177/1046496416689710"", ""10.1145/3303772.3303780"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.05.003"", ""10.1145/3375462.3375465"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883892"", ""10.1109/TLT.2018.2851585"", ""10.1145/3027385.3029488"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.12.006"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-07221-0_16"", ""10.1007/s11409-019-09204-9"", ""10.1109/3468.844354"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2020.03.180"", ""10.1145/3371300.3383342"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98572-5_29"", ""10.1111/jcal.12175"", ""10.1007/s10639‐017‐9651‐9"", ""10.1201/9781003005629"", ""10.1109/TLT.2021.3067946"", ""10.1038/s41591‐018‐0300‐7"", ""10.1145/3448139.3448181"", ""10.1007/s11409‐022‐09308‐9"", ""10.18608/jla.2021.7325"", ""10.1080/00461520.2011.611369"", ""10.1787/d3153fcd-en"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1798995"", ""10.18608/hla17.021""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13116,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,The effectiveness of technology-supported personalised learning in low- and middle-income countries: A meta-analysis,"AbstractDigital technology offers the potential to address educational challenges in resource‐poor settings. This meta‐analysis examines the impact of students' use of technology that personalises and adapts to learning level in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Following a systematic search for research between 2007 and 2020, 16 randomised controlled trials were identified in five countries. Studies involved 53,029 learners aged 6–15 years. Coding examined learning domain (mathematics and literacy); personalisation level and delivery; technology use; and intervention duration and intensity. Overall, technology‐supported personalised learning was found to have a statistically significant—if moderate—positive effect size of 0.18 on learning (p = 0.001). Meta‐regression reveals how more personalised approaches which adapt or adjust to learners' level led to significantly greater impact (an effect size of 0.35) than those only linking to learners' interests or providing personalised feedback, support, and/or assessment. Avenues for future research include investigating cost implications, optimum programme length, and teachers' role in making personalised learning with technology effective. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic? Promoting personalised learning is an established aim of educators. Using technology to support personalised learning in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) could play an important role in ensuring more inclusive and equitable access to education, particularly in the aftermath of COVID‐19. There is currently no rigorous overview of evidence on the effectiveness of using technology to enable personalised learning in LMICs. What this paper adds? The meta‐analysis is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of technology‐supported personalised learning in improving learning outcomes for school‐aged children in LMICs. Technology‐supported personalised learning has a statistically significant, positive effect on learning outcomes. Interventions are similarly effective for mathematics and literacy and whether or not teachers also have an active role in the personalisation. Personalised approaches that adapt or adjust to the learner led to significantly greater impact, although whether these warrant the additional investment likely necessary for implementation at scale needs to be investigated. Personalised technology implementation of moderate duration and intensity had similar positive effects to that of stronger duration and intensity, although further research is needed to confirm this. Implications for practice and/or policy: The inclusion of more adaptive personalisation features in technology‐assisted learning environments can lead to greater learning gains. Personalised technology approaches featuring moderate personalisation may also yield learning rewards. While it is not known whether personalised technology can be scaled in a cost‐effective and contextually appropriate way, there are indications that this is possible. The appropriateness of teachers integrating personalised approaches in their practice should be explored given ‘supplementary’ uses of personalised technology (ie, additional sessions involving technology outside of regular instruction) are common.","[{""name"": ""Louis Major"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education University of Cambridge Cambridge UK""]}, {""name"": ""Gill A.

10.1108/IJSHE-04-2021-0162,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,Sustainable leadership in higher education institutions: social innovation as a mechanism,"Purpose Considering the vital role of higher education institutions (HEIs) in accomplishing sustainable development goals, this study aims to examine how and when sustainable leadership (SL) influences sustainable performance by examining social innovation (SI) as a mediating mechanism and managerial discretion (MD) as a boundary condition based on upper echelon theory. Design/methodology/approach This study is cross-sectional in nature. The authors adopted a cluster-sampling approach to collect data from 500 employees of HEIs in Pakistan and China. The response rate for this study was 52.63%. As the proposed model is complex, the authors used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the research hypothesis. Findings The empirical findings confirm the presence of SI as a competitive partial mediator between SL and sustainable performance. Nevertheless, the findings of this study do not suggest a higher positive effect of SL on SI in the presence of high MD. Research limitations/implications The study evaluated the role of SL and SI in fostering sustainable performance from the perspective of employees in HEIs in China and Pakistan. Before the empirical evidence can be generalized, there is a need to conduct similar studies in other parts of Asia and Western countries as well. Practical implications This study presents implications for higher education leaders and policymakers at the national level to foster the sustainable performance of their institutions. Social implications The current evidence reveals the effectiveness of SL in achieving the social goals of HEIs through SI.

10.1007/s40979-021-00075-9,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY,0401 Education,Responding to the COVID-19 emergency: student and academic staff perceptions of academic integrity in the transition to online exams at three Australian universities,"AbstractThis paper explores the perceptions of academic staff and students to student cheating behaviours in online exams and other online assessment formats. The research took place at three Australian universities in July and August 2020 during the emergency transition to online learning and assessment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study sought to inform decision making about the future of online exams at the participating universities. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using online surveys. The findings of the study led to seven key observations, most notably the need to redefine the characteristics of academic misconduct to account for changes wrought to examinations in a digital world. The study concludes with lessons learned in relation to enhancing academic integrity in digital examinations and assessments.","[{""name"": ""Alison Reedy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Darius Pfitzner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Rook"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leonie Ellis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.36690/2674-5208-2020-1-93-98"", ""10.25304/rlt.v28.2279"", ""10.1080/0013188032000133548"", ""10.1080/10508422.2014.978977"", ""10.1080/00405841.2017.1308173"", ""10.1023/A:1004181331049"", ""10.1186/s41039-017-0055-7"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1527892"", ""10.1080/03075079.2013.777406"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-079-7_58-1"", ""10.1007/s10805-014-9214-2"", ""10.1080/02602938.2020.1719975"", ""10.1080/07294360.2021.1872057"", ""10.1016/j.chbr.2020.100033"", ""10.1007/s10805-020-09367-0"", ""10.1080/07294360.2019.1680956"", ""10.1002/JAAL.00100"", ""10.3200/JECE.39.2.116-125"", ""10.1080/07294360.2020.1724899"", ""10.31234/osf.io/rjk7g"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4609.2008.00220.x"", ""10.1007/s10734-014-9761-x"", ""10.1016/j.system.2017.03.015"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-10020-6"", ""10.1186/s41239-016-0015-0"", ""10.1080/02602938.2014.956683"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.11.007"", ""10.1080/00049530412331283426"", ""10.1016/j.system.2020.102399"", ""10.1016/j.ijedro.2020.100012"", ""10.1016/j.jmir.2020.09.009"", ""10.19030/tlc.v7i11.253"", ""10.1080/21568235.2018.1541420"", ""10.1080/08923647.2017.1258628"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02229"", ""10.1177/0894439307313515"", ""10.1080/02602930701563104"", ""10.1111/bjet.12735"", ""10.24059/olj.v20i3.650"", ""10.1080/02602938.2010.488797"", ""10.1080/02602938.2020.1764907""]",['Social Sciences'],['Safety Research'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Emulating biological synaptic functions by electric devices for neuromorphic computation has been considered as a way to overcome the traditional von Neumann architecture in which separated memory and information processing units require high power consumption for their functions. Synaptic devices are expected to conduct complex signal processing such as image classification, decision‐making, and pattern recognition in artificial neural networks. Among various materials and device architectures for synaptic devices, 2D materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have been attracting tremendous attention from researchers based on their capacity to mimic unique synaptic plasticity for neuromorphic computing. Herein, the basic operations of biological synapses and physical properties of 2D materials are discussed, and then 2D materials and their vdW heterostructures for advanced synaptic operations with novel working mechanisms are reviewed. In particular, there is a focus on how to design synaptic devices with the vdW structures in terms of critical 2D materials and their limitations, providing insight into the emerging synaptic device systems and artificial neural networks with 2D materials.","[{""name"": ""Linfeng Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy Science Sungkyunkwan University  Suwon 16419 Korea""]}, {""name"":

This approach uses training data obtained through full‐wave EM simulations of a series of nanostructures to train geometric deep learning algorithms to assess the range of feasible responses as well as the feasibility of a desired response from a class of EM nanostructures. To facilitate the knowledge discovery, this approach combines the dimensionality reduction technique with convex‐hull and one‐class support‐vector‐machine (SVM) algorithms to find the range of the feasible responses in the latent response space of the EM nanostructure. More importantly, the one‐class SVM algorithm can be trained to provide the degree of feasibility of a response from a given nanostructure. This important information can be used to modify the initial structure to an alternative one that can enable an initially unfeasible response. To show the applicability of this approach, it is applied to two important classes of binary metasurfaces (MSs), formed by an array of plasmonic nanostructures, and periodic MSs formed by an array of dielectric nanopillars. These theoretical and experimental results confirm the unique features of this approach for knowledge discovery in EM nanostructures.","[{""name"": ""Yashar Kiarashinejad"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgia Institute of Technology  778 Atlantic Drive NW Atlanta GA 30332 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Mohammadreza Zandehshahvar"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgia Institute of Technology  778 Atlantic Drive NW Atlanta GA 30332 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Sajjad Abdollahramezani"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgia Institute of Technology  778 Atlantic Drive NW Atlanta GA 30332 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Omid Hemmatyar"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgia Institute of Technology  778 Atlantic Drive NW Atlanta GA 30332 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Reza Pourabolghasem"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgia Institute of Technology  778 Atlantic Drive NW Atlanta GA 30332 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Ali Adibi"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgia Institute of Technology  778 Atlantic Drive NW Atlanta GA 30332 USA""]}]","[""10.1088/1361-6633/aa8732"", ""10.1515/nanoph-2017-0129"", ""10.1002/adom.201801709"", ""10.1364/OPTICA.4.000139"", ""10.1038/nnano.2015.304"", ""10.1021/acsphotonics.5b00660"", ""10.1364/AOP.11.000518"", ""10.1364/OL.41.003451"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2017.93"", ""10.1038/ncomms15391"", ""10.1364/OL.42.001197"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aar2114"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.045901"", ""10.1002/lpor.201400157"", ""10.1109/TMAG.2003.816248"", ""10.1021/nn4057148"", ""10.23919/ACES49320.2020.9196200"", ""10.1515/nanoph-2018-0183"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-37952-2"", ""10.1021/acsnano.8b03569"", ""10.1364/OME.9.001842"", ""10.1364/OE.27.005874"", ""10.1063/1.5094838"", ""10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b03171"", ""10.1002/advs.201900128"", ""10.1109/JSTQE.2019.2933796"", ""10.1117/1.OE.58.6.065103"", ""10.1002/adma.201905467"", ""10.1364/OE.27.027523"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-12698-1"", ""10.1002/adts.201900088"", ""10.1039/C9NR07408B"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804441"", ""10.1016/j.jmva.2006.11.013"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2006.106"", ""10.1109/ICDM.2018.00033"", ""10.1126/science.1127647"", ""10.1145/235815.235821"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2017.142"", ""10.1073/pnas.1611740113"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-055630-7.50017-1""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Developmental Biology', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7511), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7356)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

These liquid alloys have the largest interfacial tension of any liquid at room temperature. The ability to modulate the tension offers the possibility to create forces that change the shape and position of small volumes of liquid metal. It has been known since the late 1800s that electrocapillarity—the use of potential to modulate the electric double layer on the surface of metals in electrolyte—lowers the interfacial tension of liquid metals. This phenomenon, however, can only achieve modest changes in interfacial tension since it is limited to potentials that avoid Faradaic reactions. A recent discovery suggests reactions driven by the electrochemical oxidation of gallium alloys cause the interfacial tension to decrease from ≈500 mN m−1 at 0 V to ≈0 mN m−1 at less than 1 V. This change in interfacial tension is reversible, controllable, and goes well‐beyond what is possible via conventional electrocapillarity or surfactants. This report aims to introduce beginners to this field and address misconceptions.

10.1111/bjet.12947,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Integrating interactive learner-immersed video-based virtual reality into learning and teaching of physical geography,"AbstractImmersive virtual reality (IVR) is regarded as one of the contemporary technological innovations with rich educational potential. As a subset of IVR, spherical video‐based IVR (SV‐IVR) immerses users centrally in a human‐recorded real‐world environment, allowing them to explore the environment in any directions via mobile phones and cardboard goggles. We have proposed a pedagogical framework—Learner‐Immersed Virtual Interactive Expedition (LIVIE), which leverages SV‐IVR to integrate immersive and interactive virtual inquiry‐based fieldwork into learning and teaching of physical geography. Besides discussing the design of LIVIE, this paper reports on the quasi‐experimental study that we carried out to evaluate its pedagogical effectiveness. The research subjects were 566 students from upper, middle and lower academic‐category secondary schools in Hong Kong. The study showed that LIVIE had different degrees of positive effects on the high, moderate and low academic‐achieving subjects. Our work not only provides evidence for supporting wider adoption of LIVIE in geography education, but it also sheds light on how to design and implement the pedagogical use of SV‐IVR in school education. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic There is an urgent need for seeking alternative teaching strategies to foster deeper learning and stimulate students’ motivation in geography education. IVR is a technological innovation with rich educational potential. Creating 3‐dimensional animation‐based IVR is quite costly, technically demanding and time‐consuming, thus impeding its widespread adoption in school education. The pedagogical use of SV‐IVR is an emerging research area in the domain of educational technology. What this paper adds SV‐IVR offers a pragmatic alternative to incorporate immersive virtual learning elements in the process of learning and teaching. LIVIE is a theoretically grounded pedagogical framework designed for learning and teaching of physical geography with the adoption of SV‐IVR and has been empirically implemented in different academic settings of formal schooling in Hong Kong. LIVIE has different degrees of positive pedagogical effects on high, moderate and low academic‐achieving students, respectively, with small, medium and medium effect sizes. Implications for practice and/or policy Researchers, instructional designers and technological developers are provided with scholarly and practical insights into designing immersive and interactive virtual environments with SV‐IVR for educational purposes. Educational policymakers and school administrators are provided with a concrete example of incorporating SV‐IVR in formal education. Teachers are provided with pragmatic in‐class and out‐of‐class strategies for integrating immersive and interactive virtual inquiry‐based fieldwork into learning and teaching of physical geography.","[{""name"": ""Morris Siu‐Yung Jong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chin‐Chung Tsai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haoran Xie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frankie Kwan‐Kit Wong"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780203872376"", ""10.1162/105474603322955950"", ""10.1111/bjet.12790"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103751"", ""10.1126/science.1127750"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.09.002"", ""10.4101/jvwr.v11i1.7298"", ""10.3102/0034654312457206"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1593200"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.009"", ""10.1080/09585176.2015.1018915"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44447-4_5"", ""10.1080/10494820.2015.1113710"", ""10.1145/3010915.3011001"", ""10.1080/00221340308978534"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1624579"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-5490-7"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2015.02.003"", ""10.1109/ISET.2018.00066"", ""10.1145/3041021.3054152"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-8126-4"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.04.006""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

For decades, there has been growing evidence of a relationship between metabolism and malignant cell proliferation. Unlike normal differentiated cells, cancer cells have reprogrammed metabolism in order to fulfill their energy requirements. These cells display crucial modifications in many metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and glutaminolysis, which include the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the electron transport chain (ETC), and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) [1]. Since the discovery of the Warburg effect, it has been shown that the metabolism of cancer cells plays a critical role in cancer survival and growth. More recent research suggests that the involvement of glutamine in cancer metabolism is more significant than previously thought. Glutamine, a nonessential amino acid with both amine and amide functional groups, is the most abundant amino acid circulating in the bloodstream [2]. This chapter discusses the characteristic features of glutamine metabolism in cancers and the therapeutic options to target glutamine metabolism for cancer treatment.","[{""name"": ""Ting Li"",

10.1186/s41239-020-00237-8,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Exploring the impact of Artificial Intelligence and robots on higher education through literature-based design fictions,"AbstractArtificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics are likely to have a significant long-term impact on higher education (HE). The scope of this impact is hard to grasp partly because the literature is siloed, as well as the changing meaning of the concepts themselves. But developments are surrounded by controversies in terms of what is technically possible, what is practical to implement and what is desirable, pedagogically or for the good of society. Design fictions that vividly imagine future scenarios of AI or robotics in use offer a means both to explain and query the technological possibilities. The paper describes the use of a wide-ranging narrative literature review to develop eight such design fictions that capture the range of potential use of AI and robots in learning, administration and research. They prompt wider discussion by instantiating such issues as how they might enable teaching of high order skills or change staff roles, as well as exploring the impact on human agency and the nature of datafication.","[{""name"": ""A.

10.1002/jee.20391,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Engineering stress culture: Relationships among mental health, engineering identity, and sense of inclusion","AbstractBackgroundStress is commonly experienced by college students, especially engineering students. However, the role of stress within engineering culture and its implications for engineering programs have not been fully explored in the literature.Purpose/HypothesisThe purpose of this study was to measure and examine the relationships among self‐reported stress, anxiety, and depression; engineering identity; and perceptions of inclusion of undergraduate engineering students.Design/MethodWe validated a quantitative survey instrument built on previously published scales and used it to measure self‐reported stress, anxiety, and depression; engineering identity; and perceptions of inclusion.ResultsOur findings indicate that self‐reported levels of stress, anxiety, and depression are high for engineering students. Further, levels of stress and anxiety are significantly higher for female students, while levels of depression are higher for first‐generation students. We find correlations between self‐reported mental health symptoms, engineering identity, and perceptions of inclusion, and these relationships differ by gender. Lastly, we find that students underrepresented in engineering rate their departments as less diverse than their peers.ConclusionsOur results suggest that perceptions of inclusion and engineering identity are related to student mental health, further emphasizing the importance of developing inclusive cultures in engineering programs. The findings suggest that mental health needs greater attention in engineering education, particularly for female and first‐generation students.","[{""name"": ""Karin J.

10.1007/s11191-021-00202-5,SCIENCE & EDUCATION,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0401 Education,"Computational Thinking, Between Papert and Wing","AbstractThe pervasiveness of Computer Science (CS) in today’s digital society and the extensive use of computational methods in other sciences call for its introduction in the school curriculum. Hence, Computer Science Education is becoming more and more relevant. In CS K-12 education, computational thinking (CT) is one of the abused buzzwords: different stakeholders (media, educators, politicians) give it different meanings, some more oriented to CS, others more linked to its interdisciplinary value. The expression was introduced by two leading researchers, Jeannette Wing (in 2006) and Seymour Papert (much early, in 1980), each of them stressing different aspects of a common theme. This paper will use a historical approach to review, discuss, and put in context these first two educational and epistemological approaches to CT. We will relate them to today’s context and evaluate what aspects are still relevant for CS K-12 education. Of the two, particular interest is devoted to “Papert’s CT,” which is the lesser-known and the lesser-studied. We will conclude that “Wing’s CT” and “Papert’s CT,” when correctly understood, are both relevant to today’s computer science education. From Wing, we should retain computer science’s centrality, CT being the (scientific and cultural) substratum of the technical competencies. Under this interpretation, CT is a lens and a set of categories for understanding the algorithmic fabric of today’s world. From Papert, we should retain the constructionist idea that only a social and affective involvement of students into the technical content will make programming an interdisciplinary tool for learning (also) other disciplines. We will also discuss the often quoted (and often unverified) claim that CT automatically “transfers” to other broad 21st century skills. Our analysis will be relevant for educators and scholars to recognize and avoid misconceptions and build on the two core roots of CT.","[{""name"": ""Michael Lodi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simone Martini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/1922681.1922682"", ""10.1145/3011071"", ""10.1145/367236.367262"", ""10.1145/1953163.1953241"", ""10.15388/ioi.2018.01"", ""10.1145/3106077"", ""10.1145/3059009.3059040"", ""10.1145/3105726.3106194"", ""10.1145/1516046.1516054"", ""10.1145/2447976.2447988"", ""10.1145/2998438"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11740.001.0001"", ""10.1145/63238.63239"", ""10.1145/3041047"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1786.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00029890.1974.11993624"", ""10.1080/10986065.2018.1403544"", ""10.1145/965754.965757"", ""10.1017/9781108654555"", ""10.1090/psapm/019/0235771"", ""10.1080/00029890.1968.11971015"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(80)90013-4"", ""10.1002/bs.3830120602"", ""10.3102/0013189X12463051"", ""10.2200/S00684ED1V01Y201511HCI033"", ""10.1145/3363181"", ""10.1145/1592440.1592442"", ""10.1007/s40309-016-0087-z"", ""10.15388/infedu.2018.14"", ""10.1145/2955114"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9992.001.0001"", ""10.1145/3381887"", ""10.1145/367415.993453"", ""10.1145/155360.155364"", ""10.1109/C-M.1977.217672"", ""10.1145/361532.361538"", ""10.1080/00029890.1974.11993556"", ""10.1007/s41979-019-00014-x"", ""10.15388/ioi.2020.09"", ""10.1080/09500690902792385"", ""10.1145/2713609.2713610"", ""10.1145/6138.6142"", ""10.1145/367177.367199"", ""10.1145/1460690.1460715"", ""10.1145/321574.321575"", ""10.1145/3231587"", ""10.1007/BF01966091"", ""10.1126/science.157.3795.1373-b"", ""10.1353/tech.2014.0031"", ""10.1147/sj.393.0720"", ""10.1016/0732-118X(84)90018-7"", ""10.1017/9781108654555.010"", ""10.1145/2750858.2804261"", ""10.1016/0732-118X(84)90019-9"", ""10.1145/2676723.2677238"", ""10.1037/edu0000314"", ""10.1145/1121341.1121482"", ""10.1145/800176.809944"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.09.003"", ""10.1201/b17764"", ""10.1145/2999541.2999542"", ""10.1145/3265747"", ""10.1007/s10639-015-9412-6"", ""10.1007/s10956-015-9581-5"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103646"", ""10.1145/1118178.1118215"", ""10.1098/rsta.2008.0118"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226902050.001.0001""]","['Computer Science', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Hardware and Architecture', 'Molecular Biology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

This study systematically reviewed how research on ML teaching and learning in K-12 has fared, including the current area of focus, and the gaps that need to be addressed in the literature in future studies. We reviewed 43 conference and journal articles to analyze specific focus areas of ML learning and teaching in K-12 from four perspectives as derived from the data: curriculum development, technology development, pedagogical development, and teacher training/professional development. The findings of our study reveal that (a) additional ML resources are needed for kindergarten to middle school and informal settings, (b) further studies need to be conducted on how ML can be integrated into subject domains other than computing, (c) most of the studies focus on pedagogical development with a dearth of teacher professional development programs, and (d) more evidence of societal and ethical implications of ML should be considered in future research. While this study recognizes the present gaps and direction for future research, these findings provide insight for educators, practitioners, instructional designers, and researchers into K-12 ML research trends to advance the quality of the emerging field.","[{""name"": ""Ismaila Temitayo Sanusi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Solomon Sunday Oyelere"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henriikka Vartiainen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jarkko Suhonen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markku Tukiainen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100099"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.006"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.9864"", ""10.1109/ISET49818.2020.00040"", ""10.3390/su12145568"", ""10.1007/s11528-021-00637-1"", ""10.1002/tea.10066"", ""10.1145/3491102.3502031."", ""10.1145/3311890.3311904"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x"", ""10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739219"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956136"", ""10.1109/TE.2008.930511"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-6747-6_7."", ""10.15388/infedu.2022.18"", ""10.1145/3202185.3210776"", ""10.1145/3466725.3466728"", ""10.1145/1134285.1134500"", ""10.1145/3341525.3393981"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i09.7061"", ""10.1145/3476034"", ""10.1145/3364510.3364520"", ""10.15388/infedu.2020.14"", ""10.1145/3408877.3439550"", ""10.1007/s10758-020-09453-7"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.11.005"", ""10.1109/TALE.2018.8615279"", ""10.1145/3434780.3436705"", ""10.6018/red.410121"", ""10.1145/3408877.3432393"", ""10.1145/3341525.3387364"", ""10.1109/TALE.2018.8615249"", ""10.1145/3446871.3469769"", ""10.1016/j.caeo.2021.100072"", ""10.1016/j.caeo.2022.100083"", ""10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274129"", ""10.1145/3340764.3345375"", ""10.1145/3159450.3159573"", ""10.1145/2325296.2325354"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100049"", ""10.1145/3336124"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097962"", ""10.1109/ICALT49669.2020.00099"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019795"", ""10.1145/2839509.2844620"", ""10.1177/14614448221079626"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2020.100182"", ""10.1080/09523987.2020.1848512"", ""10.1145/3392063.3394440"", ""10.1145/3290605.3300677"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019729"", ""10.1145/3392063.3394438"", ""10.1145/3331071"", ""10.1145/3311927.3323139""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

We introduce campus racial climate as a framework for conceptualizing the role of racial microaggressions (RMAs) as a contributing factor to the lack of representation of domestic students of color in STEM programs on college campuses. We analyze the experiences of students of color in STEM majors who have faced RMAs at the campus, academic, and peer levels. We draw from an online survey of more than 4800 students of color attending a large public university in the USA. The STEM major subsample is made up of 1688 students of color. The study estimates a series of Poisson regressions to examine whether one’s race, gender, or class year can be used to predict the likelihood of the regular occurrence of microaggressions. We also use interview data to further understand the challenges faced by STEM students of color.ResultsThe quantitative and qualitative data suggest that RMAs are not isolated incidents but are ingrained in the campus culture, including interactions with STEM instructors and advisers and with peers. Students of color experience RMAs at all three levels, but Black students in the STEM majors are more likely to experience RMAs than other students of color in the sample.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the need for campus officials, academic professionals, faculty members, and students to work together to address racism at the campus, academic, and peer levels. Additionally, STEM departments must address the impacts of the larger racial campus culture on their classrooms, as well as how departmental culture reinforces racial hostility in academic settings. Finally, our findings reveal the continued presence of anti-Black racism in higher education.","[{""name"": ""Meggan J. Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jasmine D.

10.1017/S0261444820000269,LANGUAGE TEACHING,0401 Education,Race and language teaching,"AbstractIn this review article on race and language teaching, we highlight an urgent need for the international educational community to continue to develop a complex understanding of how language teaching and learners’ lives are shaped by our global history of racist practices of colonial expansion, including settler colonialism and transatlantic slavery. We outline the genesis of research on race and language teaching and review literature that reflects a recent increase in scope and range of studies that problematize the workings of race and racism in language teaching and point to hopeful solutions for addressing effects of racial inequities. We conceptualize two key terms, ‘race’ and ‘language,’ then overview theories that appeared most significant in the research literature. We explore five interconnected themes that featured prominently throughout the existing literature on race and language teaching: standard language ideology and racial hegemony, the idealized and racialized native speaker, racial hierarchies of languages and language speakers, racialization and teacher identity, and race-centered approaches to pedagogies and educational practices. We offer a critical analysis of the current status of scholarship on race and language teaching, including gaps and necessary reframing, and conclude with implications for future directions and questions arising from the work.","[{""name"": ""Kerry Soo Von Esch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suhanthie Motha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ryuko Kubota"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1146/annurev-linguistics-011415-040434"", ""10.1080/15427587.2016.1165074"", ""10.1080/15427587.2010.521487"", ""10.58680/rte201527600"", ""10.17763/1943-5045-87.1.50"", ""10.1080/15348450903476840"", ""10.1111/0026-7902.00013"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95621-3_2"", ""10.1080/13613320701658464"", ""10.1177/0042085901363002"", ""10.1177/0957155815587246"", ""10.4324/9781351049672"", ""10.1002/tesq.195"", ""10.1002/tesj.286"", ""10.1080/15348431.2011.605686"", ""10.4324/9781315724225"", ""10.4324/9781410600790"", ""10.1080/13613324.2012.759924"", ""10.5749/9781452958460"", ""10.1016/j.linged.2017.12.002"", ""10.1080/1070289X.2011.672863"", ""10.2307/40264541"", ""10.2307/302821"", ""10.1177/0042085913478624"", ""10.1111/aeq.12076"", ""10.5212/MuitasVozes.v.1i2.0003"", ""10.1111/lnc3.12276"", ""10.18806/tesl.v20i2.946"", ""10.1080/15427587.2006.9650840"", ""10.1558/wap.v3i2.241"", ""10.4324/9780203880371"", ""10.1080/01434632.2014.892503"", ""10.1177/016146819509700104"", ""10.4324/9780203876657"", ""10.2307/40264540"", ""10.1111/j.1944-9720.2008.tb03281.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2014.12057.x"", ""10.1080/09636412.2010.513229"", ""10.1017/S0261444800006583"", ""10.1080/13613320802291132"", ""10.3998/mpub.8739"", ""10.1111/j.1557-203X.2012.01178.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2009.00982.x"", ""10.2307/3587669"", ""10.1080/15427580903118689"", ""10.1002/tesq.331"", ""10.2307/3588492"", ""10.1177/2332649214560440"", ""10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.149"", ""10.1002/tesq.114"", ""10.2307/817020"", ""10.2307/j.ctvfjcz3b"", ""10.1080/15348458.2016.1193440"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199573714.001.0001"", ""10.1080/15427587.2014.936243"", ""10.3102/0013189X16631750"", ""10.1080/13613324.2016.1150827"", ""10.3102/0091732X17690120"", ""10.1007/s11256-005-0018-y"", ""10.1002/9781444324068.ch12"", ""10.4324/9780203802755"", ""10.21832/9781783096800"", ""10.1108/SSRP-05-2017-0023"", ""10.2307/3587841"", ""10.1080/13670050408667807"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816674244.001.0001"", ""10.1057/9781137385765"", ""10.3138/cmlr.66.5.711"", ""10.4324/9780203973431"", ""10.1093/applin/amu045"", ""10.1080/1361332042000234295"", ""10.1007/s11256-013-0254-5"", ""10.1080/15348458.2013.835575"", ""10.1515/9783110220957.233"", ""10.2307/40264542"", ""10.21832/9781847692849-010"", ""10.1002/tesq.126"", ""10.1080/15348458.2018.1494598"", ""10.1080/13613324.2011.558894"", ""10.1007/s11256-008-0087-9"", ""10.4324/9780203961537"", ""10.1007/s11256-016-0370-0"", ""10.4324/9780203348802"", ""10.1080/01434632.2014.892497"", ""10.1017/S0266078411000344"", ""10.2307/40264544"", ""10.4324/9780203078051"", ""10.1177/0896920515569916"", ""10.1080/13613324.2010.488900"", ""10.58680/rte201527601"", ""10.2307/j.ctt5hjn6c"", ""10.58680/ee201829833"", ""10.1080/1554480X.2014.924005"", ""10.1080/15235882.2017.1405680"", ""10.1093/applin/amz033"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190625696.001.0001"", ""10.1080/15427587.2017.1285205"", ""10.2307/3588350"", ""10.1353/hpn.2014.0089"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-0897-7"", ""10.1080/13613324.2011.645569"", ""10.2307/40264543"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2013.05.001"", ""10.1080/15348450802237913"", ""10.1017/S004740451600083X"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190625696.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000004565,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Learning Through Listening: A Scoping Review of Podcast Use in Medical Education,"Purpose To improve understanding of podcast use in medical education by examining current research on descriptive attributes and educational outcomes, highlighting implications of the current evidence base for educational practices, and identifying research gaps to guide future investigation. Method The authors conducted a scoping review, searching PubMed and Embase databases in June–July 2020 for English-language studies of audio-only medical education podcast use in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education. The authors excluded studies without original data or with nonphysician data that could not be separated from physician data. From included studies, the authors extracted data regarding descriptive outcomes (e.g., podcast use, content areas, structure) and educational outcomes (classified using Kirkpatrick’s 4 levels of evaluation). Results Of 491 unique articles, 62 met inclusion criteria. Descriptive outcomes were reported in 44 studies. Analysis of these studies revealed podcast use has increased over time, podcasts are a top resource for resident education, and podcasts are being incorporated into formal medical curricula. Educational outcomes were reported in 38 studies. The 29 studies that assessed learner reaction and attitudes to podcasts (Kirkpatrick level 1) showed learners value podcasts for their portability, efficiency, and combined educational and entertainment value. The 10 studies that assessed knowledge retention (Kirkpatrick level 2) showed podcasts to be noninferior to traditional teaching methods. The 11 studies that assessed behavior change (Kirkpatrick level 3) showed improved documentation skills in medical students and self-reported practice change in residents and practicing physicians after listening to podcasts. None of the studies reported system change or patient outcomes (Kirkpatrick level 4). Conclusions Future research should focus on the optimal structure of podcasts for learning, higher-level outcomes of podcasts, and the implementation of podcasts into formal curricula. Podcasts may prove to be essential tools for disseminating and implementing the most current, evidence-based practices.","[{""name"": ""Jessica M. Kelly"", ""affiliation"": [""J.M.

10.1002/rrq.343,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,How the Reading for Understanding Initiative's Research Complicates the Simple View of Reading Invoked in the Science of Reading,"AbstractAdvocates of the science of reading have invoked the simple view of reading (SVR) to justify an approach that foregrounds decoding in early reading instruction. The SVR, which describes comprehension as the product of decoding and listening comprehension, also served as the primary theoretical model underlying the Reading for Understanding (RfU) initiative. Research funded under the RfU initiative included direct examinations of the validity of the SVR and the nature of its underlying components and extended the SVR in studies of middle school and high school readers. In this article, the authors use research conducted under the RfU initiative to examine the validity and utility of the SVR, in general, and the appropriateness of its application in the “science of reading” debate. RfU research has provided not only evidence in support of the overall SVR model but also important cautions relevant to the “science of reading” debate. In particular, RfU has provided evidence regarding the significance of the listening comprehension component of the SVR, often overlooked by advocates of the science of reading. This research has documented the importance of early oral language skills, which support both decoding and listening comprehension in young readers and plays a critical role in students’ success as readers as they move through school. In addition, RfU research has identified a complicated constellation of skills and knowledge that impact reading comprehension as students advance in school.","[{""name"": ""Gina N.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003524,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,From Theory to Practice: The Application of Cognitive Load Theory to the Practice of Medicine,"Cognitive load theory has become a leading model in educational psychology and has started to gain traction in the medical education community over the last decade. The theory is rooted in our current understanding of human cognitive architecture in which an individual’s limited working memory and unlimited long-term memory interact during the process of learning. Though initially described as primarily a theory of learning, parallels between cognitive load theory and broader aspects of medical education as well as clinical practice are now becoming clear. These parallels are particularly relevant and evident in complex clinical environments, like resuscitation medicine. The authors have built on these connections to develop a recontextualized version of cognitive load theory that applies to complex professional domains and in which the connections between the theory and clinical practice are made explicit, with resuscitation medicine as a case study. Implications of the new model for medical education are also presented along with suggested applications.","[{""name"": ""Adam Szulewski"", ""affiliation"": [""A.

10.1186/s41239-020-0179-5,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Examining learning engagement in MOOCs: a self-determination theoretical perspective using mixed method,"AbstractMOOCs as a learning approach are gaining popularity, and helping learners and instructors understand how learning engagement is constructed in a MOOC context is of increasing importance. Although previous research has undoubtedly enriched our knowledge of MOOCs, our understanding of student engagement in the MOOC context is still limited. This study adopts a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach to examine student engagement in MOOCs from the self-determination theory (SDT) perspective. A total of 693 valid responses to a MOOC Engagement-Motivation scale were collected and 82 MOOC participants were interviewed. The results showed significant differences between the MOOC completers and non-completers with respect to the rank of motivators for enrolment and the rank of learning activities for participation. The association between perceived competence and emotional engagement was significantly higher in the MOOC completion group. The results of a multiple regression analysis indicated that the SDT model can significantly predict student engagement. Perceived competence registered the largest positive impact, and perceived relatedness had a slight negative impact on engagement. The three components of engagement can also predict learners’ perceived learning. Emotional engagement showed the largest positive impact. However, logistic regression analysis indicated that these components of engagement poorly predicted MOOC learners’ completion. Qualitative analyses of student interview data revealed three main factors that can promote learners’ SDT needs: active learning, course resources, and instructor accessibility. Implications of the findings can help MOOC designers and educators to better engage their participants.","[{""name"": ""Min Lan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Khe Foon Hew"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/249763"", ""10.1109/TLT.2018.2859304"", ""10.14419/ijet.v7i4.15156"", ""10.1145/2566486.2568042"", ""10.1007/s11528-008-0153-x"", ""10.1145/2876034.2893437"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.01.011"", ""10.14742/ajet.3240"", ""10.1145/2531602.2531657"", ""10.1145/2567574.2567586"", ""10.5860/crln.74.10.9023"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_34"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027411"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v15i5.1841"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00331.x"", ""10.1145/2723576.2723606"", ""10.5944/openpraxis.7.2.194"", ""10.1145/2535918"", ""10.3102/00346543074001059"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0086-6"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.95.1.148"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-1270-1_4"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.05.004"", ""10.2307/798843"", ""10.1080/13614533.2013.851609"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2014.05.001"", ""10.1111/bjet.12235"", ""10.1111/bjet.12770"", ""10.1177/1525822X05282260"", ""10.1037/a0019682"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103771"", ""10.3102/0034654317740335"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v18i6.3087"", ""10.1007/s12528-016-9126-9"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.015"", ""10.1145/2460296.2460330"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.10.001"", ""10.4135/9781483385693"", ""10.1007/s11528-015-0871-9"", ""10.1006/jrpe.2000.2300"", ""10.1007/s10648-008-9082-7"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_3"", ""10.14742/ajet.3722"", ""10.1080/0158791010220208"", ""10.1080/02701367.1989.10607413"", ""10.1002/asi.20416"", ""10.1016/j.adolescence.2005.11.009"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v20i1.3709"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_1"", ""10.1007/s10459-011-9272-9"", ""10.1111/j.1350-4126.2005.00106.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_10"", ""10.1123/jtpe.31.3.231"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.85.4.571"", ""10.1037/a0012840"", ""10.1348/000709904X22359"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-8-45"", ""10.1108/RSR-03-2013-0015""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.24059/olj.v24i3.2066,ONLINE LEARNING,0401 Education,"Examining Students' Confidence to Learn Online, Self-Regulation Skills and Perceptions of Satisfaction and Usefulness of Online Classes","As online class offerings continue to proliferate and more students take at least one online class in college, more research is needed to explore factors that impact students’ perceptions of their online classes. Past research has found a positive relationship between students’ computer self-efficacy and their satisfaction with online learning, but little research has explored how learning management system and online learning self-efficacy relate to perceptions of satisfaction and perceived usefulness of online classes. In addition to confidence, students must also implement and apply their learning skills in an online environment; thus self-regulation and time management as well as past online learning experience are additional factors that have been shown to be related to satisfaction with and usefulness of online learning. This study explores how students’ confidence regarding their ability to use online learning platforms, utilize self-regulation strategies, and their confidence in their ability to learn in online classes predict both their satisfaction with and perceived usefulness of online classes. Multiple regression analyses revealed that students’ confidence to learn online was the strongest positive predictor of satisfaction and usefulness of online classes. The results indicate that exploring students’ purpose and reasons for taking online classes, beyond a students’ skill set and learning strategies, are fruitful directions to pursue when assessing evaluations of online classes.","[{""name"": ""Brittany Landrum"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s11409-020-09222-y,METACOGNITION AND LEARNING,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,Evaluating metacognitive self-reports: systematic reviews of the value of self-report in metacognitive research,"AbstractMetacognitive skills have been shown to be strongly associated with academic achievement and serve as the basis of many therapeutic treatments for mental health conditions. Thus, it is likely that training metacognitive skills can lead to improved academic skills and health and well-being. Because metacognition is an awareness of one’s own thoughts, and as such is not directly observable, it is often measured by self-report. This study reviews and critiques the use of self-report in evaluating metacognition by conducting systematic reviews and a meta-analysis of studies assessing metacognitive skills. Keyword searches were performed in EbscoHost, ERIC, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, Scopus, Web of Science, and WorldWideScience.org to locate all articles evaluating metacognition through self-report. 24,396 articles from 1982 through 2018 were screened for inclusion in the study. Firstly, a systematic review of twenty-two articles was conducted to review the ability of self-report measures to evaluate a proposed taxonomy of metacognition. Secondly, a systematic review and meta-analyses of 37 studies summarizes the ability of self-report to relate to metacognitive behavior and the possible effects of differences in research methods. Results suggest that self-reports provide a useful overview of two factors – metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive regulation. However, metacognitive processes as measured by self-report subscales are unclear. Conversely, the two factors of metacognition do not adequately relate to metacognitive behavior, but subscales strongly correlate across self-reports and metacognitive tasks. Future research should carefully consider the role of self-reports when designing research evaluating metacognition.","[{""name"": ""Kym Craig"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Hale"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Catherine Grainger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mary E.

10.1111/bjet.12790,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Effects of applying a VR-based two-tier test strategy to promote elementary students' learning performance in a Geology class,"AbstractScience and technology are driving people’s life changes, including education and the environment. Many scholars have attempted to import technology into the classroom to help students learn in different subjects. However, students often need assistance with unfamiliar learning approaches and learning environments. This study proposed a non‐immersive virtual reality (VR) guidance system combined with a two‐tier strategy to help students learn geology knowledge. Two groups of students used different learning approaches: the experimental group students were guided by the two‐tier test VR guidance system, and the control group students learned with the conventional VR guidance system. According to the experimental result, the two‐tier test VR guidance system not only improved the students’ learning achievement in natural science, but also enhanced their learning motivation. In addition, according to the sequential results, we found that VR learning materials or environmental resources can help students answer questions and solve problems more effectively.","[{""name"": ""Shao‐Chen Chang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ting‐Chia Hsu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wei‐Chen Kuo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Morris Siu‐Yung Jong"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511527685"", ""10.1080/10462939309366037"", ""10.5367/000000000101295255"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00981a"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2005.06.002"", ""10.1007/s11423-013-9323-4"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.004"", ""10.1080/08957347.2015.1064124"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.10.037"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.009"", ""10.1007/s10055-015-0280-6"", ""10.1007/s10055-006-0053-3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.11.015"", ""10.1080/09588221.2014.967701"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01102.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.02.016"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.008"", ""10.1007/s11423-017-9567-5"", ""10.1007/s11423-017-9540-3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.09.010"", ""10.1504/IJMLO.2014.067029"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.014"", ""10.2307/2529310"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.07.010"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00657a"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.018"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.593"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.01.009"", ""10.1023/A:1012061809603"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep2302_5"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/812/1/012117"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00812.x"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1558258"", ""10.1080/10494820.2017.1283334"", ""10.1016/0307-4412(91)90094-O"", ""10.1080/0950069880100204"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.08.008"", ""10.1080/09500690902951429"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.07.019"", ""10.1080/14703290903525838"", ""10.1016/j.jemermed.2014.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.021"", ""10.1109/MC.2005.297""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"
10.1111/hequ.12314,HIGHER EDUCATION QUARTERLY,0401 Education,E-learning? Never again! On the unintended consequences of COVID-19 forced e-learning on academic teacher motivational job characteristics,"AbstractDuring the COVID‐19 pandemic, universities worldwide are going into ‘emergency mode’—radically transforming education by switching to online and e‐learning education. In the face of these emergent changes, many academic teachers who are unwilling to use e‐learning or who lack the appropriate competences are suddenly being forced to teach via electronic devices and the Internet. But how will this COVID‐19 forced e‐learning influence academic teachers' motivation and performance? In this conceptual paper, drawing from Job Characteristics Theory—a model of human work motivation, we would like to discuss the possible changes in six motivational job characteristics of the academic teacher's job (task identity, task significance, skill variety, feedback, autonomy, social dimensions of the work) caused by COVID‐19 forced e‐learning. Our concise conceptual elaboration might spark a debate on the possible unintended consequences of COVID‐19 forced e‐learning.","[{""name"": ""Konrad Kulikowski"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Management University of Social Sciences Łódź Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Sylwia Przytuła"", ""affiliation"": [""Human Resource Management Department Wroclaw University of Economics and Business Wrocław Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Łukasz Sułkowski"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Higher Education Institutions Jagiellonian University Kraków Poland""]}]","[""10.1007/s10639-020-10219-y"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956349"", ""10.14569/IJACSA.2020.0110512"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00748"", ""10.1177/2042753018785180"", ""10.1080/13562510802334871"", ""10.1177/0047239520934018"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-08-2017-3106"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.1987.tb00605.x"", ""10.15239/j.brcacadje.2017.06.01.ja02"", ""10.1177/1059601115576425"", ""10.1007/s10734-004-0040-0"", ""10.1037/h0076546"", ""10.1016/0030-5073(76)90016-7"", ""10.1080/13562510903186774"", ""10.1111/puar.13116"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2014.02.001"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.5.1332"", ""10.1007/s13162-020-00161-0"", ""10.1057/s41307-019-00139-z"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2015.05.013"", ""10.1080/03043790802564046"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1809650"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.70.2.280"", ""10.1080/10494820.2012.680966"", ""10.1016/j.system.2020.102352"", ""10.18662/rrem/12.1sup2/242"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.91.6.1321"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.016"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199276813.003.0008"", ""10.1002/job.678"", ""10.1007/s10758-020-09446-6"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02007-6"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.5227"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v13i2.1161"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10117-3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.017"", ""10.1080/713611436"", ""10.53761/1.2.1.3"", ""10.4324/9780203075258"", ""10.2478/joim-2020-0029"", ""10.1007/s11761-020-00288-9"", ""10.1080/13562517.2018.1449739"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2016.08.007"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09978-0"", ""10.1177/0149206316654545"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-1428-6_431"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2014.992092""]",['Psychology'],"['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1002/tea.21693,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING,0401 Education,Developing deep learning in science classrooms: Tactics to manage epistemic uncertainty during whole-class discussion,"AbstractScience teachers usually view students' uncertainty as a barrier to overcome, a negative experience to be avoided, a deficiency in need of remedy. Building on the theory of deep learning in science as a generative and sensemaking process, the purpose of this design‐based study is to identify tactics for teachers to manage their students' epistemic uncertainty as a pedagogical resource to develop student conceptual understanding during whole‐class discussion. Classroom observations of whole‐class discussion were collected from six teachers' classes ranging from third to eighth grade. A total of 18 whole‐class discussions were collected, transcribed, and analyzed. A storyline talk to manage uncertainty during whole‐class discussion was developed and consisted of three stages: (1) Raise epistemic uncertainty through creating ambiguous conditions; (2) Maintain epistemic uncertainty through preventing immature disclosure and discussing alternative explanations or conflicting ideas; and (3) Reduce epistemic uncertainty through making coherent connections among current uncertainty, prior knowledge, and familiar phenomena. Seven nuanced tactics used by teachers to achieve each stage of uncertainty management were identified. The results suggest that managing uncertainty goes beyond asking questions and problematizing phenomena. When engaging students in storyline‐based whole‐class discussion, teachers should focus on one specific uncertainty and establish a coherent, consistent storyline that raises, maintains, and reduces student uncertainty to horizontally and vertically construct a collective knowledge among students. The horizontal nature occurs within a stage of management, and the vertical nature of a storyline talk is related to moving along from stage to stage. Through the storyline talk focusing on students' epistemic uncertainty, students can truly become agents in the learning process when the lesson is centered on and driven by students' uncertainty.","[{""name"": ""Ying‐Chih Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Teacher Preparation Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, Arizona State University  Tempe Arizona USA""]}, {""name"": ""Ratrapee Techawitthayachinda"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Teacher Preparation Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, Arizona State University  Tempe Arizona USA""]}]","[""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00042"", ""10.1080/00461520709336919"", ""10.1177/0022487114560646"", ""10.1207/s15327027hc1001_1"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-98125-3_5"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1301_1"", ""10.1007/s11858-017-0885-1"", ""10.1080/09500693.2011.645086"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2001.tb02891.x"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2001.tb02892.x"", ""10.1080/00461520.2014.916217"", ""10.1080/09500693.2014.924641"", ""10.1080/03057267.2020.1755803"", ""10.1002/trtr.1808"", ""10.1007/s11191-020-00111-z"", ""10.1002/sce.21527"", ""10.1007/s11165-015-9506-6"", ""10.1080/00368121.2014.915792"", ""10.1080/07370008.2016.1145120"", ""10.1080/09500693.2020.1813349"", ""10.1111/cogs.12626"", ""10.1002/tea.20171"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(200002)37:2<109::AID-TEA3>3.0.CO;2-7"", ""10.1207/S1532690XCI1903_3"", ""10.1002/tea.10041"", ""10.3102/0013189X032001009"", ""10.1002/1098-2736(200008)37:6<582::AID-TEA5>3.0.CO;2-L"", ""10.1080/10508400903452884"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2012.05.003"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.96.4.619"", ""10.1080/002202799183278"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep2302_6"", ""10.1207/S1532690XCI2004_1"", ""10.1007/s10648-015-9348-9"", ""10.1037/edu0000408"", ""10.1038/526638a"", ""10.3102/978-0-935302-43-1_11"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.08.005"", ""10.1007/s11251-016-9371-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511802157.009"", ""10.1080/01638539909545058"", ""10.1007/s10972-016-9467-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107706903"", ""10.1023/A:1026456101444"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2018.02.013"", ""10.1177/0022487118800706"", ""10.1023/B:EDPR.0000034022.16470.f3"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc.41.2.0169"", ""10.1080/10508406.2014.896254"", ""10.1080/0163853X.2012.722851"", ""10.1007/s11191-018-0019-3"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190871666.001.0001"", ""10.1080/07370000802212669"", ""10.1080/00461520.2016.1155457"", ""10.1002/sce.10024"", ""10.1080/00461520.2020.1784012"", ""10.1002/sce.20362"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-9041-7_57"", ""10.1007/s11165-010-9197-y"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2019.101785"", ""10.1002/tea.21600"", ""10.1002/tea.21147"", ""10.1002/sce.21504"", ""10.1159/000022695"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(85)90062-8"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2014.08.004"", ""10.1080/00461520.2015.1113134"", ""10.1080/07370008.2018.1496919"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.10.033"", ""10.1002/sce.21343"", ""10.1016/S0959-4752(00)00042-6"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.1996.tb10205.x"", ""10.1080/15544800701366563"", ""10.1002/tea.21381"", ""10.1002/sce.21274"", ""10.17763/haer.48.1.208101354lw53713"", ""10.1207/s1532690xci2202_3"", ""10.3102/978-0-935302-43-1_27"", ""10.1002/tea.21459"", ""10.1002/tea.21199"", ""10.1037/edu0000460"", ""10.1007/s10648-019-09499-9"", ""10.1002/sce.10032"", ""10.1002/sce.21452"", ""10.1787/b25efab8-en"", ""10.1002/tea.20345"", ""10.1098/rsta.2014.0455"", ""10.1007/s10972-014-9384-1"", ""10.1002/tea.21528"", ""10.1126/science.1182595"", ""10.1002/tea.21477"", ""10.1159/000271225"", ""10.1002/sce.3730660207"", ""10.1080/07370000801980779"", ""10.1080/00461520903028990"", ""10.1007/s11165-018-9725-8"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls0203_1"", ""10.1002/tea.20408"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199609)33:7<709::AID-TEA2>3.0.CO;2-R"", ""10.1177/1065912907313077"", ""10.1002/tea.21621"", ""10.1038/s41562-019-0793-1"", ""10.1037/edu0000483"", ""10.1177/030631285015003001"", ""10.1002/sce.21588"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.01.021"", ""10.3102/0013189X20932480"", ""10.1002/tea.21152"", ""10.1080/0950069980200403"", ""10.1016/0959-4752(94)90018-3"", ""10.3138/9781442681859"", ""10.1086/697531"", ""10.1002/sce.10036"", ""10.1080/00461520903433554"", ""10.1007/s11251-020-09503-8"", ""10.1007/s10649-005-0606-5"", ""10.1002/tea.21077""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

The working group of the current study consists of 65 teachers. The data were collected via an open-endedwritten interview. Content analysis was applied for analysis of the data gathered. Various important results regarding the use of distance education were obtained during the pandemic period and yielded significant findings. The first and the most important finding is that theachers have difficulties in internet access and lack of infrastructure, classroom management and human resources. Another challenge that participants reported was about teachers’ and students’ behaviours. The last theme stated by the participants is the distance education process itself. The findings reveal that the participants determined their strategies to deal with these problems with new arrangements regarding the classroom management, getting help from colleagues, family members and experts and communicating with students and parents. It can be certainly suggested that the participants are not ready for the distance education process and there is a lack of application in this regard; such as technology support and distance education training, and moreover, the participants do not have sufficient knowledge and experience about distance education.","[{""name"": ""Tamer Sari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Funda Nayır"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Robot‐assisted surgeries offer many benefits over the conventional approach including lower risk of infection and blood loss, shorter recovery, and an overall safer procedure for patients. The past few decades have shown many emerging surgical robotic platforms that can work in complex and confined channels of the internal human organs and improve the cognitive and physical skills of the surgeons during the operation. Advanced technologies for sensing, actuation, and intelligent control have enabled multiple surgical devices to simultaneously operate within the human body at low cost and with more efficiency. Despite advances, current surgical intervention systems are not able to execute autonomous tasks and make cognitive decisions that are analogous to those of humans. Herein, the historical development of surgery from conventional open to robotic‐assisted approaches with discussion on the capabilities of advanced intelligent systems and devices that are currently implemented in existing surgical robotic systems is reviewed. Also, available autonomous surgical platforms are comprehensively discussed with comments on the essential technologies, existing challenges, and suggestions for the future development of intelligent robotic‐assisted surgical systems toward the achievement of fully autonomous operation.","[{""name"": ""Mai Thanh Thai"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering Faculty of Engineering UNSW  Kensington Campus Sydney NSW 2052 Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Phuoc Thien Phan"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering Faculty of Engineering UNSW  Kensington Campus Sydney NSW 2052 Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Trung Thien Hoang"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering Faculty of Engineering UNSW  Kensington Campus Sydney NSW 2052 Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Shing Wong"", ""affiliation"": [""Prince of Wales Hospital  Randwick Sydney NSW 2031 Australia"", ""Faculty of Medicine UNSW  Kensington Campus Sydney NSW 2052 Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Nigel H.

10.1111/medu.14381,MEDICAL EDUCATION,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,A review to characterise and map the growth mindset theory in health professions education,"AbstractIntroductionGrowth mindset is a motivation theory proposed by Carol Dweck that posits our beliefs about intelligence, and the ability to change mindsets can have impacts on how we approach challenges, respond to criticism challenges and orient our goals. This study characterised articles on growth mindset theory in health professions education to: summarise the aspects of growth mindset being researched, describe the discussed benefits of growth mindset theory and outline strategies discussed that may promote a growth mindset.MethodsA systematic review of the literature yielded 4927 articles—articles were reviewed and excluded if they were outside of health professions education and did not discuss Dweck's growth mindset theory. The final review yielded 14 research articles and 13 commentaries, which were characterised and analysed using content analysis.ResultsThe included articles were published in 2016 and beyond; the articles represented a diverse context, participant type and approach. Most research studies measured participant mindsets and evaluated the correlation with other variables (eg grit, well‐being, anxiety). Articles often highlighted benefits and strategies to promote a growth mindset at the learner, educator and organisation level. The most common learner benefits were to help them be more receptive to feedback as well as increased resiliency and perseverance, educator benefits focused on supporting collaborative relationships and safe learning environments. The most prevalent strategies discussed were teaching learners about growth mindset theory, shifting faculty feedback to emphasise effort and to prioritise feedback across the organisation.ConclusionThe growth mindset framework has been shown in other fields to help others manage educational challenges and enhance learning environments. Researchers are encouraged to explore how interventions such as teaching about and prioritising a growth mindset can support learners, health care professionals, educators and organisations.","[{""name"": ""Michael D.

10.1111/bjet.13212,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,"The post-COVID-19 future of digital learning in higher education: Views from educators, students, and other professionals in six countries","AbstractPredictions about the post‐pandemic future of digital learning vary among higher education scholars. Some foresee dramatic, revolutionary change while others speculate that growth in educational technology will be buffeted both by modest expansion and unevenness. To this debate we contribute evidence from four groups across six countries on four continents: college and university educators (n = 281), students (n = 4243), senior administrators (n = 15), and instructional design specialists (n = 43). Our focus is on the future of digital learning after the pandemic‐induced pivot to emergency remote instruction. Using data from interviews and self‐administered questionnaires, our findings reveal a high degree of congruency between respondent groups, with most envisioning more blended/hybrid instruction post‐pandemic and some modest increases in fully online courses. Student opinion is more sceptical about future change than within the other groups. Among respondents in all groups there is little expectation for a full‐blown, revolutionary change in online or digital learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Digital learning has been growing in higher education, although a digital disconnect continues whereby the availability of educational technology exceeds its application to learning. Expectations regarding technology‐mediated learning post‐COVID‐19 are mixed, hampering planning for the future. Hesitancy about teaching or taking courses with some or full online components persists. What this paper adds A strong majority of respondents in higher education foresee the most growth in blended/hybrid forms of digital learning post‐COVID‐19. A solid percentage, between about two‐thirds and three‐quarters of faculty and students, envision learners and instructors taking or teaching more fully online courses post‐pandemic. A strong congruency exists between faculty, students, senior administrators, and instructional design professionals in their ranking of scenarios for the future of digital learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technology in higher learning will not return to a pre‐COVID‐19 normality—if a pre‐COVID‐19 ‘normal’ could even be defined. As post‐pandemic institutional planning unfolds, it is important to reflect experiences and incorporate insights of instructors, students, and instructional designers. Successfully building on these insights, where more blended/hybrid learning is foreseen, requires a thoughtful integration of face‐to‐face learning and educational technology.","[{""name"": ""Neil Guppy"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology University of British Columbia  Vancouver British Columbia Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Dominique Verpoorten"", ""affiliation"": [""Didactics and Teacher Training Unit Université de Liège  Liège Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""David Boud"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Research in Assessment and Digital Learning Deakin University  Burwood Victoria Australia"", ""University of Technology Sydney  Sydney New South Wales Australia"", ""Middlesex University  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Lin Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Learning Technologies University of North Texas  Denton Texas USA""]}, {""name"": ""Joanna Tai"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Research in Assessment and Digital Learning Deakin University  Burwood Victoria Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Silvia Bartolic"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sociology University of British Columbia  Vancouver British Columbia Canada""]}]","[""10.1007/s10758‐020‐09477‐z"", ""10.1080/00131911.2021.1955830"", ""10.1007/s11423‐020‐09809‐x"", ""10.1080/2159676X.2019.1628806"", ""10.5430/ijhe.v10n3p285"", ""10.1177/016146819309500202"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1815702"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1859681"", ""10.1007/BF02504683"", ""10.5334/jime.575"", ""10.1007/s10734‐021‐00781‐w"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103857"", ""10.1080/17439884.2019.1656235"", ""10.1080/13523260.2020.1761749"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-4914-9_1"", ""10.1111/bjet.13112"", ""10.1177/003172170208300614"", ""10.1177/0022487116687738"", ""10.20944/preprints202004.0290.v1"", ""10.1080/07294360.2019.1598338"", ""10.1007/s10648‐004‐0007‐9"", ""10.1007/s10734‐020‐00561‐y"", ""10.1038/d41586‐020‐01518‐y""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.30827/portalin.vi40.27061,PORTA LINGUARUM,0401 Education,The impact of blended learning-based scaffolding techniques on learners' self-efficacy and willingness to communicate,"Motivating learners to engage in effective communication is one of the fundamental concerns of language education. Accordingly, an educational context where L2 learners display a willingness to communicate (WTC) is a requirement for successful learning. A further concept that should be studied regarding WTC is students' self-efficacy from the socio-cognitive theory. Moreover, to boost the quality of learning, English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students should receive effective support, including scaffolding that motivates them to build up their knowledge in Blended Learning (BL) settings. To examine BL-based scaffolding techniques on students’ self-efficacy and WTC, this quasi-experimental design involving 232 participants were assigned to the experimental and the control groups including both intermediate and advanced learners. Subsequently, the self-efficacy questionnaire, and WTC questionnaires were distributed among them as a pretest. The statistical results of Two two-way ANCOVA tests showed that both language proficiency and the treatment type are the significant moderators of the efficacy scores. The experimental group outperformed the control group and the advanced learners outperformed the intermediate ones. In addition, the results indicated that while language proficiency did not moderate the WTC scores, the treatment type was the significant moderator of the WTC scores.","[{""name"": ""Yunxian Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yongliang Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""José Luis Ortega-Martín"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Psychology'],['Developmental and Educational Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

Subsequently, cancer patients have a wide range of needs. This study aims to identify and synthesise cancer patients’ views about areas where they need support throughout their care. A systematic search of the literature from PsycInfo, Embase and Medline databases was conducted, and a narrative. Synthesis of results was carried out using the Corbin &amp; Strauss “3 lines of work” framework. For each line of work, a group of key common needs were identified. For illness-work, the key needs idenitified were; understanding their illness and treatment options, knowing what to expect, communication with healthcare professionals, and staying well. In regards to everyday work, patients wanted to maintain a sense of normalcy and look after their loved ones. For biographical work, patients commonly struggled with the emotion impact of illness and a lack of control over their lives. Spiritual, sexual and financial problems were less universal. For some types of support, demographic factors influenced the level of need reported. While all patients are unique, there are a clear set of issues that are common to a majority of cancer journeys. To improve care, these needs should be prioritised by healthcare practitioners.","[{""name"": ""Madeleine Evans Webb"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth Murray"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zane William Younger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry Goodfellow"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jamie Ross"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11606-009-0993-x"", ""10.1002/1099-1611(200101/02)10:1<19::AID-PON501>3.0.CO;2-6"", ""10.1002/cncr.23448"", ""10.1016/j.ejon.2012.07.010"", ""10.1200/JCO.2005.04.2846"", ""10.1097/01.PSY.0000077503.96903.A6"", ""10.1001/jama.283.22.2975"", ""10.1186/s13643-017-0644-y"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-9-59"", ""10.1016/S0738-3991(02)00183-0"", ""10.1097/00006199-198609000-00005"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03407.x"", ""10.1016/j.ejon.2015.03.004"", ""10.1007/s11764-014-0345-7"", ""10.1007/s00520-016-3327-7"", ""10.1300/J077v26n02_01"", ""10.1016/j.ejon.2015.07.006"", ""10.1002/pon.3068"", ""10.1002/cncr.22357"", ""10.1007/s00520-010-0966-y"", ""10.1007/s00520-011-1181-1"", ""10.1016/j.ejon.2010.01.024"", ""10.1038/sj.bjc.6605235"", ""10.1002/pon.1577"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19971015)80:8<1518::AID-CNCR21>3.0.CO;2-7"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2354.2011.01270.x"", ""10.1002/pon.1065"", ""10.1186/1477-7525-10-133"", ""10.1007/s00520-010-0939-1"", ""10.1186/1471-2407-3-12"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2013.03.011"", ""10.1007/s00520-002-0354-3"", ""10.1016/j.ejon.2015.06.001"", ""10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181eff008"", ""10.1007/s13187-015-0887-z"", ""10.1188/10.CJON.765-770"", ""10.1111/ecc.12159"", ""10.1177/1043454204269606"", ""10.1002/pon.3887"", ""10.1007/s00520-010-0973-z"", ""10.1111/ecc.12181"", ""10.2217/fon.12.97"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03278.x"", ""10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.07.008"", ""10.1089/jayao.2012.0029"", ""10.1016/j.ejon.2010.01.024"", ""10.1191/0269216304pm837oa"", ""10.1200/JCO.2007.12.4362"", ""10.1188/09.ONF.E31-E38"", ""10.1177/1049909106295773"", ""10.1097/HNP.0000000000000070"", ""10.1188/06.ONF.729-735"", ""10.1089/jpm.2013.0569"", ""10.1097/00002820-200308000-00002"", ""10.1111/ecc.12200"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2004.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2016.10.008"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02768.x"", ""10.1007/s00520-009-0615-5"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000101)88:1<226::AID-CNCR30>3.0.CO;2-P""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Oncology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3991/ijep.v10i6.16205,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING PEDAGOGY,0401 Education,Remote Knowledge Acquisition and Assessment During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"On 16 March 2020, as a result of the unprecedented global health crisis linked to the emergence of a new form of coronavirus (COVID-19), the 74 universities of France closed their doors, forcing nearly 1.6 million students, as well as their teachers, to find solutions and initiatives that could ensure continuity in teaching. In the reliance on videoconferencing tools, chat, the sharing of documents/tutorials/videos/podcasts, and the use of social networks, many ideas have emerged, but no consensus has developed nor has a common way of doing things been adopted by a majority of teachers. Some software tools, such as Zoom, have also been questioned over data security issues or excessive intrusion into the student learning process. Nevertheless, in these uncertain times, much had to be done so that students can acquire the requisite knowledge, develop skills, and build on what they have learned. How can we ensure that the learning process is as smooth as possible for everyone involved? How can we evaluate knowledge and skills learned at a distance, and their relevance? Four groups of electronic and electrical engineering students in France were monitored during the containment period in order to provide answers to these questions. Lectures, tutorials, practical work, and projects were carried out using the Microsoft Teams and Zoom video conferencing and chat tools to complement activities made available through the digital work environment. In order to ensure equity among all students, especially in view of the digital divide, open access tools/software/applications have been promoted. In the various surveys completed, the engineering students asserted their complete satisfaction with the learning process, the use of distance tools, and the level of mastery of these tools by their teachers. The results of the various knowledge tests show that, for the same course, distance learning does not reduce the performance of the engineering students. Indeed, they obtained local grades similar to those expected in face-to-face teaching. The results presented in this article are not intended to highlight the virtues of distance education, but rather to open up a debate and reflect more widely on the sustainability of this transformation of education in universities.","[{""name"": ""Sébastien Jacques"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdeldjalil Ouahabi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thierry Lequeu"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The authors build on theory and research in teacher on-the-job discourse and learning in order to (a) argue that, as a field, we need to pay more focused and systematic attention to teacher on-the-job discourse; (b) offer a coherent conceptual framework for “pedagogically productive” teacher talk; and (c) highlight key research directions and challenges in investigating this and related phenomena.","[{""name"": ""Adam Lefstein"", ""affiliation"": [""Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Dana Vedder-Weiss"", ""affiliation"": [""Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Aliza Segal"", ""affiliation"": [""Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel""]}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226189666.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9620.00168"", ""10.1080/10508406.2014.999196"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610554"", ""10.17763/1943-5045-88.3.308"", ""10.1287/orsc.2.1.40"", ""10.3102/0091732X024001249"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674062788"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2015.01.003"", ""10.1080/0141192052000310029"", ""10.1086/597001"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2015.06.001"", ""10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.172"", ""10.1525/aa.1994.96.3.02a00100"", ""10.1111/0161-4681.00140"", ""10.3102/0013189X13512674"", ""10.1177/016146811011200109"", ""10.1177/0022487116676315"", ""10.3102/0002831215573773"", ""10.3102/0002831209345158"", ""10.1177/0022487108324330"", ""10.1177/0022487115614617"", ""10.3102/0162373713519496"", ""10.1177/0022487100051003011"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2019.102954"", ""10.1177/0022487109347319"", ""10.1177/016146819009100403"", ""10.1016/S0742-051X(02)00052-5"", ""10.1177/016146810310500601"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2015.10.001"", ""10.1086/444197"", ""10.3102/00028312033004757"", ""10.1080/00098650903505498"", ""10.1086/648981"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2016.06.007"", ""10.3102/978-0-935302-43-1"", ""10.3102/0002831215585562"", ""10.1016/0742-051x(92)90009-r"", ""10.1002/sce.20131"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2019.102913"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.11.018"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511499944"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2003.08.001"", ""10.58680/ee201322152"", ""10.1002/9781405186407.wbiect016"", ""10.1177/0022487117751125."", ""10.1016/j.tate.2011.09.005"", ""10.1177/0022487114534266"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2015.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2018.01.002"", ""10.1177/0022487119841895"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2007.01.004"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0750-z"", ""10.3102/0034654308330970"", ""10.1080/10508406.2011.553258""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Twisted fibers can be used in powerful artificial muscles and can convert volume expansion upon stimuli into torsional rotation or axial contraction due to their spiral structure. Upon twist insertion, torsional stress is produced in the fiber, and fiber volume expansion increases the torsional stress, resulting in fiber untwisting. By inserting twist to form a self‐coiled fiber, fiber volume expansion causes the contraction of this self‐coiled fiber if the fiber is torsionally tethered. Fiber‐based artificial muscles have potential applications in a variety of fields such as temperature‐regulating clothing, soft robots, prosthetics, and exoskeletons. Herein, the recent progress in twisted‐fiber artificial muscles with different actuation stimuli, such as thermal, photo, solvent adsorption or infiltration, and electrochemical, is reviewed. The opportunities and challenges for twisted‐fiber artificial muscles are also discussed. Therefore, this review provides an insight for designing high‐performance and multi‐functional twisted‐fiber artificial muscles and motivates the development and applications of fiber‐based artificial muscle in future research.","[{""name"": ""Xueqi Leng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology College of Chemistry and College of Pharmacy Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoyu Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology College of Chemistry and College of Pharmacy Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Wubin Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology College of Chemistry and College of Pharmacy Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Baigang An"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering University of Science and Technology Liaoning  Anshan 114051 China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiang Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Science Pharmaceutical University  Nanjing 210009 China""]}, {""name"": ""Zunfeng Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology College of Chemistry and College of Pharmacy Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China"", ""School of Chemical Engineering University of Science and Technology Liaoning  Anshan 114051 China""]}]","[""10.1126/science.284.5418.1340"", ""10.1002/adma.201303432"", ""10.1016/S1748-0132(08)70062-8"", ""10.1557/mrs2009.179"", ""10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70048-2"", ""10.1073/pnas.1605273113"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/22/10/104022"", ""10.1002/adma.201904093"", ""10.1126/science.1211220"", ""10.1002/adma.201305708"", ""10.1126/science.1246906"", ""10.1038/nature08863"", ""10.1039/C6RA25024F"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b02335"", ""10.1126/science.aax6182"", ""10.1126/science.aaw3722"", ""10.1126/science.aaw2502"", ""10.1126/science.aaw2403"", ""10.1126/science.aam8771"", ""10.1126/science.1104276"", ""10.1126/science.1226762"", ""10.1242/jeb.032326"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2008.03.024"", ""10.1002/adfm.201808241"", ""10.1039/C6NR06185K"", ""10.1016/0032-3861(70)90030-3"", ""10.1109/JMEMS.2002.1007394"", ""10.1146/annurev.ph.55.030193.002523"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2013.11.084"", ""10.1063/1.1729603"", ""10.1038/nnano.2015.198"", ""10.1007/s10118-019-2245-9"", ""10.1002/ange.201507108"", ""10.1088/1674-1056/ab7745"", ""10.1021/nl500526r"", ""10.1002/adma.201700870"", ""10.1002/smll.201801883"", ""10.1039/C7CC03408C"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b05136"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989150"", ""10.1016/S1369-7021(10)70128-0"", ""10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2013.04.003"", ""10.1126/science.287.5454.836"", ""10.1109/TIE.2014.2316255"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2013.2280964"", ""10.1109/TRO.2019.2894371""]",['Engineering'],"['Biomedical Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1111/medu.14154,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Psychological safety in feedback: What does it look like and how can educators work with learners to foster it?,"AbstractContextFeedback conversations play a central role in health professions workplace learning. However, learners face a dilemma: if they engage in productive learning behaviours (such as asking questions, raising difficulties, offering opinions or contesting ideas), they risk exposing their limitations or offending the educator. This highlights the importance of psychological safety in encouraging learners to candidly engage in interactive dialogue and the co‐construction of knowledge. Previous research has recommended that building safety, trust or an educational alliance is key to productive feedback encounters. Yet it is unclear how to translate this into practice. Hence our research question was: What does psychological safety look like in workplace feedback and how can educators work with learners to foster it?MethodsWe analysed 36 videos of routine formal feedback episodes in clinical practice involving diverse health professionals. A psychologically safe learning environment was inferred when learners progressively disclosed information and engaged in productive learning behaviours during the conversation. We used thematic analysis to identify associated educator strategies, which seemed to promote psychological safety.ResultsFour themes were identified: (a) setting the scene for dialogue and candour; (b) educator as ally; (c) a continuing improvement orientation, and (d) encouraging interactive dialogue. Educators approaches captured within these themes, seemed to foster a psychologically safe environment by conveying a focus on learning, and demonstrating respect and support to learners.ConclusionsThis study builds on claims regarding the importance of psychological safety in feedback by clarifying what psychological safety in workplace feedback conversations might look like and identifying associated educator approaches. The results may offer educators practical ways they could work with learners to encourage candid dialogue focused on improving performance.","[{""name"": ""Christina E.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003478,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Medical Students Are Not Essential Workers: Examining Institutional Responsibility During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) released a joint statement in March 2020 recommending an immediate suspension of medical student participation in direct patient contact. As graduating medical students who will soon begin residency, the authors fully support this recommendation. Though paid health care workers, like residents, nurses, and environmental services staff, are essential to the management of COVID-19 patients, medical students are not. Students’ continued involvement in direct patient care will contribute to SARS-CoV-2 exposures and transmissions and will waste already limited personal protective equipment. By decreasing nonessential personnel in health care settings, including medical students, medical schools will contribute to national and global efforts to “flatten the curve.” The authors also assert that medical schools are responsible for ensuring medical student safety. Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles. Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to “flatten the curve” supersedes usual teaching responsibilities. Therefore, the authors request further guidance from the LCME and AAMC regarding curricular exemptions/alternatives and adjusted graduation timelines. The pool of graduating medical students affected by this pause in direct patient contact represents a powerful reserve, which may soon need to be used as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the U.S. health care infrastructure.","[{""name"": ""Anitha Menon"", ""affiliation"": [""is a fourth-year MD–MPH student, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.""]}, {""name"": ""Edwin J.

10.1002/cae.22318,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Education in times of crisis: Rapid transition to distance learning,"AbstractThe COVID‐19 crisis is having a significant impact on the quality of life and future of young people; it can also lead to disruption in education. A disruption would pose a severe threat to the entire society in the postcrisis period. Therefore, educational institutions must respond quickly and ensure the continuity of the educational processes. Our research goal has been to develop and implement a model enabling a rapid transition from the traditional to the distance learning model in a state of emergency. Our focus has been on conceiving technical, organizational, and pedagogical changes that educational organizations need to implement to enable different interaction methods, ensure continuity, and provide high‐quality education. We have defined and implemented a model, which is described in detail in this paper, thus giving guidelines for a rapid transition to distance learning, which is not restricted to the crisis times only. We have evaluated our approach by monitoring the IT solutions and surveying students and teachers at the School of Computing, Union University of Belgrade.

10.3390/educsci12080569,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Artificial Intelligence and Learning Analytics in Teacher Education: A Systematic Review,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics (LA) have been introduced into the field of education, where their use has great potential to enhance the teaching and learning processes. Researchers have focused on applying these technologies to teacher education, as they see the value of technology for educating. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on AI and LA in teacher education is necessary to understand their impact in the field. Our methodology follows the PRISMA guidelines, and 30 studies related to teacher education were identified. This review analyzes and discusses the several ways in which AI and LA are being integrated in teacher education based on the studies’ goals, participants, data sources, and the tools used to enhance teaching and learning activities. The findings indicate that (a) there is a focus on studying the behaviors, perceptions, and digital competence of pre- and in-service teachers regarding the use of AI and LA in their teaching practices; (b) the main data sources are behavioral data, discourse data, and statistical data; (c) machine learning algorithms are employed in most of the studies; and (d) the ethical clearance is mentioned by few studies. The implications will be valuable for teachers and educational authorities, informing their decisions regarding the effective use of AI and LA technologies to support teacher education.","[{""name"": ""Sdenka Salas-Pilco"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education, Central China Normal University, Wuhan 430079, China""]}, {""name"": ""Kejiang Xiao"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Research Center for Educational Informatization, Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education, Central China Normal University, Wuhan 430079, China""]}, {""name"": ""Xinyun Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education and Human Development, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China""]}]","[""10.7717/peerj.7702"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grab019"", ""10.1111/bjet.12952"", ""10.5944/ried.23.2.26377"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.11.010"", ""10.1111/jcal.12554"", ""10.1007/s10758-018-9388-6"", ""10.1186/s41039-017-0062-8"", ""10.1002/9781118784235"", ""10.1186/s41239-022-00326-w"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988510"", ""10.1109/AIEEE.2017.8270532"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00284-9"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9615-9"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2019.1625867"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10439-w"", ""10.1111/bjet.12748"", ""10.1080/03054985.2021.1853934"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-39478-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-27602-7"", ""10.3102/0013189X14528752"", ""10.1186/2046-4053-4-1"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2021.1902383"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/202129701067"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103670"", ""10.1109/TE.2019.2925253"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00249-z"", ""10.1177/0162643420973216"", ""10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2749569"", ""10.1145/3313831.3376418"", ""10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8102410"", ""10.1007/s10758-021-09522-5"", ""10.1177/1046878120962152"", ""10.3389/feduc.2020.502698"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104052"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.008"", ""10.1111/bjet.12590"", ""10.3389/frai.2021.668220"", ""10.24191/ajue.v17i3.14499"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1660996"", ""10.1109/T4E.2019.00021"", ""10.1007/s10956-020-09865-1"", ""10.1111/bjet.13040"", ""10.1007/s10758-020-09460-8"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00441"", ""10.3991/ijet.v16i16.17891"", ""10.1080/10447318.2020.1848163"", ""10.1080/02619768.2011.587116"", ""10.12973/eu-jer.8.1.181"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103941"", ""10.1177/0022057418811128"", ""10.1080/09523987.2019.1583461"", ""10.1007/s42979-021-00635-3"", ""10.3390/app11010237"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106552"", ""10.70725/560948mgghtd"", ""10.1080/23299460.2021.1955613"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104285"", ""10.1145/3399971.3399984"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103862"", ""10.1007/s10676-018-9492-2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.02.003"", ""10.4018/IJMBL.2018040105"", ""10.4324/9781315523293-18"", ""10.1145/3506860.3506861"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-8431-5"", ""10.18608/hla22.001"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100076"", ""10.1080/21532974.2011.10784684"", ""10.1177/1477878518805308"", ""10.1145/3386392.3397593"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-8161-4"", ""10.1145/3386392.3397603"", ""10.1007/s40593-021-00239-1"", ""10.1080/01587919.2019.1656153""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.14742/ajet.7945,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,"What is the metaverse? Definitions, technologies and the community of inquiry","The term metaverse appeared for the first time in a novel published in 1992. Since the early 2000s, researchers have started to use this term to refer to digital technologies for learners to interact with other users with avatars. The term came to prominence in around 2020 due to the rebranding of Facebook. However, there was no consensus on what kind of technologies should belong to the metaverse and how to conceptualise the term. As such, this paper presents an exploratory review for conceptualising the metaverse based on 19 articles from the Web of Science database. This review focuses on the metaverse trend, how researchers in the past and present conceptualizing the term, and key technologies identified in the metaverse world. The findings identify the major types of technologies used in the metaverse studies and offers a sound theoretical foundation in terms of cognitive, social and teacher presence to understand what future potential of these technologies could bring to online learning. Five major types of technologies are identified which could map to four key elements of the metaverse (i.e., immersion, advanced computing, socialisation, decentralisation). At the end, a model is proposed to connect the key elements of the metaverse and its three presences in the community of inquiry that enhance students’ learning outcomes in the metaverse learning environment. Implications for practice or policy: Educators and researchers could rethink what types of technologies belong to the metaverse and how it has the potential to influence the education sector. Instructional designers could create meaningful learning experiences through the four key elements of the metaverse – immersion, advanced computing, socialisation and decentralisation. Policy-makers and educators could refer to the model of metaverse learning environment to guide their future policy and practices.","[{""name"": ""Davy Tsz Kit Ng"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],"['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Information Systems', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

According to those views, such data provide convincing evidence that explicit decoding instruction (e.g., phonological awareness, phonics) should be beneficial to reading success. Nevertheless, there has been pushback against such policies, the use of the term science of reading by “phonics‐centric people”, and their lack of instructional knowledge and experience. In this article, although the author supports pedagogical decision making on the basis of a confluence of evidence from a variety of sources, he cautions against instructional overgeneralizations based on various kinds of basic research without an adequate consideration of instructional experiments. The author provides several examples of the premature translation of basic research findings into wide‐scale pedagogical application.","[{""name"": ""Timothy Shanahan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/747537"", ""10.1080/00220973.1940.11010201"", ""10.1037/edu0000006"", ""10.2307/747502"", ""10.1093/arclin/6.4.375"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.92.4.659"", ""10.1177/001440298304900601"", ""10.1177/1529100618772271"", ""10.1093/mind/os-XI.44.524"", ""10.1080/07263869100034271"", ""10.1080/02702711.2016.1157538"", ""10.1207/S1532799Xssr0502_2"", ""10.1007/s11145-016-9694-0"", ""10.1598/RRQ.36.3.5"", ""10.1080/10824669.2015.1112746"", ""10.1044/2018_LSHSS-DYSLC-18-0020"", ""10.1016/S0010-9452(78)80025-2"", ""10.1080/19388076709556976"", ""10.17763/haer.81.4.t2k0m13756113566"", ""10.1177/105345127601100408"", ""10.1037/edu0000082"", ""10.1037/h0072813"", ""10.2307/746971"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.85.1.112"", ""10.1177/00222194050380050801"", ""10.1177/0022219409338739"", ""10.1177/074193258500600404"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139013949"", ""10.1177/002221948501800410"", ""10.3102/0013189X19891428"", ""10.1016/j.jecp.2020.104813"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.95.1.3"", ""10.1353/book.55896"", ""10.2307/1510711"", ""10.1037/10895-006"", ""10.2307/747940"", ""10.1086/456609"", ""10.1007/s10648-020-09526-0"", ""10.1001/archneurpsyc.1925.02200170002001"", ""10.1177/0895904803260041"", ""10.1016/0010-0277(84)90021-0"", ""10.1037/h0032648"", ""10.1002/rrq.179"", ""10.1016/S0042-6989(00)00310-2"", ""10.1097/00006324-196005000-00001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00164"", ""10.1080/15475441.2013.812017"", ""10.2307/748206"", ""10.17763/haer.78.1.v62444321p602101"", ""10.2466/pms.1967.25.3.841"", ""10.3102/00346543056001072"", ""10.2307/747348"", ""10.1073/pnas.0030098100"", ""10.1037/e482932006-004"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-0385-5_2"", ""10.1017/9781108349352.003"", ""10.1037/edu0000168"", ""10.3102/00028312006004501"", ""10.1080/0266736940100101""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/mbe.12244,MIND BRAIN AND EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,The Role of Positive Emotions in Education: A Neuroscience Perspective,"ABSTRACTHumans are inherently emotional creatures due to our social nature, and emotions are able to influence how well we learn and even affect academic outcomes. Emotions are rarely a chief concern in educational settings, and we will discuss the mechanisms underlying how emotions are processed in the brain and how they influence the key aspects of learning—attention, memory, and motivation. The brain mechanisms of emotional and cognitive relationships are then detailed in order to provide some context within the modern developments of neuroscience. This will help to clarify the relationship between emotions and cognition, and hope to put forward a theoretical map based on neuroscience that helps us to better understand the pivotal role of emotions in students' cognitive activities and ultimately their performance. Various strategies, based on research findings, aimed at creating more positive learning environments are then put forward.","[{""name"": ""Lu Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education, Department of Educational Psychology Center for Educational Neuroscience, East China Normal University  China"", ""College of Art and Science Yunnan Normal University  China""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew Douglas Isherwood Gow"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education, Department of Educational Psychology Center for Educational Neuroscience, East China Normal University  China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiaxian Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education, Department of Educational Psychology Center for Educational Neuroscience, East China Normal University  China""]}]","[""10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163514"", ""10.1038/nn1001"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.033"", ""10.1016/j.conb.2012.12.012"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135233"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2010.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.09.011"", ""10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01483-2"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.03.071"", ""10.1006/ceps.2000.1068"", ""10.1038/nrn2920-c1"", ""10.3102/00346543071001001"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.002"", ""10.1080/14697017.2015.1125384"", ""10.1126/science.1145463"", ""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.022"", ""10.1073/pnas.1015950108"", ""10.1038/nrn2649"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00285.x"", ""10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.07.008"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.56.3.218"", ""10.1080/02699930441000238"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2006.05.001"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0598-16.2016"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.07.047"", ""10.1038/nrn2897"", ""10.1007/s10212-015-0250-0"", ""10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01707-1"", ""10.1016/S0742-051X(00)00028-7"", ""10.1007/s10780-019-09360-6"", ""10.1159/000215072"", ""10.1177/1046878109333793"", ""10.1111/j.1751-228X.2007.00004.x"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-7213-1_5"", ""10.1073/pnas.1320040111"", ""10.1038/nrn1825"", ""10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.155"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2012.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.02.078"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3702_4"", ""10.1093/med:psych/9780198508144.003.0008"", ""10.4324/9780203148211"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2009.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.06.038"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2013.00022"", ""10.1016/S0006-3223(03)00171-9"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.09.012"", ""10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17617-3"", ""10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00751-7"", ""10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230"", ""10.1038/nrn.2016.135"", ""10.1007/s10459-006-9039-x"", ""10.1101/lm.995108"", ""10.1073/pnas.0908994106"", ""10.1038/nrn2889"", ""10.1038/nrn3916"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2007.00076.x"", ""10.1080/17470910701376878"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.05.041"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.2012.02064.x"", ""10.1111/mbe.12011"", ""10.1101/lm.803708"", ""10.1016/j.jsp.2010.06.004"", ""10.1038/nature10899"", ""10.1002/wcs.1431"", ""10.1073/pnas.182176499""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1007/s11412-021-09340-y,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING,0401 Education; 1205 Library and Information Science & Archive Management,Promoting regulation of equal participation in online collaboration by combining a group awareness tool and adaptive prompts. But does it even matter?,"AbstractUnequal participation poses a challenge to collaborative learning because it reduces opportunities for fruitful collaboration among learners and affects learners’ satisfaction. Social group awareness tools can display information on the distribution of participation and thus encourage groups to regulate the distribution of participation. However, some groups might require additional explicit support to leverage the information from such a tool. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of combining a group awareness tool and adaptive collaboration prompts on the distribution of participation during web-based collaboration. In this field experiment, students in a university level online course collaborated twice for two-weeks (16 groups in the first task; 13 groups in the second task) and either received only a group awareness tool, a combination of a group awareness tool and adaptive collaboration prompts, or no additional support. Our results showed that students were more satisfied when the participation in their group was more evenly distributed. However, we only found tentative support that the collaboration support helped groups achieve equal participation. Students reported rarely using the support for shared regulation of participation. Sequence alignment and clustering of action sequences revealed that groups who initiated the collaboration early, coordinated before solving the problem and interacted continuously tended to achieve an equal distribution of participation and were more satisfied with the collaboration. Against the background of our results, we identify potential ways to improve group awareness tools for supporting groups in their regulation of participation, and discuss the premise of equal participation during collaborative learning.","[{""name"": ""Sebastian Strauß"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nikol Rummel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0049124100029001001"", ""10.1177/0273475308322283"", ""10.1109/TLT.2010.18"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.685"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.05.016"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.014"", ""10.4324/9781315617572-34"", ""10.12806/V17/I2/R3"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v13i2.1127"", ""10.1007/s11409-012-9086-z"", ""10.3102/0034654318791584"", ""10.1177/1046496417721627"", ""10.1037/10096-006"", ""10.1145/2460296.2460332"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155"", ""10.1109/ITHET46829.2019.8937348"", ""10.1007/s11412-007-9032-2"", ""10.1142/S1793206809000660"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.10.021"", ""10.2307/1924845"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.04.004"", ""10.1080/00461520.2012.748005"", ""10.2307/1126804"", ""10.1177/0273475310389150"", ""10.18637/jss.v040.i04"", ""10.1007/BF02504836"", ""10.1024/1010-0652.23.2.95"", ""10.1037/10690-009"", ""10.1145/1124772.1124810"", ""10.1007/s11412-018-9279-9"", ""10.1177/0273475317708588"", ""10.1109/TLT.2017.2756629"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02580.x"", ""10.1080/00335637809383411"", ""10.1080/13594320344000228"", ""10.1007/s40593-020-00229-9"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2008.12.001"", ""10.1177/1368430211402405"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2016.10.006"", ""10.1201/b11963"", ""10.1080/00461520.2012.749153"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.06.002"", ""10.4324/9781315617572-13"", ""10.1007/s11423-014-9358-1"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.100284"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.05.012"", ""10.3102/0013189X09339057"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v16i3.2112"", ""10.1007/s10648-007-9054-3"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-849867-5.00001-X"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.65.4.681"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.45.4.819"", ""10.1177/1046496491222004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.02.005"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-36949-5_2"", ""10.1111/jcal.12084"", ""10.1016/S0747-5632(02)00057-2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.06.004"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2016.1259389"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2004.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.03.002"", ""10.1007/s10648-014-9287-x"", ""10.1007/s11412-020-09323-5"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.013"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog1103_4"", ""10.1007/s10648-014-9260-8"", ""10.1111/jasp.12449"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.06.024"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.91.6.1375"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.02.006"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00820"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.001"", ""10.3390/mti4030039"", ""10.1007/s11412-018-9273-2"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1402_2"", ""10.5465/amle.2012.0191"", ""10.1007/s11412-017-9261-y"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.05.009"", ""10.1007/s11412-016-9240-8"", ""10.1080/07370024.2016.1203263"", ""10.1037/edu0000436"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2389.2011.00559.x"", ""10.1007/s11412-011-9111-2"", ""10.1007/s11412-011-9124-x"", ""10.1521/soco.1995.13.3.319"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.016"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2005.04.003"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.61.4.570"", ""10.1007/s11412-017-9267-5"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106596""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The aim of this study was to explore the nature and transferability of this knowledge.MethodWe conducted an interpretative synthesis, searched PubMed, CINAHL, Philosopher's Index and PsycINFO and included fourteen studies.ResultsParents’ knowledge was based on their long‐lasting and special bond with their child and described as an intuition, a gut feeling, a sixth sense and a sense of knowing. Parents applied their knowledge as experts in interpreting their child's intended communication, well‐being and pain, and as advocates opposing the more objectivist approach of medical professionals. Showing by example and passing on narratives were seen as important ways of transferring this knowledge.ConclusionsSuggestions are made on how to apply and retain parents’ knowledge to improve care and support for people with PIMD.","[{""name"": ""Kasper Kruithof"", ""affiliation"": [""Section of Medical Ethics Department of General Practice Amsterdam UMC Location AMC University of Amsterdam Amsterdam The Netherlands"", ""Department of Medical Ethics &amp; Health Law Leiden University Medical Center Leiden The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Dick Willems"", ""affiliation"": [""Section of Medical Ethics Department of General Practice Amsterdam UMC Location AMC University of Amsterdam Amsterdam The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Faridi van Etten‐Jamaludin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Spiritual Care Hoofddorp The Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Erik Olsman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Medical Ethics &amp; Health Law Leiden University Medical Center Leiden The Netherlands"", ""Department of Spiritual Care Hoofddorp The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.3109/09638288.2014.895058"", ""10.1352/0047-6765(2004)42<356:SOTSID>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1111/jar.12379"", ""10.1155/2017/2514920"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02206.x"", ""10.1155/2016/8617182"", ""10.1001/jama.286.15.1897"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2214.2002.00294.x"", ""10.1177/135581960501000110"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02207.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-3148.2007.00415.x"", ""10.1111/jar.12394"", ""10.1016/j.ridd.2017.05.001"", ""10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181a00578"", ""10.1352/1934-9556-47.3.208"", ""10.1111/cch.12085"", ""10.3109/13668250903285648"", ""10.1016/S0020-7489(02)00058-5"", ""10.1177/1524839909353023"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2214.2012.01381.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00753.x"", ""10.1111/jar.12134"", ""10.1177/1744629516653037"", ""10.1353/nar.2006.0015"", ""10.3109/13668250.2016.1224333"", ""10.1080/14330237.2018.1426807"", ""10.1111/j.1741-1130.2007.00104.x"", ""10.3109/13668250.2017.1388913"", ""10.1111/j.1468-3156.2009.00599.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2788.2009.01235.x"", ""10.1080/J006v18n01_01"", ""10.1352/0895-8017(2001)106<0265:LCIOPA>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1093/intqhc/mzm042"", ""10.1111/jar.12393"", ""10.1016/j.ridd.2015.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.ridd.2016.09.012""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7563), ('1011 护理学', 0.7526)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.3390/educsci10100292,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Modified Blended Learning in Engineering Higher Education during the COVID-19 Lockdown-Building Automation Courses Case Study,"The blended learning method with its supporting electronic tools is a very well-known approach in academic education. In most of its practical applications, direct face to face contacts between students and the teacher as well as students with each other in groups are important elements in the organization of lectures and classes. This is of particular importance in conducting laboratory classes in teaching process for engineers. However, the COVID-19 lockdown in the spring of 2020 closed schools, universities and completely eliminated the possibility of direct interpersonal contacts. These extraordinary circumstances forced changes in the organization of the teaching process, in particular the introduction of distance learning. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified blended learning method as well as describes a case study on its introduction in the education of building automation engineers at a technical university. A new organizational structure of this modified method is presented, with discussion of tools and methods of active distance learning, introduced during the COVID-19 lockdown period.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000002984,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Independent and Interwoven: A Qualitative Exploration of Residents' Experiences With Educational Podcasts,"Purpose Educational podcasts are an increasingly popular platform for teaching and learning in health professions education. Yet it remains unclear why residents are drawn to podcasts for educational purposes, how they integrate podcasts into their broader learning experiences, and what challenges they face when using podcasts to learn. Method The authors used a constructivist grounded theory approach to explore residents’ motivations and listening behaviors. They conducted 16 semistructured interviews with residents from 2 U.S. and 1 Canadian institution from March 2016 to August 2017. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were analyzed using constant comparison, and themes were identified iteratively, working toward an explanatory framework that illuminated relationships among themes. Results Participants described podcasts as easy to use and engaging, enabling both broad exposure to content and targeted learning. They reported often listening to podcasts while doing other activities, being motivated by an ever-present desire to use their time productively; this practice led to challenges retaining and applying the content they learned from the podcasts to their clinical work. Listening to podcasts also fostered participants’ sense of connection to their peers, supervisors, and the larger professional community, yet it created tensions in their local relationships. Conclusions Despite the challenges of distracted, contextually constrained listening and difficulties translating their learning into clinical practice, residents found podcasts to be an accessible and engaging learning platform that offered them broad exposure to core content and personalized learning, concurrently fostering their sense of connection to local and national professional communities.","[{""name"": ""Jeffrey Riddell"", ""affiliation"": [""is assistant professor of clinical emergency medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Lynne Robins"", ""affiliation"": [""is professor, Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Alisha Brown"", ""affiliation"": [""is acting assistant professor, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Sherbino"", ""affiliation"": [""is professor, Department of Medicine, and assistant dean, Health Professions Education Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]}, {""name"": ""Michelle Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""is professor of emergency medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco, California; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Jonathan S.

Since March 2020, schools transitioned to a distance-learning format, which unintentionally forced parents into new teaching roles as proxy educators. In this brief, we explore the association between distance learning and the mental health of proxy educators. We find that parents with children who struggled with distance learning experienced elevated mental distress. Given the relationship between teacher burnout and student outcomes, we argue the importance of supporting parents during this time to improve students’ schooling.","[{""name"": ""Cassandra R.

These methods help to communicate how the model works with the aim of making ML models more transparent and increasing the trust of end‐users in their output. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation (LIME) are two widely used XAI methods, particularly with tabular data. In this perspective piece, the way the explainability metrics of these two methods are generated is discussed and a framework for the interpretation of their outputs, highlighting their weaknesses and strengths is proposed. Specifically, their outcomes in terms of model‐dependency and in the presence of collinearity among the features, relying on a case study from the biomedical domain (classification of individuals with or without myocardial infarction) are discussed. The results indicate that SHAP and LIME are highly affected by the adopted ML model and feature collinearity, raising a note of caution on their usage and interpretation.","[{""name"": ""Ahmed M.

10.1111/modl.12672,MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL,0401 Education,Tracking the Evolution of Chinese Learners' Multilingual Motivation Through a Longitudinal Q Methodology,"AbstractThis study uses a Q methodology to track the changing motivational profiles of 15 Chinese university students simultaneously engaged in second‐language (L2) English and third‐language (L3) Spanish learning over 1.5 years. Guided by complex dynamic systems theory (CDST), the study aims to investigate the initial trigger that propelled the Chinese learners to engage in intensive L3 learning and to chart the different routes of multilingual self‐development. Over the 1.5 years, Q sort tasks were administered at 3 time points, and retrospective interviews elicited data to complement the Q sort analysis. A nonspecific multilingual posture was found to be the initial trigger for voluntary investment in intensive L3 learning. A motivational profile with a dominating translingual and transcultural orientation develops into either more constitutive ideal multilingual selves or more language‐specific integrative ideal selves, continuously exerting motivational forces. Another profile, which has a dominating instrumental orientation, generates diminishing motivational forces. We argue that different aspects of multilingual learning motivation may be operating in parallel through correlative associations in the holistic, dynamic, and relational system of multilingual self. The article concludes by discussing pedagogical implications for learning and teaching multiple foreign languages for university students.","[{""name"": ""YONGYAN ZHENG"", ""affiliation"": [""Fudan University English Department, College of Foreign Languages and Literature  No. 220 Handan Road Shanghai 200433 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""XIUCHUAN LU"", ""affiliation"": [""Fudan University Spanish Department, College of Foreign Languages and Literature  No. 220 Handan Road Shanghai 200433 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""WEI REN"", ""affiliation"": [""Beihang University School of Foreign Languages  No. 37 Xueyuan Road Beijing 100191 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1017/S0266078412000223"", ""10.1016/j.system.2015.10.006"", ""10.1111/modl.12415"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2013.12004.x"", ""10.1111/j.0023-8333.2005.00319.x"", ""10.1016/j.system.2009.12.001"", ""10.1075/lllt.29.01deb"", ""10.1016/j.system.2018.11.001"", ""10.21832/9781847691293-003"", ""10.1111/lang.12005"", ""10.1017/S0261444811000516"", ""10.1111/modl.12408"", ""10.21832/9781853598876"", ""10.4324/9781315772714"", ""10.1111/modl.12416"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.102147"", ""10.1080/17544750.2016.1207694"", ""10.1080/01434632.2019.1571073"", ""10.1080/01434630903471439"", ""10.1080/14790718.2011.554983"", ""10.1111/modl.12412"", ""10.1080/14790718.2017.1411916"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.94.3.319"", ""10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60381-0"", ""10.1080/01434632.2019.1571069"", ""10.1002/9783527651009.ch4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9922.2008.00443.x"", ""10.1016/j.system.2016.05.012"", ""10.1111/modl.12410"", ""10.1016/j.system.2018.05.010"", ""10.1111/modl.12515"", ""10.1075/lllt.48.02lar"", ""10.1016/j.system.2017.09.025"", ""10.5209/clac.65649"", ""10.1075/lllt.48.06mac"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.41.9.954"", ""10.1111/flan.12380"", ""10.1111/modl.12624"", ""10.1111/lang.12065"", ""10.1093/applin/amt019"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.1935.tb02022.x"", ""10.1111/modl.12546"", ""10.1016/j.system.2017.04.004"", ""10.1111/modl.12409"", ""10.1111/modl.12187"", ""10.21832/9781847691293-012"", ""10.1111/modl.12413"", ""10.1111/modl.12407"", ""10.1080/14739879.2015.1101855"", ""10.1191/1478088705qp022oa"", ""10.4135/9781446251911"", ""10.21832/9781847691293-008"", ""10.1093/applin/amu046"", ""10.1080/01434632.2019.1571074""]",['Decision Sciences'],['Management Science and Operations Research'],"[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1007/s10734-020-00639-7,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,The future of value in digitalised higher education: why data privacy should not be our biggest concern,"AbstractUniversities around the world are increasingly digitalising all of their operations, with the current COVID-19 pandemic speeding up otherwise steady developments. This article focuses on the political economy of higher education (HE) digitalisation and suggests a new research programme. I foreground three principal arguments, which are empirically, theoretically, and politically crucial for HE scholars. First, most literature is examining the impacts of digitalisation on the HE sector and its subjects alone. I argue that current changes in digitalising HE cannot be studied in isolation from broader changes in the global economy. Specifically, HE digitalisation is embedded in the expansion of the digital economy, which is marked by new forms of value extraction and rentiership. Second, the emerging research on the intersection of marketisation and digitalisation in HE seems to follow the theories of marketisation qua production and commodification. I argue that we need theories with better explanatory power in analysing the current digitalisation dynamics. I propose to move from commodification to assetisation, and from prices to rents. Finally, universities are digitalising in the time when the practice is superseding policy, and there is no regulation beyond the question of data privacy. However, digital data property is already a reality, governed by ‘terms of use’, and protected by the intellectual property rights regime. The current pandemic has led to ‘emergency pedagogy’, which has intensified overall digitalisation in the sector and is bypassing concerns of data value redistribution. I argue that we urgently need public scrutiny and political action to address issues of value extraction and redistribution in HE.","[{""name"": ""Janja Komljenovic"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7551/mitpress/12075.003.0005"", ""10.1177/0162243916661633"", ""10.1177/0162243919829567"", ""10.1080/01442872.2020.1748264"", ""10.1177/0162243912442398"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3431732"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0109-y"", ""10.1080/13562517.2019.1711050"", ""10.5120/5686-7731"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2009.08.002"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3369509"", ""10.1080/02691728.2019.1638986"", ""10.1080/01425692.2020.1784707"", ""10.1057/9780230607187_7"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0174-5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198712282.003.0001"", ""10.2218/finsoc.v3i1.1936"", ""10.1080/13562517.2020.1739641"", ""10.1080/02680939.2012.747109"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1168797"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0093-2"", ""10.1080/17508487.2014.939098"", ""10.3390/socsci7100170"", ""10.1177/1461444816661553"", ""10.1177/1478210318819495"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3191436"", ""10.1177/2053951718820549"", ""10.1111/anti.12595"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12240.001.0001"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3476668"", ""10.1093/jiplp/jpx213"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3637961"", ""10.1007/s10734-018-0291-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-36911-8_2"", ""10.1080/03075079.2018.1520415"", ""10.1093/jiplp/jpw175"", ""10.1177/2042753017731238"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0094-1"", ""10.1111/bjet.12849"", ""10.1080/17508487.2020.1737556"", ""10.1080/13562517.2020.1748811""]",['Social Sciences'],['Safety Research'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1002/jee.20345,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education,Research literature on women of color in undergraduate engineering education: A systematic thematic synthesis,"AbstractBackgroundTo address social disparities and generate an innovative workforce, engineering higher education should provide learning environments that benefit students from all backgrounds. However, because engineering programs are not enrolling or retaining women of color at demographic parity, a better understanding of these students' experiences is needed to develop effective interventions.PurposeThis study analyzes research on women of color in undergraduate engineering education to determine what influences their experiences, participation, and advancement. We identify challenges to and strategies for persistence and present recommendations for engineering institutions to create interventions that support women of color and mitigate institutional inequities.Scope/MethodUsing the snowballing method, we identified 65 empirical studies published between 1999 and 2015 that met the criteria for this review. These studies represented qualitative, mixed‐methods, and quantitative methodologies from various fields. We conducted a systematic thematic synthesis, informed by frames of intersectionality, critical race theory, and community cultural wealth.ConclusionsWomen of color use navigational strategies to address the social pain of race and gender inequity in engineering education. Institutions should take responsibility for generating a sense of belonging for women of color and provide social and structural supports that increase self‐efficacy, address social pain, and improve retention.","[{""name"": ""Maria Ong"", ""affiliation"": [""TERC  Cambridge MA USA""]}, {""name"": ""Nuria Jaumot‐Pascual"", ""affiliation"": [""TERC  Cambridge MA USA""]}, {""name"": ""Lily T.

10.1186/s41239-020-00193-3,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Prerequisites for artificial intelligence in further education: identification of drivers, barriers, and business models of educational technology companies","AbstractThe ongoing datafication of our social reality has resulted in the emergence of new data-based business models. This development is also reflected in the education market. An increasing number of educational technology (EdTech) companies are entering the traditional education market with data-based teaching and learning solutions, and they are permanently transforming the market. However, despite the current market dynamics, there are hardly any business models that implement the possibilities of Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create adaptive teaching and learning paths. This paper focuses on EdTech companies and the drivers and barriers that currently affect data-based teaching and learning paths. The results show that LA especially are integrated into the current business models of EdTech companies on three levels, which are as follows: basic Learning Analytics, Learning Analytics and algorithmic or human-based recommendations, and Learning Analytics and adaptive teaching and learning (AI based). The discourse analysis reveals a diametrical relationship between the traditional educational ideal and the futuristic idea of education and knowledge transfer. While the desire for flexibility and individualization drives the debate on AI-based learning systems, a lack of data sovereignty, uncertainty and a lack of understanding of data are holding back the development and implementation of appropriate solutions at the same time.","[{""name"": ""André Renz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Romy Hilbig"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1504/IJTM.2018.091716"", ""10.1108/S0742-332220150000033013"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139519526.016"", ""10.7238/rusc.v12i1.2475"", ""10.5296/ijld.v8i4.14057"", ""10.1504/IJTEL.2012.051816"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027396"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.10.002"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-02-2014-0098"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-24525-2"", ""10.1177/2158244017697160"", ""10.3991/ijai.v1i1.10978"", ""10.12753/2066-026X-19-040"", ""10.1080/08923649509526885"", ""10.21839/jaar.2018.v3iS1.162"", ""10.1007/978-3-531-92085-6"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4609.2007.00143.x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3589393"", ""10.14419/ijet.v7i3.9789"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61425-0_24"", ""10.9781/ijimai.2014.275"", ""10.3991/ijep.v7i3.7337"", ""10.1145/2330601.2330635"", ""10.3991/ijai.v2i1.12675"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2017.07.005"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2017.648"", ""10.1007/s40593-015-0040-5"", ""10.1177/0002764213479366"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2009.07.003"", ""10.22215/timreview/1027"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.027"", ""10.1177/0149206311406265""]",['Computer Science'],['Computer Science Applications'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour, among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning. Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification. This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts: Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.","[{""name"": ""Tarek R.

Given how rapidly generative AI developments are currently occurring, this editorial is speculative. Although there is a long history of research on AI in education, the current situation is both unprecedented and seemingly not something that the AI in education community fully predicted. We also outline the editorial position of AJET in regards to generative AI to assist authors using tools such as ChatGPT as any part of the research or writing process.

Our objective is to systematically evaluate and conduct a meta-analysizes on the impact effect of virtual reality technology in teaching nursing students. Methods To achieve this, we conducted comprehensive computer searches on platforms including of PubMed, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, Zhiwang database, Wanfang database, and China Biomedical Literature Service (SinoMed), were conducted to collect randomized controlled trial studies on the use of virtual reality’s technology for teaching nursing students built up to until March 2023., and the Cochrane Furthermore, the quality of the included literature was assessed evaluated using the quality evaluation criteria specified for randomized controlled trial studies within the Cochrane provided in the evaluation handbook manual. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software. Results The aggregate outcomes from a total of 12 randomized controlled trials, encompassing including 1167 students, indicate were included. Meta-analysis results showed that virtual reality technology significantly enhances could better improve nursing students’’ theoretical knowledge [(SMD = 0.97, 95% CI [0.48, 1.46], p &lt; 0.001)], practical skills (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI [0.33, 1.46], p &lt; 0.001), skill retention, (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI [0.33, 0.71], p &lt; 0.001), and satisfaction levels (SMD = 1.14, 95% CI [0.85, 1.43], p &lt; 0.001), in comparison with traditional or alternative teaching methodologies. However, no statistically significant impact was observed on the enhancement of critical thinking skills (SMD = 0.79, 95% CI [-0.05, 1.64], p = 0.07) among nursing students. Conclusion Our findings underscore that compared to conventional teaching methods, virtual reality offers superior potential in advancing nursing students’ theoretical knowledge, practice proficiencies, and overall satisfaction, while not yielding a significant advantage in enhancing critical thinking skills. The incorporated literature consisted exclusively of randomized controlled trials, albeit a subset of these studies omitted descriptions of the allocation concealment strategy.","[{""name"": ""Kai Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Weiwei Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wei Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ting Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yanxue Zheng"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.nepr.2018.06.007"", ""10.1093/neuros/nyaa447_162"", ""10.2196/12959"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2022.906715"", ""10.1002/ca.23655"", ""10.2196/20249"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30226-7"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2021.100799"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.009"", ""10.1080/13683500.2017.1417359"", ""10.1016/j.amjsurg.2017.02.011"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00135"", ""10.1136/bmj.d5928"", ""10.2196/11529"", ""10.1186/s12909-022-03834-5"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0275130"", ""10.3390/ijerph19084823"", ""10.1016/j.anr.2021.03.002"", ""10.1111/jocn.15701"", ""10.16281/j.cnki.jocml.2017.84.105"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-77712-2_129"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2015.09.006"", ""10.1080/03043797.2012.706596"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104655"", ""10.1016/j.ecns.2021.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.ecns.2023.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103758"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000434"", ""10.1016/j.ecns.2020.05.008""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Information Systems', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Physiology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"
10.1007/s40299-021-00619-0,ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER,0401 Education,Criteria for Good Qualitative Research: A Comprehensive Review,"AbstractThis review aims to synthesize a published set of evaluative criteria for good qualitative research. The aim is to shed light on existing standards for assessing the rigor of qualitative research encompassing a range of epistemological and ontological standpoints. Using a systematic search strategy, published journal articles that deliberate criteria for rigorous research were identified. Then, references of relevant articles were surveyed to find noteworthy, distinct, and well-defined pointers to good qualitative research. This review presents an investigative assessment of the pivotal features in qualitative research that can permit the readers to pass judgment on its quality and to condemn it as good research when objectively and adequately utilized. Overall, this review underlines the crux of qualitative research and accentuates the necessity to evaluate such research by the very tenets of its being. It also offers some prospects and recommendations to improve the quality of qualitative research. Based on the findings of this review, it is concluded that quality criteria are the aftereffect of socio-institutional procedures and existing paradigmatic conducts. Owing to the paradigmatic diversity of qualitative research, a single and specific set of quality criteria is neither feasible nor anticipated. Since qualitative research is not a cohesive discipline, researchers need to educate and familiarize themselves with applicable norms and decisive factors to evaluate qualitative research from within its theoretical and methodological framework of origin.","[{""name"": ""Drishti Yadav"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.02.005"", ""10.1007/s10464-005-3398-y"", ""10.1080/13645570701401644"", ""10.1177/160940690300200201"", ""10.1370/afm.818"", ""10.1348/014466599162782"", ""10.1177/1094670520961445"", ""10.1080/17437270701614782"", ""10.1177/1609406920976417"", ""10.1002/jcad.12365"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2702.2003.00683.x"", ""10.1177/1077800403259491"", ""10.5688/ajpe7120"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2006.00124.x"", ""10.2307/249410"", ""10.1177/1077800403256154"", ""10.1037/cou0000523"", ""10.1002/ev.1427"", ""10.1348/000712600161646"", ""10.1002/9781119410867.ch15"", ""10.1177/1938965520940294"", ""10.1111/medu.14010"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.52.2.250"", ""10.1177/1049732303013006005"", ""10.1177/1362168820941288"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000388"", ""10.1177/1609406919899220"", ""10.1080/135046200110494"", ""10.1080/13678868.2010.501959"", ""10.2307/1556383"", ""10.1177/107780049600200109"", ""10.1177/107780049900500402"", ""10.3233/EFI-2004-22201"", ""10.1177/104973230101100409"", ""10.1111/tct.13242"", ""10.1080/02660830.2001.11661452"", ""10.1093/intqhc/mzm042"", ""10.1177/1077800410383121""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['General Health Professions', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In addition to the basic sensing requirements, leading sensory systems are required to process data and extract featured information from highly redundant data in real time. With the added edge‐computational capabilities, data shuttling is avoided, leading to significant reduction of computational burden and bandwidth pressure in the cloud. Among the different computing architectures, the neuromorphic sensory system stands out due to its high power efficiency, low latency, and excellent processing capability. Mimicking the biological neural network, the colocation of sensory, processor, and memory components of neuromorphic sensory systems enables the requirements for frequent data shuttles to be circumvented. In particular, artificial intelligent perceptions built on memristive neuromorphic systems exhibit outstanding characteristics of small footprint, low power consumption, 3D stacking ability, and high density. Herein, the two essential parts of the memristive artificial perceptron system are presented: 1) memristive systems for neuromorphic computing and 2) high‐performance sensors. Next, the current state of the art established on artificial perceptron systems covering visual, auditory, and tactile sensations is highlighted.

10.1111/medu.14659,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Thinking about social power and hierarchy in medical education,"AbstractContextSocial power has been diversely conceptualised in many academic areas. Operating on both the micro (interactional) and macro (structural) levels, we understand power to shape behaviour and knowledge through both repression and production. Hierarchies are one organising form of power, stratifying individuals or groups based on the possession of valued social resources.DiscussionMedicine is a highly organised social context where work and learning are contingent on interaction and thereby influenced greatly by social power and hierarchy. Despite the relevance of power to education research, there are many unrealized opportunities to use this construct to expand our understanding of how physicians work and learn. Hierarchy, when considered in our field, is typically gestured to as an omnipresent feature of the clinical environment that harms low‐status individuals by repressing their ability to communicate openly and exercise their agency. This may be true in many circumstances, but this conceptualization of hierarchy neglects consideration of other aspects of hierarchy that may be generative for understanding the experiences of medical learners. For example, medical learners may experience the superimposition of multiple hierarchies, some of which are fluid and some of which are calcified, some of which are productive and helpful and some of which are oppressive and harmful. Power may work ‘up’ and ‘across’ hierarchical ranks, rather than just from higher status to lower status individuals.ConclusionThe conceptualizations of how social power shapes human behaviour are diverse. Often paired with hierarchy, or social arrangement, these social scientific ideas have much to offer our collective study of the ways that health professionals learn and practice. Accordingly, we posit that a consideration of the ways social power works through hierarchies to nurture or harm the growth of learners should be granted explicit consideration in the framing and conduct of medical education research.","[{""name"": ""Meredith Vanstone"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Family Medicine McMaster University  Hamilton Ontario Canada"", ""McMaster FHS Program for Education Research, Innovation and Theory (MERIT) McMaster University  Hamilton Ontario Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Lawrence Grierson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Family Medicine McMaster University  Hamilton Ontario Canada"", ""McMaster FHS Program for Education Research, Innovation and Theory (MERIT) McMaster University  Hamilton Ontario Canada""]}]","[""10.1111/medu.12055"", ""10.1080/19416520802211628"", ""10.1007/s10459-020-09993-8"", ""10.1258/1355819041403222"", ""10.1080/10401334.2017.1392864"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03921.x"", ""10.1080/0260293042000227209"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.05.048"", ""10.2307/3341493"", ""10.1080/01425692.2019.1703645"", ""10.1111/medu.12668"", ""10.1111/medu.12077"", ""10.1007/s10459-013-9486-0"", ""10.1177/1049732316650418"", ""10.1111/medu.14395"", ""10.1111/medu.14462"", ""10.1111/medu.13894"", ""10.1111/medu.13945"", ""10.1111/medu.13065"", ""10.1111/medu.12036"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract199117118"", ""10.4324/9780203792643"", ""10.2307/2089716"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.65.4.440"", ""10.1525/si.1977.1.1.71"", ""10.2307/799219"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2021.1892619"", ""10.1007/s12630-015-0364-5"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32595-9"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003628"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03440.x"", ""10.1177/030981680408200108"", ""10.4324/9781315688299"", ""10.2307/256865"", ""10.1111/anae.13191"", ""10.1186/1472-6963-14-61"", ""10.1016/j.bja.2018.10.056"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2007.02893.x"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318271fc82"", ""10.1111/medu.12424"", ""10.1111/medu.12832"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002113"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.04024.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03911.x"", ""10.1067/mob.2003.85"", ""10.1136/bmj.322.7288.709"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000199"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-0974-4"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03878.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-84996-133-2_11"", ""10.4135/9781452243610.n9"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.04126.x"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000560"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2001.00870.x"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00758.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.06.027"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.75.2.132"", ""10.1086/220526"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90006-F"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2016.11.001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01355.x"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.09.036"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-13-79"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1755-z"", ""10.1111/medu.13871"", ""10.1080/13596748.2018.1526909"", ""10.1111/medu.12547"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002933"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2003.01622.x"", ""10.1007/s10459-016-9732-3""]",['Medicine'],"['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Family Practice', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"
10.1007/s10734-020-00569-4,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Telework in academia: associations with health and well-being among staff,"AbstractAs the development of technical aids for telework has progressed, work has become more flexible in time and space. Among academics, the opportunity to telework has been embraced by most, but it is unclear how it relates to their health and well-being. The aim of this study was to determine how frequency and amount of telework is associated with perceived health, stress, recuperation, work-life balance, and intrinsic work motivation among teaching and research academics. An electronic questionnaire was sent to junior lecturers, senior lecturers, and professors at Swedish public universities. It included the General Health Questionnaire, Work Stress Questionnaire, items for assessing recuperation, the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction at Work scale, and parts of Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, as well as questions about the frequency and amount of telework performed. In total, 392 academics responded to the survey. Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences between groups of academics with different telework frequency (p &lt; 0.05). Univariate analyses of variance showed that ratings of stress related to indistinct organization and conflicts were higher among academics that telework several times per week or more than among academics that telework less than once per month. In regression analyses of associations between amount of telework (in hours per week) and the dependent variables, no significant effects were found. Although it cannot be concluded whether stress is a cause or an effect of frequent telework, the findings warrant further attention to academics who telework frequently.","[{""name"": ""Marina Heiden"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Linda Widar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Birgitta Wiitavaara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eva Boman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1529100615593273"", ""10.1037/1072-5245.10.3.217"", ""10.1002/job.144"", ""10.1177/0963721411414534"", ""10.1109/47.807962"", ""10.1186/1756-0500-6-102"", ""10.1007/s10734-010-9404-9"", ""10.1080/00140130512331319409"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00584"", ""10.1016/S0923-4748(98)00026-5"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00965"", ""10.1080/00909882.2010.513998"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1524"", ""10.1007/s10869-018-9530-4"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.91.6.1340"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.11.008"", ""10.1037/1040-3590.11.2.159"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2006.12.004"", ""10.2747/0272-3638.27.7.610"", ""10.1080/09638280801931287"", ""10.1080/12265934.2018.1446352"", ""10.1177/0972150914564421"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0143-z"", ""10.1080/10911350802165478"", ""10.1080/13562517.2014.945161"", ""10.17576/JEM-2014-4801-10"", ""10.1080/13538322.2014.979547"", ""10.1108/IJWHM-07-2015-0050"", ""10.1007/s11162-017-9467-x"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v7i2.300"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2015.1126895"", ""10.1177/1478210315579552"", ""10.1068/a43223"", ""10.1007/s13384-013-0115-y"", ""10.3390/su11113067"", ""10.1080/21568235.2016.1224674"", ""10.22230/cjc.2006v31n3a1721"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v15i3.1770"", ""10.1111/ntwe.12060""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['General Health Professions', 'Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1007/s10639-021-10706-w,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Technology supported learning and pedagogy in times of crisis: the case of COVID-19 pandemic,"AbstractOnline teaching within disciplines such as Engineering require experiential learning that equip future graduates with highly intellectual and professional skills to meet the demands of employers and the industry. The outbreak of COVID-19 however, has shifted the academic community into new landscapes that require educators and students to adapt and manage their expectations. Although literature reports on research attempts to study the implications of Covid-19 on the Higher Education curricular, little has been reported on its impact on Engineering Education. This paper therefore uses the theory of Emergency Management Life Cycle (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recover) as a lens to examine the challenges faced by students and academics and coping mechanism during the COVID period. This study adopts a mixed method approach using a case study from the College of Engineering at a Higher Education Institution in the UAE due to the sudden migration to online teaching amid COVID-19. Data is collected through interviews and surveys with both students and instructors on challenges, strategies and online delivery good practices that enhanced students’ learning experience. The results show that, Technology Supported Learning tools are capable of enhancing students’ experiential learning and associated competencies, however there were a number of pedagogical, technological and psychological challenges that faced students and instructors as a result of the sudden migration online, which are likely to play a role in the impediment of the students’ learning cycle, due to the lack of preparedness in response to the state of emergency created by Covid-19. Despite these challenges, the study found that instructors with effective communication skills and teaching style, competent use of technology, flexible, friendly and supportive attitude towards teaching, played a positive role in mitigating for the lack of preparedness in response to sudden migration online. The study also reveals that by overcoming some of the technical challenges such as slow internet connection and interruptions, lessons learnt from the sudden migration to online delivery amid COVID-19, will help create new opportunities for the use of blended learning approaches to meet the needs of the on-going COVID and future online deliveries.","[{""name"": ""Vian Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex Opoku"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/AAOUJ-07-2020-0047"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0250041"", ""10.1002/hbe2.191"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.11.006"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1574/1/012166"", ""10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/01625-9"", ""10.1111/1467-9671.00157"", ""10.1177/0047239520934018"", ""10.1136/bmj.m1066"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls0504_3’"", ""10.4324/9781003154587-1"", ""10.24059/olj.v22i2.1255"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27711-5_32"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1683748"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2020.1839543"", ""10.1145/3300942.3300956"", ""10.3402/rlt.v20i0.14406"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1809650"", ""10.5040/9798400677885"", ""10.1111/curi.12003"", ""10.4324/9781315363813"", ""10.3390/educsci10100292"", ""10.4324/9780203726624"", ""10.1177/0973703020946700"", ""10.1108/FS-11-2019-0097"", ""10.17763/haer.57.1.j463w79r56455411"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2020.1854844"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2019.1625867"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2021.1866838"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00164-x"", ""10.1080/17439884.2020.1761641"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.024"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2020.1854337"", ""10.3390/jrfm13030055"", ""10.1007/s40692-019-00148-2""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

While the acceptance of some of these new digital technologies has been investigated, there are few direct comparisons. The most established model for measuring acceptance is the technology acceptance model, which can predict the behavioral intention to use the technology. We compared four digital learning technologies (e-lectures, classroom response system, classroom chat, and mobile virtual reality) in terms of their technology acceptance. The classroom response system had the highest level of acceptance. It was closely followed by e-lectures, then the classroom chat and then mobile virtual reality. The students evaluated all tools favorably before and after usage, except for mobile virtual reality, which saw a substantial drop in perceived usefulness and behavioral intention after 3 months’ usage.","[{""name"": ""David A.

We synthesize themes, questions, results and perspectives emphasized in the articles that appear in this issue alongside the relevant foundations of these ideas within the key journal articles, handbooks and conference papers. Our aim is to give an overview of the field that provides opportunities for readers to gain deeper insights into theoretical, methodological, practical and societal challenges that concern teaching mathematics with technology in its broadest sense. Although this collection of articles was developed prior to the global coronavirus pandemic, we have taken the opportunity to survey the contributing authors to provide some country perspectives on the impact the pandemic has had on mathematics teaching with technology in the period January–July 2020. We conclude the survey paper by identifying some areas for future research in this increasingly relevant topic.","[{""name"": ""Alison Clark-Wilson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ornella Robutti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mike Thomas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1023/A:1009903206236"", ""10.3102/0034654311404435"", ""10.1007/s11858-010-0275-4"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4638-1_14"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01172-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-19741-4"", ""10.1023/A:1022103903080"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4638-1_15"", ""10.1007/s11858-010-0235-z"", ""10.4324/9780203930236.ch28"", ""10.1007/BF03217558"", ""10.1007/s11092-008-9068-5"", ""10.1007/s11858-012-0436-8"", ""10.1007/s10649-016-9732-5"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01184-4"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-1655-8_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-90179-4"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01191-5"", ""10.1007/s11858-010-0279-0"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4638-1_1"", ""10.1111/bjet.12727"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-19741-4_1"", ""10.1007/s10649-012-9465-z"", ""10.1007/s10649-010-9254-5"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01169-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812774.003"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01165-7"", ""10.1007/s10857-005-0457-0"", ""10.1007/s10649-008-9159-8"", ""10.1023/A:1009892720043"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01179-1"", ""10.1007/s10758-005-0395-z"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4638-1_11"", ""10.1007/s11858-009-0193-5"", ""10.1007/s11858-009-0200-x"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc.39.4.0372"", ""10.1007/s11858-013-0540-4"", ""10.1007/s11858-016-0795-7"", ""10.1007/s11858-009-0196-2"", ""10.1007/s10857-005-1223-z"", ""10.1080/07294360.2017.1344197"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-5696-0_2"", ""10.1007/s11858-017-0858-4"", ""10.1023/A:1012793121648"", ""10.1163/9789087901127_011"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-09629-2_6"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00684.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-02396-0"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01186-2"", ""10.2307/749622"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-1696-8"", ""10.1007/s11858-017-0879-z"", ""10.1007/s10758-010-9158-6"", ""10.1007/s10857-012-9213-4"", ""10.1007/s13394-017-0229-z"", ""10.1016/S0953-5438(03)00058-4"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01180-8"", ""10.1007/s11858-009-0222-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-15789-0_100012"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01195-1"", ""10.2307/1602690"", ""10.4000/educationdidactique.434"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4638-1_16"", ""10.1007/s10649-008-9176-7"", ""10.1023/A:1016052130572"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.05.013"", ""10.1007/s11858-013-0531-5"", ""10.3102/0013189X015002004"", ""10.1007/s11858-008-0132-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-15789-0_153"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01163-9"", ""10.1007/s10649-018-9841-4"", ""10.1177/0162243910377624"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01178-2"", ""10.1287/isre.6.2.144"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61488-5_6"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-4638-1_4"", ""10.1007/BF03217288"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01158-6"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01171-9"", ""10.1007/s10758-004-3468-5"", ""10.1007/s11858-010-0269-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-15789-0_100011"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01164-8"", ""10.1007/s11858-020-01182-6"", ""10.1007/BF03172796"", ""10.1007/s11858-010-0287-0""]","['Engineering', 'Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Media Technology', 'Applied Mathematics']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)], [('0701 数学', 0.7285), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7193)]]"
10.3102/0013189X211047251,EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER,0401 Education,Rethinking Learning: What the Interdisciplinary Science Tells Us,"Theories of learning developed in education and psychology for the past 100 years are woefully inadequate to support the design of schools and classrooms that foster deep learning and equity. Needed is learning theory that can guide us in creating schools and classrooms where deep learning occurs, where learners’ full selves are engaged, and that disrupt existing patterns of inequality and oppression. In this article, we build on recent research in education, neuroscience, psychology, and anthropology to articulate a theory of learning that has the potential to move us toward that goal. We elaborate four key principles of learning: (1) learning is rooted in evolutionary, biological, and neurological systems; (2) learning is integrated with other developmental processes whereby the whole child (emotion, identity, cognition) must be taken into account; (3) learning is shaped in culturally organized practice across people’s lives; and (4) learning is experienced as embodied and coordinated through social interaction. Taken together, these principles help us understand learning in a way that foregrounds the range of community and cultural experiences people have throughout the life course and across the multiple settings of life and accounts for learning as set within systems of injustice.","[{""name"": ""Na’ilah Suad Nasir"", ""affiliation"": [""Spencer Foundation, Chicago, IL""]}, {""name"": ""Carol D.

10.1007/s10639-022-11286-z,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Modeling English teachers' behavioral intention to use artificial intelligence in middle schools,"AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) provides new opportunities for K-12 English as foreign language (EFL) teachers to improve their teaching. To address the emerging trend of integrating AI into teaching, this study investigated EFL teachers’ perceptions, knowledge, and behavioral intention to use AI to support teaching and learning of English in middle schools. This study combined relevant aspects of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) as the theoretical basis. A survey was conducted in an AI education demonstration district in China. This survey adopted a 5-point Likert scale which was developed from previous research and the interview records of EFL teachers. A total of 470 valid responses were collected. The reliability and validity of the scale were satisfied with eight constructs: Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Conditions (FC), AI language technological knowledge (AIL-TK), AI technological pedagogical knowledge (AI-TPK), AI-TPACK, and Behavioral Intention (BI). The results showed that the EFL teachers were positive with regard to the measured factors. PE, SI, AIL-TK, and AI-TPACK had significant positive predictive power on BI; and EE, FC, AI-TPK had indirect effects on BI. The complex interrelations were mapped out to provide educators and policymakers with a theoretically grounded scheme to foster teachers’ BI to use AI in teaching.","[{""name"": ""Xin An"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ching Sing Chai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yushun Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ying Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xi Shen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chunping Zheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mengyuan Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.19173/irrodl.v10i2.596"", ""10.1017/S0958344010000261"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.07.006"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09904-4"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1535508"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10159-7"", ""10.3390/su12145568"", ""10.23903/kaited.2020.18.4.003"", ""10.1016/C2013-0-10517-X"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.14742/ajet.3508"", ""10.1080/09588221.2021.1879162"", ""10.1111/exsy.12667"", ""10.1007/BF02299597"", ""10.1109/CSCS.2019.00069"", ""10.2307/3151312"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1593200"", ""10.1080/09588221.2016.1278024"", ""10.14742/ajet.6798"", ""10.1126/science.aaa8415"", ""10.1007/s11251-012-9249-y"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104304"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1958348"", ""10.3390/su13147568"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00684.x"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM1004_8"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106468"", ""10.2478/jolace-2019-0025"", ""10.1080/09588221.2017.1418754"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103967"", ""10.1080/13598660801971641"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1489290"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-95947-0_29"", ""10.9781/ijimai.2021.03.002"", ""10.14742/ajet.810"", ""10.1080/09588221.2014.941369"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1674887"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1627560"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1080/09588221.2021.1946562"", ""10.14742/ajet.6719"", ""10.1007/s40299-017-0344-3""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

This study aimed to verify the effects of this innovative blended educational strategy on knowledge, problem-solving ability, and learning satisfaction of undergraduate nursing students undergoing public healthcare education.MethodsThe subjects were undergraduate nursing students enrolled in H University in South Korea. The experiment was conducted over a period of 8 weeks in the public healthcare course. Two groups, blended learning (A flipped classroom with team-based learning) which was the experimental group and traditional lecture-based classroom group, the control group, were assessed. In the blended learning group, the students had pre-class, in-class (including team-based learning elements), and post-class learning elements. The two groups were compared on the following learning outcomes: knowledge, problem-solving ability, and learning satisfaction.ResultsResults showed that the blended learning instructional methods, in comparison with traditional lectures, enhanced the students’ knowledge, problem-solving ability, and learning satisfaction in the public healthcare course.ConclusionsThis study supports the feasibility of the flipped classroom with team-based learning as a blended learning strategy, able to produce improvements in nursing students’ learning outcomes. Blended learning approaches may be an effective alternative to conventional approaches in nursing education.","[{""name"": ""Hee Young Kang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hae Ran Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1403494817743897"", ""10.1002/ace.20269"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2015.08.019"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001561"", ""10.1097/PHH.0000000000000775"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2017.00272"", ""10.12968/hmed.2018.79.7.408"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.02.002"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182a36a07"", ""10.1097/SIH.0000000000000280"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.923821"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01157"", ""10.1080/10872981.2017.1395679"", ""10.2527/jas.2015-9087"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2016.13.11"", ""10.3389/fimmu.2019.02477"", ""10.1002/jgf2.284"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2017.09.012"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003157"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02684.x"", ""10.7556/jaoa.2015.042"", ""10.1016/j.jneb.2014.08.008"", ""10.5688/ajpe6922"", ""10.5688/ajpe816103"", ""10.1002/bmb.21328"", ""10.5688/ajpe779189"", ""10.1007/s11423-013-9305-6"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.94.4.820"", ""10.1016/j.jpor.2016.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.104229"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2013.02.012"", ""10.1111/medu.13272"", ""10.21815/JDE.019.190"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2006.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2018.01.021"", ""10.1080/10401334.2015.1107488"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2018.1451630"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2017.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2019.151457"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1550-x""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Physiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003137,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Coproducing Health Professions Education: A Prerequisite to Coproducing Health Care Services?,"In 2016, Batalden et al proposed a coproduction model for health care services. Starting from the argument that health care services should demonstrate service-dominant rather than goods-dominant logic, they argued that health care outcomes are the result of the intricate interaction of the provider and patient in concert with the system, community, and, ultimately, society. The key notion is that the patient is as much an expert in determining outcomes as the provider, but with different expertise. Patients come to the table with expertise in their lived experiences and the context of their lives. The authors posit that education, like health care services, should follow a service-dominant logic. Like the relationship between patients and providers, the relationship between learner and teacher requires the integrated expertise of each nested in the context of their system, community, and society to optimize outcomes. The authors then argue that health professions learners cannot be educated in a traditional, paternalistic model of education and then expected to practice in a manner that prioritizes coproductive partnerships with colleagues, patients, and families. They stress the necessity of adapting the health care services coproduction model to health professions education. Instead of asking whether the coproduction model is possible in the current system, they argue that the current system is not sustainable and not producing the desired kind of clinicians. A current example from a longitudinal integrated clerkship highlights some possibilities with coproduced education. Finally, the authors offer some practical ways to begin changing from the traditional model. They thus provide a conceptual framework and ideas for practical implementation to move the educational model closer to the coproduction health care services model that many strive for and, through that alignment, to set the stage for improved health outcomes for all.","[{""name"": ""Robert Englander"", ""affiliation"": [""R.

10.1186/s12909-020-02255-6,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Can virtual reality improve traditional anatomy education programmes? A mixed-methods study on the use of a 3D skull model,"AbstractBackgroundRealistic, portable, and scalable lectures, cadaveric models, 2D atlases and computer simulations are being combined more frequently for teaching anatomy, which result in major increases in user satisfaction. However, although digital simulations may be more portable, interesting, or motivating than traditional teaching tools, whether they are superior in terms of student learning remain unclear. This paper presents a study in which the educational effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR) skull model is compared with that of cadaveric skulls and atlases. The aim of this study was to compare the results of teaching with VR to results of teaching with traditional teaching methods by administering objective questionnaires and perception surveys.MethodsA mixed-methods study with 73 medical students was conducted with three different groups, namely, the VR group (N = 25), cadaver group (N = 25) and atlas group (N = 23). Anatomical structures were taught through an introductory lecture and model-based learning. All students completed the pre- and post-intervention tests, which comprised a theory test and an identification test. The theory test consisted of 18 multiple-choice questions, and the identification test consisted of 25 fill-in-the-blank questions.ResultsThe participants in all three groups had significantly higher total scores on the post-intervention test than on the pre-intervention test; the post-intervention test score in the VR group was not statistically significantly higher than the post-intervention test score of the other groups (VR: 30 [IQR: 22–33.5], cadaver: 26 [IQR: 20–31.5], atlas: 28[IQR: 20–33];p &gt; 0.05). The participants in the VR and cadaver groups provided more positive feedback on their learning models than the atlas group (VR: 26 [IQR: 19–30], cadaver: 25 [IQR: 19.5–29.5], atlas: 12 [IQR: 9–20];p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionsThe skull virtual learning resource (VLR) was equally efficient as the cadaver skull and atlas in teaching anatomy structures. Such a model can aid individuals in understanding complex anatomical structures with a higher level of motivation and tolerable adverse effects.","[{""name"": ""Shi Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jiawei Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cheng Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhouxian Pan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lingshan Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jianhua Du"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xinhua Shen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhen Shen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Huijuan Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jihai Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hua Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chao Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hui Pan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1308/003588407X168244"", ""10.1002/ase.1696"", ""10.1016/j.cag.2018.01.005"", ""10.1002/ase.1928"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.019"", ""10.1002/ca.10159"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2007.10.001"", ""10.1002/alr.21986"", ""10.1002/ase.1345"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1911-5"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2015.05.006"", ""10.2196/ijmr.2172"", ""10.1007/s10956-014-9526-4"", ""10.1002/ase.1275"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0757-3"", ""10.1002/ase.76"", ""10.1002/ase.214"", ""10.1002/ase.1921"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-00647-1"", ""10.1002/ase.1510"", ""10.1007/s11548-016-1461-9"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2015.06.016"", ""10.1016/j.bjps.2019.09.034"", ""10.1007/s00276-007-0180-x"", ""10.1002/ca.21059"", ""10.1002/ca.20584"", ""10.1089/cpb.2006.9.207"", ""10.1002/ca.10113"", ""10.3946/kjme.2011.23.4.275"", ""10.1007/s10459-008-9117-3"", ""10.1111/eje.12485"", ""10.1080/01421590801932228"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-13-131"", ""10.1097/01.NEP.0000000000000258"", ""10.1002/ase.1355"", ""10.12968/hmed.2018.79.12.666"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S219344"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2019.06.081""]","['Engineering', 'Medicine', 'Dentistry']","['Surgery', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'General Dentistry']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.78), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7342), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7246), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7141), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7138)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.7328), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6867)]]"

In the United States, many medical schools, the American Medical Association, and the National Academy of Sciences have published calls for physicians and physicians-in-training to develop a basic knowledge of the science of climate change and an awareness of the associated health risks. The authors—all medical students and educators—argue for the expeditious redesign of medical school curricula to teach students to recognize, diagnose, and treat the many health conditions exacerbated by climate change as well as understand public health issues. In this Invited Commentary, the authors briefly review the health impacts of climate change, examine current climate change course offerings and proposals, and describe the rationale for promptly and comprehensively including climate science education in medical school curricula. Efforts in training physicians now will benefit those physicians’ communities whose health will be impacted by a period of remarkable climate change. The bottom line is that the health effects of climate reality cannot be ignored, and people everywhere must adapt as quickly as possible.","[{""name"": ""Anna Goshua"", ""affiliation"": [""A.

But these methods and tools were designed primarily to answer simple, focused questions in a stable context where yesterday’s research can be mapped more or less unproblematically onto today’s clinical and policy questions. They have significant limitations when extended to complex questions about a novel pathogen causing chaos across multiple sectors in a fast-changing global context. Non-pharmaceutical interventions which combine material artefacts, human behaviour, organisational directives, occupational health and safety, and the built environment are a case in point: EBM’s experimental, intervention-focused, checklist-driven, effect-size-oriented and deductive approach has sometimes confused rather than informed debate. While RCTs are important, exclusion of other study designs and evidence sources has been particularly problematic in a context where rapid decision making is needed in order to save lives and protect health. It is time to bring in a wider range of evidence and a more pluralist approach to defining what counts as ‘high-quality’ evidence. We introduce some conceptual tools and quality frameworks from various fields involving what is known as mechanistic research, including complexity science, engineering and the social sciences. We propose that the tools and frameworks of mechanistic evidence, sometimes known as ‘EBM+’ when combined with traditional EBM, might be used to develop and evaluate the interdisciplinary evidence base needed to take us out of this protracted pandemic. Further articles in this series will apply pluralistic methods to specific research questions.","[{""name"": ""Trisha Greenhalgh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Fisman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Danielle J Cane"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew Oliver"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chandini Raina Macintyre"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/jep.13438"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94610-8"", ""10.1136/ebmed-2016-110401"", ""10.1001/jama.1992.03490170092032"", ""10.1136/bmj.39489.470347.AD"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa2021436"", ""10.1016/s0140-6736(21)00461-x"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.10.017"", ""10.1007/s11245-013-9220-9"", ""10.1080/02698595.2019.1630927"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-1866-9"", ""10.1177/003591576505800503"", ""10.1080/02698590701498084"", ""10.1186/s12982-014-0022-3"", ""10.4269/ajtmh.20-1015"", ""10.7326/M20-6817"", ""10.7326/M20-7499"", ""10.1126/science.abi9069"", ""10.1021/acsnano.0c04676"", ""10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03182"", ""10.1136/bmj.m2913"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.16924"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00869-2"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.07.002"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2004973"", ""10.1038/s41467-020-20241-w"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106859"", ""10.1126/science.abg2025"", ""10.1111/ina.12751"", ""10.1126/science.abd9149"", ""10.1136/bmj.321.7262.694"", ""10.1136/bmj.n2061"", ""10.1353/pbm.0.0086"", ""10.1186/s12916-018-1089-4"", ""10.1186/s12874-021-01418-3"", ""10.1136/jech-2019-213085"", ""10.1111/eci.12931"", ""10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004017"", ""10.1503/cmaj.090885"", ""10.1177/1077800405284363"", ""10.1080/03043798808939429"", ""10.1007/s11948-021-00285-x"", ""10.1186/s13012-018-0821-y"", ""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103604""]","['Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'General Health Professions']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Relative to a pre-COVID achievement gap of 1.00 SD, respondents’ median forecasts for the jump in the achievement gaps in elementary school by spring 2021 were large–a change from 1.00 to 1.30 and 1.25 SD for math and reading achievement. Forecasts were similar for 2022. Although forecasts were heterogeneous, respondents showed overwhelming consensus that gaps would grow.

This paper aims to focus on UN developments and the long history of university involvement in sustainability might create more interest and understanding that sustainably oriented universities are actually possible and a much stronger role for higher education is needed when nations are discussing their future. Design/methodology/approach Literature review with a focus on international treaties and declarations on the UN level and international university networks, literature review of the background and potential of the whole-institution approach and the need/suggestions for further research, also to measure advancement. Findings History shows a strong engagement of higher education with sustainability from its beginnings. There have been strong calls/offers from within university networks to take a crucial role in moving towards sustainable development that involves more than teaching about sustainability. The international community calls for higher education to be involved in policymaking rather than simply implementation, have been limited and the full potential of higher education institutions using all opportunities such as being living labs for sustainability has not as yet been realized. Currently, calls for engagement are often still limited to training and providing research when scientific evidence is wanted. Research limitations/implications Literature review focused on UN level treaties/declarations English- and German-language review national developments limited to samples of members of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 subcluster in the Higher Education and Research for Sustainable Development (HESD) Global Cluster by the International Association of Universities (IAU). Practical implications Guidance for university leaders and other stakeholders to become aware of and consider a whole-institution approach. Practitioner relevance as countries is encouraged to embed UN recommendations, treaties and declarations. Defining opportunities for further research. Presenting the HESD Cluster by the IAU as a sample for new approaches of higher education to interact with the SDGs. Social implications Strengthening the role of higher education in the pursuit of a better future would focus on science and research as a neutral basis for decision-making and policy development. Sustainability embedded in all streams of university can help universities to be a practical example of the possibilities of sustainability at work. Originality/value Composition of authors with UN background and involvement. Focus on UN treaties/declarations and guidance for academics and practitioners in leadership on adopted UN and other international documents. Summarizing the background of the whole-institution approach as a genuine development over time but including limitations and implications for future roles for higher education leadership. IAU SDG 4 Subcluster is unique in its own approach and with its connections to a global network of higher education institutions and UNESCO.","[{""name"": ""Katrin Kohl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Charles Hopkins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthias Barth"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gerd Michelsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jana Dlouhá"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dzulkifli Abdul Razak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zainal Abidin Bin Sanusi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isabel Toman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-47889-0_7"", ""10.1108/14676370710817165"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.166"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.239"", ""10.1108/14676370210434705"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-07-2017-0114"", ""10.1108/14676371011031892"", ""10.1080/14797580009367205"", ""10.1111/j.1469-5812.2008.00431.x"", ""10.1177/097340820900300113"", ""10.1108/SAMPJ-09-2013-0037"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-03-2017-0043"", ""10.1108/14676371011010066"", ""10.1080/13504622.2016.1201789"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-02-2019-0103"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-02375-5_8"", ""10.1108/14676370210434714"", ""10.1108/14676370910925262"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.06.007"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-10-2018-0190"", ""10.1007/s11625-012-0157-5""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Education']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

In the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) States, recent long-term policy plans emphasize the ever-increasing need of transition to a knowledge-based economy and preparing highly qualified nationals with credentials in STEM fields to meet the current and future needs of the labor market. Yet, despite multiple educational reforms and substantial resources, national and international indicators of student performance still demonstrate insignificant improvement in GCC students’ achievement in STEM subjects. Demonstrably, the GCC youth still lack interest in STEM careers and represent low enrollment rates in STEM fields. This paper presents the results of a systematic review conducted on STEM education research in GCC countries. The review seeks to contribute to the body of the existing STEM literature, explore the factors influencing student participation in STEM, and identify the gaps in STEM education research in those countries.","[{""name"": ""Fatma Kayan-Fadlelmula"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdellatif Sellami"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nada Abdelkader"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Salman Umer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/2331186X.2019.1580852"", ""10.1155/2020/8886126"", ""10.1016/S0738-0593(97)00002-3"", ""10.1108/JARHE-10-2017-0120"", ""10.1002/tea.20353"", ""10.7771/1541-5015.1349"", ""10.1080/03043797.2011.624174"", ""10.1186/s40594-016-0045-0"", ""10.1111/1467-8624.00273"", ""10.1093/teamat/15.4.141"", ""10.14221/ajte.2015v40n7.8"", ""10.1073/pnas.1804247115"", ""10.2307/2673196"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.2011.00109.x"", ""10.1007/s10763-017-9863-x"", ""10.1002/j.2161-0045.1996.tb00451.x"", ""10.1002/tea.20237"", ""10.1080/09500693.2016.1143137"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1m3p2gh.7"", ""10.1093/qje/qjaa021"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1071899"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2011.620935"", ""10.3102/978-0-935302-42-4_3"", ""10.1080/00461520902832368"", ""10.34293/education.v8i1.1136"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.01235a"", ""10.1080/03050068.2018.1545386"", ""10.1007/s10763-017-9802-x"", ""10.5089/9781451849271.001"", ""10.1007/s10649-014-9550-6"", ""10.1073/pnas.1319030111"", ""10.1080/00228958.2008.10516514"", ""10.1596/978-0-8213-9719-0"", ""10.1615/JWomenMinorScienEng.v12.i2-3.50"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2016.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.appdev.2005.02.007"", ""10.1080/01973533.2016.1209757"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0127-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25304-2_3"", ""10.5430/wje.v7n6p12"", ""10.5430/wje.v9n3p94"", ""10.1080/02635140500068435"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(200003)84:2<180::AID-SCE3>3.0.CO;2-X"", ""10.1353/jda.2017.0056"", ""10.1007/s11422-014-9639-3"", ""10.1080/09500693.2010.518645"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-22201-1_1"", ""10.1007/s40299-018-0424-z"", ""10.1006/jvbe.1994.1027"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2015.08.017"", ""10.1007/s41979-019-00020-z"", ""10.1186/s40594-020-00207-6"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.06.006"", ""10.20897/ejsteme/8468"", ""10.5539/jel.v8n3p202"", ""10.1177/0309132507079501"", ""10.1002/sce.21522"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-10-2019-0148"", ""10.11613/BM.2012.031"", ""10.1080/03050068.2011.553935"", ""10.1080/03057925.2019.1607255"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.1093/bja/aew264"", ""10.1080/03050068.2017.1348018"", ""10.15663/tandc.v18i1.318"", ""10.1177/1478210318774190"", ""10.1080/00220671.2012.667014"", ""10.1087/20150104"", ""10.1080/0305006032000162002"", ""10.1080/0950069032000032199"", ""10.1177/1476718X15614040"", ""10.1007/s10763-015-9656-z"", ""10.1086/506492"", ""10.1080/1046560X.2017.1356671"", ""10.1111/ssm.12185"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2016.1301a"", ""10.5430/ijhe.v8n4p189"", ""10.1186/s40594-017-0068-1"", ""10.1207/s1532480xads0901_3"", ""10.1037/a0021385"", ""10.1080/09500693.2019.1607983"", ""10.1037/a0017364"", ""10.1080/09500693.2018.1540897"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010"", ""10.5430/ijhe.v9n2p1"", ""10.5703/1288284314636"", ""10.1111/dome.12087"", ""10.1007/s10798-019-09508-6""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Safety Research']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.3390/educsci11050249,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Using PLS-SEM Model to Explore the Influencing Factors of Learning Satisfaction in Blended Learning,"This research explores the influencing factors of learning satisfaction in blended learning. Three dimensions are proposed: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and learning motivation. It studied how these variables affect students’ learning satisfaction. The research hypotheses are: (1) Perceived ease of use positively affects perceived usefulness; (2) Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use will have a positive effect on learning motivation; (3) Learning motivation positively affects learning satisfaction; (4) Perceived usefulness has a positive intermediary effect on the relationship between perceived ease of use and learning motivation. Participants included 173 freshmen who took the first-year interactive game design course at Ling Tung University in Taichung, Taiwan. The questionnaire survey method is applied in this research to analyze the relationship between the variables and verify the hypothesis based on the collected 173 valid questionnaires. The partial least square method structural equation model (PLS-SEM) is used to carry out structural equation modeling to study the relationship between latent variables. It explains that the perceived ease of use affects the perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a positive impact on learning motivation. Learning motivation has a positive impact on learning satisfaction. Perceived usefulness as an intermediary factor of perceived ease of use has an indirect impact on learning motivation. The contribution of this research is to provide empirical evidence and explain what factors may affect learning satisfaction. Some other related factors that may affect learning satisfaction should be taken as the factors that teachers should pay attention to when implementing blended learning.","[{""name"": ""Chun-Hsiung Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Digital Content Design, Ling Tung University, Taichung 408213, Taiwan""]}]","[""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.11.003"", ""10.1111/medu.13558"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.09.003"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0087-5"", ""10.2307/3250989"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.024"", ""10.3390/educsci6020015"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.01.004"", ""10.25304/rlt.v25.1981"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2015.05.001"", ""10.12968/bjon.2017.26.2.S4"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09886-3"", ""10.1080/14703290500062516"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.10.028"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.01.003"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.100.2.398"", ""10.2307/27798014"", ""10.1016/j.system.2012.10.014"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.021"", ""10.1080/09588221.2014.941370"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.020"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.12.003"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v18i2.3033"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926"", ""10.1016/j.im.2015.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2011.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2018.02.005"", ""10.2190/B2V7-R91M-6WXR-KCCR"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61542-4_86"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v14i1.1338"", ""10.5480/13-1266"", ""10.7899/JCE-14-28"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007"", ""10.2307/25148720"", ""10.2307/41410402"", ""10.4324/9781410604385"", ""10.1080/10705510903439003"", ""10.1007/BF02723327"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8"", ""10.2753/MTP1069-6679190202"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.3.4.424"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.88.3.588"", ""10.1177/1094428114526928"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173"", ""10.1086/651257""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Desde noviembre de 2022, con la aparición de la herramienta ChatGPT, ha habido un aumento exponencial en el uso de la inteligencia artificial en todos los ámbitos. Aunque ChatGPT es solo una de las muchas tecnologías generativas de inteligencia artificial, su impacto en los procesos de enseñanza y aprendizaje ha sido notable. Este artículo reflexiona sobre las ventajas, inconvenientes, potencialidades, límites y retos de las tecnologías generativas de inteligencia artificial en educación, con el objetivo de evitar los sesgos propios de las posiciones extremistas. Para ello, se ha llevado a cabo una revisión sistemática tanto de las herramientas como de la producción científica que ha surgido en los seis primeros meses desde la aparición de ChatGPT. La inteligencia artificial generativa es extremadamente potente y mejora a un ritmo acelerado, pero se basa en lenguajes de modelo de gran tamaño con una base probabilística, lo que significa que no tienen capacidad de razonamiento ni de comprensión y, por tanto, son susceptibles de contener fallos que necesitan ser contrastados. Por otro lado, muchos de los problemas asociados con estas tecnologías en contextos educativos ya existían antes de su aparición, pero ahora, debido a su potencia, no podemos ignorarlos solo queda asumir cuál será nuestra velocidad de respuesta para analizar e incorporar estas herramientas a nuestra práctica docente.","[{""name"": ""Francisco José García Peñalvo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Faraón Llorens-Largo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Javier Vidal"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],['Computer Science Applications'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Our sample consisted of 108 undergraduate students from two universities, one located in the Netherlands (NL) and one in the United States (US). Students’ self-reported intercultural competence was measured using a pre-post survey which included the Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) and Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ). Qualitative data were collected to complement our quantitative findings and to give a deeper insight into the student experience. The data showed a significantly bigger increase in intercultural competence for the US experimental group compared to the US control group, supporting our hypothesis that COIL develops intercultural competence. This difference was not observed for the NL students, possibly due to the NL control group being exposed to other international input during the course.","[{""name"": ""Simone Hackett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jeroen Janssen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pamela Beach"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Melanie Perreault"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jos Beelen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan van Tartwijk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1740-8784.2007.00082.x"", ""10.14705/rpnet.2019.29.9782490057337"", ""10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.02.009"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2013-0036"", ""10.1007/s11412-007-9032-2"", ""10.1097/NNE.0000000000000609"", ""10.1177/1028315319826226"", ""10.6017/ihe.2015.83.9073"", ""10.1177/1028315306287002"", ""10.1002/ir.381"", ""10.4135/9781452218397.n16"", ""10.1515/9780804766005"", ""10.1080/13678868.2013.856206"", ""10.5465/amle.2012.0200"", ""10.2797/851121"", ""10.1177/0969776406065429"", ""10.1002/ets2.12112"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0244425"", ""10.1002/ijop.12647"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65291-3_27"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-70892-8_1"", ""10.3102/0013189X033007014"", ""10.5539/ies.v13n7p145"", ""10.1177/1028315303260832"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.12.092"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2007.01.004"", ""10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-031413-091229"", ""10.1177/1028315320963507"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.03.001"", ""10.24059/olj.v25i1.2471"", ""10.4067/S0718-27242016000100005"", ""10.1080/09500790.2010.495984"", ""10.1177/0022022113492891"", ""10.1177/1098048220948522"", ""10.1080/14703297.2021.1895867"", ""10.1007/BF02213419"", ""10.14705/rpnet.2018.jve.1"", ""10.1080/00223891.2013.843181"", ""10.4018/978-1-7998-8921-2.ch018"", ""10.1080/09588221.2020.1737546"", ""10.13189/ujer.2020.080412"", ""10.1080/01434632.2015.1073737"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.291"", ""10.4135/9781071872987.n1"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.01.141"", ""10.1080/13511610.2019.1597685"", ""10.1075/sar.1.1.05tra"", ""10.1080/14703297.2020.1792331"", ""10.33612/diss.119789093"", ""10.1002/1099-0984(200007/08)14:4<291::AID-PER377>3.0.CO;2-6"", ""10.1006/jrpe.2001.2320"", ""10.1080/00223891.2012.718302"", ""10.6017/ihe.2014.78.5801"", ""10.1002/psp.1833"", ""10.5465/amle.2012.0289"", ""10.1037/a0018634"", ""10.1080/15528014.2022.2069441"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2006.02.001"", ""10.21827/jve.4.37582""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Education', 'Communication']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

However, learners often face challenges in properly applying SRL in online learning environments. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications have shown promise in supporting learners’ self-regulation in online learning by measuring and augmenting SRL, but research in this area is still in its early stages. The purpose of this study is to explore students’ perceptions of the use of AI applications to support SRL and to identify the pedagogical and psychological aspects that they perceive as necessary for effective utilization of those AI applications. To explore this, a speed dating method using storyboards was employed as an exploratory design method. The study involved the development of 10 AI application storyboards to identify the phases and areas of SRL, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 university students from various majors. The results indicated that learners perceived AI applications as useful for supporting metacognitive, cognitive, and behavioral regulation across different SRL areas, but not for regulating motivation. Next, regarding the use of AI applications to support SRL, learners requested consideration of three pedagogical and psychological aspects: learner identity, learner activeness, and learner position. The findings of this study offer practical implications for the design of AI applications in online learning, with the aim of supporting students’ SRL.","[{""name"": ""Sung-Hee Jin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kowoon Im"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mina Yoo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ido Roll"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kyoungwon Seo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.17718/tojde.598191"", ""10.1007/s11251-011-9167-4"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00218-x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104094"", ""10.1145/3196709.3196770"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.006"", ""10.1080/00461520.2010.515935"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027451"", ""10.1037/a0019682"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103771"", ""10.1109/TLT.2021.3126388"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100758"", ""10.1007/s12369-017-0458-z"", ""10.3402/meo.v20.28694"", ""10.1080/14703297.2020.1794928"", ""10.1177/0735633117707696"", ""10.1007/s11251-011-9165-6"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.10.001"", ""10.1007/s00146-022-01401-6"", ""10.1080/00131881.2014.934557"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(85)90062-8"", ""10.1007/978-0-85729-224-7_22"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.12.003"", ""10.4324/9781351113038-4"", ""10.1145/3313831.3376311"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.019"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00422"", ""10.1007/s10648-004-0006-x"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.1.33"", ""10.18608/jla.2015.21.2"", ""10.1111/bjet.12858"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0113-2"", ""10.1006/ceps.1994.1033"", ""10.4135/9781529682571"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4002_3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104132"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00292-9"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2020.05.096"", ""10.1109/JCDL52503.2021.00026"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.07.018"", ""10.1145/1142405.1142410"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2012.04.002"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.2.2.131"", ""10.1080/10447318.2018.1543084"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-13388-6_37"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.81.3.329"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50031-7"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1016"", ""10.3102/0002831207312909"", ""10.1080/00461520.2013.794676"", ""10.3102/00028312023004614""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.12992,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Multimodal learning analytics for game-based learning,"AbstractA distinctive feature of game‐based learning environments is their capacity to create learning experiences that are both effective and engaging. Recent advances in sensor‐based technologies such as facial expression analysis and gaze tracking have introduced the opportunity to leverage multimodal data streams for learning analytics. Learning analytics informed by multimodal data captured during students’ interactions with game‐based learning environments hold significant promise for developing a deeper understanding of game‐based learning, designing game‐based learning environments to detect maladaptive behaviors and informing adaptive scaffolding to support individualized learning. This paper introduces a multimodal learning analytics approach that incorporates student gameplay, eye tracking and facial expression data to predict student posttest performance and interest after interacting with a game‐based learning environment, Crystal Island. We investigated the degree to which separate and combined modalities (ie, gameplay, facial expressions of emotions and eye gaze) captured from students (n = 65) were predictive of student posttest performance and interest after interacting with Crystal Island. Results indicate that when predicting student posttest performance and interest, models utilizing multimodal data either perform equally well or outperform models utilizing unimodal data. We discuss the synergistic effects of combining modalities for predicting both student interest and posttest performance. The findings suggest that multimodal learning analytics can accurately predict students’ posttest performance and interest during game‐based learning and hold significant potential for guiding real‐time adaptive scaffolding.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Emerson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth B.

10.1111/bjet.13114,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Learning with technology during emergencies: A systematic review of K-12 education,"AbstractEmergency situations that cause damage to educational buildings or require the closure of schools due to unsafe health, environmental, or political conditions can be an unwelcomed interruption to education. Indeed, the recent COVID‐19 pandemic created the largest disruption of education in history, affecting 94% of the world's student population. In emergencies, technology is often utilised as part of a crisis response protocol by continuing education using emergency remote education (ERE). The purpose of this study is to determine how technology has been used to continue K‐12 learning remotely during an emergency. This systematic review included an aggregated and configurative synthesis to examine extant empirical work over eleven years, from January 2010 to December 2020. Following a rigorous, PRISMA selection process, 60 articles were included in the final analysis from 48 countries. Grounded coding of the strategies used for learning revealed the following categories: communication, delivery systems, student ERE readiness, partnerships, promoting student learning and engagement, and resources. Grounded coding of the technologies revealed that types of technologies used were divided into two major categories: Internet‐based and non‐Internet based, with the majority using Internet‐based technologies. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic The COVID‐19 pandemic has caused school closures across the globe and prevented in‐person school teaching. The rapid shift to distance education in schools can be conceptualised as ‘emergency remote education’ (ERE). Prior ERE research focused on bounded geographic locations where localised emergencies occurred. What this paper adds This provides the scholarly community with a unique systematic review of existing academic research on K‐12 ERE implementation in emergencies. This provides aggregated data and analysis on the past 11 years of the types of emergencies, participants, subject domain, technologies used, and location information. This provides findings of the types of remote teaching strategies involving technology used to continue K‐12 learning in emergency situations. This provides a set of recommendations on ERE for teachers, school leaders, policy makers, and funders. This provides researchers with a review of the field with identification of gaps and future research opportunities. Implications for practice and/or policy Recommendations regarding ERE are provided in this paper that will be of benefit to K‐12 teachers, school leaders policymakers, and funders in the continuing COVID‐19 pandemic and future emergencies. The research gaps highlighted in this paper, such as the lack of studies conducted in low and low middle‐income countries, are presented with suggestions for much needed future research. This can lead to changes in practice and policy.","[{""name"": ""Helen Crompton"", ""affiliation"": [""Teaching and Learning Old Dominion University Norfolk VA USA""]}, {""name"": ""Diane Burke"", ""affiliation"": [""Keuka College Keuka Park NY USA""]}, {""name"": ""Katy Jordan"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education University of Cambridge Cambridge UK""]}, {""name"": ""Samuel W.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000004118,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,How Are the Arts and Humanities Used in Medical Education? Results of a Scoping Review,"Purpose Although focused reviews have characterized subsets of the literature on the arts and humanities in medical education, a large-scale overview of the field is needed to inform efforts to strengthen these approaches in medicine. Method The authors conducted a scoping review in 2019 to identify how the arts and humanities are used to educate physicians and interprofessional learners across the medical education continuum in Canada and the United States. A search strategy involving 7 databases identified 21,985 citations. Five reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts. Full-text screening followed (n = 4,649). Of these, 769 records met the inclusion criteria. The authors performed descriptive and statistical analyses and conducted semistructured interviews with 15 stakeholders. Results The literature is dominated by conceptual works (n = 294) that critically engaged with arts and humanities approaches or generally called for their use in medical education, followed by program descriptions (n = 255). The literary arts (n = 197) were most common. Less than a third of records explicitly engaged theory as a strong component (n = 230). Of descriptive and empirical records (n = 424), more than half concerned undergraduate medical education (n = 245). There were gaps in the literature on interprofessional education, program evaluation, and learner assessment. Programming was most often taught by medical faculty who published their initiatives (n = 236). Absent were voices of contributing artists, docents, and other arts and humanities practitioners from outside medicine. Stakeholders confirmed that these findings resonated with their experiences. Conclusions This literature is characterized by brief, episodic installments, privileging a biomedical orientation and largely lacking a theoretical frame to weave the installments into a larger story that accumulates over time and across subfields. These findings should inform efforts to promote, integrate, and study uses of the arts and humanities in medical education.","[{""name"": ""Tracy Moniz"", ""affiliation"": [""T.

10.1111/bjet.13056,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,From experiencing to expressing: A virtual reality approach to facilitating pupils' descriptive paper writing performance and learning behavior engagement,"AbstractDue to the lack of life experience and situational experience, it is difficult to arouse pupils’ inner motivation and interest in writing. Therefore, the early stage of Chinese writing may be a challenge for Chinese pupils. In order to solve this problem, a spherical video‐based virtual reality (SVVR) experience learning system was developed to help pupils improve their writing performance and interest. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was carried out in a primary school in Zhejiang province, China. First, a writing pretest was administered in two grade 4 classes. The researchers then randomly selected 40 pupils of about 10 years old with similar writing abilities, and assigned them to an experimental group, which used the SVVR learning method, and a control group, which used the traditional learning method. The researchers observed and recorded the pupils’ writing process and then, interviewed them. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the comprehensive writing performance of the two groups (F = 6.272; p = .017 &lt; .05). The mean of the experimental group (Mean = 73.85) was higher than that of the control group (Mean = 70.00). Moreover, there were significant differences between the two groups in terms of the thematic coherence, structural integrity and linguistic expressiveness of their writing performance. However, there was no significant difference in the achievement of creative thinking. In the experimental group, different levels of learning behavior engagement could affect the structural integrity and language expression of writing achievements, and the degree of writing learning behavior engagement was highly correlated with reading time. Through the interviews, it was found that the pupils in the experimental group were more satisfied with the SVVR learning method than the control group pupils were with the traditional learning method. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic? Spherical video‐based virtual reality (SVVR) set a simulated environment enabling students to have in‐depth experience in learning contexts. Most SVVR studies focused on speaking and writing in middle schools and colleges, while its impacts on young children’s writing performance is generally ignored. What this paper adds? An SVVR system based on experiencing learning theory was developed to promote young students’ in‐depth experience and perception in descriptive paper writing. The proposed approach promoted students’ writing performances, writing experience and learning behavior engagement.

10.1002/cae.22354,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,"Fostering STEAM through challenge-based learning, robotics, and physical devices: A systematic mapping literature review","AbstractNowadays, companies are demanding better‐prepared professionals to succeed in a digital society, and the acquisition of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM)‐related competencies is a key issue. One of the main problems in this sense is how to integrate STEAM into the current educational curricula. This is not something related to a subject or educational trend but rather to new methodological approaches that can engage students. In this sense, such active methodologies that apply mechatronics and robotics could be an interesting path to pursue. Given this context, the first necessary task in evaluating the potential of this approach is to understand the landscape of the application of robotics and mechatronics in STEAM Education and how active methodologies are applied in this sense. To carry out this analysis in a systematic and replicable manner, it is necessary to follow a methodology. In this case, the researchers employ a systematic mapping review. This paper presents this process and its main findings. Fifty‐four studies have been selected out of 242 total studies analyzed. From these, beyond obtaining a clear vision of the STEAM landscape regarding project topics, we can also conclude that robotics and physical devices have been applied successfully with collaborative methodologies in STEAM Education. Regarding conclusions, this paper shows that robotics and mechatronics applied with active methodologies is to be a good means to engage students in STEAM disciplines and thus aid the acquisition of what is commonly known as “21st‐century skills.”","[{""name"": ""Miguel Á.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003496,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Changing How Race Is Portrayed in Medical Education: Recommendations From Medical Students,"The medical community has been complicit in legitimizing claims of racial difference throughout the history of the United States. Unfortunately, a rigorous examination of the role medicine plays in perpetuating inequity across racial lines is often missing in medical school curricula due to time constraints and other challenges inherent to medical education. The imprecise use of race—a social construct—as a proxy for pathology in medical education is a vestige of institutionalized racism. Recent examples are presented that illustrate how attributing outcomes to race may contribute to bias and unequal care. This paper proposes the following recommendations for guiding efforts to mitigate the adverse effects associated with the use of race in medical education: emphasize the need for incoming students to be familiar with how race can influence health outcomes; provide opportunities to hold open conversations about race in medicine among medical school faculty, students, and staff; craft and implement protocols that address and correct the inappropriate use of race in medical school classes and course materials; and encourage a large cultural shift within the field of medicine. Adoption of an interdisciplinary approach that taps into many fields, including ethics, history, sociology, evolutionary genetics, and public health is a necessary step for cultivating more thoughtful physicians who will be better prepared to care for patients of all racial and ethnic backgrounds.","[{""name"": ""Edwin Nieblas-Bedolla"", ""affiliation"": [""is a second-year student, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Briana Christophers"", ""affiliation"": [""is a second-year MD-PhD student, Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, New York, New York; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Naomi T.

In light of this, our study, integrating Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate factors influencing 568 Chinese English learners’ use of large language models for vocabulary learning. Our findings identified six significant factors from those models—perceived autonomy, perceived competence, perceived relatedness, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence—that significantly shape learners’ intentions and behaviors towards utilizing large language models for vocabulary learning. Notably, effort expectancy emerged as the most influential factor, while facilitating conditions did not significantly impact usage intentions.

Because there are growing concerns about the suboptimal efficiencies of poultry production and its impact on environmental sustainability, much attention has been paid to the formulation of low-protein diets and precision nutrition through the addition of low-cost crystalline AAs or alternative sources of animal-protein feedstuffs. This necessitates a better understanding of AA nutrition and metabolism in chickens. Although historic nutrition research has focused on nutritionally essential amino acids (EAAs) that are not synthesized or are inadequately synthesized in the body, increasing evidence shows that the traditionally classified nutritionally nonessential amino acids (NEAAs), such as glutamine and glutamate, have physiological and regulatory roles other than protein synthesis in chicken growth and egg production. In addition, like other avian species, chickens do not synthesize adequately glycine or proline (the most abundant AAs in the body but present in plant-source feedstuffs at low content) relative to their nutritional and physiological needs. Therefore, these two AAs must be sufficient in poultry diets. Animal proteins (including ruminant meat &amp; bone meal and hydrolyzed feather meal) are abundant sources of both glycine and proline in chicken nutrition. Clearly, chickens (including broilers and laying hens) have dietary requirements for all proteinogenic AAs to achieve their maximum productivity and maintain optimum health particularly under adverse conditions such as heat stress and disease. This is a paradigm shift in poultry nutrition from the 70-year-old “ideal protein” concept that concerned only about EAAs to the focus of functional AAs that include both EAAs and NEAAs.","[{""name"": ""Wenliang He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peng Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guoyao Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s00726-020-02821-8"", ""10.3382/japr.2014-00980"", ""10.1016/j.bbr.2006.02.005"", ""10.1093/jn/103.7.999"", ""10.4081/ijas.2014.3297"", ""10.17582/journal.aavs/2019/7.s2.26.33"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-817052-6.00021-5"", ""10.1007/s00726-008-0198-3"", ""10.3382/ps.0731441"", ""10.3382/ps.0471376"", ""10.1017/S1751731117000660"", ""10.3382/ps.0690934"", ""10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.060"", ""10.3382/ps.0630717"", ""10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2004.11.007"", ""10.1146/annurev.nu.15.070195.001025"", ""10.3382/ps.0440803"", ""10.1590/1806-9061-2017-0707"", ""10.5713/ajas.2010.90611"", ""10.1080/03079457.2010.539590"", ""10.1007/s00726-012-1272-4"", ""10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.04.042"", ""10.1016/S0899-9007(02)00916-4"", ""10.1016/0003-9861(54)90506-8"", ""10.1152/ajpregu.1996.271.5.R1149"", ""10.1017/S1751731113000347"", ""10.1093/jn/135.4.714"", ""10.3382/ps.2010-00801"", ""10.3382/ps.0520892"", ""10.1007/s00726-008-0164-0"", ""10.1007/s00726-008-0204-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45328-2_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-54462-1_12"", ""10.3945/an.116.012971"", ""10.1007/s00726-018-2634-3"", ""10.1186/s40104-017-0153-9"", ""10.1007/s00726-019-02751-0"", ""10.1111/jpn.12346"", ""10.3382/japr/pfw021"", ""10.1016/j.neulet.2003.09.071"", ""10.3945/jn.108.096362"", ""10.1016/j.japr.2019.10.014"", ""10.1016/S0006-8993(99)02466-X"", ""10.1016/S0021-9258(18)81373-4"", ""10.3382/ps.0390039"", ""10.3382/ps.2011-01919"", ""10.1093/jn/69.3.289"", ""10.1007/s00726-017-2490-6"", ""10.1007/s00726-020-02833-4"", ""10.1007/s00726-010-0740-y"", ""10.1007/s00726-020-02851-2"", ""10.1007/s00726-020-02824-5"", ""10.1017/S0007114516004190"", ""10.3382/ps.0550045"", ""10.1079/9780851993782.0003"", ""10.2527/af.2017.0441"", ""10.1002/vms3.195"", ""10.1007/s00726-006-0404-0"", ""10.1007/s00726-007-0573-5"", ""10.1007/s00726-017-2510-6"", ""10.1016/j.livsci.2017.02.005"", ""10.3382/ps.2013-03171"", ""10.1590/1806-9061-2017-0620"", ""10.1042/bj1880619"", ""10.1093/jn/51.3.413"", ""10.1093/jn/130.4.978S"", ""10.3390/nu11030684"", ""10.3382/ps.0521219"", ""10.3382/ps.0521970"", ""10.1007/s00726-011-0875-5"", ""10.1016/S0021-9258(17)44168-8"", ""10.1007/s00726-008-0148-0"", ""10.1002/jsfa.6692"", ""10.1042/bj2400829"", ""10.1016/j.brainresbull.2004.01.002"", ""10.1111/j.1740-0929.2005.00263.x"", ""10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.12.007"", ""10.1007/s00726-019-02762-x"", ""10.1007/s00726-013-1493-1"", ""10.1007/s00726-014-1758-3"", ""10.1016/j.cbpc.2004.12.009"", ""10.1016/S0021-9258(19)68734-X"", ""10.1017/S0007114513002419"", ""10.1071/AN19305"", ""10.1007/s00726-009-0269-0"", ""10.3945/an.110.1008"", ""10.1201/b14661"", ""10.1186/2049-1891-5-34"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-817052-6.00027-6"", ""10.1007/s00726-020-02823-6"", ""10.1016/0020-711X(87)90175-3"", ""10.1042/bj2650593"", ""10.1042/bj2740769"", ""10.1093/jn/124.12.2437"", ""10.1042/bj3060717"", ""10.1016/S0305-0491(98)10018-4"", ""10.1007/s00726-010-0715-z"", ""10.2527/jas.2010-3614"", ""10.1089/ars.2017.7338"", ""10.1007/s00726-018-2631-6"", ""10.1007/s00726-008-0203-x"", ""10.1111/j.1740-0929.2009.00625.x"", ""10.1002/jez.1402160216"", ""10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.105031"", ""10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.06.041"", ""10.1111/jpn.13214"", ""10.3382/japr/pfw004"", ""10.3382/ps/pew253"", ""10.1177/1559325817708674""]","['Nursing', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Animal Science and Zoology', 'Nutrition and Dietetics', 'Aquatic Science']","[[('1011 护理学', 0.7465), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7157), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7101), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7061), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7035)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7727), ('0906 兽医学', 0.7603)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7392), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7295)], [('0908 水产', 0.7739), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7632)]]"

For wearable devices to be practical, they must be responsive, deformable to fit the wearer, and robust to the user's range of motion. Signals produced by the wearable must also be informative enough to infer the precise physical state or activity of the user. Herein, a fully soft, wearable glove is developed, which is capable of real‐time hand pose reconstruction, environment sensing, and task classification. The design is easy to fabricate using low cost, commercial off‐the‐shelf items in a manner that is amenable to automated manufacturing. To realize such capabilities, resisitive and fluidic sensing technologies with machine learning neural architectures are merged. The glove is formed from a conductive knit which is strain sensitive, providing information through a network of resistance measurements. Fluidic sensing captured via pressure changes in fibrous sewn‐in flexible tubes, measuring interactions with the environment. The system can reconstruct user hand pose and identify sensory inputs such as holding force, object temperature, conductability, material stiffness, and user heart rate, all with high accuracy. The ability to identify complex environmentally dependent tasks, including held object identification and handwriting recognition is demonstrated.","[{""name"": ""Josie Hughes"", ""affiliation"": [""Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Cambridge MA 02139 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew Spielberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Cambridge MA 02139 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Chounlakone"", ""affiliation"": [""Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Cambridge MA 02139 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Gloria Chang"", ""affiliation"": [""Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Cambridge MA 02139 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Wojciech Matusik"", ""affiliation"": [""Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Cambridge MA 02139 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Daniela Rus"", ""affiliation"": [""Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Cambridge MA 02139 USA""]}]","[""10.1109/TRO.2009.2033627"", ""10.1038/nature14543"", ""10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2021255"", ""10.1177/1545968306289299"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2016.04.121"", ""10.1021/acsnano.7b04898"", ""10.1088/0960-1317/20/12/125029"", ""10.1002/adfm.201602733"", ""10.1145/1531326.1531369"", ""10.5772/50093"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889481"", ""10.1016/j.bspc.2007.09.001"", ""10.1038/nmat4671"", ""10.1039/c3nr05496a"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-12654-3_19"", ""10.1145/3311972"", ""10.3390/s18113822"", ""10.1039/C7MH00071E"", ""10.3390/s140712748"", ""10.1557/adv.2016.498"", ""10.1109/ISSMDBS.2006.360082"", ""10.1016/j.sse.2015.05.024"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2016.2583542"", ""10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100898"", ""10.1145/3356250.3360040"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1234-z"", ""10.1039/C7LC00914C"", ""10.1177/1528083715619948"", ""10.3390/s130811114"", ""10.3390/s140304712"", ""10.3390/s130506380"", ""10.1145/3130800.3130830""]","['Engineering', 'Neuroscience']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

A range of material has been drawn upon to highlight educational issues of this learning context, including psychosocial and emotional repercussions. Globally, while some countries opted for a mass school shut-down, many schools remained open for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This partial closure not only enabled learning in smaller targeted groups but also offered a safe sanctuary for those who needed a regulated and secure environment. In Australia, if full school closures were to be enforced over a long period, a significant proportion of students from more vulnerable backgrounds would likely experience persistent disadvantage through a range of barriers: long-term educational disengagement, digital exclusion, poor technology management, and increased psychosocial challenges. This scoping review combines research on technology availability and learning, with analysis of the long-term educational impacts of navigating the COVID-19 disruption.","[{""name"": ""Catherine F.

10.1002/cae.22333,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Virtual reality learning environment for enhancing electronics engineering laboratory experience,"AbstractEngineering laboratory courses have a significant role in building practical knowledge and enhancing the skills of the students. While working in electronics laboratories, students often operate complicated laboratory equipment and juggle through a set of multiple knobs and buttons to configure the equipment(s). It takes a lot of practice to master the skill of operating the laboratory equipment and it becomes difficult for students to operate the equipment without any prior experience. Virtual reality (VR) is the emerging technology and has the potential to provide a better learning experience to the students. In this paper, a VR‐based learning environment (VLE) is developed, which aims to give prior training to the engineering students about the electronics laboratory hardware. An experimental study was conducted to measure the effectiveness of VR on student knowledge development, learning motivation, and cognition. The study was conducted among the 65 engineering students and they were randomly divided into two groups: treatment group (N = 33) and control group (N = 32). The students of the treatment group were taught with the VR approach and students of the control group were taught with a conventional teaching approach. The outcomes of the experiment indicate that VR has a significant positive impact on student knowledge, learning motivation, and cognition.

10.1186/s13643-020-01443-1,SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,0401 Education,Understanding the mental health of doctoral researchers: a mixed methods systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-synthesis,"AbstractBackgroundData from studies with undergraduate and postgraduate taught students suggest that they are at an increased risk of having mental health problems, compared to the general population. By contrast, the literature on doctoral researchers (DRs) is far more disparate and unclear. There is a need to bring together current findings and identify what questions still need to be answered.MethodsWe conducted a mixed methods systematic review to summarise the research on doctoral researchers’ (DRs) mental health. Our search revealed 52 articles that were included in this review.ResultsThe results of our meta-analysis found that DRs reported significantly higher stress levels compared with population norm data. Using meta-analyses and meta-synthesis techniques, we found the risk factors with the strongest evidence base were isolation and identifying as female. Social support, viewing the PhD as a process, a positive student-supervisor relationship and engaging in self-care were the most well-established protective factors.ConclusionsWe have identified a critical need for researchers to better coordinate data collection to aid future reviews and allow for clinically meaningful conclusions to be drawn.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO registration CRD42018092867","[{""name"": ""Cassie M.

To enhance student engagement in large university classes, this study examined the effects of self‐efficacy, self‐regulation and social presence on learning engagement in a large university class using a flipped learning approach. A total of 390 undergraduates who were enrolled in a large general education class using flipped learning at a university in Korea participated in this study. The learners completed an online survey measuring the variables of this study. The research findings indicated that self‐regulation affected social presence as well as learning engagement. Self‐efficacy affected social presence and indirectly affected learning engagement through social presence. Finally, social presence affected learning engagement. Social presence also mediated the relationship between self‐efficacy and learning engagement as well as between self‐regulation and learning engagement. This study confirmed the significant effects of self‐regulation and social presence on students' learning engagement in large university classes.","[{""name"": ""Min Young Doo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Education Sejong University Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Curtis J.

10.1002/ase.2020,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,Spotlight on the Shift to Remote Anatomical Teaching During Covid-19 Pandemic: Perspectives and Experiences from the University of Malta,"Covid‐19 has spread globally, affecting all nations. Preventive measures were implemented by governments including the closure of universities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the student's perspectives and experiences on the shift to remote preclinical medical education while inquiring whether there has been any psychological impact on the students. A customized questionnaire utilizing Likert‐scale‐based questions and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 assessment tool was distributed online to enrolled preclinical medical students at the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Malta. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data gathered was carried out. Multivariate logistic regression analyses was performed to establish independent variables associated with anxiety symptoms. A total of 172 responded out of a cohort of 299 preclinical students (58%). The majority perceived a positive learning experience following the shift to remote lectures, however, it was not the case for small group teaching including dissection sessions. Nonetheless students reported concerns about their education, examinations, progression to next academic year and wellbeing. Less than half the students exhibited symptoms of anxiety. Students exhibiting “moderate” worry (OR:7.6; CI 95%:1.98–29.31; P &lt; 0.01) and “severe” worry (OR: 2.0; CI 95%: 5.0–80.5; P &lt; 0.01) on their mental, emotional, and wellbeing due to Covid‐19 were associated with anxiety symptoms after adjusting for cofounders. Apart from the short‐term effects, the Covid‐19 pandemic may have a long‐term impact on both the medical education and the students' future careers. It is important that the implemented changes in medical education are recorded and studied since such data will be essential on how to proceed post‐Covid‐19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Cuschieri"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Anatomy Faculty of Medicine and Surgery University of Malta Msida Malta""]}, {""name"": ""Jean Calleja Agius"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Anatomy Faculty of Medicine and Surgery University of Malta Msida Malta""]}]","[""10.1002/ase.1751"", ""10.1002/jmv.25706"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30309-3"", ""10.1002/ase.1550"", ""10.1136/bmj.a1310"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002079"", ""10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035"", ""10.1002/ase.1963"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0757-3"", ""10.1002/ase.1966"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-00896-7"", ""10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105026"", ""10.1001/jama.287.9.1180-JMS0306-4-1"", ""10.1152/advan.00007.2017"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934"", ""10.1002/ase.254"", ""10.15694/mep.2016.000033"", ""10.1111/medu.14206"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000007528"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-146-5-200703060-00004"", ""10.1007/s40037-015-0192-x"", ""10.1002/ase.1967"", ""10.1002/ase.1968"", ""10.1002/ase.1810"", ""10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102066"", ""10.1002/ase.1962"", ""10.1016/j.sleep.2020.04.019"", ""10.1016/j.morpho.2020.05.003"", ""10.1002/ase.1454"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003401"", ""10.1001/archinte.166.10.1092"", ""10.1002/ase.1970"", ""10.1136/ebm.11.6.184"", ""10.1111/medu.14181"", ""10.1002/ase.1620"", ""10.1308/003588407X168244"", ""10.1016/j.bja.2020.05.025"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000015337"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30089-4""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1002/sce.21622,SCIENCE EDUCATION,0401 Education,Scientific modeling and translanguaging: A multilingual and multimodal approach to support science learning and engagement,"AbstractResearch suggests that translanguaging can be transformative for teaching and learning by making students' diverse linguistic resources a meaningful part of classroom discourse. Building on this study, researchers have explored how translanguaging practices can support learning in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), primarily in the context of bilingual classrooms. However, in the United States, most students learn in English‐dominant classrooms. In response, researchers and educators have begun to explore strategies for inviting and leveraging translanguaging in English‐dominant classrooms, primarily focusing on literacy learning. Less is known about supporting translanguaging in English‐dominant STEM classrooms, particularly with monolingual teachers. In an English‐dominant sixth‐grade STEM classroom engaging in a 9‐week ecology unit, we explored how scientific modeling could not only provide a context for inviting translanguaging, but how it could also provide a setting where modeling and translanguaging could be experienced as analogous meaning‐making practices. Our findings demonstrate that translanguaging has the potential to support new kinds of learning in English‐dominant STEM classrooms, not only about STEM content and practices but also about what counts as legitimate and valuable participation in these spaces.","[{""name"": ""Ashlyn E.

10.1186/s40594-021-00295-y,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,STEM stereotypes predict students' STEM career interest via self-efficacy and outcome expectations,"AbstractBackgroundNurturing students’ interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers is a major goal of STEM education. Although the relationship between students’ stereotypical beliefs regarding STEM careers and their career interest can be reasonably hypothesized, research investigating the extent to which and how students’ STEM career interest is directly or indirectly influenced by their stereotypical beliefs is lacking. This study investigated how upper primary students’ stereotypical beliefs regarding STEM careers predicted their STEM self-efficacy and STEM career-related outcome expectations and how these constructs predicted their STEM career interest. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse quantitative survey data of 824 fourth- to sixth-grade students and test the hypothesized models.ResultsStudents’ stereotypical beliefs regarding STEM careers negatively predicted their self-efficacy in STEM activities and career-related outcome expectations. Additionally, the students’ self-efficacy in STEM activities and career-related outcome expectations in turn predicted their STEM career interest.ConclusionsThese results explain the potential indirect effect of STEM stereotypes on students’ career interest through self-efficacy and outcome expectations. The findings highlight the significant role of STEM stereotypes, self-efficacy in STEM activities, and career-related outcome expectations in students’ career development. The implications of this study for STEM education are also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Tian Luo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Winnie Wing Mui So"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhi Hong Wan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wai Chin Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/0021-843X.112.4.545"", ""10.1080/02635143.2013.865601"", ""10.1080/14681366.2012.748676"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.88.3.588"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0118-3"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00015.x"", ""10.1177/1948550611405218"", ""10.1007/s11165-012-9315-0"", ""10.1177/0956797610377342"", ""10.1007/s10956-008-9133-3"", ""10.1007/s42330-020-00105-7"", ""10.1080/0263514022000030453"", ""10.1177/1069072716665825"", ""10.1177/0894845316633860"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.28.6.545"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2020.103427"", ""10.1002/tea.20363"", ""10.1080/09500693.2012.749362"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1111/ssm.12043"", ""10.1007/s11165-013-9389-3"", ""10.1006/jvbe.1994.1027"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2014.11.004"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.47.1.36"", ""10.1037/cou0000243"", ""10.1177/0894845319884652"", ""10.1007/s10956-020-09882-0"", ""10.1080/09500690902759053"", ""10.1177/1069072713515427"", ""10.1002/ir.411"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.54.3.320"", ""10.1080/15391523.2010.10782557"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1017863"", ""10.1080/00220679909597600"", ""10.1007/s10956-012-9430-8"", ""10.1002/sce.21007"", ""10.1007/s10763-017-9847-x"", ""10.1007/s10956-012-9425-5"", ""10.3200/JOER.99.6.323-338"", ""10.1037/a0036219"", ""10.1007/s10763-017-9828-0"", ""10.1002/tea.21506"", ""10.1007/s10798-015-9308-1"", ""10.1037/14646-000"", ""10.3102/0002831213488622"", ""10.1177/0049124187016001005"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1016""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Safety Research']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1186/s40594-020-00208-5,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Rubrics to assess critical thinking and information processing in undergraduate STEM courses,"Abstract Background Process skills such as critical thinking and information processing are commonly stated outcomes for STEM undergraduate degree programs, but instructors often do not explicitly assess these skills in their courses. Students are more likely to develop these crucial skills if there is constructive alignment between an instructor’s intended learning outcomes, the tasks that the instructor and students perform, and the assessment tools that the instructor uses. Rubrics for each process skill can enhance this alignment by creating a shared understanding of process skills between instructors and students. Rubrics can also enable instructors to reflect on their teaching practices with regard to developing their students’ process skills and facilitating feedback to students to identify areas for improvement. Results Here, we provide rubrics that can be used to assess critical thinking and information processing in STEM undergraduate classrooms and to provide students with formative feedback. As part of the Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills in STEM (ELIPSS) Project, rubrics were developed to assess these two skills in STEM undergraduate students’ written work. The rubrics were implemented in multiple STEM disciplines, class sizes, course levels, and institution types to ensure they were practical for everyday classroom use. Instructors reported via surveys that the rubrics supported assessment of students’ written work in multiple STEM learning environments. Graduate teaching assistants also indicated that they could effectively use the rubrics to assess student work and that the rubrics clarified the instructor’s expectations for how they should assess students. Students reported that they understood the content of the rubrics and could use the feedback provided by the rubric to change their future performance. Conclusion The ELIPSS rubrics allowed instructors to explicitly assess the critical thinking and information processing skills that they wanted their students to develop in their courses. The instructors were able to clarify their expectations for both their teaching assistants and students and provide consistent feedback to students about their performance. Supporting the adoption of active-learning pedagogies should also include changes to assessment strategies to measure the skills that are developed as students engage in more meaningful learning experiences. Tools such as the ELIPSS rubrics provide a resource for instructors to better align assessments with intended learning outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Gil Reynders"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juliette Lantz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suzanne M.

10.1002/tea.21625,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING,0401 Education,Rethinking the classroom science investigation,"AbstractThere is now a significant research literature devoted to reconceptualizing scientific activities, such as modeling, explanation, and argumentation, to realize a vision of science‐as‐practice in classrooms. As yet, however, not all scientific practices have received equal attention.Planning and Carrying out Investigationsis one of the eight scientific practices identified in the Next Generation Science Standards, and there is a long line of research from both psychological and science education traditions that addresses topics about investigation, such as the generation and interpretation of evidence. However, investigation has not been subject to concerted reconceptualization within recent research and instructional design efforts focused on science‐as‐practice. In this article, we propose a framework that centers the investigation as a key locus for constructing alignments among phenomena, data, and explanatory models and makes visible the work that scientists engage in as they develop and stabilize alignments. We argue that these alignments are currently under‐theorized and under‐utilized in instructional environments. We explore four opportunities that we argue are both accessible to students from a young age and can support conceptual innovation. These are (a) developing empirical systems, (b) getting a grip on empirical systems, (c) determining, defining and operationalizing data as “evidence,” and (d) making sense of what the results of empirical systems do and do not help us understand.","[{""name"": ""Eve Manz"", ""affiliation"": [""Boston University Wheelock College of Education &amp; Human Development Boston Massachusetts""]}, {""name"": ""Richard Lehrer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Teaching and Learning Vanderbilt University Peabody College of Education and Human Development Nashville Tennessee""]}, {""name"": ""Leona Schauble"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Teaching and Learning Vanderbilt University Peabody College of Education and Human Development Nashville Tennessee""]}]","[""10.1002/tea.20446"", ""10.1002/sce.20420"", ""10.1002/tea.21257"", ""10.1002/sce.20449"", ""10.1002/sce.20278"", ""10.3102/0034654310376953"", ""10.1093/0195171276.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0013188042000337596"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.94.2.327"", ""10.1002/sce.10001"", ""10.1080/09500693.2016.1234085"", ""10.3102/0091732X07309371"", ""10.1186/s40594-014-0012-6"", ""10.3102/0034654308325899"", ""10.1002/sce.20049"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1404_1"", ""10.1002/sce.21188"", ""10.3102/0091732X030001001"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-0707-2"", ""10.1525/aa.1994.96.3.02a00100"", ""10.1080/0950069960180705"", ""10.1080/09500693.2014.899722"", ""10.1002/1098-237X(200011)84:6<757::AID-SCE5>3.0.CO;2-F"", ""10.1002/tea.20020"", ""10.1080/09500693.2014.958600"", ""10.1163/9789460911453_009"", ""10.1002/1098-237X(200009)84:5<624::AID-SCE5>3.0.CO;2-S"", ""10.1002/sce.20362"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6758.001.0001"", ""10.1080/07370000802391745"", ""10.1016/S0065-2407(08)60356-0"", ""10.1002/sce.20475"", ""10.1016/j.cogdev.2008.09.001"", ""10.3102/0034654314558490"", ""10.1080/07370008.2014.1000490"", ""10.1002/tea.21264"", ""10.1002/sce.21282"", ""10.1080/15248372.2003.9669683"", ""10.1002/tea.21381"", ""10.1002/tea.21252"", ""10.1080/10508400903013488"", ""10.1207/s1532690xci2202_3"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-1616-6_1"", ""10.1002/tea.21259"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7967.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10749039.2012.688232"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-51667-1.50031-8"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226668253.001.0001"", ""10.1002/tea.3660300203"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226293707.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10508406.2018.1517354"", ""10.1002/sce.21006"", ""10.1002/sce.21069"", ""10.1207/S15327809JLS1201_2"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls0402_1"", ""10.1002/tea.20311"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1403_1"", ""10.1093/ilar/ilx007"", ""10.1002/sce.21112"", ""10.1207/S1532690XCI1804_1"", ""10.1002/sce.20081"", ""10.1002/sce.20232"", ""10.1002/tea.1017"", ""10.1002/sce.20259"", ""10.1002/sce.21027"", ""10.1002/tea.21104"", ""10.1016/j.dr.2006.12.001""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Interpersonal interaction is a necessary yet nebulous concept in online learning. This paper attempts to build a quality lens to view interpersonal interaction in online learning through, called purposeful interpersonal interaction (PII) by exploring types of interpersonal interaction demonstrated in the literature to lead to better student outcomes. PII encompasses three main types of interaction: purposeful interpersonal instructional interaction, purposeful social interaction, and supportive interaction. These interaction types have been associated with important student outcomes like perceived learning, satisfaction, and academic achievement. Robyler and Wiencke’s (2003) rubric for assessing interactive qualities of distance courses (RAIQDC) includes many of the concepts identified as important to PII and has been established as a valid and reliable tool for assessing the amount of quality interpersonal interaction that occurs in an online course.

However, they may not be sufficiently represented in educational institutions. In this regard, the research objectives are set, namely: organize a comparative analysis of several popular distance learning platforms (Moodle, Open edX and NEO LMS) in accordance with the criteria (system features, content support, content creation, user management, reporting system; conduct consultation with university teachers, during which they will highlight the benefits of distance education systems from the point of view of the teacher; and test students, who use the online platform for learning in order to clarify its impact on academic performance. While consulting with 40 teachers of Russian and Chinese universities (Moscow State University, Higher School of Economics, Peking University, Tsinghua University), the following advantages of distance platforms have been highlighted: greater freedom of access, lower education prices, the possibility of dividing the content of the e-course into modules, flexibility of education, the ability to keep up with modern pace of life, and the ability to define criteria for assessing knowledge. According to the results of testing, after working with the Moodle platform, students (300 people in total) with different academic performance have improved their results. The most significant improvement has occurred among students with “unsatisfactory” grades; more than 50% have improved their results. Analysis of distance learning systems, testing of students and consultation with teachers allow saying that such platforms help to make education more accessible and convenient. Besides, information technologies are introduced in the educational process. That is why it is important to implement such platforms in higher education.","[{""name"": ""Zi-Yu Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Natalya Lomovtseva"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elena Korobeynikova"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

However, this model has limitations when used by evaluators especially in the complex environment of higher education. Addressing the scarcity of a collective effort on discussing these limitations, this review paper aims to present a descriptive analysis of the limitations of the Kirkpatrick evaluation model in the higher education ﬁeld. Three themes of limitations were found out: propensity towards the use of the lower levels of the model; rigidity wich leaves out other essential aspects of the evaluand; and paucity of evidence on the causal chains among the levels. It is suggested that, when employing the Kirkpatrick model in higher education, evaluators should address these limitations by considering more appropriate methods, integrating contextual inputs in the evaluation framework, and establishing causal relationships among the levels. These suggestions to address the limitations of the model are discussed at the end of the study.","[{""name"": ""Michael CAHAPAY"", ""affiliation"": [""Mindanao State University""]}]","[""10.3109/0142159X.2014.886012"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.1989.tb00661.x"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.234"", ""10.1080/0144341032000060110"", ""10.1080/1554480X.2016.1242426"", ""10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2004.04.011"", ""10.3316/QRJ0902027"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1515/libri-2014-0016"", ""10.21831/reid.v4i2.22495"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.573"", ""10.4135/9781506326139"", ""10.1007/s10798-007-9029-1"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2011.05.020"", ""10.32327/IJMESS/8.4.2019.17"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2017.14.28"", ""10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.12.006"", ""10.1136/bmj.326.7385.385"", ""10.18178/ijiet.2017.7.4.878"", ""10.1002/nha3.20178"", ""10.5772/intechopen.78887"", ""10.1080/08989621.2016.1186547"", ""10.9790/487X-0521622"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.04076.x""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Health Professions']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Applied Psychology', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"
10.1186/s40594-021-00270-7,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Instructor strategies to aid implementation of active learning: a systematic literature review,"AbstractBackgroundDespite the evidence supporting the effectiveness of active learning in undergraduate STEM courses, the adoption of active learning has been slow. One barrier to adoption is instructors’ concerns about students’ affective and behavioral responses to active learning, especially student resistance. Numerous education researchers have documented their use of active learning in STEM classrooms. However, there is no research yet that systematically analyzes these studies for strategies to aid implementation of active learning and address students’ affective and behavioral responses. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review and identify 29 journal articles and conference papers that researched active learning, affective and behavioral student responses, and recommended at least one strategy for implementing active learning. In this paper, we ask: (1) What are the characteristics of studies that examine affective and behavioral outcomes of active learning and provide instructor strategies? (2) What instructor strategies to aid implementation of active learning do the authors of these studies provide?ResultsIn our review, we noted that most active learning activities involved in-class problem solving within a traditional lecture-based course (N= 21). We found mostly positive affective and behavioral outcomes for students’ self-reports of learning, participation in the activities, and course satisfaction (N= 23). From our analysis of the 29 studies, we identified eight strategies to aid implementation of active learning based on three categories. Explanation strategies included providing students with clarifications and reasons for using active learning. Facilitation strategies entailed working with students and ensuring that the activity functions as intended. Planning strategies involved working outside of the class to improve the active learning experience.ConclusionTo increase the adoption of active learning and address students’ responses to active learning, this study provides strategies to support instructors. The eight strategies are listed with evidence from numerous studies within our review on affective and behavioral responses to active learning. Future work should examine instructor strategies and their connection with other affective outcomes, such as identity, interests, and emotions.","[{""name"": ""Kevin A.

Results from this study indicate that gender differences in students’ self-concept in mathematics are significant in most countries, usually in favour of boys as early as in fourth grade. The differences largely remain the same when the data analysis controls for effects of student achievement and parental involvement.","[{""name"": ""Ana María Mejía-Rodríguez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hans Luyten"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martina R.

Results The study employed a quasi-experimental design, and twenty-eight preservice technology teachers participated in the teaching experiment. The flow-map method and metalistening technique were utilized to enable preservice technology teachers to create flow maps of engineering design, and a chi-square test was employed to analyze the data. The results suggest that (1) applying the engineering design process to STEM project-based learning is beneficial for developing preservice technology teachers’ schema of design thinking, especially with respect to clarifying the problem, generating ideas, modeling, and feasibility analysis, and (2) it is important to encourage teachers to further explore the systematic concepts of engineering design thinking and expand their abilities by merging the engineering design process into STEM project-based learning. Conclusions The findings of this study provide initial evidence on the effects of infusing the engineering design process into STEM project-based learning to develop preservice technology teachers’ engineering design thinking. However, further work should focus on exploring how to overcome the weaknesses of preservice technology teachers’ engineering design thinking by adding a few elements of engineering design thinking pedagogy, e.g., designing learning activities that are relevant to real life.","[{""name"": ""Kuen-Yi Lin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ying-Tien Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yi-Ting Hsu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P.

10.1007/s10639-021-10451-0,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,An assessment of the interplay between literacy and digital Technology in Higher Education,"AbstractDigital technologies fundamentally transform teaching and learning in higher education environments, with the pace of technological change exacerbating the challenge. Due to the current pandemic situation, higher education environments are all now forced to move away from traditional teaching and learning structures that are simply no longer adaptable to the challenges of rapidly changing educational environments. This research develops a conceptual model and employs Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using Partial least Squares (PLS) to examine the impact of information and digital literacy on 249 Finnish university staff and students’ intention to use digital technologies. The findings show the complex interrelationship between literacy skills and digital technologies among university staff and students. The results illustrate that information literacy has a direct and significant impact on intention to use; while, unlike our expectation, digital literacy does not have a direct impact on the intention to use. However, its effect is mediated through performance expectancy and effort expectancy. The authors suggest that to understand the changes that are taking place in higher education environment, more attention needs to be paid to redefining policies and strategies in order to enhance individuals’ willingness to use digital technologies within higher education environments.","[{""name"": ""Shahrokh Nikou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Milla Aavakare"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.19173/irrodl.v14i5.1631"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.102041"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957206"", ""10.5860/crln.61.3.207"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10201-8"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1636088"", ""10.1007/s10639-015-9456-7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01097.x"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1799021"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.02.009"", ""10.1177/1086296X13493273"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1207/S15327930PJE763&4_14"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.06.002"", ""10.1016/S0099-1333(01)00281-6"", ""10.14429/djlit.28.2.166"", ""10.1108/AJIM-08-2012-0066"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2008.11.004"", ""10.1002/asi.21681"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2006.06.001"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10246-9"", ""10.2753/MTP1069-6679190202"", ""10.15358/9783800653614"", ""10.1108/EBR-11-2018-0203"", ""10.1007/s10643-009-0313-4"", ""10.1207/s15548430jlr3802_3"", ""10.28945/1532"", ""10.1080/03075070309295"", ""10.1007/s11145-019-09944-9"", ""10.2511/027494811800824507"", ""10.1088/2F1742-6596/2F1213/2F2/2F022017"", ""10.1108/00220410610714949"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0235957"", ""10.1080/03075071003664021"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103857"", ""10.1108/00220410610688723"", ""10.1080/08923647.2010.519947"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9701-y"", ""10.18261/ISSN1891-943X-2006-02-06"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10222-3"", ""10.1080/17439884.2013.783597"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.025"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.016"", ""10.47989/irisic2016"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2019.05.003"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1156666"", ""10.1109/TALE.2018.8615207"", ""10.1111/bjet.12753"", ""10.1002/hbe2.201"", ""10.2753/MIS0742-1222250303"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-60013-0_248-1"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2018.1436590""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000002902,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Uncertainty in Decision Making in Medicine: A Scoping Review and Thematic Analysis of Conceptual Models,"Purpose The practice of medicine is rarely straightforward. Data used to facilitate medical decision making may be conflicting, ambiguous, or scarce, and providing optimal care requires balancing clinicians’ expertise and available evidence with patients’ preferences. To explore uncertainty in decision making across disciplines, the authors performed a scoping review and thematic analysis of the literature to formulate a model describing the decision-making process in medicine under uncertain conditions. Method In 2016, the authors performed a comprehensive search of key databases using a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary. They identified and reviewed 3,398 records. After applying their inclusion and exclusion criteria to the titles and abstracts and then full texts, 19 articles were selected. The authors applied a qualitative thematic analysis to these articles, using codes to extract themes related to uncertainty in decision making. Results The 19 articles spanned 6 fields of study and 5 disciplines within the health sciences. The thematic analysis revealed 6 main themes: recognition of uncertainty, classification of uncertainty, stakeholder perspectives, knowledge acquisition, decision-making approach, and evaluation of the decision-making process. Conclusions Based on the themes that emerged from their thematic analysis of the literature characterizing the effects of uncertainty and ambiguity on the decision-making process, the authors developed a framework depicting the interplay between these themes with a visual representation of the decision-making process under uncertain conditions. Future research includes further development and validation of this framework to inform medical school curricula.","[{""name"": ""Marieka A.

10.1007/s10459-022-10112-y,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Transgender health content in medical education: a theory-guided systematic review of current training practices and implementation barriers & facilitators,"AbstractHealth disparities faced by transgender people are partly explained by barriers to trans-inclusive healthcare, which in turn are linked to a lack of transgender health education in medical school curricula. We carried out a theory-driven systematic review with the aim to (1) provide an overview of key characteristics of training initiatives and pedagogical features, and (2) analyze barriers and facilitators to implementing this training in medical education. We used queer theory to contextualize our findings. We searched the PubMed/Ovid MEDLINE database (October 2009 to December 2021) for original studies that reported on transgender content within medical schools and residency programs (N = 46). We performed a thematic analysis to identify training characteristics, pedagogical features, barriers and facilitators. Most training consisted of single-session interventions, with varying modes of delivery. Most interventions were facilitated by instructors with a range of professional experience and half covered general LGBT+-content. Thematic analysis highlighted barriers including lack of educational materials, lack of faculty expertise, time/costs constraints, and challenges in recruiting and compensating transgender guest speakers. Facilitators included scaffolding learning throughout the curriculum, drawing on expertise of transgender people and engaging learners in skills-based training. Sustainable implementation of transgender-health objectives in medical education faces persistent institutional barriers. These barriers are rooted in normative biases inherent to biomedical knowledge production, and an understanding of categories of sex and gender as uncomplicated. Medical schools should facilitate trans-inclusive educational strategies to combat transgender-health inequities, which should include a critical stance toward binary conceptualizations of sex and gender throughout the curriculum.","[{""name"": ""Jason van Heesewijk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex Kent"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tim C. van de Grift"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex Harleman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maaike Muntinga"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1215/01642472-8680478"", ""10.1007/s40670-020-00958-5"", ""10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596"", ""10.1071/PY19102"", ""10.1111/maq.12129"", ""10.1215/10642684-2843239"", ""10.1353/ff.2019.0028"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11148"", ""10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00043-5"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10915"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10970"", ""10.1080/00918369.2017.1321389"", ""10.36834/cmej.70496"", ""10.1111/medu.14312"", ""10.1089/lgbt.2016.0119"", ""10.1007/s11199-017-0823-2"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.09.027"", ""10.1891/CRNR-D-19-00091"", ""10.17161/kjm.v11i4.8707"", ""10.1111/tct.13074"", ""10.1111/tct.13074"", ""10.1080/15532739.2011.700873"", ""10.9740/mhc.2021.01.001"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10781"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001533"", ""10.22454/FamMed.2021.764850"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S147183"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19752-4"", ""10.4158/EP151141.OR"", ""10.4324/9780203127971"", ""10.1080/00224499.2019.1581883"", ""10.1215/10642684-2008-135"", ""10.1007/s12152-012-9169-1"", ""10.4324/9780203715109"", ""10.36834/cmej.53009"", ""10.1177/2382120520965254"", ""10.1111/soc4.12432"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01047.x"", ""10.1007/s43678-021-00185-w"", ""10.11124/01938924-201008180-00001"", ""10.4300/JGME-D-16-00770.1"", ""10.4324/9780203720776"", ""10.1210/jc.2017-01658"", ""10.1037/a0029597"", ""10.1007/s10508-018-1239-y"", ""10.1007/s40596-016-0570-7"", ""10.1177/0004867420982069"", ""10.7759/cureus.17425"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30675-4"", ""10.1007/s12630-019-01562-x"", ""10.30476/JAMP.2021.90099.1398"", ""10.2307/j.ctvckq9pv"", ""10.5749/j.ctv17mrv14"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10536"", ""10.1353/sof.2004.0081"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S255483"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10861"", ""10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.03.010"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11072"", ""10.1093/med/9780190636890.003.0016"", ""10.1002/aet2.10580"", ""10.1080/13691058.2017.1322715"", ""10.1177/0891241614556345"", ""10.1007/s11199-008-9458-7"", ""10.1177/2382120520934813"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1003583"", ""10.1089/trgh.2017.0047"", ""10.22454/FamMed.2021.612374"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02045-0"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003581"", ""10.1017/S1743923X20000707"", ""10.1111/maq.12289"", ""10.1212/WNL.0000000000004751"", ""10.1016/j.acap.2021.05.027"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11013"", ""10.1111/jmwh.13278"", ""10.4158/EP13014.OR"", ""10.3390/ijerph16132305"", ""10.1080/00918369.2021.1933782"", ""10.4103/efh.EfH_78_16"", ""10.1080/00918369.2021.1987750"", ""10.1007/s10912-018-9526-0"", ""10.1210/jendso/bvz007"", ""10.1007/s11606-019-04855-5"", ""10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001197"", ""10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100599"", ""10.1111/tct.12647"", ""10.5694/mja17.01044"", ""10.1136/postgradmedj-2019-136683"", ""10.1186/s12909-021-02532-y"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10875"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10518"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.10896"", ""10.1016/j.acap.2021.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.11.020"", ""10.1111/tct.12780"", ""10.15694/mep.2018.000001.1"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0234743"", ""10.1002/aet2.10680"", ""10.1016/j.jsxm.2018.01.016""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Gender Studies', 'Pharmacy']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)]]"
10.1186/s41239-020-00201-6,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Teaching analytics, value and tools for teacher data literacy: a systematic and tripartite approach","AbstractTeaching Analytics (TA) is a new theoretical approach, which combines teaching expertise, visual analytics and design-based research to support teacher’s diagnostic pedagogical ability to use data and evidence to improve the quality of teaching. TA is now gaining prominence because it offers enormous opportunities to the teachers. It also identifies optimal ways in which teaching performance can be enhanced. Further, TA provides a platform for teachers to use data to reflect on teaching outcome. The outcome of TA can be used to engage teachers in a meaningful dialogue to improve the quality of teaching. Arguably, teachers need to develop their teacher data literacy and data inquiry skills to learn about teaching challenges. These skills are dependent on understanding the connection between TA, LA and Learning Design (LD). Additionally, they need to understand how choices in particular pedagogues and the LD can enhance their teaching experience. In other words, teachers need to equip themselves with the knowledge necessary to understand the complexity of teaching and the learning environment. Providing teachers access to analytics associated with their teaching practice and learning outcome can improve the quality of teaching practice. This research aims to explore current TA related discussions in the literature, to provide a generic conception of the meaning and value of TA. The review was intended to inform the establishment of a framework describing the various aspects of TA and to develop a model that can enable us to gain more insights into how TA can help teachers improve teaching practices and learning outcome. The Tripartite model was adopted to carry out a comprehensive, systematic and critical analysis of the literature of TA. To understand the current state-of-the-art relating to TA, and the implications to the future, we reviewed published articles from the year 2012 to 2019. The results of this review have led to the development of a conceptual framework for TA and established the boundaries between TA and LA. From the analysis the literature, we proposed a Teaching Outcome Model (TOM) as a theoretical lens to guide teachers and researchers to engage with data relating to teaching activities, to improve the quality of teaching.","[{""name"": ""Ifeanyi Glory Ndukwe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ben Kei Daniel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11162-011-9240-5"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v4i2.149"", ""10.1016/j.jpdc.2014.08.003"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883944"", ""10.1177/0256090920130401"", ""10.1145/2818346.2830604"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-8005-6_7"", ""10.1037/e532532011-001"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.11.006"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883890"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2014.04.002"", ""10.1201/9781315161501-5"", ""10.1177/0047239519835846"", ""10.1186/s41039-016-0034-4"", ""10.1045/july2002-choudhury"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2013.07.007"", ""10.1111/bjet.12230"", ""10.4324/9781315149783"", ""10.4337/9781788112352.00018"", ""10.1111/bjet.12212"", ""10.1080/07294360701805234"", ""10.1504/IJTEL.2012.051816"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-01667-2_2"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-57284-4"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.10.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-45153-4_69"", ""10.1111/jcal.12129"", ""10.1080/03634528809378702"", ""10.55612/s-5002-033-006"", ""10.1016/bs.host.2016.07.010"", ""10.4324/9780203728703-3"", ""10.1080/13562517.2017.1395408"", ""10.1111/bjet.12645"", ""10.1111/bjet.12853"", ""10.1109/MITP.2013.61"", ""10.1111/ejed.12079"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52977-6_1"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2016.12.004"", ""10.1177/0022487102053001004"", ""10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4"", ""10.4324/9780429053573"", ""10.1080/00220485.1980.10844950"", ""10.1016/0883-0355(87)90001-2"", ""10.1111/bjet.12262"", ""10.9776/16611"", ""10.4324/9780203728703-8"", ""10.1111/bjet.12273"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52836-6_51"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-7181-3_8"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2016.14"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17727-4_15-1"", ""10.1111/bjet.12152"", ""10.1504/IJTEL.2011.041283"", ""10.1111/bjet.12207"", ""10.3402/rlt.v21i0.17585"", ""10.31219/osf.io/bj2rp"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883927"", ""10.1111/jcal.12232"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.csda.2006.05.025"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883886"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06520-5_7"", ""10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2053532"", ""10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943055"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2018.00020"", ""10.26529/cepsj.288"", ""10.1080/00933104.2007.10473333"", ""10.1080/02701367.2004.10609134"", ""10.1186/s12874-015-0038-6"", ""10.1109/icalt.2016.134"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-52977-6_2"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.014"", ""10.1109/ITHET.2018.8424797"", ""10.1177/0002764213498851"", ""10.1177/0894439319843669"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2017.75"", ""10.1007/s11092-016-9238-9"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2017.113"", ""10.1002/he.20240"", ""10.1145/3242969.3264969"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.05.013"", ""10.1007/s11412-019-09299-x"", ""10.1145/2399016.2399141"", ""10.1145/2399016.2399141"", ""10.1145/2090116.2090129"", ""10.1177/0002764213479363"", ""10.4324/9780203728703-7"", ""10.1111/jbl.12010"", ""10.1007/BF02504682"", ""10.1080/02680939.2015.1035758"", ""10.5465/ambpp.2018.15903abstract"", ""10.1016/j.accinf.2011.08.002""]",['Computer Science'],['Computer Science Applications'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1002/rev3.3314,REVIEW OF EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Reading wars or reading reconciliation? A critical examination of robust research evidence, curriculum policy and teachers' practices for teaching phonics and reading","AbstractTeaching children to read is one of the most fundamental goals of early years and primary education worldwide, and as such has attracted a large amount of research from a range of academic disciplines. The aims of this paper are: (a) to provide a new critical examination of research evidence relevant to effective teaching of phonics and reading in the context of national curricula internationally; (b) to report new empirical findings relating to phonics teaching in England; and (c) examine some implications for policy and practice. The paper reports new empirical findings from two sources: (1) a systematic qualitative meta‐synthesis of 55 experimental trials that included longitudinal designs; (2) a survey of 2205 teachers. The paper concludes that phonics and reading teaching in primary schools in England has changed significantly for the first time in modern history, and that compared to other English dominant regions England represents an outlier. The most robust research evidence, from randomised control trials with longitudinal designs, shows that the approach to phonics and reading teaching in England is not sufficiently underpinned by research evidence. It is recommended that national curriculum policy is changed and that the locus of political control over curriculum, pedagogy and assessment should be re‐evaluated.

Context and implicationsRationale for this studyTeaching children to read is one of the most important elements of primary education because it is fundamental to children's educational development. For this reason it is vital that the teaching of reading, and curriculum policies on reading, are informed by robust research.Why the new findings matterIf children are not being taught to read in the most appropriate way, because curriculum policy and teaching practices are not informed sufficiently by robust research evidence, then children's education will not be as effective as it should be.Implications for practitioners, policy makers, researchersThe outcomes of the survey of teachers in England, and the new analysis of systematic reviews and meta analyses, and randomised controlled trials with longitudinal designs, reported in the paper show the need for changes to the teaching of reading and to national curriculum policy on the teaching of reading.The teaching of phonics and reading in curriculum policy and practice should more closely reflect the evidence that contextualised teaching of reading, or balanced instruction, is the most effective way to teach reading.","[{""name"": ""Dominic Wyse"", ""affiliation"": [""IOE, UCL's Faculty of Education and Society University College London London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Alice Bradbury"", ""affiliation"": [""IOE, UCL's Faculty of Education and Society University College London London UK""]}]","[""10.1111/j.2044-8279.2010.02015.x"", ""10.1007/s11092-020-09329-5"", ""10.1037/0022‐0663.96.3.444"", ""10.1023/A:1008050403932"", ""10.1007/s10648‐019‐09515‐y"", ""10.1007/s10648-021-09602-z"", ""10.1002/berj.3449"", ""10.1080/03004279.2019.1622497"", ""10.1080/01425692.2021.1878873"", ""10.1007/BF02648154"", ""10.1080/17597536.2020.1864983"", ""10.1080/19388070701750171"", ""10.1177/1529100618772271"", ""10.2307/748034"", ""10.3102/0002831208330214"", ""10.1177/0956797610375449"", ""10.1002/berj.3269"", ""10.3102/0013189X07313156"", ""10.1111/j.1540‐5826.2010.00306.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.10.010"", ""10.1037/0022‐0663.96.4.660"", ""10.1002/dys.1450"", ""10.1080/01443410124914"", ""10.1007/s10648‐020‐09580‐8"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0089900"", ""10.1111/j.1469-7610.1983.tb00568.x"", ""10.1177/074193258600700104"", ""10.1177/00224669050390020301"", ""10.1080/19345747.2010.488716"", ""10.2307/1131364"", ""10.1111/j.1469‐7610.2004.00225.x"", ""10.1007/s11881-001-0006-1"", ""10.1080/09243453.2011.600534"", ""10.1002/berj.3498"", ""10.1016/S0959‐4752(02)00009‐9"", ""10.1016/0959‐4752(95)00004‐M"", ""10.1002/rrq.038"", ""10.2307/747762"", ""10.1044/1058‐0360(2009/08‐0067)"", ""10.1023/A:1015272516220"", ""10.1086/461707"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD009115.pub3"", ""10.1177/0022219409355472"", ""10.1044/0161-1461(2005/032)"", ""10.1207/SLDRP1501_5"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐9817.1995.tb00076.x"", ""10.1080/10862969609547915"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2007.01.005"", ""10.1207/s1532799xssr0204_1"", ""10.1024/1422‐4917.32.3.167"", ""10.1007/s11145‐007‐9080‐z"", ""10.1002/berj.3177"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐9817.2005.00260.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365‐2729.2005.00107.x"", ""10.1348/000712603321661859"", ""10.1017/edp.2020.18"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2008.05.003"", ""10.1177/0022219414528540"", ""10.1080/02671522.2017.1420816"", ""10.1007/s11881‐009‐0032‐y"", ""10.1177/002221940003300606"", ""10.1037/a0019639"", ""10.1080/10888438.2010.501091"", ""10.1007/s11145‐012‐9393‐4"", ""10.1037/a0028163"", ""10.1037/0022‐0663.98.3.508"", ""10.1037/a0026984"", ""10.1348/000709904322848815"", ""10.3102/00028312043003449"", ""10.1080/19345740802114749"", ""10.1177/00222194060390010601"", ""10.1086/510653"", ""10.1007/BF02928179"", ""10.1037/0022‐0663.72.1.1"", ""10.1002/dys.438"", ""10.1002/berj.3135"", ""10.1080/01411920802268912"", ""10.1080/00131880902891479""]","['Neuroscience', 'Mathematics', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Statistics and Probability', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003351,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Pregnancy and Parenthood Remain Challenging During Surgical Residency: A Systematic Review,"Purpose To examine common themes and synthesize data surrounding pregnancy and parenthood during surgical residency training. Method The authors conducted a systematic search of the literature in March 2019. They searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus, seeking articles published from 2003 to 2018 that focused on pregnancy, parenthood, and the experience of surgical residents. They excluded articles that examined nonsurgical programs, as well as editorials, abstracts, and commentaries. Two investigators independently reviewed all citations, selected articles for full-text review, and extracted data from the selected articles. Results Of 523 titles and abstracts screened, 27 were included. Overall, female surgical residents had fewer children during residency training than their male counterparts (18%–28% vs 32%–54%). As compared with the general population, surgical residents had their first child later in life (30–34 vs 25 years old), and had fewer children overall (0.6–2.1 vs 2.7). Infertility rates were higher among female surgeons than in the general population (30%–32% vs 11%), as were assisted reproductive technology rates (8%–13% vs 1.7%). Pregnant surgical residents experienced a high rate of obstetrical complications; working more than 6 overnight calls shifts per month or 60 hours per week were predictors of increased complication rates. The authors noted no differences in attrition, caseload, or exam pass rates amongst female surgical residents who had become pregnant as compared with other residents. Despite these similar academic outcomes, negative attitudes and perceptions toward pregnancy during residency were consistently identified. Conclusions Female surgical residents experience high rates of infertility and obstetrical complications, contend with negative attitudes and stigma during their pregnancies, and voluntarily delay childbearing. Formal maternity policies, a shift in surgical culture, and ongoing discussion with all stakeholders are needed to attract and retain female surgical residents.","[{""name"": ""Anna R.

More recently, ground-breaking AI applications like ChatGPT have demonstrated the potential to bring radical changes to the educational landscape due to their capability to understand complex questions, generate plausible responses and human-like writing, and assist with the completion of complex tasks. However, ChatGPT has limitations in the quality of its output, such as the inclusion of inaccurate, fabricated and biased information and the lack of critical thinking and in-depth understanding. The combinations of these capabilities and limitations along with external factors (e.g., the growing demand for personalized learning support, the irresponsible and unethical use of AI) presents a range of opportunities and challenges to the potential use of ChatGPT in education.

Gasol offers a wide variety of cost models that allow inferring the gas consumption associated to selected types of EVM instructions and/or inferring the number of times that such types of bytecode instructions are executed. Among others, we have cost models to measure only storage opcodes, to measure a selected family of gas-consumption opcodes following the Ethereum’s classification, to estimate the cost of a selected program line, etc. After choosing the desired cost model and the function of interest, Gasol returns to the user an upper bound of the cost for this function. As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions that access the storage, Gasol uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the selected function. Our tool can be used within an Eclipse plugin for which displays the gas and instructions bounds and, when applicable, the gas-optimized function.","[{""name"": ""Elvira Albert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesús Correas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Gordillo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guillermo Román-Díez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Rubio"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_46"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69166-2_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_30"", ""10.1145/3167084"", ""10.1145/2993600.2993611"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.1109/SANER.2017.7884650"", ""10.1145/3276486"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89722-6_10"", ""10.1145/3158136"", ""10.14722/ndss.2018.23082"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330560"", ""10.1145/2976749.2978309"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03427-6_33"", ""10.1145/3274694.3274743"", ""10.1145/3360611"", ""10.1145/3243734.3243780""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

However, non-randomised studies (NRS) are increasingly recognised as a source of insights into the real-world performance of novel therapeutic products, particularly when traditional RCTs are impractical or lack generalisability. This means there is a growing need for synthesising evidence from RCTs and NRS in healthcare decision making, particularly given recent developments such as innovative study designs, digital technologies and linked databases across countries. Crucially, however, no formal framework exists to guide the integration of these data types. Objectives and Methods: To address this gap, we used a mixed methods approach (review of existing guidance, methodological papers, Delphi survey) to develop guidance for researchers and healthcare decision-makers on when and how to best combine evidence from NRS and RCTs to improve transparency and build confidence in the resulting summary effect estimates. Results: Our framework comprises seven steps on guiding the integration and interpretation of evidence from NRS and RCTs and we offer recommendations on the most appropriate statistical approaches based on three main analytical scenarios in healthcare decision making (specifically, ‘high-bar evidence’ when RCTs are the preferred source of evidence, ‘medium,’ and ‘low’ when NRS is the main source of inference). Conclusion: Our framework augments existing guidance on assessing the quality of NRS and their compatibility with RCTs for evidence synthesis, while also highlighting potential challenges in implementing it.

The commerce students of the different public sector universities are targeted through a random sampling technique. The authors used a survey questionnaire to attain the responses from respondents. Finally, 184 usable cases are utilized to assume the hypothesized paths.FindingsBy applying the structural equation modeling (SEM), the findings of the study demonstrate a significant positive effect of constructs of entrepreneurship education (EE), that is, opportunity recognition (OR) and entrepreneurship knowledge acquisition (EKA) on entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE), entrepreneurial intention (EI) and need for achievement (NFA). Besides, ESE and NFA are found to be the robust predictors of EI.Practical implicationsThe findings provide significant guidelines to policy-makers and university authorities for developing useful EE courses to uplift and boost students' skills to face today's considerable business and entrepreneurship challenges. The study also helps to generate eagerness among students in selecting entrepreneurship as a career option.Originality/valueThis study suggests the confirmation of EE's significant role in developing ESE, NFA and EI among commerce students.","[{""name"": ""Bahadur Ali Soomro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Naimatullah Shah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.18488/journal.1006.2020.101.114.121"", ""10.1108/ET-04-2013-0053"", ""10.1177/2515127420988517"", ""10.1016/j.iedeen.2017.04.001"", ""10.1177/1094428105278021"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2008.03.001"", ""10.1007/s11187-013-9514-8"", ""10.1177/1094428111428817"", ""10.1016/j.jm.2003.04.002"", ""10.1177/002224377901600110"", ""10.1177/0950422216656699"", ""10.1108/14626000810871655"", ""10.1007/s11365-014-0306-7"", ""10.1108/14626001211250144"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1108/20400701211265036"", ""10.1108/00400910610645716"", ""10.1007/s40685-018-0072-4"", ""10.1108/13552559810203957"", ""10.1016/S0167-4870(02)00188-5"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2020-0033"", ""10.1108/EJTD-02-2013-0019"", ""10.1108/ET-05-2020-0142"", ""10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.09.085"", ""10.4103/IJAM.IJAM_7_18"", ""10.32479/irmm.8330"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00318.x"", ""10.1007/s11365-015-0356-5"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.7.1.64"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2018-0226"", ""10.1007/s11365-009-0123-6"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12116"", ""10.1177/1350507607075776"", ""10.1108/00400911211274882"", ""10.1108/AJEMS-09-2017-0211"", ""10.5897/AJBM12.410"", ""10.1177/0266242608088739"", ""10.1213/ANE.0000000000002864"", ""10.1108/ET-11-2016-0168"", ""10.1287/orsc.11.4.448.14602"", ""10.2224/sbp.2012.40.8.1311"", ""10.1108/APJIE-03-2018-0015"", ""10.1108/JEIM-07-2014-0070"", ""10.1108/ET-01-2020-0014"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2006.05.002"", ""10.1177/002224379303000207"", ""10.1142/S1084946709001247"", ""10.1007/s10869-009-9102-8"", ""10.1108/01409170710833358"", ""10.1142/S0218495813500040"", ""10.1108/JEEE-03-2014-0004"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2016.03.001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.1994.tb01849.x""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Business and International Management', 'Education']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

A Nationwide, Multi-Institutional, Cross-Sectional Study of Students at DO-Granting Medical Schools","Purpose To examine differences in students’ empathy in different years of medical school in a nationwide study of students of U.S. DO-granting medical schools. Method Participants in this cross-sectional study included 10,751 students enrolled in 41 of 48 campuses of DO-granting medical schools in the United States (3,616 first-year, 2,764 second-year, 2,413 third-year, and 1,958 fourth-year students). They completed a web-based survey at the end of the 2017–2018 academic year that included the Jefferson Scale of Empathy and the Infrequency Scale of the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire for measuring “good impression” response bias. Comparisons were made on empathy scores among students in different years of medical school using analysis of covariance, controlling for the effect of “good impression” response bias. Also, comparisons were made with preexisting data from students of U.S. MD-granting medical schools. Results A statistically significant decline in empathy scores was observed when comparing students in the preclinical (years 1 and 2) and the clinical (years 3 and 4) phases of medical school (P &lt; .001); however, the magnitude of the decline was negligible (effect size =0.13). Comparison of findings with MD students showed that while the pattern of empathy decline was similar, the magnitude of the decline was less pronounced in DO students. Conclusions Differences in DO-granting and MD-granting medical education systems, such as emphasis on provision of holistic care, hands-on approaches to diagnosis and treatment, and patient-centered care, provide plausible explanations for disparity in the magnitude of empathy decline in DO compared with MD students. More research is needed to examine changes in empathy in longitudinal study and explore reasons for changes to avert erosion of empathy in medical school.","[{""name"": ""Mohammadreza Hojat"", ""affiliation"": [""is research professor of psychiatry and human behavior, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, and director, Jefferson Longitudinal Study of Medical Education, Asano-Gonnella Center for Research in Medical Education and Health Care, and Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen C.

10.1007/s10639-020-10100-y,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Defining student learning experience through blended learning,"AbstractThis paper aims to explore the benefits of Blended Learning towards students’ learning experiences at an offshore campus of an Australian university located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At the university campus, the Blended Learning practice in use is the displacement of content. Content displacement refers to a portion of the learning content and activities for a course being delivered online via the Learning Management System. Learning not only happens in face-to-face sessions at a given time but is extended to online spaces as well, happening anywhere at any time at students’ preference. The focus of this research is its usefulness and effectiveness in promoting interactions between students and their peers, their teachers, and course materials. An online survey, which was designed based on a set of validated questions, was used to collect data from sixty-six students enrolled in eight Blended Learning courses. The analysis of the survey results provides empirical evidence to the claim that students’ perception of their learning experiences at the university was beneficially impacted as a result of the Blended Learning environment in each of their classes. Specifically, factor analysis using oblique rotation method identifies a clear factor structure across survey questions, representing four dimensions of benefits: Engagement, Flexibility of learning, Online learning experience, and Self-confidence. In addition, significant differences between the clusters on these factors indicate that students vary in their responses towards the benefits of Blended Learning and their experience with a Blended Learning approach.","[{""name"": ""Frederique Bouilheres"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Le Thi Viet Ha Le"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Scott McDonald"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clara Nkhoma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lilibeth Jandug-Montera"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.06.001"", ""10.3102/0013189X018001032"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-09886-3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.11.008"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2005.00554.x"", ""10.14742/apubs.2013.1518"", ""10.1080/13538320500074915"", ""10.14742/ajet.1098"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.08.012"", ""10.1080/03043797.2013.766679"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2007.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2004.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2009.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.08.035"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4609.2006.00102.x"", ""10.1109/TE.2015.2427116"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2013.943a"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05684.x"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2007.11.003"", ""10.1007/BF02299477"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00387.x"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.598505"", ""10.1080/03043797.2013.834295"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.010"", ""10.2196/jmir.5035"", ""10.1002/ir.283"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2011.00474.x"", ""10.14742/ajet.1100"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.12.001"", ""10.1080/01587910500081269"", ""10.1007/s10639-013-9303-7"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2009.10.009"", ""10.3200/JOEB.84.2.101-109"", ""10.1007/s10639-009-9109-9"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2014.22"", ""10.1007/BF02504682"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.12.012"", ""10.1111/bjet.12080"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.08.012""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1186/s12909-021-03094-9,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Burnout and dropout intention in medical students: the protective role of academic engagement,"Abstract Introduction The influence of burnout, academic engagement, and their interaction in dropout intention among medical students should be further studied. Current research shows its consequences are relevant, however, there is little understanding on burnout and academic engagement moderation in dropout intention. The current study tested a model that relates the effects of coping strategies, social support satisfaction, general distress on academic engagement, burnout, and dropout intention, on medical students. Methods Through an online survey a non-probabilistic sample of one Medical Faculty's 1st- and 2nd-year students was recruited. Cross-sectional data were collected using psychometric instruments (Maslach Burnout Inventory – Student Survey, Social Support Satisfaction Scale for College Students, Brief COPE Scale for College Students, University Student Engagement Inventory, and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale), sociodemographic and academic variables, and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results 532 students (76% response rate) enrolled in the study. Latent variables structural model presented a satisfactory fit to the data and confirmed the expected negative path between burnout and dropout intention (β DI&lt;-SB =0.430; p&lt;.001) and the latent moderation burnout x engagement (β DI&lt;-SB*SE =-0.218; p&lt;.001). Conclusion Academic engagement attenuates the impact of burnout on dropout intention, working as a protective factor. Social support satisfaction and adaptive coping are associated with increased levels of academic engagement, and general distress and maladaptive coping are associated with burnout. Medical Schools should develop interventions to prevent dropout intention, tackle students' stress and academic challenges, and develop their academic engagement levels.","[{""name"": ""Sara Calcatin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jorge Sinval"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lia Lucas Neto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""João Marôco"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""António Gonçalves Ferreira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pedro Oliveira"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000134"", ""10.17711/SM.0185-3325.2021.013"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0239816"", ""10.15309/20psd210104"", ""10.1186/s12909-021-02511-3"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181c46aad"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001736"", ""10.1007/s12671-020-01582-5"", ""10.58680/rte199115462"", ""10.1111/ijsa.12238"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.56.2.267"", ""10.18848/2156-8960/CGP/v08i03/31-46"", ""10.3233/WOR-152145"", ""10.1002/smi.1242"", ""10.1590/1678-7153.201427205"", ""10.1002/smi.2771"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0162-9"", ""10.4236/ojs.2014.46046"", ""10.1007/s12144-018-0082-6"", ""10.1023/A:1012731520781"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-62518-7_1"", ""10.18637/jss.v048.i02"", ""10.1016/0304-4076(83)90093-3"", ""10.1348/000711001159582"", ""10.2307/2095172"", ""10.1080/10705511.2010.488999"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.9.3.275"", ""10.1016/0005-7967(94)00075-U"", ""10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144141"", ""10.1080/10872981.2018.1535739"", ""10.1001/jama.2010.1318"", ""10.1007/s11606-016-3886-9""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1002/rrq.338,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,Building Content Knowledge to Boost Comprehension in the Primary Grades,"ABSTRACTWell‐established theoretical models and a body of empirical research elucidate the critical role of content knowledge in comprehending texts. However, the potential of supporting knowledge in service of enhancing linguistic and reading comprehension has been a relatively neglected topic in the science of reading. The authors explicate why knowledge building in English language arts instruction (i.e., content‐rich instruction) can support language and content knowledge, leading to better linguistic and reading comprehension, based on theoretical arguments and empirical studies. In particular, the authors review the evidence on this claim, paying special attention to experimental trials conducted in K–2 settings. The authors also share preliminary findings from a novel intervention study testing one instantiation of a widely used content‐rich English language arts curriculum. Whereas this growing literature base demonstrates evidence of promise, further rigorous trials are needed to examine the efficacy of this integrative approach to teaching reading for understanding.","[{""name"": ""Sonia Q.

10.1186/s12909-022-03898-3,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Analysis of the effect of an artificial intelligence chatbot educational program on non-face-to-face classes: a quasi-experimental study,"Abstract Background Education and training are needed for nursing students using artificial intelligence-based educational programs. However, few studies have assessed the effect of using chatbots in nursing education. Objectives This study aimed to develop and examine the effect of an artificial intelligence chatbot educational program for promoting nursing skills related to electronic fetal monitoring in nursing college students during non-face-to-face classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design This quasi-experimental study used a nonequivalent control group non-synchronized pretest–posttest design. Methods The participants were 61 junior students from a nursing college located in G province of South Korea. Data were collected between November 3 and 16, 2021, and analyzed using independent t-tests. Results The experimental group—in which the artificial intelligence chatbot program was applied—did not show statistically significant differences in knowledge (t = -0.58, p = .567), clinical reasoning competency (t = 0.75, p = .455), confidence (t = 1.13, p = .264), and feedback satisfaction (t = 1.72, p = .090), compared with the control group; however, its participants’ interest in education (t = 2.38, p = .020) and self-directed learning (t = 2.72, p = .006) were significantly higher than those in the control group. Conclusion The findings of our study highlighted the potential of artificial intelligence chatbot programs as an educational assistance tool to promote nursing college students’ interest in education and self-directed learning. Moreover, such programs can be effective in enhancing nursing students’ skills in non-face-to face-situations caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Jeong-Won Han"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Junhee Park"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hanna Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2196/23933"", ""10.2196/14658"", ""10.25231/pee.2019.25.4.79"", ""10.1177/20552076211038151"", ""10.3233/SHTI200531"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10627-8"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2020.101850"", ""10.1111/j.1552-6909.2011.01291.x"", ""10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2020.02.004"", ""10.4069/kjwhn.2014.20.2.173"", ""10.4069/kjwhn.2011.17.3.225"", ""10.4069/kjwhn.2016.22.1.21"", ""10.4040/jkan.2011.41.4.433"", ""10.1007/s40670-021-01405-9"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01063"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09751"", ""10.3758/BF03193146"", ""10.1111/jan.12831"", ""10.5762/KAIS.2017.18.4.304"", ""10.1145/3012430.3012625"", ""10.6224/JN.202112_68(6).04""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/modl.12738,MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL,0401 Education,Academic Perseverance in Foreign Language Learning: An Investigation of Language-Specific Grit and Its Conceptual Correlates,"AbstractThe emerging interest in grit, referred to as sustained perseverance and passion for reaching long‐term goals and conceptualized as a facet of conscientiousness, has shown that language‐specific grit is positively linked to foreign language (FL) achievement. Evidence from recent studies on intended effort and academic buoyancy—constructs conceptually related to grit—suggests that they also play a meaningful role in FL learning. Drawing on the framework for noncognitive factors in academic performance and academic perseverance in particular, this study examines grit and its conceptual correlates. A total of 360 FL learners responded to a survey assessing their FL grit, conscientiousness, intended effort, and buoyancy. The results demonstrated that grit largely overlapped with intended effort but was found to be conceptually distinct from buoyancy and the industriousness facet of conscientiousness. Contrary to previous research, the consistency‐of‐interest facet of grit demonstrated superior predictive and incremental validity with regard to FL achievement compared to the perseverance‐of‐effort facet. The findings suggest that the role of academic perseverance in FL learning is a fruitful area of investigation that merits further exploration and research.","[{""name"": ""EKATERINA SUDINA"", ""affiliation"": [""Northern Arizona University Department of English  705 S.

10.1111/bjet.13305,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,The mediating effects of needs satisfaction on the relationships between prior knowledge and self-regulated learning through artificial intelligence chatbot,"AbstractThe anthropomorphic characteristics of artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a positive environment for self‐regulated learning (SRL). The factors affecting adolescents' SRL through AI technologies remain unclear. Limited AI and disciplinary knowledge may affect the students' motivations, as explained by self‐determination theory (SDT). In this study, we examine the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in SDT on the relationship between students' previous technical (AI) and disciplinary (English) knowledge and SRL, using an AI conversational chatbot. Data were collected from 323 9th Grade students through a questionnaire and a test. The students completed an AI basic unit and then learned English with a conversational chatbot for 5 days. Confidence intervals were calculated to investigate the mediating effects. We found that students' previous knowledge of English but not their AI knowledge directly affected their SRL with the chatbot, and that satisfying the need for autonomy and competence mediated the relationships between both knowledge (AI and English) and SRL, but relatedness did not. The self‐directed nature of SRL requires heavy cognitive learning and satisfying the need for autonomy and competence may more effectively engage young children in this type of learning. The findings also revealed that current chatbot technologies may not benefit students with relatively lower levels of English proficiency. We suggest that teachers can use conversational chatbots for knowledge consolidation purposes, but not in SRL explorations. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can potentially support students' self‐regulated learning (SRL) of disciplinary knowledge through chatbots. Needs satisfaction in Self‐determination theory (SDT) can explain the directive process required for SRL. Technical and disciplinary knowledge would affect SRL with technologies. What this paper adds This study examines the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in SDT on the relationship between students' previous AI (technical) and English (disciplinary) knowledge and SRL, using an AI conversational chatbot. Students' previous knowledge of English but not their AI knowledge directly affected their SRL with the chatbot. Autonomy and competence were mediators, but relatedness was not. Implications for practice and/or policy Teachers should use chatbots for knowledge consolidation rather than exploration. Teachers should support students' competence and autonomy, as these were found to be the factors that directly predicted SRL. School leaders and teacher educators should include the mediating effects of needs satisfaction in professional development programmes for digital education.","[{""name"": ""Qi Xia"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Faculty of Education The Chinese University of Hong Kong  Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR""]}, {""name"": ""Thomas K.

10.1186/s41239-021-00262-1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,The disconnected: COVID-19 and disparities in access to quality broadband for higher education students,"AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic forced many higher education institutions (HEIs) across the world to cancel face-to-face teaching, close campus facilities, and displace staff and students to work and learn from home. Given the persistent nature of the pandemic, many HEIs have continued to deliver courses online and/or use a blended learning approach. However, there are concerns around differences in student access to digital learning resources while at home, including high quality broadband connectivity. This is important, since variation in connectivity may impact the type of online/blended model that faculty can deliver or constrain student engagement with online content. In this context, this paper combines national data on the domiciles of students enrolled in Irish HEIs with detailed spatial data on broadband coverage to estimate the number of higher education students ‘at risk’ of poor access to high quality internet connectivity. Overall it finds that one-in-six students come from areas with poor broadband coverage, with large disparities by geography and by HEI. It also finds that students from the poorest broadband coverage areas are more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged. As a result, this paper recommends that HEIs use their detailed registration data to help identify and support at-risk students. In particular, the results suggest that some HEIs may need to prioritise access to campus facilities and services to less well-off students living in poor broadband coverage areas.","[{""name"": ""John Cullinan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Darragh Flannery"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jason Harold"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Seán Lyons"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dónal Palcic"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104345"", ""10.1080/17421772.2016.1177195"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48553-9"", ""10.1162/REST_a_00712"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00199-x"", ""10.1086/669930"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48553-9_1"", ""10.1177/0093650218796366"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.598505"", ""10.1007/s10734-019-00429-w"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.01.001"", ""10.26504/sustat92.pdf"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.09.002"", ""10.1057/9780230297579"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.05.005"", ""10.3102/0013189X19898690"", ""10.1007/s10984-019-09303-z"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103701"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2018.02.008"", ""10.1007/s11162-018-9539-6"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.09.001"", ""10.1007/s12061-016-9193-3"", ""10.1080/03323315.2015.1010302"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2013.08.001"", ""10.1007/s11528-018-0344-z""]",['Engineering'],['Media Technology'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"
10.3916/C65-2020-01,COMUNICAR,0503 Journalism and Communication; 0401 Education,Systematic review of mixed methods in the framework of educational innovation,"In the field of education research, mixed methods have traditionally referred to the combination of quantitative and qualitative data that brings us closer to ‘reality’. However, recent literature on social and educational studies has increasingly incorporated works that integrate digital technologies and mixed methods. This novelty provides an opportunity to re-examine original contributions in the field, particularly in relation to educational innovation. Therefore, the objective of this article is to analyze the characteristics and the trends of new contributions from researchers in education. To achieve this, we carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) of 311 articles published from January 2010 to January 2020 in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. We worked with nine questions that explored three key themes: characteristics, technologies and designs within the realm of educational innovation. The validation for this analysis was achieved using a criterion adopted by scholars at York University, which incorporates: inclusion and exclusion, relevance and description of data, as well as peer review in the analysis. Our findings indicate that networks of co-terms, identification of educational innovations and the types of designs -currently applied in educational innovation- as well as the adoption of a mixed-method approach seem to be much better suited to underpin the required combination of strategies and processes that are interwoven in order to address the complexity of the education phenomenon in our times. En el ámbito de la investigación, los métodos mixtos usan combinadamente datos cuantitativos y cualitativos para un acercamiento con la «realidad». En la literatura reciente de los estudios sociales y educativos, se ubica un crecimiento de publicaciones que integran tecnologías digitales y métodos mixtos y, con ello, se presenta la oportunidad de generar un aporte original de posibilidades para investigar la innovación educativa. El objetivo de este artículo fue analizar las características de estos estudios y las tendencias de nuevas contribuciones para la educación. Para lograrlo se realizó una revisión sistemática de literatura (SLR) de 311 artículos publicados, de enero 2010 a enero 2020, en las bases de datos Web of Science (WoS) y Scopus. Se trabajó con nueve preguntas que exploraron tres temas: características, tecnologías y diseños con líneas de innovación educativa. La validación se dio con los criterios de la Universidad de York: inclusión y exclusión, pertinencia y descripción de datos, así como evaluación de pares en el análisis. Los hallazgos dan cuenta de redes de co-términos, identificación de innovaciones educativas y tipos de diseños que están siendo trabajados en líneas de investigación de innovación educativa. Se concluye que el enfoque de métodos mixtos aporta con una combinación interceptadas de estrategias y procesos para abordar la complejidad del fenómeno de la educación, con compresión holística, interdisciplinar y cambio en la forma de hacer investigación en nuestros tiempos.","[{""name"": ""María-Soledad Ramírez-Montoya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jairo Lugo-Ocando"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.06.185"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.06.185"", ""10.1097/00013614-200604000-00002"", ""10.1103/physrevphyseducres.12.010113"", ""10.4135/9781071802823.n13"", ""10.5539/elt.v12n5p40"", ""10.4135/9781483399980.n10"", ""10.4135/9781071802779"", ""10.1007/s11135-015-0261-6"", ""10.4135/9781483351377"", ""10.14221/ajte.2016v41n7.6"", ""10.3102/0013189x033007014"", ""10.1177/0731948711417559"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-8427-0_11"", ""10.1186/s12889-019-7091-8"", ""10.4135/9781506335193"", ""10.4135/9781483398341.n6"", ""10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182440"", ""10.14201/eks20181941130"", ""10.1007/s10833-015-9253-5"", ""10.26754/cinaic.2019.0127"", ""10.1002/smr.1993"", ""10.4135/9781506335193"", ""10.1145/3362789.3362904"", ""10.1049/ic.2012.0001"", ""10.14221/ajte.2014v39n7.5"", ""10.1177/1094428108318066""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Method The authors searched records in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, Web of Science, CINAHL, and CENTRAL from database inception to August 8, 2019, using combinations of terms for mindfulness, interventions, and physicians. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized trials (NRTs), including controlled and noncontrolled before-after studies, all assessing burnout and stress among physicians preintervention and postintervention via validated instruments. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated overall quality of evidence. The authors used random-effects modeling to calculate pooled effect sizes and conducted prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses to explore potential moderators. Results Of 6,831 identified records, 25 studies (with 925 physicians) were ultimately included. MBIs were associated with significant small reductions in burnout in between-group analyses (5 comparisons: standardized mean difference [SMD] = −0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.50, −0.03) and pre–post analyses (21 comparisons: SMD = −0.26; 95% CI = −0.37, −0.15), and with a significant medium reduction in stress in between-group analyses (4 comparisons: SMD = −0.55; 95% CI = −0.95, −0.14) and a significant small reduction in stress in pre–post analyses (17 comparisons: SMD = −0.41; 95% CI = −0.61, −0.20). Versions of established MBIs showed higher effectiveness in reducing stress than other forms of MBIs or a mindfulness app. Reductions were maintained over an average follow-up of 5.3 months. The risk of bias was moderate with RCTs and high with NRTs. The overall quality of evidence was low to very low. Conclusions MBIs can be effective in reducing physicians’ burnout and stress. Shortcomings in the quality of evidence highlight the need for high-quality controlled trials providing long-term follow-up data.","[{""name"": ""Johannes C. Fendel"", ""affiliation"": [""J.C.

Using a game called Physics Playground, we randomly assigned 263 ninth‐ to eleventh‐grade students into four groups: adaptive, linear, free choice and no‐treatment control. Each condition had access to the same in‐game learning supports during gameplay. Results showed that: (a) the stealth assessment estimates of physics understanding were valid—significantly correlating with the external physics test scores; (b) there was no significant effect of game‐level delivery method on students' learning; and (c) physics animations were the most effective (among eight supports tested) in predicting both learning outcome and in‐game performance (e.g. number of game levels solved). We included student enjoyment, gender and ethnicity in our analyses as moderators to further investigate the research questions.","[{""name"": ""Valerie Shute"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Seyedahmad Rahimi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Ginny Smith"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Fengfeng Ke"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Russell Almond"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Chih‐Pu Dai"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Renata Kuba"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Zhichun Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaotong Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Chen Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems, College of Education Florida State University  Tallahassee Florida USA""]}]","[""10.1007/978-1-4939-2125-6"", ""10.1002/1098-237X(200011)84:6<740::AID-SCE4>3.0.CO;2-3"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.040"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.010"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.09.010"", ""10.1080/08839510290030390"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.026"", ""10.1145/950566.950595"", ""10.1109/VS-Games.2018.8493409"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01853.x"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2012.02.012"", ""10.1080/09523987.2018.1484043"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3546-4_1"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.022"", ""10.1007/s10956-018-9753-1"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.022"", ""10.1007/s11423-015-9418-1"", ""10.1186/s40594-016-0046-z"", ""10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.12.041"", ""10.5465/amle.2010.0141"", ""10.1109/TLT.2019.2922356"", ""10.1207/S15366359MEA0101_02"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.09.036"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-39298-1_4"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3546-4_4"", ""10.1080/10627197.2015.1127752"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9589.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.013"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139049580.004"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.002"", ""10.3102/0013189X035008019"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.01.001"", ""10.1080/10494820.2012.705852"", ""10.1111/jcal.12416"", ""10.5430/ijhe.v2n2p106"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.246"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.07.003"", ""10.1037/a0031311"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.07.018"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.012"", ""10.3102/0034654312436980"", ""10.61468/jofdl.v22i1.325"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103633""]",['Psychology'],"['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"
10.1108/IJSHE-04-2021-0167,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,From environmental education to education for sustainable development in higher education: a systematic review,"Purpose In education concerning environmental issues, there are two predominant currents in the world, environmental education (EE) and education for sustainable development (ESD). ESD is the formal commitment and therefore promoted by the United Nations, to ensure that countries achieve sustainable development. In contrast, EE was the first educational trend with an environmental protection approach. The purpose of this systematic review that seeks to show whether the migration from EE to ESD is being effective and welcomed by researchers and especially by universities is presented. With the above, a global panorama can be provided, where the regions that choose each model can be identified. In the same sense, it was sought to determine which of the two currents is more accepted within engineering education. Design/methodology/approach The review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyzes parameters for systematic reviews. In total, 198 papers indexed in Scopus, Science Direct, ERIC and Scielo were analyzed. With the results, the advancement of ESD and the state of the EE by regions in the world were identified. Findings It was possible to categorize the geographical regions that host either of the two EE or ESD currents. It is important to note that ESD has gained more strength from the decade of ESD proposed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. For its part, EE has greater historical roots in some regions of the planet. In turn, there is evidence of a limited number of publications on the design and revision of study plans in engineering. Originality/value Through this systematic literature review, the regions of the world that are clinging to EE and those that have taken the path of ESD could be distinguished. Moreover, specific cases in engineering where ESD has been involved were noted.","[{""name"": ""Pedro Mauricio Acosta Castellanos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Araceli Queiruga-Dios"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/su12187239"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1054783"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1054783"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.11.179"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.11.056"", ""10.1080/03098265.2017.1339265"", ""10.18546/IJDEGL.8.1.03"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.12.011"", ""10.1080/13504622.2018.1542488"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.117"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.280"", ""10.1080/09585176.2013.792672"", ""10.1080/13504622.2018.1499015"", ""10.1080/03057267.2017.1319632"", ""10.1080/03075070802641552"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2013.03.002"", ""10.1080/03098260600717406"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.063"", ""10.1186/s12961-018-0318-9"", ""10.1080/13504622.2020.1754342"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.153"", ""10.18870/hlrc.v4i3.157"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-03-2014-0036"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.05.014"", ""10.1007/s10755-012-9225-0"", ""10.1080/00958964.2015.1072704"", ""10.2478/v10099-009-0029-y"", ""10.3390/su12051947"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.074"", ""10.1080/13504622.2015.1018141"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00602.x"", ""10.23741/RRGE220192"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.02.368"", ""10.22329/celt.v4i0.3281"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2008.11.001"", ""10.1080/03098260500030363"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2013.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.envdev.2015.03.005"", ""10.3390/su11226465"", ""10.1504/IJSSOC.2020.105012"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.05.028"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-03-2017-0043"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.11.708"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2008.12.002"", ""10.3390/su10010158"", ""10.1007/s10037-017-0116-9"", ""10.1080/13504509.2019.1672220"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2004)130:3(173)"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1009871"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000118"", ""10.1177/2053019614564785"", ""10.1080/13504620701295726"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.064"", ""10.1111/conl.12315"", ""10.1590/s1413-24782017226926"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.07.022"", ""10.1080/03043799908923571"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.09.038"", ""10.1080/13504622.2013.879695"", ""10.1080/13549839908725594"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.10.041""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Education', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Like octopuses and worms in nature, soft robots’ flexible bodies conform to hard objects and reconfigure for different tasks, delegating the burden of control from brain to body through embodied cognition. However, because of the lack of efficient modeling and simulation tools, soft robots are primarily designed by hand. Typically, hard components from rigid robots or living creatures are heuristically substituted for comparable soft ones. Autonomous design and manufacturing methodologies are urgently required to produce bespoke, high‐performing robots. Currently, design methodologies exist between simple but realistic parametric optimizations, and evolutionary algorithms which simulate morphology and control coevolution. To find high‐performing designs, novel high‐fidelity simulators and high‐throughput manufacturing and testing processes are required to explore the complex soft material, morphology and control landscape, blending simulation, and experimental data. This article reviews the state of the art in autonomous soft robotic design. Existing manual and automated designs are surveyed and future directions to automate soft robot design and manufacturing are presented.","[{""name"": ""Joshua Pinskier"", ""affiliation"": [""Robotics

10.1186/s41239-021-00302-w,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Educational chatbots for project-based learning: investigating learning outcomes for a team-based design course,"AbstractEducational chatbots (ECs) are chatbots designed for pedagogical purposes and are viewed as an Internet of Things (IoT) interface that could revolutionize teaching and learning. These chatbots are strategized to provide personalized learning through the concept of a virtual assistant that replicates humanized conversation. Nevertheless, in the education paradigm, ECs are still novel with challenges in facilitating, deploying, designing, and integrating it as an effective pedagogical tool across multiple fields, and one such area is project-based learning. Therefore, the present study investigates how integrating ECs to facilitate team-based projects for a design course could influence learning outcomes. Based on a mixed-method quasi-experimental approach, ECs were found to improve learning performance and teamwork with a practical impact. Moreover, it was found that ECs facilitated collaboration among team members that indirectly influenced their ability to perform as a team. Nevertheless, affective-motivational learning outcomes such as perception of learning, need for cognition, motivation, and creative self-efficacy were not influenced by ECs. Henceforth, this study aims to add to the current body of knowledge on the design and development of EC by introducing a new collective design strategy and its pedagogical and practical implications.","[{""name"": ""Jeya Amantha Kumar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-49186-4_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-24305-0_38"", ""10.1145/3236669"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.119.2.197"", ""10.14236/ewic/HCI2018.153"", ""10.1080/10447318.2020.1841438"", ""10.1177/0735633120929622"", ""10.1080/03055698.2020.1850426"", ""10.1016/j.future.2018.01.055"", ""10.18178/ijmerr.7.5.528-533"", ""10.9781/ijimai.2021.05.007"", ""10.1177/1073191118793208"", ""10.1109/ISCE.2016.7797406"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01063"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135153"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-17705-8_13"", ""10.1145/3085558"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.023"", ""10.7238/elc.chatbots.2018"", ""10.1109/TALE.2018.8615175"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.08.045"", ""10.3390/ijerph17061883"", ""10.1037/stl0000021"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/879/1/012049"", ""10.3926/jiem.2929"", ""10.18420/delfi2019_289"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39540-7_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39540-7_3"", ""10.1109/IMITEC45504.2019.9015857"", ""10.5465/AMJ.2009.41331431"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2006.11.014"", ""10.1080/02635143.2019.1682988"", ""10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125183"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037925"", ""10.1007/s10798-020-09566-1"", ""10.1109/TALE48000.2019.9226016"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39540-7_16"", ""10.3390/JOITMC6020031"", ""10.1109/ICETA48886.2019.9040095"", ""10.1108/MD-04-2019-0516"", ""10.1061/(asce)0742-597x(2008)24:2(111)"", ""10.1145/3012430.3012625"", ""10.1007/s10758-019-09414-9"", ""10.1145/3291078.3291115"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.1.33"", ""10.1177/0013164493053003024"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/434/1/012132"", ""10.1109/R10-HTC.2017.8288910"", ""10.1142/S0218194019400163"", ""10.1142/S0218194019400163"", ""10.1002/9781119563600"", ""10.48009/4_iis_2018_44-52"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.09.169"", ""10.1057/s41265-017-0049-3"", ""10.1111/bjet.12723"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/325/1/012005"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-54226-3_8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103862"", ""10.1109/GHCI47972.2019.9071832"", ""10.3233/SHTI200531"", ""10.5944/openpraxis.12.1.1063"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39540-7_17"", ""10.1016/S0742-051X(01)00046-4"", ""10.1037/apl0000486"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00269-8"", ""10.1109/FIE.2018.8659282"", ""10.3200/JOER.102.6.463-472"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100023"", ""10.1080/01587919.2020.1724768"", ""10.5465/AMBPP.2018.15903abstract"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988252"", ""10.1080/03055698.2018.1516628"", ""10.1007/s11423-017-9534-1"", ""10.1177/0735633120952067""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Communication', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

To engage with questions of ethical practice, the authors begin with the International Society for Technology in Education framework for digital citizenship. They expand on these standards to argue for an awareness of the ethical questions facing citizens online that are difficult to encompass as a set of skills or competencies. The authors then take these considerations into a set of practical steps for teachers to nurture participatory and social justice–oriented digital citizenship as part of the curriculum. The authors conclude by noting the digital divide and social inequities that have been highlighted by the current crisis.","[{""name"": ""Beth A.

10.1111/medu.14073,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Autonomy and professional identity formation in residency training: A qualitative study,"AbstractContextProfessional identity formation (PIF) involves the development of professional values, actions and aspirations and is central to medical education. Current understanding of PIF is informed by psychological and sociological theories. One ideal of medicine is responsibility to the patient; the development of this ideal is related to learner autonomy. The purpose of this study was to further theorise the relationships between the individual and contextual aspects of PIF through exploring the associations amongst autonomy, making decisions and responsibility for patients during residency training.MethodsUsing constructivist grounded theory, we conducted 23 semi‐structured interviews with internal medicine residents at an academic medical centre. Interview transcripts were de‐identified and processed through open coding and analytic memo writing. During data collection and analysis, we identified social cognitive theory (SCT), specifically reciprocal determinism, or the triadic and reciprocal relationship between context, person and behaviour, as a useful theoretical lens through which to illuminate the relationship between autonomy and PIF. Using SCT to guide analysis, we organised themes, identified relationships amongst themes, and refined them through group discussion and constant comparison with new data.ResultsResidents discussed three main themes: autonomy; making decisions, and responsibility for patient care. Autonomy allowed residents to feel personally responsible for patient care, and build confidence and trust. Autonomy allowed residents to feel engaged in making ‘real decisions’ for patient care. By displaying confidence in their decision making, residents were granted more autonomy. Lack of autonomy led to disengagement and lack of ownership over patient care.ConclusionsThis study highlighted the role of autonomy in the PIF of learners. Exploring the tension between autonomy and supervision through the lens of SCT highlighted the interconnectedness of context, behaviour and identity in PIF. To ensure optimal learning environments for PIF, educators should weigh the need for autonomy against the demands for supervision and patient safety.","[{""name"": ""Adam P.

10.3390/educsci10080198,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Active Learning Augmented Reality for STEAM Education-A Case Study,"Immersive technologies are rapidly transforming the field of education. Amongst them, Augmented Reality (AR) has shown promise as a resource, particularly for education in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM). There are, however, few teachers deploying this new medium in the classroom directly, and, consequently, only a few, elect students benefit from the AR-enriched offers. Curricula are already overloaded, and schools generally lack developmental resources, thus leaving no room for experimentation. This situation is further aggravated by the too few educational applications available with sufficient learning content. In this article, we investigate the method of Active Learning for the teaching of STEAM subjects, using a format where students are tasked with building an AR application as part of their learning. We evaluate the applicability of the Active Learning for STEAM subjects with a qualitative, case study approach, applying the workshop format as an extracurricular activity in our work with students from a range of secondary schools in Oxford. We discuss how the format works, so it can be embedded into regular curricula, not just as an extracurricular activity, also providing an overview on the involved teaching units and rationale. All teams in our preview audience of the case study succeeded in building working applications, several of impressive complexity. Students found that the lessons were enjoyable and AR technology can enhance their learning experience. The Active Learning method served as a catalyst for students’ skills development, with the case study providing evidence of learning to code, working with a physics simulation engine, ray-tracing, and geometry, learning how to manage teams and interact with other students/instructors, and engineering a working prototype of a game. We consequentially argue that combining the STEM subjects and the arts, using the proposed Active Learning format, is able to provide a more holistic and engaging education.","[{""name"": ""Joanna Jesionkowska"", ""affiliation"": [""Performance Augmentation Lab, Oxford Brookes University, Headington Rd, Headington, Oxford OX3 0BP, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Fridolin Wild"", ""affiliation"": [""Performance Augmentation Lab, Oxford Brookes University, Headington Rd, Headington, Oxford OX3 0BP, UK"", ""Institute of Educational Technology, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Yann Deval"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent researcher, Centre de la Marionnette de la Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles, ATLAS, Rue Saint Martin, 47-7500 Tournai, Belgium""]}]","[""10.1016/j.futures.2019.04.009"", ""10.3991/ijep.v5i2.4458"", ""10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2016.0015"", ""10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355"", ""10.1007/s11528-012-0559-3"", ""10.1016/j.cag.2011.05.002"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2020.1737210"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.024"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-2419-1_2"", ""10.1109/ISMAR.2012.6402590"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103635"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.02.007"", ""10.1080/03043797.2016.1209463"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2006.11.001"", ""10.1080/03043797.2016.1254160"", ""10.1007/s10956-005-4425-3"", ""10.1080/03043797.2016.1193126"", ""10.1002/cae.22035"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.002"", ""10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943042""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

10.1177/1356336X20923710,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW,0401 Education,A scoping review critically examining research connecting social and emotional learning with three model-based practices in physical education: Have we been doing this all along?,"The purpose of this scoping review is to critically examine previous research that connects three selected model-based practices (MBPs) to social and emotional learning (SEL) outcomes in K-12 physical education (PE) settings to inform a future research agenda for the field. A methodological framework involving the processes of inductive analysis and constant comparison was followed. Sixty-three studies (teaching personal and social responsibility = 26; cooperative learning = 24; and outdoor and/or adventure education = 13) across 14 countries adopting qualitative (26), quantitative (23), and mixed methods (14) in elementary (17), middle (27), and high school (19) settings presented evidence connecting these three MBPs explicitly, but more often implicitly, with SEL outcomes. While it is possible to say SEL skills and outcomes were observed, it would be more appropriate to suggest that there is evidence of only some key skills and elements of SEL outcomes occurring. Similar to general education, we do not know as much about if and how these three MBPs deliver such outcomes comprehensively. The educational and political rhetoric surrounding SEL is not matched by a body of empirical research that dedicates itself solely to investigating SEL in PE using a contemporary theory, framework, and assessment. Aligning future research involving these three MBPs and other pedagogical approaches with a suitable framework and theory involving teachers and students can advance future research on SEL in PE and is necessary in order to develop a common language and understanding within the field.","[{""name"": ""Ben Dyson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Carolina at Greensboro, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Donal Howley"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Carolina at Greensboro, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Paul M.

10.1186/s12909-021-02576-0,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice of undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey in Indonesia,"Abstract Background The question to involve or restrict medical students’ involvement in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response remains contentious. As their state of preparation and perceptions in volunteering during this pandemic have yet to be investigated, this study aims to evaluate Indonesian medical students’ willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A web-based survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students throughout Indonesia. Socio-demographic and social interaction information, in addition to willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice, were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. The significance level was set at 5%. Results Among 4870 participants, 2374 (48.7%) expressed their willingness to volunteer, while only 906 (18.6%) had adequate readiness to practice. Male students, students with prior volunteering experience in health or non-health sectors, and students from public universities or living in Central Indonesia (vs Java) had higher scores of willingness and readiness to volunteer. Students from Sumatra also had better preparedness (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–2.12, p = 0.004), while the opposite occurred for students from Eastern Indonesia (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44–0.89, p = 0.002)–when compared to students from Java. In addition, compared to students with high family income, students from lower-middle income families were less willing to volunteer (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59–0.98, p = 0.034), though those with low family income had better readiness (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10–2.08, p = 0.011). Shortage of medical personnel, sense of duty, and solicitation by stakeholders were the main reasons increasing the students’ willingness to volunteer; whereas contrarily fear for own’s health, absence of a cure, and fear of harming patients were the primary factors diminishing their willingness to volunteer. Conclusion Our findings indicated that many Indonesian medical students are willing to volunteer, yet only few of them were ready to practice, indicating that further preparations are required to maximize their potentials and minimize their exposure to hazards. We suggest that their potentials as a firm support system during the pandemic should not be overlooked, and that the integration of relevant courses to the medical curricula are imperative to prepare for future public health emergencies.","[{""name"": ""Gilbert Lazarus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ardi Findyartini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Azis Muhammad Putera"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nico Gamalliel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Nugraha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Imam Adli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jason Phowira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lyanna Azzahra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bagas Ariffandi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Indah Suci Widyahening"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7189/jogh.10.020306"", ""10.1007/s40037-020-00592-2"", ""10.3946/kjme.2020.165"", ""10.7326/M20-1281"", ""10.1080/10872981.2020.1764741"", ""10.1136/medethics-2020-106353"", ""10.1017/dmp.2019.157"", ""10.1111/j.1750-2659.2008.00042.x"", ""10.1017/dmp.2017.18"", ""10.4103/sja.SJA_203_17"", ""10.4081/jphr.2020.1918"", ""10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4"", ""10.1186/s12879-018-3199-1"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020218"", ""10.1017/dmp.2019.81"", ""10.1111/irv.12310"", ""10.24911/IJMDC.51-1591758178"", ""10.1186/s12889-018-6077-2"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182952bc3"", ""10.1111/1467-8721.00037"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0689-y"", ""10.1017/dmp.2020.315"", ""10.1017/dmp.2020.56"", ""10.4103/jehp.jehp_377_20"", ""10.1016/j.amsu.2020.10.010"", ""10.1080/13561820.2020.1822790"", ""10.1097/PEC.0000000000000806"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02315-x"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2011.05.026""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1039/d1rp00007a,CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,0401 Education,The current state of methods for establishing reliability in qualitative chemistry education research articles,"The tradition of qualitative research drives much of chemistry education research activity. When performing qualitative studies, researchers must demonstrate the trustworthiness of their analysis so researchers and practitioners consuming their work can understand if and how the presented research claims and conclusions might be transferable to their unique educational settings. There are a number of steps researchers can take to demonstrate the trustworthiness of their work, one of which is demonstrating and reporting evidence of reliability. The purpose of this methodological review is to investigate the methods researchers use to establish and report reliability for chemistry education research articles including a qualitative research component. Drawing from the literature on qualitative research methodology and content analysis, we describe the approaches for establishing the reliability of qualitative data analysis using various measures of inter-rater reliability and processes including negotiated agreement. We used this background literature to guide our review of research articles containing a qualitative component and published in Chemistry Education Research and Practice and the Journal of Chemical Education from the years 2010 through 2019 for whether they report evidence of reliability. We followed this by a more in-depth analysis of how articles from the years 2017 through 2019 discuss reliability. Our analysis indicates that, overall, researchers are presenting evidence of reliability in chemistry education research (CER) articles by reporting reliability measures, describing a process of negotiated agreement, or mentioning reliability and the steps taken to demonstrate it. However, there is a reliance on reporting only percent agreement, which is not considered an acceptable measure of reliability when used on its own. In addition, the descriptions of how reliability was established were not always clear, which may make it difficult for readers to evaluate the veracity of research findings. Our findings indicate that, as a field, CER researchers should be more cognizant of the appropriateness of how we establish reliability for qualitative analysis and should more clearly present the processes by which reliability was established in CER manuscripts.","[{""name"": ""Field M.

10.1111/bjet.13151,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Teachers' digital competence to assist students with functional diversity: Identification of factors through logistic regression methods,"AbstractWe are experiencing a serious health crisis due to COVID‐19 that has a major impact on the field of education. The educational system therefore needs to be updated and innovated, with the addition of digital resources, to adapt the teaching and learning processes to students with disabilities. To meet the goal of high‐quality education, teachers must have adequate digital competence to face the educational demands that are placed on them. Therefore, the purposes of this study are: to know the teachers' knowledge about digital resources to support students with disabilities (O1); at each educational stage (O2), identify the variables that have a significant impact on the acquisition of teacher competence (O3); propose a selection of useful ICT resources for each type of disability (O4). An ex post facto design was used with 1194 teachers from Andalusia (Spain). The results showed the medium‐low level of the teaching staff, especially in the higher education stage. In addition, gender, motivation, attitude and having students with special needs are determining factors in the development of teacher knowledge. The results highlight the urgent need for teachers to be trained in digital resources. We hope that the range of resources proposed in this study will help teachers enhance their teaching practice. Practitioner notesWhat we already know about this topic Teachers have to find and adapt educational technology to achieve a higher level of success in students with disabilities. The use of ICT resources by teachers acts as a bridge to promote learning in students with disabilities. What this paper adds Identification of those predictors that significantly influence the acquisition of digital competence in teaching staff at various stages of education: gender, educational stage, motivation, attitude towards technologies and having students with specific educational support needs. A proposal of didactic applications is provided to address the different types of functional diversity. Implications for practice and/or policy It is essential that training plans on digital competence are established to assist students with functional diversity in their different learning stages. In this sense, personalised training itineraries or TMOOCs can be of major assistance. Expansion of the study sample (macro level) to identify digital factors, which affect the acquisition of the digital competence of the teaching staff to support their students' disabilities. Change regarding the type of diagnosis through self‐perception tests, such as those presented by these models, and subsequent work in other fields such as e‐portfolios of evidence or instruments in the form of problem solving.","[{""name"": ""Julio Cabero‐Almenara"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Didactics and Educational Organization Faculty of Education Sciences University of Sevilla  Seville Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Francisco D.

Design/methodology/approach The research used a qualitative methodology with a case study design from an ethnographic-interpretative approach. The participants were 81 higher education level students from the PETE program. For the collection of information, the following techniques and instruments were used: non-participant observation, students’ portfolios, focus groups and group-interviews. Findings The main findings show the teaching positive features of SL experiences in the PETE students. In alignment with the sustainable development model, the findings suggest that SL can boost and strengthen knowledge, comprehension, sensitivity and compromise in relation to the SDGs. It can be concluded that SL allows teacher educators to train socially critical professionals and to progress toward a sustainable development. Originality/value SL emerges as an appropriate pedagogical model to meet the educational needs of higher education and to face global challenges in relation to the sustainable development of the planet.","[{""name"": ""Luis García-Rico"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L.

The squishy touch sensor is developed with custom‐made graphite paste on a tiny permanent magnet, encapsulated in Sil‐Poxy, and the actuator (15 μ‐thick coil) is fabricated on polyimide by Lithographie Galvanoformung Abformung (LIGA) micromolding method. The actuator can operate in two modes (expansion and contraction/squeeze) and two states (vibration and nonvibration). The sensor was tested with up to 12 N applied forces and exhibited ≈70% average relative resistance variation (ΔR/Ro), ≈0.346 kPa−1 sensitivity, and ≈49 ms response time with excellent repeatability (≈12.7% coefficient of variation) at 5 N. During simultaneous sensing and actuation, the modulation of coil current, due to ΔR/Ro (≈14% at 2 N force) in the sensor, allows the close loop control (ΔI/Io ≈385%) of expansion/contraction (≈69.8 μm expansion in nonvibration state and ≈111.5 μm peak‐to‐peak in the vibration state). Finally, the soft sensor is embedded in the 3D‐printed fingertip of a robotic hand to demonstrate its use for pressure mapping along with remote vibrotactile stimulation using SensAct device. The self‐controllable actuation of SensAct could provide eSkin the ability to tune stiffness and the vibration states could be utilized for controlled haptic feedback.","[{""name"": ""Oliver Ozioko"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8 QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Prakash Karipoth"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8 QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Pablo Escobedo"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8 QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Markellos Ntagios"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8 QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Abhilash Pullanchiyodan"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8 QQ Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Ravinder Dahiya"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering University of Glasgow  G12 8 QQ Glasgow UK""]}]","[""10.1038/s41528-018-0045-x"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2018.2890729"", ""10.1016/j.mechatronics.2017.11.002"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2019.2941366"", ""10.1002/anie.201800907"", ""10.1038/nmat4671"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.11.471"", ""10.1002/aisy.201900080"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-40828-8"", ""10.3390/s20174780"", ""10.1080/01691864.2015.1095653"", ""10.1038/nmat2834"", ""10.1038/ncomms4132"", ""10.1002/adma.201304248"", ""10.3389/fnins.2017.00501"", ""10.1152/jn.01007.2009"", ""10.1002/aisy.201900051"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2018.2844194"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0579-1"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2018.2876678"", ""10.1063/1.5030545"", ""10.1016/j.orgel.2018.01.041"", ""10.1109/TSM.2015.2468053"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2012.02.046"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2011.2159835"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2019.2928797"", ""10.1002/adfm.201606287"", ""10.1098/rsta.2019.0156"", ""10.1111/joa.12942"", ""10.3390/act5030021"", ""10.1002/adfm.201800244"", ""10.1002/admt.201600018"", ""10.3390/act4010017"", ""10.1002/adfm.201806057"", ""10.1002/pi.4562"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2007.10.076"", ""10.1002/admt.201900042"", ""10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2986222"", ""10.1002/aisy.201900025"", ""10.1002/admt.201900493"", ""10.1016/j.mee.2019.111031"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2016.05.007"", ""10.3390/mi9010013"", ""10.1109/TOH.2016.2591951"", ""10.1002/9780470602638.ch15"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0134095""]","['Engineering', 'Neuroscience']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Researchers attribute this to stereotypes and institutional climates that juxtapose their STEM and racial identities as incongruent. In this article, we analyzed the perceptions of environmental, behavioral, and verbal racial microaggressions of 33 Black doctoral students and postdocs, with a focus on their interactions with non‐Black peers. Data were collected through semi‐structured interviews with Black doctoral students from 11 Predominantly White Institutions in the United States. To analyze the experiences of our participants, we utilized two theoretical frameworks: Racial microaggressions and identity nonverification. Across the interviews, participants described various forms of racial microaggressions that greatly challenged their sense of belonging and identities as engineers. This research affirms the need to develop initiatives at the departmental and institutional levels to encourage more inclusive spaces for diverse students in STEM doctoral programs and to combat the types of exclusionary practices found in this study.","[{""name"": ""Monica L.

10.1007/s40979-020-0051-3,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EDUCATIONAL INTEGRITY,0401 Education,Impact of academic integrity on workplace ethical behaviour,"AbstractCorruption is a serious problem in Mexico and the available information regarding the levels of academic dishonesty in Mexico is not very encouraging. Academic integrity is essential in any teaching-learning process focussed on achieving the highest standards of excellence and learning. Promoting and experiencing academic integrity within the university context has a twofold purpose: to achieve the necessary learnings and skills to appropriately perform a specific profession and to develop an ethical perspective which leads to correct decision making. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between academic integrity and ethical behaviour, particularly workplace behaviour. The study adopts a quantitative, hypothetical and deductive approach. A questionnaire was applied to 1203 college students to gather information regarding the frequency in which they undertake acts of dishonesty in different environments and in regards to the severity they assign to each type of infraction. The results reflect that students who report committing acts against academic integrity also report being involved in dishonest activities in other contexts, and that students who consider academic breaches less serious, report being engaged in academic misconduct more frequently in different contexts. In view of these results, it is unavoidable to reflect on the role that educational institutions and businesses can adopt in the development of programmes to promote a culture of academic integrity which: design educational experiences to foster learning, better prepare students to fully meet their academic obligations, highlight the benefits of doing so, prevent the severity and consequences of dishonest actions, discourage cheating and establish clear and efficient processes to sanction those students who are found responsible for academic breaches.","[{""name"": ""Jean Gabriel Guerrero-Dib"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luis Portales"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yolanda Heredia-Escorza"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1207/S15327019EB1001_1"", ""10.15581/015.XIX.2.51-68"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_1"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_10"", ""10.1037/a0026406"", ""10.2202/0027-6014.1069"", ""10.1109/MAP.2004.1388860"", ""10.1177/1094428104263675"", ""10.1111/j.1467-629X.2007.00245.x"", ""10.1016/j.profnurs.2012.10.009"", ""10.1023/B:BUSI.0000015784.34148.cb"", ""10.1007/s10805-013-9186-7"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_35"", ""10.1080/08832320109599052"", ""10.1016/j.erap.2018.02.001"", ""10.1177/0273475310377781"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2014.12.019"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139962933"", ""10.1080/08832323.1993.10117614"", ""10.21913/IJEI.v6i1.674"", ""10.1037/10694-000"", ""10.1023/A:1026551002367""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Safety Research']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

The development of flexible strain sensors offers the possibility of directly measuring the finger motion behaviors for accurate and cost‐effective hand gesture recognition, by placing the sensors on the fingers or integrating them on data gloves. Herein, the operation mechanisms of various flexible strain sensor designs are introduced first. Progresses on related materials and device structures to achieve the demanded figure of merits for flexible strain sensors are then reviewed. In addition to continuous performance optimization of the flexible strain sensor devices, the development of system‐level algorithms is shown to be important for not only recognition functions but also for suppression of nonidealities of the sensor devices, which are difficult to be addressed at device and material level.","[{""name"": ""Yuying Si"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronic

10.1007/s10459-022-10098-7,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Entrustable professional activities versus competencies and skills: Exploring why different concepts are often conflated,"AbstractDespite explanations in the literature, a returning question in the use of entrustable professional activities (EPAs) is how to distinguish them from competencies and skills. In this article, we attempt to analyze the causes of the frequent confusion and conflation of EPAs with competencies and skills, and argue why the distinction is important for education, qualification and patient safety. ‘Tracheotomy’, ‘lumbar puncture’, ‘interprofessional collaboration’ for example are colloquially called ‘skills’, but its is a person’s ability to perform these activities that is the actual skill; the EPA is simply the activity itself. We identify two possible causes for the confusion. One is a tendency to frame all educational objectives as EPAs. Many objectives of medical training can be conceptualized as EPAs, if ‘the ability to do X’ is the corresponding competency; but that does not work for all. We offer ways to deal with objectives of training that are not usefully conceptualized as EPAs. A more fundamental cause relates to entrustment decisions. The permission to contribute to health care reflects entrustment. Entrustment decisions are the links or pivots between a person’s readiness for the task and the actual task execution. However, if entrustment decisions do not lead to increased autonomy in the practice of health care, but only serve to decide upon the advancement to a next stage of training, EPAs can become the tick boxes learners feel they need to collect to ‘pass’. Gradually, then, EPAs can loose their original meaning of units of practice for which one becomes qualified.","[{""name"": ""Olle ten Cate"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel J.

10.1186/s40594-020-00230-7,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Creating inclusive classrooms by engaging STEM faculty in culturally responsive teaching workshops,"AbstractBackgroundAs higher education institutions strive to effectively support an increasingly diverse student body, they will be called upon to provide their faculty with tools to teach more inclusively, especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classrooms where recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented and disadvantaged groups present long-standing challenges. Pedagogical training approaches to creating inclusive classrooms involve interventions that raise awareness of student and instructor social identities and explore barriers to learning, such as implicit bias, microaggressions, stereotype threat, and fixed mindset. Such efforts should focus on embracing diversity as an asset leveraged to benefit all students in their learning. In this paper, we describe the impact of multiday, off-campus immersion workshops designed to impart faculty with these tools. Based on analysis of workshop participant data, we report the resulting changes in faculty knowledge of factors affecting classroom climate and student success in STEM, attitudes about students, and motivation to adopt new teaching practices aimed at fostering equitable and culturally responsive learning environments.ResultsKey findings indicate that attendees (1) increased their knowledge of social identities and the barriers to learning in STEM classrooms, particularly those faced by students from underrepresented groups in STEM or socioeconomically challenged backgrounds; (2) changed their attitudes about students’ abilities as science majors, shifting away from a fixed-mindset perspective in which characteristics, such as intelligence, are perceived as innate and unalterable; and (3) modified their teaching approaches to promote inclusivity and cultural responsiveness.ConclusionFaculty members, who are linchpins in the evolution of college classrooms into settings that provide students with equitable opportunities to succeed academically in STEM, can benefit from participating in immersion workshops structured to support their awareness of issues affecting classroom culture related to race/ethnicity, LGBTQ status, religious affiliation, ability, socioeconomic status, and other social identities that contribute to disparities in STEM achievement and persistence.","[{""name"": ""Erin Sanders O’Leary"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Casey Shapiro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shannon Toma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hannah Whang Sayson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marc Levis-Fitzgerald"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tracy Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victoria L.

10.1186/s12909-021-02575-1,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,A comparative study regarding distance learning and the conventional face-to-face approach conducted problem-based learning tutorial during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Abstract Background Educational pedagogies were modified during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimise interruption to teaching. One approach has been the distance learning problem-based learning (PBL) tutorial utilising the online peer-to-peer platform. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of students using distance learning PBL tutorials using with that of students utilising the conventional face-to-face approach. Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a single academic institution. We compared two groups of fourth-year medical students from the same class: one group used distance learning (DL); the other, the face-to-face (FF) method. We used students’ baseline performance at the preceding block for one-to-one propensity score matching. Students utilising the PBL tutorial were given grades by their tutors according to a standardised scoring system encompassing five key areas (score range: 0–10). The main outcome was a student’s total score (i.e., the sum of the scores from the five key areas, ranging from 0 to 50). Result We matched 62 students in each group. With four tutorials, there were 490 observations, with 245 in each group. The mean total score for the DL group was 37.5 ± 4.6, which was significantly lower than that of the FF group (39.0 ± 4.4, p &lt; 0.001). We noted that students in the DL group had a significantly lower scores for all five areas of proficiency: participation, communication, preparation, critical thinking and group skills. Conclusion Findings of this study revealed that the performance of students utilising the DL PBL tutorials was lower than that of students participating in the conventional FF approach. Further studies are needed to ascertain the underlying cause.","[{""name"": ""Chi-chung Foo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Billy Cheung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kent-man Chu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/medu.14172"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.03.018"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003441"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2006.3.3"", ""10.1111/medu.14175"", ""10.1111/1744-1633"", ""10.3109/13697137.2015.1115314"", ""10.1097/00001888-200603000-00002"", ""10.2196/20963"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318033385d"", ""10.3402/meo.v4i.4303"", ""10.1097/00001888-200503000-00020"", ""10.1055/s-0040-1709715"", ""10.4066/AMJ.2011.823"", ""10.3389/fdigh.2016.00005"", ""10.1111/medu.14272"", ""10.1002/ase.1967"", ""10.4103/ijo.IJO_1241_20""]","['Engineering', 'Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/medu.14131,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Where medical education meets artificial intelligence: 'Does technology care?',"Abstract‘Cold’ technologies and ‘warm’ hands‐on medicine need to walk hand‐in‐handTechnologies, such as deep learning artificial intelligence (AI), promise benign solutions to thorny, complex problems; but this view is misguided. Though AI has revolutionised aspects of technical medicine, it has brought in its wake practical, conceptual, pedagogical and ethical conundrums. For example, widespread adoption of technologies threatens to shift emphasis from ‘hands‐on’ embodied clinical work to disembodied ‘technology enhanced’ fuzzy scenarios muddying ethical responsibilities. Where AI can offer a powerful sharpening of diagnostic accuracy and treatment options, ‘cold’ technologies and ‘warm’ hands‐on medicine need to walk hand‐in‐hand. This presents a pedagogical challenge grounded in historical precedent: in the wake of Vesalian anatomy introducing the dominant metaphor of ‘body as machine,’ a medicine of qualities was devalued through the rise of instrumental scientific medicine. The AI age in medicine promises to redouble the machine metaphor, reducing complex patient experiences to linear problem‐solving interventions promising ‘solutionism.’ As an instrumental intervention, AI can objectify patients, frustrating the benefits of dialogue, as patients’ complex and often unpredictable fleshly experiences of illness are recalculated in solution‐focused computational terms.Suspicions about solutionsThe rate of change in numbers and sophistication of new technologies is daunting; they include surgical robotics, implants, computer programming and genetic interventions such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Contributing to the focus of this issue on ‘solutionism,’ we explore how AI is often promoted as an all‐encompassing answer to complex problems, including the pedagogical, where learning ‘hands‐on’ bedside medicine has proven benefits beyond the technical. Where AI and embodied medicine have differing epistemological, ontological and axiological roots, we must not imagine that they will readily walk hand‐in‐hand down the aisle towards a happy marriage. Their union will be fractious, requiring lifelong guidance provided by a perceptive medical education suspicious of ‘smart’ solutions to complex problems.","[{""name"": ""Anneke G. van der Niet"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences School of Health Professions Education Maastricht University Maastricht the Netherlands"", ""Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care University Medical Center Utrecht Utrecht the Netherlands""]}, {""name"": ""Alan Bleakley"", ""affiliation"": [""Plymouth University Peninsula School of Medicine Plymouth UK""]}]","[""10.3399/bjgp18X695213"", ""10.4324/9781315389448"", ""10.4324/9780429260438"", ""10.1056/NEJM198703123161109"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2019.1595557"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002044"", ""10.1001/amajethics.2019.146"", ""10.1111/medu.13916"", ""10.1515/jib-2017-0030"", ""10.1515/9781474413640"", ""10.1007/978-4-431-54853-9"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002175"", ""10.1057/sth.2014.18"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199256044.001.0001"", ""10.1001/archinternmed.2011.327"", ""10.15537/smj.2017.12.20631"", ""10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181c1b18e"", ""10.4324/9781315887104"", ""10.1177/0018726710367441"", ""10.1111/nup.12154"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000092"", ""10.1111/1467-9566.00342"", ""10.1001/jama.2017.19198"", ""10.1038/nature21056"", ""10.1016/j.radonc.2013.07.007"", ""10.2478/v10136-012-0031-x"", ""10.1007/S40037-017-0394-5"", ""10.1186/1747-5341-3-10"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001986""]",['Medicine'],"['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Family Practice', 'Health Informatics']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)]]"

The aim of this scoping review was to identify the current status of the literature on trauma that is specific to the experiences of adults with an intellectual disability, living in community settings.MethodsA scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley (International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 2005, 8, 19) framework. Forty‐one international papers were reviewed spanning 2000–2020, and their quality assessed using the MMAT.Findings(1) Aggressive behaviours can be symptoms of trauma, (2) there are appropriate assessment tools for the impact of trauma, (3) evidence‐based interventions for trauma may be effective, and (4) factors associated with disability can be experienced as traumatic.ConclusionThere is a growing body of literature highlighting assessment needs and potential interventions for people with an intellectual disability who have experienced psychological trauma. Further research is needed to develop trauma‐informed pathways.","[{""name"": ""Paddy McNally"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Nursing and Health Science Ulster University Newtownabbey UK""]}, {""name"": ""Laurence Taggart"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Nursing Ulster University Newtownabbey UK""]}, {""name"": ""Mark Shevlin"", ""affiliation"": [""Ulster University Coleraine UK""]}]","[""10.1016/S0749-3797(18)30622-6"", ""10.1080/1364557032000119616"", ""10.1891/1933-3196.4.4.156"", ""10.1108/AMHID-09-2014-0034"", ""10.1111/j.1468-3148.2010.00561.x"", ""10.1037/pas0000254"", ""10.1186/s13033-017-0137-3"", ""10.1111/jar.12243"", ""10.1080/14999013.2016.1228087"", ""10.1920/re.ifs.2081.0143"", ""10.1080/19315864.2019.1637979"", ""10.1352/1944-7558-123.2.176"", ""10.1016/S0005-7967(99)00123-0"", ""10.1016/j.acap.2016.12.011"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2788.2012.01577.x"", ""10.1037/1040-3590.9.4.445"", ""10.1111/jir.12091"", ""10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8"", ""10.1080/13668250902845228"", ""10.1177/1744629514560638"", ""10.1016/j.comppsych.2013.08.020"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00693.x"", ""10.1177/1073191104269954"", ""10.1111/bjc.12048"", ""10.1002/mrdd.20097"", ""10.1097/00006842-197905000-00004"", ""10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30118-4"", ""10.1016/j.dhjo.2018.09.007"", ""10.1080/15021149.2007.11434286"", ""10.1111/jar.12570"", ""10.1108/AMHID-04-2013-0028"", ""10.1111/jppi.12071"", ""10.1111/jar.12197"", ""10.1352/1934-9556-58.3.208"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.110.080499"", ""10.1111/jar.12734"", ""10.1080/19315864.2020.1760972"", ""10.1111/jar.12067"", ""10.1097/00006842-200203000-00008"", ""10.1111/j.1468-3148.2005.00275.x"", ""10.1108/AMHID-05-2016-0008"", ""10.1080/19371918.2011.619433"", ""10.1016/S1077-7229(02)80026-8"", ""10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181923c8c"", ""10.1192/apt.7.3.163"", ""10.1111/jcpp.12993"", ""10.1016/j.cpr.2009.12.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08613-2_95-2"", ""10.3109/13668250.2011.621415"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2788.2005.00705.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-3148.2005.00235.x"", ""10.1111/eip.12478"", ""10.1007/BF00805440"", ""10.1192/bjp.163.4.471"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2788.2007.00973.x"", ""10.1111/inm.12012"", ""10.1007/s00127-017-1371-3"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349"", ""10.6000/2292-2598.2016.04.01.4"", ""10.1111/j.1468-3156.2003.00254.x"", ""10.1046/j.1468-3148.2003.00145.x"", ""10.1111/jppi.12323"", ""10.1111/bld.12259"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4187.2006.00426.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-3148.2006.00347.x"", ""10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.09.018"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1123"", ""10.1002/wps.20322"", ""10.1111/jar.12549"", ""10.1111/jir.12733"", ""10.1111/jar.12016"", ""10.1023/A:1025714729117"", ""10.1111/jir.12540"", ""10.1111/jar.12720"", ""10.1108/QAOA-11-2018-0061"", ""10.1080/17522439.2014.980308"", ""10.53841/bpsfpid.2020.18.1.15"", ""10.53841/bpsfpid.2020.18.1.20"", ""10.1016/j.ridd.2019.103513"", ""10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00047-8"", ""10.3928/0048-5713-20040301-08"", ""10.1007/s10567-009-0056-1"", ""10.1016/S0145-2134(00)00190-3"", ""10.7326/M18-0850"", ""10.1111/jar.12634"", ""10.3390/ijerph15102136"", ""10.1007/s40474-015-0041-y"", ""10.1080/19315864.2010.534576"", ""10.1016/j.ridd.2011.06.008"", ""10.1111/jir.12107"", ""10.1108/JAP-05-2019-0016""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Safety Research']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Using a large national data set, the current study compares mental health outcomes during the pandemic between pre-K–12 teachers and professionals in other occupations. Further, we compare the prevalence of mental health outcomes between in-person and remote teachers ( N = 134,693). Findings indicate that teachers reported a greater prevalence of anxiety symptoms than did those in other professions and that remote teachers reported significantly higher levels of distress than did those teaching in person. We summarize the policy implications of these results.","[{""name"": ""Joseph M.

10.1108/ET-10-2019-0245,EDUCATION AND TRAINING,0401 Education,Students' satisfaction and continuance intention of the cloud-based e-learning system: roles of interactivity and course quality factors,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to propose a research model based on expectation-confirmation model (ECM) to examine whether interactivity and course quality factors (i.e. course content quality, course design quality) as antecedents to student beliefs can influence students' satisfaction and continuance intention of the cloud-based electronic learning (e-learning) system within the educational institution.Design/methodology/approachSample data were collected from students enrolled in a comprehensive university in Taiwan. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed in the campus, and 515 (85.8%) useable questionnaires were analyzed using structural equation modeling.FindingsFindings showed that students' perceptions of interactivity, course content quality and course design quality positively significantly contributed to their perceived usefulness, confirmation and satisfaction with the cloud-based e-learning system, which in turn directly or indirectly led to their continuance intention of the system. Thus, the results strongly supported the research model based on ECM via positioning key constructs as the drivers with all hypothesized links being significant.Originality/valueThis study identifies three factors (i.e. interactivity, course content quality, course design quality) as drivers from the learner perspective within the cloud-based e-learning environment, and links these factors to students' satisfaction and continuance intention of the cloud-based e-learning system based on ECM. It is particularly worth mentioning that the three drivers can serve as precursors for recognizing the determinants that are crucial to understand students' satisfaction and continuance intention of the cloud-based e-learning system. Hence, this study may provide new insights in nourishing the cloud-based e-learning continuance literature in the future.","[{""name"": ""Yung-Ming Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411"", ""10.1007/BF02723327"", ""10.2307/3250921"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.07.010"", ""10.1108/LHT-11-2016-0129"", ""10.1097/JNR.0b013e31824777aa"", ""10.1108/10662241211235699"", ""10.1108/ITP-01-2013-0024"", ""10.1108/ET-09-2018-0203"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2004.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.01.014"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.10.002"", ""10.1177/002224377901600110"", ""10.1007/BF02310555"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.07.004"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982"", ""10.1080/07421222.2003.11045748"", ""10.1080/0260293022000009320"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.01.008"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2012.03.028"", ""10.1177/002224299606000304"", ""10.2753/JOA0091-3367350403"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2008.07.009"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.02.006"", ""10.1108/14684520610706406"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2014.07.050"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.07.008"", ""10.1108/02640471011093534"", ""10.2501/JAR-43-2-207-216"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.009"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2014-0014"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.10.002"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2015-0058"", ""10.1080/00913367.2002.10673674"", ""10.1108/IJWIS-03-2015-0008"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2018.09.021"", ""10.1080/02602930701293231"", ""10.1177/002224378001700405"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2004.10.007"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.im.2015.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.04.006"", ""10.2307/256690"", ""10.1108/00400911311295031"", ""10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206810"", ""10.1108/ET-04-2019-0064"", ""10.1016/j.im.2015.10.004"", ""10.1509/jmkg.72.2.99"", ""10.1016/j.intcom.2011.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007"", ""10.1108/JEIM-04-2014-0039"", ""10.1108/IMDS-08-2014-0231"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.05.001"", ""10.1080/09540091.2013.824407"", ""10.1108/OIR-04-2014-0097"", ""10.1108/EL-02-2016-0046"", ""10.1080/10641734.2006.10505193"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2012.09.001"", ""10.1108/EL-04-2016-0080"", ""10.1109/ICISCE.2017.86"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2009.10.003""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Education']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/bjet.12956,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,"Students' motivational beliefs and strategies, perceived immersion and attitudes towards science learning with immersive virtual reality: A partial least squares analysis","AbstractResearchers have been devoted to exploring the impacts of immersive virtual reality (IVR) on education in recent years. However, efforts to probe the role of students’ learning traits such as motivated strategies for learning in their IVR learning have been limited. Most studies commonly analyzed learners’ perceptions of immersion with a single construct rather than with multiple constructs. Therefore, this study implemented immersive virtual field trips for science learning in three elementary classes (a total of 76 students) for understanding how students’ inherent self‐efficacy, intrinsic value and self‐regulation for science learning related to their perceived immersion (ie, basic attention, temporal dissociation, transportation, emotional involvement, enjoyment) and attitudes (ie, perceived usefulness and behaviors of IVR learning) when engaging in IVR learning environments. The reliability and validity of the constructs in the PLS‐SEM path modeling were first confirmed. This study further identified that motivation of intrinsic value and self‐regulation may play a dominant role in the students’ learning attitudes in IVR environments for science education. It was also verified that the students’ immersive experiences of attention and enjoyment significantly mediated their IVR learning. Notably, the students with lower levels of self‐efficacy may have been more immersed in IVR environments and further held positive learning attitudes. The findings of this study have implications for practicing IVR‐related learning activities in elementary classrooms with considerations of learners’ psychological characteristics and perceived immersion when confronting IVR technology. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Students’ motivational characteristics influences their learning in online environments. Students’ perceived immersion in VR learning context is related to their learning perceptions and predict positive affection. What this paper adds Understanding the structural relationships among young students’ motivational characteristics, perceived immersion, and learning attitudes towards their IVR learning. Identifying a dominant role of motivation of intrinsic value and self‐regulation in students’ learning attitudes in IVR environments for science education. Verifying the mediating effects of immersion on the relationships between motivational characteristics for science learning and learning attitudes. Implications for practice and/or policy IVR‐related learning activities in classrooms may benefit the students with low level of self‐efficacy for science learning. Scaffolding approaches (e.g., prompts for observing virtual elements) might be considered to support those students with limited self‐regulatory skills to learn science in the context of IVR. The immersion factors of basic attention and enjoyment were highlighted when designing or implementing IVR learning activities in classrooms.","[{""name"": ""Kun‐Hung Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chin‐Chung Tsai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10494820.2019.1703008"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-39907-2_25"", ""10.1145/985921.986048"", ""10.1162/105474603322955950"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2014.09.002"", ""10.1111/bjet.12718"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103600"", ""10.1080/01587919.2013.835770"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-23089-0_2"", ""10.1111/jcal.12036"", ""10.1007/s10459-018-9860-z"", ""10.1111/jcal.12130"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.09.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71054-9_66"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1109/ICIME.2018.00010"", ""10.1109/ISET.2018.00064"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.003"", ""10.1108/EBR-10-2013-0128"", ""10.1089/cyber.2015.0073"", ""10.1177/0735633119867422"", ""10.1080/10494820.2013.817436"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.014"", ""10.1109/TE.2014.2379712"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v20i1.4012"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.10.027"", ""10.1007/s12528-015-9090-9"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.10.001"", ""10.1007/s10212-009-0009-6"", ""10.1007/s11165-018-9762-3"", ""10.1111/bjet.12890"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9581-2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2017.12.007"", ""10.1037/edu0000241"", ""10.1177/0013164493053003024"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1541909"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2016.06.003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01157.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.02.006"", ""10.1145/3064663.3064696"", ""10.1007/s10956-014-9494-8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.02.014"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip4102_2""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

We analyze recent dashboards for their ability to provide actionable insights which promote informed responses by learners in making adjustments to their learning habits. Our study finds that most LA dashboards merely employ surface-level descriptive analytics, while only few go beyond and use predictive analytics. In response to the identified gaps in recently published dashboards, we propose a state-of-the-art dashboard that not only leverages descriptive analytics components, but also integrates machine learning in a way that enables both predictive and prescriptive analytics. We demonstrate how emerging analytics tools can be used in order to enable learners to adequately interpret the predictive model behavior, and more specifically to understand how a predictive model arrives at a given prediction. We highlight how these capabilities build trust and satisfy emerging regulatory requirements surrounding predictive analytics. Additionally, we show how data-driven prescriptive analytics can be deployed within dashboards in order to provide concrete advice to the learners, and thereby increase the likelihood of triggering behavioral changes. Our proposed dashboard is the first of its kind in terms of breadth of analytics that it integrates, and is currently deployed for trials at a higher education institution.","[{""name"": ""Teo Susnjak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gomathy Suganya Ramaswami"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anuradha Mathrani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2870052"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.03.035"", ""10.3390/su12208438"", ""10.3390/app11135781"", ""10.1109/TLT.2019.2912167"", ""10.1145/2818993"", ""10.18608/hla17.003"", ""10.1080/10841806.2020.1771907"", ""10.1007/s12528-018-9186-0"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6352.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-47392-1_5"", ""10.33965/celda2019_201911l022"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027396"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-49663-0_51"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00258-x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104041"", ""10.1145/3300115.3309514"", ""10.1080/14703297.2020.1794928"", ""10.1145/3375462.3375472"", ""10.1111/bjet.12868"", ""10.18608/hla17.012"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100729"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2019.1680731"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-47392-1_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64792-0_6"", ""10.18608/hla17.006"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2018.2876857"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0073-y"", ""10.1108/BIJ-04-2020-0151"", ""10.1136/bmj.b2535"", ""10.1145/3351095.3372850"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1529/4/042100"", ""10.3390/app11010237"", ""10.3390/s19132952"", ""10.1109/TALE48869.2020.9368340"", ""10.1186/s41239-021-00284-9"", ""10.1080/01972243.2016.1130502"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.004"", ""10.1145/3290605.3300824"", ""10.1109/ICET48172.2019.8987229"", ""10.1080/10494820.2021.1933542"", ""10.1007/s11423-021-09998-z"", ""10.1080/13562517.2017.1332026"", ""10.2307/26921130""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13006,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Humanoid robots in higher education: Evaluating the acceptance of Pepper in the context of an academic writing course using the UTAUT,"AbstractThis study investigates the acceptance of social robots by higher education students in the social sciences. Pepper, a humanoid social robot from SoftBank Robotics, provided a sample of its capabilities during a first semester, large‐scale, university course, “Introduction to academic writing.”From this course, 462 freshmen participated in our survey. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) acts as the conceptual framework, and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS‐SEM) as the method for data analysis. The four perceived characteristics—trustworthiness, adaptiveness, social presence and appearance—all predict the intention to use the robot for learning purposes; anxiety regarding making mistakes in handling the robot and about privacy issues are not significant predictors. An importance‐performance map analysis indicated adaptiveness as the robot’s most important characteristic for predicting student behavioural intention. Overall, however, the study shows that students do not have the intention to rely on social robots for learning purposes at the current level of state‐of‐the‐art technology: behavioural intention reaches only 36.6% of the theoretical maximum.","[{""name"": ""Josef Guggemos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sabine Seufert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stefan Sonderegger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-34103-8_41"", ""10.1126/science.aaa1465"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.07.031"", ""10.1007/s10798-011-9157-5"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aat5954"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.11.004"", ""10.1145/3175536.3175556"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.020"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.01.013"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02138"", ""10.3390/robotics8010021"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2013.07.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64816-3_9"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2015/39.2.02"", ""10.1109/MRA.2019.2904644"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2013.12.016"", ""10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525832"", ""10.1109/PAEE.2017.8008994"", ""10.1111/bjet.12867"", ""10.1080/01587919.2013.835772"", ""10.1108/EBR-11-2018-0203"", ""10.1177/0018720811417254"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-20403-7_15"", ""10.1037/stl0000021"", ""10.1007/s12369-010-0068-5"", ""10.1108/IMR-09-2014-0304"", ""10.1145/2559636.2559667"", ""10.1145/2559636.2559668"", ""10.1145/2696454.2696457"", ""10.1080/00461520.2013.804395"", ""10.2224/sbp.2013.41.4.587"", ""10.1177/2050157919843961"", ""10.30658/hmc.1.6"", ""10.2316/Journal.209.2013.1.209-0015"", ""10.1111/bjet.12832"", ""10.1109/MRA.2018.2833157"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2013.12.002"", ""10.1108/IMDS-10-2015-0449"", ""10.1007/BF03396886"", ""10.5220/0007714603150322"", ""10.1075/is.12.3.04shi"", ""10.1108/EJM-02-2019-0189"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.001"", ""10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2015.7363546"", ""10.1109/MRA.2007.339605"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01454"", ""10.3758/s13423-018-1432-y"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.1007/s10514-007-9058-3"", ""10.1007/s10763-018-09939-y""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1088/1361-6404/ab7831,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,0401 Education; 0702 Physics,Hermione and the Secretary: how gendered task division in introductory physics labs can disrupt equitable learning,"AbstractPhysics labs provide a unique opportunity for students to grow their physics identity and science identity in general since they provide students with an opportunity to tinker with experiments and analyze data in a low-stakes environment. However, it is important to ensure that all students are benefiting from the labs equally and have a positive growth trajectory. Through interviews and reflexive ethnographic observations, we identify and analyze two common modes of work that may disadvantage female students in introductory physics labs. Students who adopt the Secretary archetype are relegated to recording and analyzing data, and thus may miss out on much of the opportunity to grow their physics and science identities by engaging fully in the experimental work. Meanwhile, students in the Hermione archetype shoulder a disproportionate amount of managerial work, and also may not get an adequate opportunity to engage with different aspects of the experimental work that is essential for helping them develop their physics and science identities. We use a physics identity framework to investigate how students under these modes of work may experience stunted growth in their physics and science identity trajectories in their physics lab course. This stunted growth can then perpetuate and reinforce societal stereotypes and biases about who does physics. Our categorization not only gives a vocabulary to discussions about equity in the physics lab, but may also serve as a useful touchstone for those who seek to center equity in efforts to transform physics instruction.","[{""name"": ""Danny Doucette"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Russell Clark"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chandralekha Singh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1167322"", ""10.1088/1361-6404/aa9585"", ""10.1088/1361-6404/aa5dc1"", ""10.1088/1361-6404/aa8757"", ""10.1088/1361-6404/aaf13b"", ""10.1088/0031-9120/33/4/016"", ""10.1088/0143-0807/28/3/S06"", ""10.1088/0143-0807/28/3/S08"", ""10.1080/0047231X.2019.12290473"", ""10.1088/0143-0807/35/2/025004"", ""10.1088/0143-0807/36/5/055052"", ""10.1088/1361-6404/aad511"", ""10.1119/1.1858450"", ""10.1063/1.3021283"", ""10.1088/1361-6404/aa9689"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.020119"", ""10.1002/tea.20363"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.010121"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.020123"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020130"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020120"", ""10.1080/09540250802213081"", ""10.1080/03043790902989457"", ""10.1177/0891243287001002002"", ""10.1086/345323"", ""10.1086/495540"", ""10.7771/1481-4374.2197"", ""10.1002/tea.20237"", ""10.2307/349494"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.010132"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020114"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.020119"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90022-L"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.37.2.122"", ""10.1002/jee.20118"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.020148"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.13.020136"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e31828c4ae0"", ""10.1119/1.19077"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020104"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020119"", ""10.1109/47.843642"", ""10.1109/FIE.2011.6142970"", ""10.1037/a0018963"", ""10.1119/1.17118"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00347"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.5.020109"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020123""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13165,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Extending the technology acceptance model of college learners' mobile-assisted language learning by incorporating psychological constructs,"AbstractFew studies have investigated the extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) of mobile‐assisted language learning (MALL) by incorporating psychological influence factors. We aimed to determine the factors affecting the continued adoption of MALL by college‐age students of English as a foreign language (EFL). We extended the TAM by adding psychological constructs from action control theory and the concept of intrinsic motivation. Data from a large‐scale survey of 557 Taiwanese college EFL students recruited through online convenience sampling were analysed through structural equation modelling. The results revealed that the significant predictors of behavioural intention were its antecedents. Three crucial psychological factors, namely nonpreoccupation, nonhesitation, and nonvolatility, significantly predicted behavioural intention. Perceived ubiquity value, tasks, and mobile self‐efficacy were strong predictors of intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation significantly predicted behavioural intention through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Finally, perceived ease of use had a moderate effect on behavioural intention through perceived usefulness. The satisfactory explanatory power of the extended model was indicated by the explained variance (R2) of 80% for behavioural intention. This extended TAM may contribute to the long‐term development of MALL. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Mobile technology has been widely adopted to enhance language learning. However, few studies have investigated individuals' adoption of mobile‐assisted language learning (MALL). Factors affecting users' behavioural intention to accept an information system have been researched extensively. The technology acceptance model (TAM) has been extensively used to investigate users' acceptance of different technology in various contexts. What this paper adds This study extended the TAM by incorporating psychological factors to predict the behavioural intention of learners to continue using mobile technology in language learning. The three action‐oriented psychological antecedents (nonpreoccupation, nonhesitation, and nonvolatility) used in the model significantly predicted EFL college learners' behavioural intention to continue using mobile devices for language learning. One major factor (intrinsic motivation) significantly affected continued behavioural intention to engage in MALL through perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Implications for practice and/or policy Teachers should incorporate various warm‐ups, collaborative activities, and positive feedback from others to MALL tasks to reduce feelings of negativity for state‐oriented learners and increase willingness to accept MALL for action‐oriented learners. Teachers and developers of MALL systems can promote its acceptance by prioritising usable interfaces and enjoyable, challenging tasks in the design of MALL systems to increase learners' intrinsic motivation and perceptions of usefulness and ease of use. Technical guidance, clear and brief operation orientation sessions, and immediate support should be offered to assist learners in engaging in MALL tasks.","[{""name"": ""Hui‐Tzu Hsu"", ""affiliation"": [""Language Centre National Chin‐Yi University of Technology  Taichung Taiwan (R.O.C.)""]}, {""name"": ""Chih‐Cheng Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English in National Taiwan Normal University  Taiwan (R.O.C.)""]}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.036"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.1999.tb01614.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.008"", ""10.4278/0890-1171-12.1.8"", ""10.2307/3250921"", ""10.1017/S0958344014000159"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.04.010"", ""10.1080/09588221.2010.536952"", ""10.1007/s40299-012-0011-7"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.015"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1485708"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.015"", ""10.2307/249688"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103850"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00945.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4613-4446-9"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.85.2.250"", ""10.2307/249524"", ""10.4324/9781315779553"", ""10.1111/bjet.12798"", ""10.1177/002224378201900406"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1037/0278-7393.19.5.1211"", ""10.1111/bjet.12864"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1552975"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9465-2"", ""10.17323/2411-7390-2018-4-2-48-58"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103761"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.066"", ""10.1017/S0958344014000214"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.004"", ""10.18178/ijiet.2017.7.9.953"", ""10.14742/ajet.237"", ""10.2753/PSS0885-3134270104"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103841"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9436-7"", ""10.1093/biomet/57.2.239"", ""10.1111/bjet.12833"", ""10.1007/s10212-016-0325-6"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.015"", ""10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal0768"", ""10.1002/9781118914069.ch15"", ""10.1017/S0958344008000335"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0070-1"", ""10.1017/S0958344017000258"", ""10.1080/09588221.2019.1594919"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1541359"", ""10.1111/bjet.12824"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.023"", ""10.1017/S0958344019000065"", ""10.1080/09588221.2017.1301957"", ""10.1016/j.system.2012.10.014"", ""10.1016/j.system.2009.12.013"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(92)90036-7"", ""10.1287/isre.2.3.173"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.7.1.64"", ""10.1016/S0378-7206(00)00061-6"", ""10.1111/bjet.12469"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103942"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.020"", ""10.1111/0023-8333.00111"", ""10.1002/eej.22717"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.01.017"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01229.x"", ""10.1080/10447318.2011.555311"", ""10.1108/JEIM-04-2012-0011"", ""10.1017/S0261444817000192"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2007.06.001"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1020"", ""10.4324/9781315800820"", ""10.1080/09588221.2017.1308383"", ""10.1016/j.im.2004.01.009"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.03.025"", ""10.1016/0959-8022(91)90013-5"", ""10.1057/9781137000873_9"", ""10.1007/s11423-019-09733-9"", ""10.1080/10494820.2017.1341940"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1489290"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2005.00129.x"", ""10.1207/s15327752jpa8701_03"", ""10.1111/bjet.13046"", ""10.1037/h0079855"", ""10.1177/0013164492052004025"", ""10.1177/0013164493053001018"", ""10.2307/249753"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.2008.00192.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926"", ""10.2307/3250981"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.2002.tb01646.x"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2016.08.003"", ""10.1177/0735633120923772"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1016"", ""10.3102/00028312029003663""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Information Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1186/s12909-020-1963-6,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Debate: Why should gender-affirming health care be included in health science curricula?,"Abstract Background Every person who seeks health care should be affirmed, respected, understood, and not judged. However, trans and gender diverse people have experienced significant marginalization and discrimination in health care settings. Health professionals are generally not adequately prepared by current curricula to provide appropriate healthcare to trans and gender diverse people. This strongly implies that health care students would benefit from curricula which facilitate learning about gender-affirming health care. Main body Trans and gender diverse people have been pathologized by the medical profession, through classifications of mental illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Disease (ICD). Although this is changing in the new ICD-11, tension remains between depathologization discourses and access to gender-affirming health care. Trans and gender diverse people experience significant health disparities and an increased burden of disease, specifically in the areas of mental health, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, violence and victimisation. Many of these health disparities originate from discrimination and systemic biases that decrease access to care, as well as from health professional ignorance. This paper will outline gaps in health science curricula that have been described in different contexts, and specific educational interventions that have attempted to improve awareness, knowledge and skills related to gender-affirming health care. The education of primary care providers is critical, as in much of the world, specialist services for gender-affirming health care are not widely available. The ethics of the gatekeeping model, where service providers decide who can access care, will be discussed and contrasted with the informed-consent model that ﻿upholds autonomy by empowering patients to make their own health care decisions. Conclusion There is an ethical imperative for health professionals to reduce health care disparities of trans and gender diverse people and practice within the health care values of social justice and cultural humility. As health science educators, we have an ethical duty to include gender-affirming health in health science curricula in order to prevent harm to the trans and gender diverse patients that our students will provide care for in the future.","[{""name"": ""Elma de Vries"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Harsha Kathard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex Müller"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/1472-6963-12-110"", ""10.1097/QAI.0000000000001088"", ""10.1080/15532739.2016.1149538"", ""10.1080/10401334.2017.1365718"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00684-X"", ""10.1007/s40670-017-0393-5"", ""10.3109/09540261.2015.1091293"", ""10.1007/s10519-018-9889-z"", ""10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596"", ""10.1177/0261018317731716"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0160066"", ""10.3109/09540261.2012.741575"", ""10.1177/0081246318780774"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2014.302373"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001533"", ""10.1089/trgh.2016.0024"", ""10.1080/15532739.2015.1064336"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001231"", ""10.1089/lgbt.2016.0115"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2011.300568"", ""10.1089/lgbt.2015.0111"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674"", ""10.1037/a0029597"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.11.010"", ""10.1080/00918369.2016.1194116"", ""10.1111/ap.12088"", ""10.1007/s11136-017-1656-8"", ""10.1542/peds.2015-3223"", ""10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.09.029"", ""10.1007/s11524-014-9921-4"", ""10.1037/a0037599"", ""10.1016/S1473-3099(12)70315-8"", ""10.2471/BLT.17.197251"", ""10.1037/a0029604"", ""10.1111/socf.12193"", ""10.1177/0038038515622907"", ""10.1097/MLR.0000000000000583"", ""10.1097/MLR.0b013e31829fa90d"", ""10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.05.002"", ""10.1093/fampra/cmx112"", ""10.1111/jocn.13384"", ""10.1111/jocn.13271"", ""10.1080/19359705.2014.960990"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-14-230"", ""10.1071/HC14001"", ""10.1007/s11673-016-9738-9"", ""10.1080/00224499.2016.1142495"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.62.4.271"", ""10.1080/15538605.2012.648583"", ""10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.03.010"", ""10.1080/10130950.2013.855527"", ""10.1007/s11673-012-9367-x"", ""10.1001/jama.2011.1255"", ""10.1111/acem.12368"", ""10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.07.017"", ""10.4300/JGME-D-16-00417.1"", ""10.1080/00918369.2016.1190218"", ""10.36834/cmej.36647"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04272.x"", ""10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.09.042"", ""10.1044/2015_AJSLP-14-0095"", ""10.7196/SAJBL.2018.v11i1.00616"", ""10.1080/15532739.2011.675233"", ""10.1177/0022167817745217"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S147183"", ""10.36834/cmej.36644"", ""10.1007/s40596-016-0570-7"", ""10.1111/medu.13796"", ""10.1007/s40841-019-00143-2"", ""10.1210/jc.2017-01658"", ""10.1542/peds.2018-2162"", ""10.1097/MOP.0000000000000516"", ""10.1016/j.pcl.2016.07.011"", ""10.1080/14681994.2014.883353"", ""10.1001/jamasurg.2016.5549"", ""10.1007/s11930-018-0159-0"", ""10.1213/ANE.0000000000003371"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30653-5"", ""10.1007/s10912-006-9021-x"", ""10.17159/assaf.2018/0021"", ""10.1016/j.pec.2017.06.003""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Gender Studies', 'Pharmacy']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003057,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Common Types of Gender-Based Microaggressions in Medicine,"Purpose Microaggressions are subtle verbal or nonverbal everyday behaviors that arise from unconscious bias, covert prejudice, or hostility. They may contribute to the persistent disparities faced by women in medicine. In this study, the authors sought to identify common microaggressions experienced by women faculty in medicine and to determine if specific demographic characteristics affect the reported frequencies of these microaggressions. Method The authors used chain referral sampling to collect real-life anecdotes about microaggressions from women faculty across the nation. Thirty-four unique experiences from those reported were identified and scripted then reenacted using professional actors to create 34 videos of the real-life microaggressions and 34 corresponding fictional “control” versions of the same situations. The videos, presented in a random order, were evaluated by faculty from 4 academic medical centers from 2016 to 2018. Results A total of 124 faculty (79 women, 45 men) participated. Women reported higher frequencies of microaggressions than men in 33 of the 34 videos depicting microaggressions (P value range: &lt; .001 to .042, area under the curve range: 0.60–0.69). No such differences were seen with the control videos. Women identified 21 microaggressions as occurring frequently. No significant differences were found with respect to participants’ age, race/ethnicity, academic rank, or years in medicine. Post hoc analyses showed that the microaggressions fell into 6 themes: encountering sexism, encountering pregnancy- and child care–related bias, having abilities underestimated, encountering sexually inappropriate comments, being relegated to mundane tasks, and feeling excluded/marginalized. Conclusions Privilege is often invisible to those who have it, whereas bias and discrimination are readily apparent to those who experience it. Knowledge of common microaggressions will allow for targeted individual, interpersonal, and institutional solutions to mitigate disparities in medicine.","[{""name"": ""Vyjeyanthi S.

10.3352/jeehp.2023.20.6,JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONS,0401 Education,Can an artificial intelligence chatbot be the author of a scholarly article?,"At the end of 2022, the appearance of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot with amazing writing ability, caused a great sensation in academia. The chatbot turned out to be very capable, but also capable of deception, and the news broke that several researchers had listed the chatbot (including its earlier version) as co-authors of their academic papers. In response, Nature and Science expressed their position that this chatbot cannot be listed as an author in the papers they publish. Since an AI chatbot is not a human being, in the current legal system, the text automatically generated by an AI chatbot cannot be a copyrighted work; thus, an AI chatbot cannot be an author of a copyrighted work. Current AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are much more advanced than search engines in that they produce original text, but they still remain at the level of a search engine in that they cannot take responsibility for their writing. For this reason, they also cannot be authors from the perspective of research ethics.","[{""name"": ""Ju Yoen Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/d41586-023-00107-z"", ""10.1038/s42256-023-00613-9"", ""10.1038/d41586-023-00191-1"", ""10.1126/science.adg7879"", ""10.1007/s40319-021-01115-0"", ""10.1007/s40319-020-00944-9""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Educational Escape Room in Nursing Education,"Abstract Escape rooms, a form of collaborative live-action gaming requiring participants to solve clues to escape a locked room, have grown in popularity across the nation. Games bring together problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork. This game method has not yet appeared in nursing education literature. The authors describe two versions of the innovative escape room pedagogical method used in undergraduate nursing education. Theoretical bases, learning activities, and types of game clues that could be used are detailed. Future research will address the ability of students to reach learning objectives before and after the game.","[{""name"": ""Briyana L. M. Morrell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Heather M.

None (0%; 95% CI 0% to 5.75%) of the trials reported blinding of all possible key persons. 37 (58.7%; 95% CI 46.42% to 70.04%) trials reported blinding of outcome assessors. Two (3.2%; 95% CI 0.87% to 10.86%) trials reported blinding of participants. Two (3.2%; 95% CI 0.87% to 10.86%) trials reported blinding of data managers. Three (4.8%; 95% CI 1.63% to 13.09%) trials reported blinding of statisticians. None of the trials reported blinding of treatment providers, the data safety and monitoring committee, and conclusion makers. 45 (71.4%; 95% CI 59.30% to 81.10%) trials rejected the null hypothesis on the primary outcome(s). 13 (20.7%; 95% CI 12.48% to 32.17%) trials discussed the potential bias risk from lack of blinding in the published trial report.ConclusionsBlinding of key persons involved in randomised clinical trials of psychological interventions is rarely sufficiently documented. The possible interpretative limitations are only rarely considered. There is a need of randomised clinical trials of psychological interventions with documented blinding attempts of all possible key persons.","[{""name"": ""Sophie Juul"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Gluud"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Simonsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frederik Weischer Frandsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Irving Kirsch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Janus Christian Jakobsen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/clpt.2011.207"", ""10.1093/aje/kwj069"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-135-11-200112040-00010"", ""10.1136/bmj.323.7303.42"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(98)01085-X"", ""10.1001/jama.1995.03520290060030"", ""10.1093/ije/dyu115"", ""10.1503/cmaj.120744"", ""10.1136/bmj.e1119"", ""10.1093/aje/kwx344"", ""10.1001/jama.287.22.2973"", ""10.1136/bmj.39465.451748.AD"", ""10.1136/bmj.l6802"", ""10.1136/bmj.m229"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-152-11-201006010-00232"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07816-9"", ""10.1002/9781119536604"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-136-3-200202050-00022"", ""10.1016/S0895-4356(02)00446-8"", ""10.2307/2276774"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.2729"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.3249"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.3880"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0429"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.1001"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.2164"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.2150"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3047"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3379"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.4249"", ""10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1109"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.116.182865"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.116.192435"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.116.184366"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.116.184234"", ""10.1192/bjp.bp.117.198630"", ""10.1192/bjp.2017.18"", ""10.1192/bjp.2017.22"", ""10.1192/bjp.2018.2"", ""10.1192/bjp.2018.130"", ""10.1192/bjp.2018.70"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30100-7"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30058-0"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30427-3"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30149-9"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30001-4"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30476-5"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30328-0"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(16)30378-9"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30426-1"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30129-3"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30053-1"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30291-2"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30096-8"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30223-2"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30162-7"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30226-8"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30184-6"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30384-5"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30129-9"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30006-3"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17060611"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.16020189"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17090978"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.16080894"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18030321"", ""10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17010089"", ""10.1002/wps.20456"", ""10.1159/000472260"", ""10.1159/000488715"", ""10.1159/000470846"", ""10.1159/000493897"", ""10.1159/000490742"", ""10.1159/000478267"", ""10.1159/000487893"", ""10.1159/000462977"", ""10.1159/000488990"", ""10.1159/000486099"", ""10.1159/000470847"", ""10.1159/000481515"", ""10.1159/000449025"", ""10.1159/000481177"", ""10.1159/000486807"", ""10.1177/1740774506069153"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.03.017"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2012.10.005"", ""10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.00327.x"", ""10.1136/bmj.37952.631667.EE"", ""10.1136/bmj.328.7448.1136-a"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2005.04.006"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.0040061"", ""10.1007/s00423-019-01761-6"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000003516"", ""10.1001/jama.2018.22039"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa1204242"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60413-8"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0528.2009.00494.x"", ""10.1093/ije/dym088"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1189"", ""10.1016/S0962-1849(05)80012-5"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.0030425"", ""10.1016/0165-1781(86)90094-6"", ""10.1037/0022-006X.59.1.184"", ""10.1136/bmjebm-2019-111174"", ""10.1016/0197-2456(95)00263-4"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.11.011""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In education, there has been intensive growth in systems that make formal and informal learning an anytime, anywhere activity for billions of people through online open educational resources and massive online open courses. Moreover, new developments in Artificial Intelligence‐related educational assessment are attracting increasing interest as means of improving assessment efficacy and validity, with much attention focusing on the analysis of the large volumes of process data being captured from digital assessment contexts. In evaluating the state of play of Artificial Intelligence in formative and summative educational assessment, this paper offers a critical perspective on the two core applications: automated essay scoring systems and computerized adaptive tests, along with the Big Data analysis approaches to machine learning that underpin them.","[{""name"": ""John Gardner"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Social Sciences University of Stirling Stirling UK""]}, {""name"": ""Michael O'Leary"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Assessment Research, Policy and Practice in Education (CARPE), Institute of Education Dublin City University Dublin Ireland""]}, {""name"": ""Li Yuan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Education for the Future Beijing Normal University Zhuhai Guangdong China""]}]","[""10.21890/ijres.327907"", ""10.3115/v1/W15-1402"", ""10.3115/v1/P14-2041"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170381"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2012.11.001"", ""10.1177/2332858416641907"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2018.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2012.10.002"", ""10.3115/v1/W15-0608"", ""10.1111/jcal.12316"", ""10.3758/BF03195564"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2012.171"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0169121"", ""10.3115/v1/P14-2029"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103771"", ""10.1111/bjet.12917"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2005.274"", ""10.3758/s13428-017-0924-4"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.015"", ""10.53761/1.13.3.7"", ""10.1038/nj7504-303a"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.05.003"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0166742"", ""10.37514/PER-B.2012.0452.2.07"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2014.05.001"", ""10.7333/1902-0701001"", ""10.3115/v1/W15-0605"", ""10.1145/2460296.2460337"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61425-0_68""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Specifically, an exploratory study was conducted on the dataset collected in three consecutive offerings of an undergraduate computer engineering course (N= 1,134). Trace data about activities were initially coded for the timeliness of activity completion. Such data were then analysed using agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on Ward's algorithm, first order Markov chains, and inferential statistics to (a) detect time management tactics and strategies from students' learning activities and (b) analyse the effects of personalized analytics‐based feedback on time management. The results indicate that meaningful and theoretically relevant time management patterns can be detected from trace data as manifestations of students' tactics and strategies. The study also showed that time management tactics had significant associations with academic performance and were associated with different interventions in personalized analytics‐based feedback.","[{""name"": ""Nora'ayu Ahmad Uzir"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Informatics The University of Edinburgh Edinburgh UK"", ""Faculty of Information Management Universiti Teknologi MARA Shah Alam Malaysia""]}, {""name"": ""Dragan Gašević"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Information Technology Monash University Clayton Victoria Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Wannisa Matcha"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Informatics The University of Edinburgh Edinburgh UK""]}, {""name"": ""Jelena Jovanović"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Business Administration University of Belgrade Belgrade Serbia""]}, {""name"": ""Abelardo Pardo"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Information Technology, Engineering and the Environment University of South Australia Adelaide South Australia Australia""]}]","[""10.5296/ije.v2i1.357"", ""10.1023/A:1022185502996"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.03.012"", ""10.1080/00461520.2015.1004069"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-5546-3_28"", ""10.1007/s11409-013-9107-6"", ""10.1177/016146811011200908"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.01.004"", ""10.3102/00346543065003245"", ""10.2190/EC.45.4.b"", ""10.3200/SOCP.149.2.195-212"", ""10.3200/SOCP.145.3.245-264"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170381"", ""10.1108/00483480710726136"", ""10.1108/00483480710726136"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027405"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027405"", ""10.1177/1529100612453266"", ""10.1016/S0361-476X(02)00042-5"", ""10.1007/BF00132287"", ""10.3102/0034654312474350"", ""10.1109/CISTI.2014.6877095"", ""10.1109/TLT.2018.2823317"", ""10.18637/jss.v040.i04"", ""10.18608/jla.2017.42.10"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59758-4_42"", ""10.1007/s11409-007-9016-7"", ""10.1080/01443410.2013.785065"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.07.001"", ""10.4085/110154"", ""10.1080/10790195.2017.1411214"", ""10.1177/2332858418809346"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.02.001"", ""10.1145/3303772.3303782"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.02.011"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883911"", ""10.4219/jaa-2008-867"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.05.006"", ""10.14742/apubs.2016.850"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2013.03.014"", ""10.1007/s10763-010-9264-x"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.1976.tb02980.x"", ""10.1145/3303772.3303787"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.50.9.741"", ""10.2505/4/jcst15_044_03_11"", ""10.1111/bjet.12590"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.06.523"", ""10.1145/2567948.2580054"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170398"", ""10.1111/bjet.12592"", ""10.1111/bjet.12592"", ""10.18608/hla17.014"", ""10.1145/2999541.2999552"", ""10.1037/t09161-000"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50043-3"", ""10.1177/0013164493053003024"", ""10.1080/08923640802039024"", ""10.1002/bs.3830280103"", ""10.1037/a0026838"", ""10.1080/00224545.1995.9712234"", ""10.3102/0034654307313795"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.4.760"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.05.016"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.01.003"", ""10.1177/1932202X16676860"", ""10.1016/j.aos.2016.09.002"", ""10.1177/1469787406064752"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.07.020"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep3004_2"", ""10.1080/00461520.2010.517150"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-5836-0_8"", ""10.1007/s11409-014-9113-3"", ""10.1177/016146811711900305"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-5546-3_20"", ""10.1016/S0361-476X(02)00006-1"", ""10.1016/S0361-476X(02)00041-3"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50045-7"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2012.03.004"", ""10.1080/02602938.2016.1174187"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep3302&3_3"", ""10.3102/0002831207312909""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.12902,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,AR videos as scaffolding to foster students' learning achievements and motivation in EFL learning,"AbstractAugmented reality (AR) is capable of providing students with proper situated scaffolding via overlaying rich media objects on the real‐world learning context. This paper examines the potential of AR to address existing problems with insufficient scaffolding in video learning materials for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. Thus, an AR video‐enhanced learning (ARVEL) method was designed to assist students’ EFL learning. Furthermore, an experiment was carried out to investigate the influences of the implemented method on students' EFL learning outcomes. The experimental results displayed that the ARVEL method significantly improved the students' learning achievements and intrinsic motivation, and enhanced their satisfaction with EFL learning, compared to the students learning EFL with conventional video‐based learning. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Learning experience of English as a foreign language (EFL) is highly related to the experience in actual learning contexts. The significance of providing students with proper assistance in a situated learning environment has been emphasized. Just observing videos might be inadequate for advancing students' reflection on learning tasks in video‐based learning. What this paper adds An augmented reality (AR) video‐enhanced learning method was proposed to assist students' EFL learning. An AR video‐enhanced learning (ARVEL) system was designed based on the implemented method. It was evidenced that the implemented method effectively improved students' learning achievements and motivation. The students display a higher degree of satisfaction with EFL learning than with the video‐enhanced learning method. Implications for practice and/or policy The ARVEL method could be a good reference for implementing an EFL learning environment. More kinds of assistance could be designed as scaffolding for assisting students' EFL learning. It is worth probing the influences of the ARVEL on students' learning of more abstract vocabulary and concepts.","[{""name"": ""Chih‐Hung Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/jcal.12222"", ""10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1483950"", ""10.1007/s10956-011-9345-9"", ""10.1080/09523987.2014.889400"", ""10.1023/B:TRUC.0000021812.96911.c5"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.11.005"", ""10.1080/09588221.2010.526947"", ""10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1610448"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1504308"", ""10.1207/s15389286ajde1904_3"", ""10.1007/s10209-017-0588-y"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139547369.009"", ""10.1080/095006900412293"", ""10.1111/0026-7902.00052"", ""10.1111/bjet.12203"", ""10.1080/10494820.2016.1276076"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.04.005"", ""10.1080/09588221.2016.1176047"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.04.001"", ""10.1111/bjet.12070"", ""10.1007/s10956-018-9734-4"", ""10.1007/s40692-017-0084-7"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.009"", ""10.1111/jcal.12173"", ""10.1111/bjet.12464"", ""10.1007/s11145-018-9903-0"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.011"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139547369.023"", ""10.1111/bjet.12092"", ""10.1111/jcal.12158"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2013.11.003"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1552974"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1458039"", ""10.1111/bjet.12716"", ""10.1111/bjet.12652"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2008.00687.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139547369.002"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139547369.015"", ""10.1016/S0959-4752(01)00018-4"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.11.004"", ""10.1080/10494820.2012.680967"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.03.004"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1303_2"", ""10.1504/IJMLO.2019.098179"", ""10.1080/09588221.2012.692384"", ""10.1007/s10956-014-9494-8"", ""10.1080/10494820.2017.1294608"", ""10.1080/02607476.2018.1450937"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.09.014"", ""10.1080/09588221.2018.1517093"", ""10.1504/IJMLO.2018.089238""]",['Computer Science'],"['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Information Systems', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.","[{""name"": ""Victor R.

Many reforms since 2010 have addressed the LGBTQ-related education of future health care professionals at the undergraduate medical education (UME) level; however, reforms at the graduate medical education (GME) level are lagging, and new literature suggests that didactic education at the UME level is not enough to prepare future physicians to properly and compassionately care for LGBTQ patients. Recently, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) implemented a major revision of its Common Program Requirements that requires residents to demonstrate, as a competence, respect and responsiveness to diverse populations. Given these revisions and the ongoing failure of many GME training programs to adequately prepare future physicians to care for LGBTQ patients, the authors argue that now is the time for the ACGME to develop and implement LGBTQ health–related residency requirements. In addition, the authors outline a path by which the academic medical community may develop and implement these requirements.","[{""name"": ""Andrew M. Pregnall"", ""affiliation"": [""A.M.

10.1007/s10734-021-00712-9,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,'All things are in flux': China in global science,"AbstractSince 1990, a large and dynamic global science system has evolved, based on grass roots collaboration, and resting on the resources, infrastructure and personnel housed by national science systems. Euro-American science systems have become intensively networked in a global duopoly; and many other countries have built national science systems, including a group of large- and middle-sized countries that follow semi-autonomous trajectories based on state investment, intensive national network building, and international engagement, without integrating tightly into the global duopoly. The dual global/national approach pursued by these systems, including China, South Korea, Iran and India, is not always fully understood in papers on science. Nevertheless, China is now the number two science country in the world, the largest producer of papers and number one in parts of STEM physical sciences. The paper investigates the remarkable evolution of China’s science funding, output, discipline balance, internationalisation strategy and national and global networking.

10.1007/s11024-021-09453-6,MINERVA,0712 History of Science and Technology; 0303 Sociology; 0401 Education,Triple Helix or Quadruple Helix: Which Model of Innovation to Choose for Empirical Studies?,"AbstractWhile the Triple Helix and Quadruple Helix models are popular in innovation studies, the relations between them have not been addressed extensively in the literature. There are diverse interpretations of helix models in empirical studies that apply them, but these sometimes deviate from the original theses of the models. Such a situation can confuse newcomers to the field in terms of which helix model to apply in their empirical research. We discern that the cause of this research challenge is a lack of systematic comparison of the two models. To bridge the research gap, this paper compares the models from the perspectives of how they were introduced and discussed in the literature and improved and how useful they are in addressing the innovation processes in contemporary society. Our major findings are as follows: First, reviewing the extant literature applying the two helix models for identifying research gaps, we discover that these studies were influenced by three views on the relations between the two models that were located on a continuum between two extreme ends—namely, isolation versus integration of the two models. Second, we provide a systematic comparison of both the advantages and weaknesses of the two models, and this may help researchers choose suitable helix models as conceptual/analytical tools in their empirical innovation studies. Third, our comparison of the two models shows that they are largely supplementary to each other when analysing innovation processes in contemporary society, providing a ground for potential synergy building between the two helix models.","[{""name"": ""Yuzhuo Cai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Annina Lattu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120183"", ""10.1007/s00191-004-0187-y"", ""10.1504/IJTLID.2017.10008256"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.08.013"", ""10.1142/S1084946708000867"", ""10.1007/s11948-016-9782-1"", ""10.1186/s40604-014-0001-2"", ""10.1177/0539018415583527"", ""10.1007/s11024-020-09418-1"", ""10.1057/s41307-021-00243-z"", ""10.1163/21971927-bja10003"", ""10.3390/su11174633"", ""10.1093/scipol/scu018"", ""10.3390/su12114376"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-72529-1"", ""10.1504/IJTM.2009.023374"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2062-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06091-0_56-1"", ""10.1007/s13132-021-00778-x"", ""10.4018/jsesd.2010010105"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2062-0"", ""10.1111/radm.12300"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.06.017"", ""10.1109/tem.2019.2914408"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.02.014"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2004.12.005"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-55577-9"", ""10.1002/tqem.3310080106"", ""10.4324/9780203929605"", ""10.1186/s40604-014-0012-z"", ""10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00055-4"", ""10.3152/147154306781779154"", ""10.4324/9781315620183"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199686346.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s13132-014-0218-3"", ""10.1057/ejdr.2013.7"", ""10.1016/0016-3287(93)90022-L"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2047-5"", ""10.1007/s11024-018-9355-3"", ""10.1007/s13132-014-0201-z"", ""10.1007/s13132-011-0049-4"", ""10.3390/joitmc4020016"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59951-5"", ""10.3152/147154303781780678"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2006.09.016"", ""10.1007/s11192-013-1079-4"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3817410"", ""10.1007/s13132-012-0098-3"", ""10.1093/scipol/scx059"", ""10.1007/s11024-011-9169-z"", ""10.1080/14778238.2020.1777909"", ""10.1111/radm.12309"", ""10.1111/radm.12228"", ""10.2478/picbe-2018-0055"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1823647"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2016.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119721"", ""10.1007/s11024-012-9194-6"", ""10.1186/s40604-016-0041-x"", ""10.1080/00343404.2012.712679"", ""10.1007/s11625-019-00668-x"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2017.636"", ""10.1177/0896920510365923"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.04.011"", ""10.47678/cjhe.v40i2.1917"", ""10.1186/s40604-014-0011-0""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"
10.1111/jcal.12533,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,The impact of risk and protective factors on online teaching experience in high school Italian teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"AbstractThe lockdown due to COVID‐19 in Italy resulted in the sudden closure of schools, with a shift from traditional teaching to the online one. Through an online questionnaire, this survey explores teachers' experience of online teaching, the level of risk factors (e.g., stress) and protective factors (e.g., locus of control) and their impact on satisfaction levels during the social distancing. One hundred seven high school teachers from Lombardy, an Italian region very affected by the COVID‐19 outbreak, participated. Results show that depression and stress are the main predictors of satisfaction levels for online teaching. In addition, coping, locus of control and self‐efficacy emerge as important protective factors. Finally, although there is great satisfaction with the online teaching experience, critical elements emerged. This study is relevant because it describes the critical elements of the online teaching experience, and identifies some protective factors and the main risk factors in teachers operating in an area strongly marked by social restrictions imposed by the pandemic. High school teachers emerge as a sub‐group of the general population with specific psychological reactions. Considering the results, it is possible to suggest providing high‐quality educational support and crisis‐psychological oriented services to teachers, and help to maintain the psychological well‐being.","[{""name"": ""Roberto Truzoli"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences “L.

10.1007/s10639-020-10119-1,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,The challenges of using head mounted virtual reality in K-12 schools from a teacher perspective,"AbstractThe use of head mounted displays (HMDs) to experience virtual realities (VR) has become increasingly common. As this technology becomes more affordable, immersive and easier to use, it also becomes more serviceable in educational and training contexts. Even though the technology, content and feasibility for K-12 school purposes are still being developed, it is reasonable to expect that the call or ‘push’ to use HMD VR in K-12 schools will increase, especially as there is now a greater economic interest in the use of digital technologies in educational contexts. This article aims to inform the process of implementing HMD VR in K-12 contexts by researching the preconditions and challenges of use from a teacher perspective. It does this by analysing the organisational, institutional, contextual and practical challenges and opportunities in the implementation of HMD VR in K-12 school contexts. The data draws on (a) interviews, informal conversations and observations of teachers testing HMD VR and different VR applications in a Digital Learning Lab (DLL) and (b) data from a project involving upper secondary school history teachers discussing the planned implementation of HMD VR in their teaching and being in the DLL. The main findings are related to: (a) economy and technology, (b) initial learning barriers, (c) organisation and practical enactment for teaching and learning, (d) curricula, syllabuses and expected learning outcomes and (e) teachers’ competences, professional development and trust. The consequences for educational contexts and possible ways forward are also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Göran Fransson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jörgen Holmberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claes Westelius"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10639-018-9734-2"", ""10.1007/BF00138871"", ""10.1111/flan.12327"", ""10.1016/j.jvcir.2018.11.039"", ""10.4018/978-1-60566-940-3"", ""10.4018/IJMBL.2016100104"", ""10.1080/13540600802661303"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip3903_2"", ""10.1080/13540602.2013.744195"", ""10.1023/A:1011508128957"", ""10.1007/s10639-017-9676-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96059-3_47"", ""10.1007/s10055-018-0364-1"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9766-7"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2017.12.007"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1523363"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.17950/ijer/v4s11/1104"", ""10.14236/ewic/HCI2017.44"", ""10.14742/ajet.3840"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-6144-8_6"", ""10.1007/s10055-018-0363-2"", ""10.20870/IJVR.2001.5.1.2675"", ""10.1007/s10639-013-9294-4"", ""10.1080/02680939.2017.1380232"", ""10.1007/s10055-016-0285-9"", ""10.1007/s10055-018-0376-x"", ""10.1080/13540602.2011.539802"", ""10.1109/KELVAR.2017.7961564"", ""10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427579"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01551-0_18"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2012.12.004"", ""10.1145/3064663.3064696"", ""10.1007/s10055-018-0373-0"", ""10.20448/journal.522.2018.42.62.69"", ""10.1007/s10055-018-0350-7""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Information Systems', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

While science education reforms around the world have shed light on various epistemic and social underpinnings of science, how science curriculum documents portray the nature of other related disciplines such as mathematics and engineering has drawn little attention. Such lack of attention is surprising, given the growing interest among educators in the integrated approach to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and the frequent emphasis on STEM in recent curriculum policy. The study reported in this paper aimed to understand how recent science education reform documents from the USA, Korea and Taiwan compare with regard to their representation of the nature of STEM disciplines. Using the framework of the family resemblance approach (FRA), we present a comparative analysis of three recent science education standards documents to examine their coverage of the epistemic underpinnings of STEM disciplines, particularly with regard to the disciplinary aims, values and practices. The results indicate that the features specific to science and shared by science and engineering were most frequently addressed in the standards documents, whereas mathematics-related features were rarely mentioned. Furthermore, there was variation in the coverage in terms of the nature of STEM disciplines. Based on the findings, we discuss the contributions of the FRA framework in analysing STEM curricula in an interdisciplinary manner and make suggestions for integrating the nature of STEM disciplines in science curriculum documents.","[{""name"": ""Wonyong Park"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jen-Yi Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sibel Erduran"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09500690050044044"", ""10.1002/tea.20226"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(200004)37:4<295::AID-TEA2>3.0.CO;2-2"", ""10.1023/A:1008600230536"", ""10.1080/14926156.2016.1271921"", ""10.1007/s11191-019-00038-0"", ""10.1057/9781137535467"", ""10.1080/14926156.2016.1271923"", ""10.5840/techne20036318"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-44687-5"", ""10.4324/9781315700328"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9057-4"", ""10.1080/03323315.2014.984386"", ""10.1007/s11191-019-00052-2"", ""10.1007/s11191-012-9519-8"", ""10.1023/A:1008604909404"", ""10.1111/ssm.12145"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-7654-8_28"", ""10.1080/14926156.2016.1271919"", ""10.1057/9780230607187_8"", ""10.1007/s11191-010-9293-4"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-7654-8_30"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-9828-5_1"", ""10.1007/s11191-016-9861-3"", ""10.1007/s11191-018-9990-y"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-3940-6"", ""10.1007/s10972-014-9382-3"", ""10.1002/tea.10034"", ""10.1080/09500690802314876"", ""10.1080/09500693.2013.864428"", ""10.1080/09500693.2013.864428"", ""10.1002/sce.21522"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-2457-0_1"", ""10.1007/0-306-47215-5_2"", ""10.4324/9781315650524-5"", ""10.1787/9789264267510-en"", ""10.1007/s11191-018-9993-8"", ""10.4324/9781351214827-14"", ""10.1007/s11191-019-00075-9"", ""10.1080/09500693.2020.1714094"", ""10.1002/sce.21483"", ""10.1002/sce.21483"", ""10.1016/0048-7333(84)90003-9"", ""10.1002/tea.21508"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6668-6_15"", ""10.1002/tea.21551"", ""10.1080/09500693.2016.1242818"", ""10.1007/s11191-019-00053-1"", ""10.1007/s11422-014-9578-z""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003058,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,The Effectiveness of Teaching Clinical Empathy to Medical Students: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Purpose Clinical empathy is a necessary trait to provide effective patient care, despite differences in how it is defined and constructed. The aim of this study was to examine whether empathy interventions in medical students are effective and how confounding factors potentially moderate this effect. Method The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. They searched the literature published between 1948 and 2018 for randomized controlled trials that examined empathy interventions in medical students. The search (database searching, citation tracking, hand-searching relevant journals) yielded 380 studies, which they culled to 16 that met the inclusion criteria. For the meta-analysis, they used a random effects model to produce a pooled estimate of the standardized mean difference (SMD), then completed subgroup analyses. Results The authors found evidence of the possibility of response and reporting bias. The pooled SMD was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.43, 0.93), indicating a moderately positive effect of students developing empathy after an intervention compared with those in the control groups. There was no evidence of publication bias, but heterogeneity was significantly high (I 2 = 88.5%, P &lt; .01). Subgroup analyses indicated that significant moderating factors for developing empathy were age, country, scope of empathy measurement, type of empathy intervention, and presence of rehearsal. Moderating factors with limited evidence were sex, study quality, journal impact factor, and intervention characteristics. Conclusions Despite heterogeneity and biases, empathy interventions in medical students are effective. These findings reinforce arguments in the literature and add considerable rigor from the meta-analysis. The authors propose a conceptual model for educators to follow when designing empathy interventions in medical students.","[{""name"": ""Konstantinos C.

However, residents’ experiences with competency-based medical education (CBME), and specifically with entrustable professional activity (EPA)-based assessments, have not been well studied. The authors explored junior residents’ perceptions regarding the implementation of EPA assessment and feedback initiatives in an internal medicine program. Method From May to November 2018, 5 focus groups were conducted with 28 first-year internal medicine residents from the University of Toronto, exploring their experiences with facilitators and barriers to EPA-based assessments in the first years of the CBME initiative. Residents were exposed to EPA-based feedback tools from early in residency. Themes were identified using constructivist grounded theory to develop a framework to understand the resident perception of EPA assessment and feedback initiatives. Results Residents’ discussions reflected a growth mindset orientation, as they valued the idea of meaningful feedback through multiple low-stakes assessments. However, in practice, feedback seeking was onerous. While the quantity of feedback had increased, the quality had not; some residents felt it had worsened, by reducing it to a form-filling exercise. The assessments were felt to have increased daily workload with consequent disrupted workflow and to have blurred the lines between formative and summative assessment. Conclusions Residents embraced the driving principles behind CBME, but their experience suggested that changes are needed for CBME in the study site program to meet its goals. Efforts may be needed to reconcile the tension between assessment and feedback and to effectively embed meaningful feedback into CBME learning environments.","[{""name"": ""Leora Branfield Day"", ""affiliation"": [""L.

However, precise cluster control, targeted drug delivery in vivo, and cellular micro–nano operation remain challenges. Herein, the scientific research results produced in recent years to meet these challenges are studied. Considering the current research enthusiasm and application challenges, the micro–nano manipulations and micro–nano robots driven by physical fields (magnetic field, sound field, and light field) are mainly discussed. This review includes detailed analysis of control mechanism, control objectives, and supporting technologies; analysis of recent research results, and advantages and future development trends driven by physic fields, etc. This review involves the crossover and integration of multiple disciplines (including microelectronic technology, micro–nano processing technology, biology, physics, chemistry, machinery, and automation, etc.), hoping to inspire relevant practitioners to create new research perspectives, and promote the development of micro–nano robotics.","[{""name"": ""Yuanyuan Chen"",

While a clause expresses that at least one literal must be true, a cardinality constraint expresses that at least n literals must be true and a pseudo-Boolean constraint states that a weighted sum of literals must be greater than a constant. These contraints have a high expressive power, have been intensively studied in 0/1 programming and are close enough to the satisfiability problem to benefit from the recents advances in this field. Besides, optimization problems are naturally expressed in the pseudo-Boolean context. This chapter presents the inference rules on pseudo-Boolean constraints and demonstrates their increased inference power in comparison with resolution. It also shows how the modern satisfiability algorithms can be extended to deal with pseudo-Boolean constraints.","[{""name"": ""Olivier Roussel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vasco Manquinho"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/jcal.12567,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,Platform is not destiny: Embodied learning effects comparing 2D desktop to 3D virtual reality STEM experiences,"AbstractExperiences in immersive 3D virtual reality (VR) are more presence‐inducing, and so it may be tempting to claim that content will be learned better in VR. This randomized control trial study on natural selection challenges that assumption. This study answers the question of whether learning STEM in an immersive 3D VR environment is always superior to learning via a 2D monitor (PC). This is a 2 × 2 × 3 design. The first factor is platform immersivity (low = 2D PC, or high = 3D VR), the second factor is level of embodiment (lower = watching playback video, or higher = using mouse/controller to agentically manipulate content), and the third factor is test time (pretest, posttest, and follow‐up). There was a significant main effect for embodiment, the high embodied and agentic groups learned the most. There was not a main effect for platform, because the participants in the low embodied VR group performed significantly worse than the three other groups. Although, the one high embodied, VR group learned and retained the most knowledge. A path‐analysis revealed that the effect of platform was significantly mediated by presence, agency, and engagement. The smaller learning gain in the low embodied VR condition suggests that participants come to the immersive VR experience with expectations about agency and control of the virtual content, and when those expectations were not met, the disconnect was deleterious for learning. More agentic and interactive control of manipulable virtual content is encouraged. Design is critical, and platform is not destiny.","[{""name"": ""Mina C.

10.3390/educsci11060302,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Parental Involvement during Pandemic Times: Challenges and Opportunities,"Due to COVID-19, many countries implemented emergency plans, such as lockdown and school closures. This new situation has significantly affected families, namely, the involvement required to support children’s learning at home. The current study aimed to analyze Portuguese parents’ perceptions of their home-based parental involvement in their children’s learning during the lockdown and school closures in 2020 due to COVID-19. An online survey, using a closed-ended questionnaire, was employed. Variables included parents’ sociodemographic and COVID-19 related characteristics; students’ sociodemographic characteristics; distance learning context; parental involvement; and students’ autonomy. Data were collected from a sample of 21,333 parents with children from elementary school to secondary education, and statistical data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26. Findings revealed that Portuguese parents supported their children during the pandemic mainly through the monitoring of attention in classes and task realization. However, several variables appear to significantly determine parental involvement time, which is higher when students attend public schools, when they are less autonomous and younger, when parents’ level of education is lower, when the child is a boy (except in secondary education where gender is not relevant), and when the online school time is higher. Findings highlight the need for a significant investment of time from parents, particularly of primary school children, making it difficult to cohere work or telework with school activities. Implications for policies, schools, families are discussed in order to promote children’s learning and success.","[{""name"": ""Luísa Mota Ribeiro"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Centre for Human Development, Faculty of Education and Psychology, Universidade Católica Portuguesa, 4169-005 Porto, Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Rosário Serrão Cunha"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Centre for Human Development, Faculty of Education and Psychology, Universidade Católica Portuguesa, 4169-005 Porto, Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Maria Conceição Andrade e Silva"", ""affiliation"": [""CEGE—Católica Porto Business School, Universidade Católica Portuguesa, 4169-005 Porto, Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Marisa Carvalho"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Centre for Human Development, Faculty of Education and Psychology, Universidade Católica Portuguesa, 4169-005 Porto, Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Maria Luísa Vital"", ""affiliation"": [""LeYa Educação, 4410-083 Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal""]}]","[""10.29062/edu.v3i2.42"", ""10.21125/iceri.2020.1316"", ""10.14746/sr.2020.4.3.05"", ""10.3991/ijet.v15i18.16439"", ""10.1007/s10826-018-1294-y"", ""10.1177/0734282920903164"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-28064-6"", ""10.1086/499194"", ""10.3102/00346543067001003"", ""10.1080/00131911.2013.780009"", ""10.1080/03055690601068345"", ""10.1080/01411920500148713"", ""10.1037/edu0000023"", ""10.1080/00220671.2014.994196"", ""10.1002/pits.22039"", ""10.15354/sief.20.rp026"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05482"", ""10.22555/joeed.v7i1.3260"", ""10.1111/famp.12601"", ""10.1177/1365480220958797""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Drawing on sociocultural and organizational learning theories, we argue that learning can happen for the organizations engaged in RPPs at the boundaries of research and practice. Such learning is evident when there are changes in collective knowledge, policies, and routines of participating organizations, with implications for longer-term outcomes of educational improvement and transformation locally and more broadly. The degree to which organizations can make use of the ideas from the RPP is dependent, in part, on the presence and design of boundary infrastructure and the preexisting organizational capacities and conditions. We conclude with implications for those engaging in RPPs and future research.","[{""name"": ""Caitlin C.

However, a lack of teaching materials and human resources presents a major challenge to meeting this demand. One way to compensate for a shortage of trained teachers is to use machine learning techniques to assist learners. This article proposes a learning path recommendation system that applies a recurrent neural network to a learner's ability chart, which displays the learner's scores. In brief, a learning path is constructed from a learner's submission history using a trial-and-error process, and the learner's ability chart is used as an indicator of their current knowledge. An approach for constructing a learning path recommendation system using ability charts and its implementation based on a sequential prediction model and a recurrent neural network, are presented. Experimental evaluation is conducted with data from an e-learning system.","[{""name"": ""Tomohiro Saito"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Aizu, Aizuwakamatsu, Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Yutaka Watanobe"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Aizu, Aizuwakamatsu, Japan""]}]","[""10.1145/312129.312230"", ""10.28945/247"", ""10.20448/journal.509.2017.41.15.21"", ""10.3115/v1/D14-1179"", ""10.3991/ijet.v9i2.3211"", ""10.1109/TLA.2016.7555265"", ""10.1145/1151588.1151600"", ""10.1109/CSCWD.2006.253206"", ""10.1109/SCM.2016.7519762"", ""10.1109/MIC.2003.1167344"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2015.03.008"", ""10.1109/WISM.2010.138"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.11.001"", ""10.1109/ICALT.2005.164"", ""10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360671"", ""10.1109/SICE.2002.1195415"", ""10.1109/ICABCD.2018.8465478"", ""10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7"", ""10.1145/352871.352887"", ""10.21236/ADA439541"", ""10.1023/A:1009804230409"", ""10.1145/1454008.1454048"", ""10.1109/CSSE.2008.305"", ""10.1111/1467-9868.00293"", ""10.3390/informatics5020017"", ""10.1109/SMC.2017.8122647"", ""10.1109/ICDSBA.2018.00053"", ""10.1145/986213.986216"", ""10.1109/CSCWD.2007.4281577"", ""10.1109/CSCWD.2007.4281571""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1017/jie.2018.25,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,0401 Education,Extending the yarning yarn: Collaborative Yarning Methodology for ethical Indigenist education research,"Abstract Yarning scholarship is emerging in the Australian context. There are a growing number of Indigenous scholars who advocate for using yarning in research and this paper aims to contribute to this methodological discussion. In this paper, I outline the development of a methodology, which I have named Collaborative Yarning Methodology (CYM). CYM extends on the current yarning scholarship available to researchers through critically addressing the issue of data collection and analysis. The methodology was developed in undertaking my doctoral study in alternative school settings. In developing CYM, I discuss and analyse the implications of using Indigenous methodologies in institutionalised education settings and some of issues that may arise, and some explicitly for Indigenous researchers. Through analysing the current discourses that exists when undertaking Indigenous-focused research in education institutions, there are clearly connections in how Indigenous people are positioned politically, racially and socially when assuming the role of a researcher. I propose that in Indigenous education focused research, there continues to be an over-reliance of positivist ways of collecting yarning data, such as audio recording. I offer an alternative to audio recording, which incorporates collaborative approaches to data collection with participants underpinned by the principle of self-determination.","[{""name"": ""Marnee Shay"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7748/nr2012.07.19.4.31.c9222"", ""10.59962/9780774855440"", ""10.5204/ijcis.v3i1.57"", ""10.4324/9780203802755"", ""10.1525/jer.2010.5.4.13"", ""10.1108/08198691201000005"", ""10.1080/09588221.2016.1166137"", ""10.5172/conu.2013.46.1.13"", ""10.1177/117718011100700101"", ""10.1186/s12939-016-0366-0"", ""10.4324/9781315252414-3"", ""10.17583/hse.2016.2299"", ""10.18778/1733-8077.09.2.05"", ""10.1177/0038038503037002006"", ""10.1080/09650792.2012.697663"", ""10.1525/aeq.2005.36.1.093"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0677-2""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13057,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,"Exploring the effects of gamification pedagogy on children's reading: A mixed-method study on academic performance, reading-related mentality and behaviors, and sustainability","AbstractGamification is becoming increasingly popular in primary education due to the widespread use of digital technology. However, gamified reading is new, and there is little empirical evidence regarding its effectiveness. The sustainability of the effects of gamification pedagogy is also in doubt as some scholars think that such effects are short‐term and not sustainable. This paper presents the results of three sub‐studies of examining the effects of an online gamified reading platform and the sustainability of these effects. Study 1 examined the change in students’ academic performance between two groups divided based on their different participation levels. Study 2 addressed the question of how students/parents/teachers perceive students’ motivation and gaining in the use of the gamified platform. Study 3 explored the sustainability of the effects of the gamified platform from a longitudinal perspective. Findings suggest that students’ deep engagement in the gamified e‐learning platform can help increase their reading motivation and improve their reading abilities. Such effects can be sustained for several semesters. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Reading is very important for children’s development. However, the ubiquity of digital entertainment (eg, digital games &amp; online videos) occupies children’s attention and energy, resulting in a decline in children’s reading motivation. At present, gamification has been widely used in e‐learning to increase learners’ learning motivation and engagement. Few studies have focused on children’s gamified reading supported by sufficient empirical evidence. What this paper adds This study proposes a gamification pedagogy with a gamified reading platform to facilitate primary students’ reading motivation and competence. This study uses a mixed‐method approach to examine the effects of the proposed gamification pedagogy on students’ reading interest, motivation, habits and abilities. This study explores the sustainability of the gamified platform effects and fills the research gap regarding the sustainability of gamification pedagogy. Implications for practice and/or policy Active users of the gamified reading platform benefit from it in reading interest, motivation, habits, and abilities. The effects of gamification pedagogy can be sustainable when users’ intrinsic learning motivation is aroused.","[{""name"": ""Xiuhan Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samuel Kai Wah Chu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.20533/iji.1742.4712.2015.0123"", ""10.3991/ijim.v9i3.4421"", ""10.1080/10494820.2014.964263"", ""10.4018/IJGBL.2019040101"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155"", ""10.1016/B978-012174698-8/50045-X"", ""10.3102/00346543071001001"", ""10.4135/9781446249215.n21"", ""10.1080/15295192.2015.992736"", ""10.17083/ijsg.v6i3.306"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2014.377"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.019"", ""10.1002/pra2.2018.14505501032"", ""10.1080/2331186X.2016.1197818"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.11.022"", ""10.1080/19404158.2019.1609272"", ""10.1111/add.13314"", ""10.1177/1476718X18792684"", ""10.3102/00028312035004535"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2014.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-45557-0"", ""10.1111/lit.12128"", ""10.1111/cdep.12184"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.89.3.420"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100326""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3390/educsci13090924,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Exploring Computer Science Students' Perception of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Descriptive and Correlation Study,"ChatGPT is an emerging tool that can be employed in many activities including in learning/teaching in universities. Like many other tools, it has its benefits and its drawbacks. If used properly, it can improve learning, and if used irresponsibly, it can have a negative impact on learning. The aim of this research is to study how ChatGPT can be used in academia to improve teaching/learning activities. In this paper, we study students’ opinions about how the tool can be used positively in learning activities. A survey is conducted among 430 students of an MSc degree in computer science at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, and their opinions about the tool are studied. The survey tries to capture different aspects in which the tool can be employed in academia and the ways in which it can harm or help students in learning activities. The findings suggest that many students are familiar with the tool but do not regularly use it for academic purposes. Moreover, students are skeptical of its positive impacts on learning and think that universities should provide more vivid guidelines and better education on how and where the tool can be used for learning activities. The students’ feedback responses are analyzed and discussed and the authors’ opinions regarding the subject are presented. This study shows that ChatGPT can be helpful in learning/teaching activities, but better guidelines should be provided for the students in using the tool.","[{""name"": ""Harpreet Singh"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Physics Engineering and Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Mohammad-Hassan Tayarani-Najaran"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Physics Engineering and Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Yaqoob"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Physics Engineering and Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, UK""]}]","[""10.3389/frai.2021.654924"", ""10.1007/s11023-020-09548-1"", ""10.1080/14703297.2023.2190148"", ""10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.9"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.5220/0011996900003470"", ""10.29333/ejmste/13272"", ""10.1007/s12195-022-00754-8"", ""10.1007/s10439-022-03121-w"", ""10.1007/s00167-023-07355-6"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2023.03.001"", ""10.1177/00336882231162868"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4391243"", ""10.1016/j.bbi.2023.02.022"", ""10.30935/cedtech/13152"", ""10.1016/j.tbench.2023.100115"", ""10.35542/osf.io/fnh48"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.02.335""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

10.1186/s12909-021-02780-y,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Distance education during COVID 19: an Italian survey on the university teachers' perspectives and their emotional conditions,"Abstract Background Following the COVID-19 pandemic, distance education (DE) replaced traditional “face-to-face” teaching and has become the main method of teaching. The aim of this study was to 1) evaluate the impact of DE by teachers in our department during the second semester of the 2019–20 academic year following the March–May 2020 Italian national lockdown and 2) evaluate the relationship between DE and the emotional well-being of teachers during the period of home confinement. Methods Ninety-seven university teachers (51.5% women; most represented age group 60–69 years range, 40.2%) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 – September 30, 2020, on the advantages and disadvantages of DE, developed by one online teacher focus group. The emotional conditions were assessed by a short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The internal consistency reliability survey and the 10-item BDI-II were measured by Cronbach’s alpha. A correlation analysis (r-Pearson) was conducted between the overall evaluation of the experience of DE and the variables included in the study. Results Teachers reported difficulties in technical aspects, and in psychological factors, as the discomfort of “speaking in the void” (64.7%). The absence of “face-to-face” eye contact with the students was complained by 81% of teachers. Significant impairments in sleep patterns and loss of energy were reported, with female teachers having greater difficulty concentrating than their male colleagues. A quarter of teachers showed depressive symptoms of varying severity. The most satisfied teachers were those most stimulated by DE (r = 0.752, p &lt; 0.000), who showed a lower impact of depressive symptoms (r = − 0.289, p = 0.005). The teaching load in hours influenced the perception of disadvantages (r = 0.214, p = 0.035) and contributed to a lower appreciation of the challenges of DE. The more significant the manifestation of depressive symptoms during the lockdown was, the greater the subjective recovery of a good emotional condition once the domestic confinement was over (r = 0.344, p = 0.001), despite maintaining DE. Conclusions Our study highlights the impact of technical, didactic, and psychological difficulties of DE, reported by our teachers. The appreciation of their new learning promoted by DE seemed related to better emotional well-being of university teachers accepting this “challenge” in their important role in the high-education system, influencing good learning and promoting students’ professional success.","[{""name"": ""Massimo Casacchia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria Grazia Cifone"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Giusti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leila Fabiani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roberto Gatto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Loreto Lancia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benedetta Cinque"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cristina Petrucci"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mario Giannoni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rodolfo Ippoliti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anna Rita Frattaroli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guido Macchiarelli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rita Roncone"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7759/cureus.7541"", ""10.1145/1995376.1995403"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2019.1585476"", ""10.2307/41409963"", ""10.2753/MIS0742-1222270311"", ""10.1097/YCO.0000000000000613"", ""10.1007/s00420-018-1352-1"", ""10.1080/10773525.2018.1436015"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.020"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01791"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30046-8"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2020.574812"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113108"", ""10.4269/ajtmh.20-0877"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00155-y"", ""10.1017/S104795112000493X"", ""10.1017/S2045796011000801"", ""10.1159/000339459"", ""10.1186/2193-1801-2-636"", ""10.1207/s15327752jpa6703_13"", ""10.1080/13600800500283734"", ""10.1016/j.amsu.2021.01.054"", ""10.46328/ijtes.v4i4.113"", ""10.1038/d41586-020-00896-7"", ""10.1007/s42399-020-00528-1"", ""10.1177/1478210320935671""]",['Psychology'],"['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

This paper focuses on how relevant variables such as participation, evaluative judgement and the quality of the assessment interact and influence peer assessment. From an analysis of 4 years of data from undergraduate classes in project management, it develops a model of causal relationships validated using the PLS-SEM method. It demonstrates relationships between these variables and considerers the influence of students’ competence and the mediating nature of feedback and self-regulation on the process. It points to how peer assessment practices can be improved whilst highlighting how evaluative judgement and feedback are two key elements that can be addressed to deliver the effective development of students’ competence.","[{""name"": ""María Soledad Ibarra-Sáiz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gregorio Rodríguez-Gómez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Boud"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/07294360.2017.1405913"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1102863"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1434128"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0027-7"", ""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748694549.003.0002"", ""10.4324/9780203964309"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1018133"", ""10.4324/9781315109251-20"", ""10.1007/s10734-009-9210-4"", ""10.1080/02602930801895786"", ""10.1007/s10734-014-9816-z"", ""10.5790/hongkong/9789622098237.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.12.010"", ""10.1080/13562510903560036"", ""10.1080/0969594X.2014.898128"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1467877"", ""10.1080/0969594X.2016.1244514"", ""10.1080/03075079912331379935"", ""10.1007/s10734-009-9247-4"", ""10.3102/0034654312474350"", ""10.1080/02602930903221444"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1080/02602938.2016.1236360"", ""10.1007/s10734-012-9506-7"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-2492-2.ch012"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.01.005"", ""10.1080/02602930600679258"", ""10.4135/9781412984409"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1083535"", ""10.3102/0013189X14545513"", ""10.1016/j.stueduc.2017.01.001"", ""10.1080/02602938.2014.985632"", ""10.1080/02602938.2013.795518"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00422"", ""10.1080/00313831.2015.1066436"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.08.004"", ""10.1007/s13384-018-0258-y"", ""10.1080/02602938.2017.1356905"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0005-0"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50043-3"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1008982"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10804-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-3045-1_11"", ""10.1080/02602930500063819"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1064858"", ""10.1007/s10734-004-6376-7"", ""10.1177/1094428107300342"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2015.01.001"", ""10.1080/02602930500099102"", ""10.1007/s10459-015-9659-0"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0220-3"", ""10.53761/1.8.1.5"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.08.003"", ""10.1007/s10734-004-7263-y"", ""10.1080/02602938.2014.880400"", ""10.1080/03075079.2015.1004241""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Education']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/jcal.12389,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,Developing a hands-on activity using virtual reality to help students learn by doing,"AbstractThis study combined virtual reality (VR) technology, the 6E (Engage, Explore, Explain, Engineer, Enrich, and Evaluate) model, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education to develop a hands‐on activity aimed at helping students to achieve “learning by doing.” The participants were 162 tenth‐grade students, divided into the Experimental Group (hands‐on activity using VR technology) and the Control Group (hands‐on activity via lectures). Using sequential analysis, this study investigated how the hands‐on activity influenced the students' behavioral patterns in learning. The results showed that all of the students' learning performances and hands‐on abilities were enhanced. Moreover, the students who used VR technology achieved both significantly better learning performances and hands‐on abilities, indicating that VR might be able to help the students understand abstract scientific concepts and build mental models, which they used to internalize and organize knowledge structures. Furthermore, this study discovered that the students who learned using VR technology formed a cyclical learning pattern, starting with a group discussion (G), moving on to solving problems (S) and developing a product (D), and then going back to another group discussion. However, the students who learned via lectures produced a linear learning pattern in the order of G→S→D.","[{""name"": ""Jyun‐Chen Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Research Center for Testing and Assessment National Academy for Educational Research  New Taipei City Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Yun Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Technology Application and Human Resource Development National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Kuen‐Yi Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Technology Application and Human Resource Development National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Yu‐Shan Chang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Technology Application and Human Resource Development National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Hung‐Chang Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Technology Application and Human Resource Development National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Chien‐Yu Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""Science and Technology Policy Research and Information Center National Applied Research Laboratories  Taipei City Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Hsien‐Sheng Hsiao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Technology Application and Human Resource Development National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei Taiwan"", ""Chinese Language and Technology Center National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei Taiwan"", ""Institute for Research Excellence in Learning Sciences National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei City Taiwan""]}]","[""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.11.002"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2016.1212931"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511527685"", ""10.1207/s15326934crj1104_7"", ""10.1007/s00464-015-4517-y"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2008.tb00985.x"", ""10.4159/9780674029019"", ""10.5755/j01.eee.18.9.2825"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.01.014"", ""10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00729a"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-618-8_10"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.09.017"", ""10.1007/s10798-015-9328-x"", ""10.1007/1-4020-3613-2_2"", ""10.1007/s10798-013-9241-0"", ""10.14742/ajet.347"", ""10.1111/jcal.12319"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.09.004"", ""10.2307/2529310"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.07.010"", ""10.1080/02635143.2018.1561432"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.01231a"", ""10.1007/s10763-013-9485-x"", ""10.1504/IJMPT.2016.073621"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9581-2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2017.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.94.3.598"", ""10.1037/edu0000241"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.01.009"", ""10.1023/B:BTTJ.0000047603.37042.33"", ""10.1007/1-4020-3613-2_4"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.jvlc.2015.01.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-78485-4""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"
10.1111/medu.14592,MEDICAL EDUCATION,1204 Public Administration; 0401 Education,Confidence-competence alignment and the role of self-confidence in medical education: A conceptual review,"AbstractContextThere have been significant advances in competency‐based medical education (CBME) within health professions education. While most of the efforts have focused on competency, less attention has been paid to the role of confidence as a factor in preparing for practice. This paper seeks to address this deficit by exploring the role of confidence and the calibration of confidence with regard to competence.MethodsThis paper presents a conceptual review of confidence and the calibration of confidence in different medical education contexts. Building from an initial literature review, the authors engaged in iterative discussions exploring divergent and convergent perspectives, which were then supplemented with targeted literature reviews. Finally, a stakeholder consultation was conducted to situate and validate the provisional findings.ResultsA series of axioms were developed to guide perceptions and responses to different states of confidence in health professionals: (a) confidence can shape how we act and is optimised when it closely corresponds to reality; (b) self‐confidence is task‐specific, but also inextricably influenced by the individual self‐conceptualisation, the surrounding system and society; (c) confidence is shaped by many external factors and the context of the situation; (d) confidence must be considered in conjunction with competence and (e) the confidence‐competence ratio (CCR) changes over time. It is important to track learners’ CCRs and work with them to maintain balance.ConclusionConfidence is expressed in different ways and is shaped by a variety of modifiers. While CBME primarily focuses on competency, proportional confidence is an integral component in ensuring safe and professional practice. As such, it is important to consider both confidence and competence, as well as their relationship in CBME. The CCR can serve as a key construct in developing mindful and capable health professionals. Future research should evaluate strategies for assessing CCR, identify best practices for teaching confidence and guiding self‐calibration of CCR and explore the role of CCR in continuing professional development for individuals and teams.","[{""name"": ""Michael Gottlieb"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Emergency Medicine Rush University Medical Center  Chicago IL USA""]}, {""name"": ""Teresa M.

10.3390/educsci10110320,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,"""Am I Doing Enough?"" Special Educators' Experiences with Emergency Remote Teaching in Spring 2020","While the COVID-19 pandemic radically changed all aspects of everyone’s life, the closure of schools was one of the most impactful, significantly altering daily life for school personnel, students, and families. The shift to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) presented particular challenges to special educators of students with significant support needs who often benefit from strong interpersonal connections, modeling, and the use of physical manipulatives. This paper details the experiences of two elementary special education teachers as they navigated the transition to ERT. The teachers reported three distinct stages of ERT: making contact, establishing routines, and transitioning to academics. They also discussed the challenges they faced during this period, such as the inequity in resources amongst their students, needing to rely on at-home support in order to meaningfully teach students, and changes in what it meant to be a teacher while having to teach online. While clearly not in favor of online learning, the teachers do present glimmers of hope, for example, with regards to increased communication between teachers and parents. The challenges and strategies used to overcome these challenges will be of use to educators in the coming months, with implications for distance learning in this population.","[{""name"": ""Rachel K.

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003587,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Trauma-Informed Medical Education (TIME): Advancing Curricular Content and Educational Context,"The majority of patients and medical students experience some form of psychological trauma or adversity across their life course. All forms of trauma can be associated with adverse health consequences and can negatively affect learning and professional development. Trauma-informed care (TIC) offers a framework to address and mitigate these consequences and promote safety and health. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration describes 6 domains of TIC: safety; trust and transparency; peer support; collaboration and mutuality; empowerment, voice, and choice; and cultural, historic, and gender issues. At present, TIC is not taught routinely in undergraduate medical education (UME)—a crucial educational gap given that UME grounds the development of key perspectives and practices that students use throughout their careers. Further, given the prevalence of preexisting trauma among learners and the likelihood of new traumatic exposures during training, medical schools’ processes, practices, and learning environments may risk exacerbating or even causing trauma. To address this educational need and support students and their future patients, the authors propose a trauma-informed medical education (TIME) framework. TIME informs medical schools’ curricular content and educational context. In UME, curricular content should address trauma epidemiology, physiology, and effects; trauma-informed clinical skills including sensitive communication and physical exam techniques; and trauma-informed self-care techniques including education on organizational resources, how to elicit supports, and personal self-care practices. A trauma-informed educational context encompasses curricular development, including student–faculty coproduction of educational content; curricular delivery, including faculty development on TIC principles; and learning environment, including trauma-informed educational practices, medical student advising, institutional policies, and recruitment. TIME offers practical strategies to support teaching, learning, educational administration, and professional development and aims to inspire new strategies for effective learner and faculty engagement. TIME aims to foster students’ development of competency in TIC and promote student engagement, learning, health, and well-being.","[{""name"": ""Taylor Brown"", ""affiliation"": [""T.

With a focus on the teaching of non-complex skills, this paper explores how skills are learned; ways to improve skill performance; determining competency; and the provision of effective feedback.","[{""name"": ""Annette Burgess"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christie van Diggele"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Craig Mellis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.bbr.2011.11.028"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00464.x"", ""10.1080/00336297.1972.10519717"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2016.1150984"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2011.75.11.tb05209.x"", ""10.1016/j.afjem.2014.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.05.026"", ""10.1080/10401334.2011.586917"", ""10.1097/00001888-200410001-00022"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-1037-6"", ""10.1097/NNE.0b013e31821fdab1"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.95.3.355"", ""10.1097/00001888-199009000-00045"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000734"", ""10.1136/bmjqs-2014-003518""]",['Medicine'],"['Family Practice', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Physiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"

10.1108/ET-01-2019-0005,EDUCATION AND TRAINING,0401 Education,The effects of entrepreneurship education on students' entrepreneurial intentions A longitudinal approach,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to employ a longitudinal approach to assess the effects of entrepreneurship education (EE) on students’ entrepreneurial intentions (EIs) through the constructs of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which include attitudes towards behaviour (ATB), subjective norms (SN) and perceived behavioural control (PBC). Specifically, this study aims to achieve two objectives: first, to determine if students’ ATB, SN, PBC and EIs would increase significantly after their exposure to EE; and second, to establish whether students’ ATB, SN and PBC mediate the relationship between EE and their EIs.Design/methodology/approachThis longitudinal study employed a one-group pretest-posttest experimental research design. A self-reported questionnaire was administered to a randomly selected sample of 250 National Diploma students from five polytechnics in the North Central part of Nigeria before and after they were exposed to EE. To achieve the objectives of this study, repeated-measurest-test and partial least squares structural equation modelling were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and SmartPLS, respectively, for data analysis.FindingsThe results of the paired-samplest-test showed that students’ ATB, SN, PBC and EIs increased significantly after their exposure to EE. Also, further data analysis revealed that EE had a significantly positive relationship with students’ ATB, SN, PBC and EIs. Similarly, the results of the structural model indicated that ATB had a significantly positive link with students’ EIs and also mediated the relationship between EE and students’ EIs. SN and PBC had a positive but not statistically significant relationship with students’ EIs and did not mediate the relationship between EE and students’ EIs.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study provide interesting implications for EE and entrepreneurship policies in Nigeria. More specifically, the findings provide some practical implications for the Nigerian government and the EE curriculum developers. To achieve greater impact of EE on students’ EIs at the tertiary education level, the Nigerian government should incorporate EE into the curricula at the primary and secondary education levels. Equipping students at the primary and secondary education levels with entrepreneurial knowledge, competencies and skills would enable them to develop a strong entrepreneurial mindset even before they gain admission to tertiary institutions.Originality/valueIt is one of the few studies that have tested empirically both the direct and the indirect effects of EE on students’ EIs in a single study. Thus, it helps to further clarify the links between EE and EIs. Besides, it is among the first studies to adopt a longitudinal approach to assess the effects of EE on students’ EIs through the constructs of the TPB (i.e. ATB, SN and PBC) in the Nigerian context.","[{""name"": ""Innocent Otache"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kadiri Umar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yakubu Audu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ugbede Onalo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/IJEBR-01-2016-0005"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1108/02621710410541114"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-12-2015-0326"", ""10.1080/14632440110094632"", ""10.1016/j.iedeen.2017.04.001"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12137"", ""10.1142/S1084946711001768"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2006.12.016"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2016-0024"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00432.x"", ""10.1108/13552551011020063"", ""10.1108/ET-04-2013-0053"", ""10.4102/sajbm.v43i3.473"", ""10.1108/WJEMSD-03-2017-0018"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12065"", ""10.1108/03090590610715022"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1108/00400910210449231"", ""10.1108/20400701211265036"", ""10.1108/01409170910944281"", ""10.1108/09534811211254608"", ""10.1177/0971355713513346"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-01-2017-0031"", ""10.1108/ET-06-2013-0079"", ""10.1108/JMP-07-2014-0213"", ""10.1108/17566261311328864"", ""10.1108/ET-04-2013-0052"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12137"", ""10.1080/00036846.2011.610750"", ""10.1080/08985629300000020"", ""10.1108/13552551211268148"", ""10.1108/17561391111166975"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00318.x"", ""10.1108/JSBED-04-2013-0052"", ""10.1108/JSBED-06-2016-0078"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2015.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2012.03.002"", ""10.47263/JASEM.2(1)01"", ""10.1108/JEEE-10-2015-0058"", ""10.1108/00400910810909018"", ""10.5465/amle.2015.0026"", ""10.11648/j.sjbm.20140204.12"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2009.08.002"", ""10.1108/ET-10-2017-0148"", ""10.7341/20151122"", ""10.1108/JIC-04-2017-0056"", ""10.1177/0266242607080656"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.3758/BF03206553"", ""10.1108/13552550910995443"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2013-0095"", ""10.5465/amle.2012.0293"", ""10.1108/JSBED-10-2015-0149"", ""10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00355.x"", ""10.1177/2393957514555255"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2014-0075"", ""10.1108/ET-06-2013-0075"", ""10.1108/14626001211250153"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2006.05.002"", ""10.1080/089856299283209"", ""10.1108/03090590910939049"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-07-2016-0218"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12026"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2010.02.015"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2008.00246.x"", ""10.1177/0266242615612534"", ""10.1596/31895"", ""10.2224/sbp.2013.41.3.367"", ""10.1016/0883-9026(94)00004-E"", ""10.1108/01437721011088557"", ""10.1086/651257"", ""10.1080/08985629100000005""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"
10.1111/medu.14567,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Social media in undergraduate medical education: A systematic review,"AbstractIntroductionThere are over 3.81 billion worldwide active social media (SoMe) users. SoMe are ubiquitous in medical education, with roles across undergraduate programmes, including professionalism, blended learning, well being and mentoring. Previous systematic reviews took place before recent explosions in SoMe popularity and revealed a paucity of high‐quality empirical studies assessing its effectiveness in medical education. This review aimed to synthesise evidence regarding SoMe interventions in undergraduate medical education, to identify features associated with positive and negative outcomes.MethodsAuthors searched 31 key terms through seven databases, in addition to references, citation and hand searching, between 16 June and 16 July 2020. Studies describing SoMe interventions and research on exposure to existing SoMe were included. Title, abstract and full paper screening were undertaken independently by two reviewers. Included papers were assessed for methodological quality using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and/or the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) instrument. Extracted data were synthesised using narrative synthesis.Results112 studies from 26 countries met inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included studies had not significantly improved since 2013. Engagement and satisfaction with SoMe platforms in medical education are described. Students felt SoMe flattened hierarchies and improved communication with educators. SoMe use was associated with improvement in objective knowledge assessment scores and self‐reported clinical and professional performance, however evidence for long term knowledge retention was limited. SoMe use was occasionally linked to adverse impacts upon mental and physical health. Professionalism was heavily investigated and considered important, though generally negative correlations between SoMe use and medical professionalism may exist.ConclusionsSocial media is enjoyable for students who may improve short term knowledge retention and can aid communication between learners and educators. However, higher‐quality study is required to identify longer‐term impact upon knowledge and skills, provide clarification on professionalism standards and protect against harms.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan Guckian"", ""affiliation"": [""Dermatology Department Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust  Yorkshire UK"", ""School of Medical Education Newcastle University  Newcastle Upon Tyne UK""]}, {""name"": ""Mrudula Utukuri"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Clinical Medicine University of Cambridge  Cambridge UK""]}, {""name"": ""Aqua Asif"", ""affiliation"": [""Leicester Medical School University of Leicester  Leicester UK""]}, {""name"": ""Oliver Burton"", ""affiliation"": [""Warwick Medical School University of Warwick  Coventry UK""]}, {""name"": ""Joshua Adeyoju"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Medicine University of Southampton  Southampton UK""]}, {""name"": ""Adam Oumeziane"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Medicine Anglia Ruskin University  Chelmsford UK""]}, {""name"": ""Timothy Chu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Medical Education Newcastle University  Newcastle Upon Tyne UK""]}, {""name"": ""Eliot L.

10.1111/bjet.12839,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,"Review of research on mobile-assisted language learning in familiar, authentic environments","AbstractFamiliarity with learning contexts is important in the field of mobile‐assisted language learning (MALL). Several review studies on MALL have been published to date. However, scholars have not covered certain aspects of familiar contexts in their reviews, such as which learning/instructional methodologies support learning in familiar contexts or what the affordances of familiar contexts are for language learning. To address this gap, the authors in this study reviewed research articles related to MALL in familiar, authentic environments published in the past 10 years. The reviewed articles were from journals published in the Social Science Citation Index between 2009 and 2018. The main aim of this study was to review the published articles to understand (1) pedagogical approaches, (2) data collection, (3) locations, (4) affordances of authentic environments and (5) issues in MALL research. The results revealed that the most frequent items in reviewed articles were task‐based learning and communicative language teaching (pedagogical approaches); questionnaires, pretest and posttests and interviews (data collection); the local community and campus (locations); daily encounters, language learning and cognitive load (affordances of authentic environments); and small sample sizes and short‐term interventions (issues in MALL research). Based on the results, the authors in this study made several suggestions and provided implications for educators and researchers in the field about MALL in familiar, authentic environments.","[{""name"": ""Rustam Shadiev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Taoying Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wu‐Yuin Hwang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/bjet.12354"", ""10.1080/09588221.2014.914539"", ""10.1007/BF02300327"", ""10.1016/j.system.2016.04.013"", ""10.1145/3141880.3141898"", ""10.1111/bjet.12674"", ""10.1017/S0958344014000287"", ""10.1080/09588221.2012.700315"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.007"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9475-0"", ""10.3758/s13423-011-0117-6"", ""10.1080/09588221.2011.639783"", ""10.1080/09588221.2012.733711"", ""10.1080/09588221.2015.1016438"", ""10.1111/bjet.12580"", ""10.1017/S0272263110000525"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2009.00329.x"", ""10.1080/10494820.2014.959976"", ""10.1186/2046-4053-4-1"", ""10.1080/09588221.2017.1308383"", ""10.1080/10494820.2015.1016534"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2011.00445.x"", ""10.1007/s11251-016-9383-z"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00357.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Information Systems', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

As an alternative, neuromorphic computation is emerging as a platform for next‐generation artificial intelligence computing systems due to their potential advantages such as highly energy‐efficient computing, robust learning, fault tolerance, and parallel processing. Moreover, to further enhance the energy efficiency and processing speed, photonic‐based neuromorphic systems have gathered significant interest in the past few years. Herein, the recent progress and development of optoelectronic and all‐optical neuromorphic devices is summarized, focusing on their structures, materials, and potential applications.

Despite the global attention, physical literacy remains an elusive concept in regards to its definition, assessment, and interventions. In this article, we review the existing scholarship on physical literacy definitions, assessments, and interventions. We first present the historic evolution of physical literacy and the various definitions, followed by a synthesis of its underlying components. We next summarize the current physical literacy assessments along with a commentary on the challenges to accurately and feasibly assess the concept. Following this we describe the characteristics and efficacy of the existing physical literacy-related interventions in children and adolescents. The article concludes with an interpretive discussion of the findings to stimulate future efforts of research, practice, and policy for fostering physically literate individuals.","[{""name"": ""Yang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Louisiana State University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Senlin Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Louisiana State University, USA""]}]","[""10.1080/00336297.2017.1320294"", ""10.1016/j.scispo.2014.08.121"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2018-0219"", ""10.1186/s12889-016-2973-5"", ""10.1080/10810730.2010.499985"", ""10.1016/S0749-3797(02)00477-4"", ""10.1016/j.jshs.2015.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.jshs.2015.03.005"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2016-0137"", ""10.1186/s12889-017-4105-2"", ""10.1016/j.jshs.2015.04.005"", ""10.1177/1356336X10369196"", ""10.1080/02701367.2016.1124722"", ""10.3390/jfmk3030037"", ""10.1006/pmed.1998.0307"", ""10.1080/1091367X.2011.568364"", ""10.1007/s40279-016-0560-7"", ""10.1007/s40279-017-0817-9"", ""10.1016/j.jshs.2015.03.001"", ""10.3390/sports4010003"", ""10.1016/j.jneb.2017.10.008"", ""10.1007/s40279-014-0205-7"", ""10.1080/08870446.2015.1006223"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2016-0182"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2016-0151"", ""10.1016/j.jshs.2015.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.psychsport.2014.03.005"", ""10.1186/s12889-019-6719-z"", ""10.3390/mps2020027"", ""10.1177/1356336X17690312"", ""10.1016/j.pmedr.2017.05.002"", ""10.1080/00336297.2015.1084341"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2018-0264"", ""10.26644/em.2018.010"", ""10.18666/TPE-2017-V74-I3-7459"", ""10.1186/s12889-015-2106-6"", ""10.1016/j.jshs.2015.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.jshs.2015.02.001"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2018-0028"", ""10.1123/jpah.2016-0474"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.07.006"", ""10.4236/ape.2013.34024"", ""10.11648/j.sjedu.20160405.14"", ""10.1080/135733200114442"", ""10.1080/07303084.2014.948353"", ""10.1177/002205743011201506"", ""10.4278/ajhp.110211-QUAL-62"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0155610"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2018.01.001"", ""10.1249/MSS.0000000000000181"", ""10.1186/s12889-018-5903-x"", ""10.1080/17408989.2018.1455819"", ""10.1093/her/cyu060"", ""10.1080/1740898010060205"", ""10.1080/17511320701676916"", ""10.4324/9780203881903"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2018-0139"", ""10.1080/1091367X.2011.568363""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0403 体育学', 0.7413), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7214)]]"

However, existing continuum robots reach the bottleneck in actuation on account of the contradiction among small size, compliance actuation, large tender range, high precision, and small dynamic error. Herein, a 3D‐printed millimeter‐scale soft continuum robot with an ultrathin hollow skeleton wall (300 μm) and a large inner‐to‐outer ratio (0.8) is reported. After coating a thin ferromagnetic elastomer layer (≈100–150 μm), the proposed soft continuum robot equipped with hybrid actuation (tendon‐ and magnetic‐driven mode) achieves large‐angle (up to 100°) steering and high‐precision (low to 2 μm for static positioning) micromanipulation simultaneously. Specifically, the robot implements an ultralow dynamic tracking error of ≈10 μm, which is ≈30‐fold improved than the state of art. Combined with a microneedle/knife or nasopharyngeal swab, the robot reveals the potential for versatile biomedical applications, such as drug injection on the target tissue, diseased tissue ablation, and COVID‐19 nasopharyngeal sampling. The proposed millimeter‐scale soft continuum robot presents remarkable advances in large‐range and high‐precise actuation, which provides a new method for miniature continuum robot design and finds broad applications in biomedical engineering.","[{""name"": ""Tieshan Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Engineering City University of Hong Kong  Tat Chee Avenue Kowloon Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Liu Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Engineering City University of Hong Kong  Tat Chee Avenue Kowloon Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiong Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Engineering City University of Hong Kong  Tat Chee Avenue Kowloon Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Rong Tan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Engineering City University of Hong Kong  Tat Chee Avenue Kowloon Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Haojian Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Engineering City University of Hong Kong  Tat Chee Avenue Kowloon Hong Kong China"", ""The State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control and Technology Zhejiang University  Hangzhou 310027 China""]}, {""name"": ""Yajing Shen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Engineering City University of Hong Kong  Tat Chee Avenue Kowloon Hong Kong China"", ""Shenzhen Research Institute of City University of Hong Kong  Shenzhen 518057 China""]}]","[""10.1038/s41578-018-0022-y"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aar7650"", ""10.1089/soro.2018.0136"", ""10.1007/s11548-015-1310-2"", ""10.1002/rcs.1774"", ""10.1002/rcs.1747"", ""10.1089/soro.2016.0065"", ""10.1007/s00464-016-4967-x"", ""10.1002/adfm.201303288"", ""10.1002/adem.201700016"", ""10.1002/advs.202000069"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-06491-9"", ""10.1177/0278364916683443"", ""10.1142/S2424905X18500022"", ""10.1089/soro.2018.0019"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aax7329"", ""10.1089/soro.2016.0042"", ""10.1007/s11517-019-02102-x"", ""10.1088/1748-3182/8/3/036008"", ""10.1109/LRA.2016.2523120"", ""10.1115/1.4042618"", ""10.1080/24699322.2018.1526972"", ""10.1016/j.jmps.2018.10.008"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0185-0""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Condensed Matter Physics', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.731), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7181)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"
10.3390/educsci11070361,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,"Learning, Student Digital Capabilities and Academic Performance over the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the time of COVID-19 lockdown over spring 2020, universities shifted teaching from on-campus blended learning to an emergency remote fully online approach. The aim of this study was to compare Psychology and Veterinary Science undergraduate students’ academic performance with their responses on a self-reported questionnaire regarding their digital capabilities, individual’s characteristics, and the role of environment on their independent learning process over the first COVID-19 lockdown period. Social-Cognitive Theory was adopted to conceptualise students’ behaviour, individuals’ characteristics, and learning environment with their academic performance to a learning framework. A total of 303 students from both disciplines (133 Psychology and 170 Veterinary Science undergraduate students) participated in this study by completing an online questionnaire after following the teaching shift from blended learning to full remote online approach at a UK University during the 2019–2020 academic year. Differences between students’ responses were identified due to their discipline’s curricular structure, students’ study behaviours (i.e., being exposed to unrelated learning activities), and students’ cognitive effort to think critically in the search, evaluation and managing of digital information. Students with high level of self-regulation and digital capabilities were able to keep focused and engaged during the lockdown. Although universities and teachers were “forced” to shift their teaching approach due to the unfortunate disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, most students have coped with the changed teaching delivery mode relatively easy with minimum guidance. However, teachers should further consider how digital technologies could enhance students’ learning flexibility promoting critical thinking.","[{""name"": ""Maria Limniou"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Psychology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZA, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Tunde Varga-Atkins"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Innovation in Education, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GW, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Caroline Hands"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Psychology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZA, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Marie Elshamaa"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Psychology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZA, UK""]}]","[""10.29333/pr/7947"", ""10.1177/0973703020946700"", ""10.3390/ijerph17186468"", ""10.3390/publications8040048"", ""10.1080/09523987.2013.795350"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010"", ""10.1177/2042753020946291"", ""10.30827/publicaciones.v48i1.7327"", ""10.21125/edulearn.2017.1004"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-1852-7.ch063"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.01.015"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.03.008"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50030-5"", ""10.1016/0361-476X(86)90027-5"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10201-8"", ""10.2501/S1470785310201119"", ""10.1111/bjet.12161"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.025"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3"", ""10.4236/ce.2019.104059"", ""10.3138/jvme.36.4.388"", ""10.1080/23752696.2020.1797522"", ""10.25304/rlt.v28.2319"", ""10.1177/2347631120983481"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104271"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104211"", ""10.1016/j.ijedro.2020.100012"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2016.1258369"", ""10.1080/02607476.2020.1800407"", ""10.5210/fm.v16i9.3171"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103230"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00187-4""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Information Systems', 'Education']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1186/s40536-020-0079-0,LARGE-SCALE ASSESSMENTS IN EDUCATION,0401 Education,Everything in moderation: ICT and reading performance of Dutch 15-year-olds,"AbstractPrevious research on the relationship between students’ home and school Information and Communication Technology (ICT) resources and academic performance has shown ambiguous results. The availability of ICT resources at school has been found to be unrelated or negatively related to academic performance, whereas the availability of ICT resources at home has been found to be both positively and negatively related to academic performance. In addition, the frequency of use of ICT is related to students’ academic achievement. This relationship has been found to be negative for ICT use at school, however, for ICT use at home the literature on the relationship with academic performance is again ambiguous. In addition to ICT availability and ICT use, students’ attitudes towards ICT have also been found to play a role in student performance. In the present study, we examine how availability of ICT resources, students’ use of those resources (at school, outside school for schoolwork, outside school for leisure), and students’ attitudes toward ICT (interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence, perceived ICT autonomy) relate to individual differences in performance on a digital assessment of reading in one comprehensive model using the Dutch PISA 2015 sample of 5183 15-year-olds (49.2% male). Student gender and students’ economic, social, and cultural status accounted for a substantial part of the variation in digitally assessed reading performance. Controlling for these relationships, results indicated that students with moderate access to ICT resources, moderate use of ICT at school or outside school for schoolwork, and moderate interest in ICT had the highest digitally assessed reading performance. In contrast, students who reported moderate competence in ICT had the lowest digitally assessed reading performance. In addition, frequent use of ICT outside school for leisure was negatively related to digitally assessed reading performance, whereas perceived autonomy was positively related. Taken together, the findings suggest that excessive access to ICT resources, excessive use of ICT, and excessive interest in ICT is associated with lower digitally assessed reading performance.","[{""name"": ""Joyce Gubbels"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicole M.

A meta-analysis,"AbstractThe great advantages of e‐learning have been recognized, and efforts have been made to promote e‐learning adoption. Despite valuable research achievements from technology adoption, previous studies built their models from different perspectives. In this study, to offer a comprehensive research model on e‐learning adoption, we integrated these models (ie, TAM, TPB and IDT) and included culture as a moderator. Based on 45 relevant empirical research, this study conducted a meta‐analysis to explore key determinants of users’ attitude and behavioral intention to adopt e‐learning. Combined with traditional technology acceptance theories and innovation diffusion theory, we developed a comprehensive model and explored the moderating role of culture. The results indicate that this integrated technology acceptance model can be applied to better understand e‐learning adoption. The moderator analysis shows that the influence of subjective norms and self‐efficacy on users’ behavior intention is more salient in the collectivistic culture, whereas perceived usefulness is more important for online learners in an individualistic culture.","[{""name"": ""Yang Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ning Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yixuan Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ruoxin Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shuangshuang Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.036"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v14i5.1631"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2013.774047"", ""10.1509/jim.14.0065"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1424-1"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.04.010"", ""10.14742/ajet.818"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2015.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2011.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.02.009"", ""10.1108/10662241211235699"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.im.2008.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.01.014"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.022"", ""10.2190/EC.49.3.e"", ""10.1007/s10796-016-9675-5"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2015.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2006.08.005"", ""10.1080/00288230709510329"", ""10.1006/obhd.1999.2845"", ""10.1038/nature25753"", ""10.1300/J120v33n69_04"", ""10.4018/jgim.1999010101"", ""10.1108/EUM0000000005485"", ""10.1016/0040-1625(94)90019-1"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.07.019"", ""10.1145/353485.353487"", ""10.4018/jgim.2006100102"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2012.702284"", ""10.1016/S1567-4223(03)00008-5"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2017.01.196"", ""10.1037/10096-012"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1881.001.0001"", ""10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/01636-3"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2008.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.ibusrev.2010.01.001"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.91.2.404"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.06.014"", ""10.4236/jssm.2011.43029"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.im.2003.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2012.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2010.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.11.006"", ""10.1080/08961530.2013.751793"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2005.07.003"", ""10.1080/01449290600958965"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.025"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2004.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.im.2003.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.06.013"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2007.06.001"", ""10.1007/s11292-007-9046-9"", ""10.28945/327"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007"", ""10.1080/10494820.2015.1122635"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.263-266.3424"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2005.12.003"", ""10.1287/isre.11.4.342.11872"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.1016/j.im.2004.07.001"", ""10.1108/02651330810866281"", ""10.1016/S1071-5819(03)00114-9"", ""10.1080/13598660802232779"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.05.008"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.08.006"", ""10.1109/ICEEE.2010.5661033""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Communication']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003092,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Can Better Selection Tools Help Us Achieve Our Diversity Goals in Postgraduate Medical Education? Comparing Use of USMLE Step 1 Scores and Situational Judgment Tests at 7 Surgical Residencies,"Purpose Use of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) for residency selection has been criticized for its inability to predict clinical performance and potential bias against underrepresented minorities (URMs). This study explored the impact of altering traditional USMLE cutoffs and adopting more evidence-based applicant screening tools on inclusion of URMs in the surgical residency selection process. Method Multimethod job analyses were conducted at 7 U.S. general surgical residency programs during the 2018–2019 application cycle to gather validity evidence for developing selection assessments. Unique situational judgment tests (SJTs) and scoring algorithms were created to assess applicant competencies and fit. Programs lowered their traditional USMLE Step 1 cutoffs and invited candidates to take their unique SJT. URM status (woman, racial/ethnic minority) of candidates who would have been considered for interview using traditional USMLE Step 1 cutoffs was compared with the candidate pool considered based on SJT performance. Results A total of 2,742 general surgery applicants were invited to take an online SJT by at least 1 of the 7 programs. Approximately 35% of applicants who were invited to take the SJT would not have met traditional USMLE Step 1 cutoffs. Comparison of USMLE-driven versus SJT-driven assessment results demonstrated statistically different percentages of URMs recommended, and including the SJT allowed an average of 8% more URMs offered an interview invitation (P &lt; .01). Conclusions Reliance on USMLE Step 1 as a primary screening tool precludes URMs from being considered for residency positions at higher rate than non-URMs. Developing screening tools to measure a wider array of candidate competencies can help create a more equitable surgical workforce.","[{""name"": ""Aimee K.

Noninvasive, on‐body sensors can monitor, track, and recognize hand gestures for various applications such as sign language recognition, rehabilitation, myoelectric control for prosthetic hands and human–machine interface (HMI), and many other applications. This article systematically reviews recent achievements from noninvasive upper‐limb sensing techniques for HGR, multimodal sensing fusion to gain additional user information, and wearable gesture recognition algorithms to obtain more reliable and robust performance. Research challenges, progress, and emerging opportunities for sensor‐based HGR systems are also analyzed to provide perspectives for future research and progress.","[{""name"": ""Rayane Tchantchane"",

10.1186/s12909-021-03041-8,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency training: a systematic review and analysis,"AbstractBackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly affected medical education in addition to clinical systems. Residency training has probably been the most affected aspect of medical education during the pandemic, and research on this topic is crucial for educators and clinical teachers. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic comprehensively through a systematic review and analysis of related published articles.MethodsA systematic review was conducted based on a predesigned protocol. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases until November 30, 2020, for eligible articles. Two independent reviewers extracted data by using a customized form to record crucial information, and any conflicts between the two reviewers were resolved through discussion with another independent reviewer. The aggregated data were summarized and analyzed.ResultsIn total, 53 original articles that investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency training were included. Studies from various regions were included in the research, with the largest percentage from the United States (n = 25, 47.2%). Most of these original articles were questionnaire-based studies (n = 44, 83%), and the research target groups included residents (79.55%), program directors (13.64%), or both (6.82%). The majority of the articles (n = 37, 84.0%) were published in countries severely affected by the pandemic. Surgery (n = 36, 67.92%) was the most commonly studied field.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected residency training globally, particularly surgical and interventional medical fields. Decreased clinical experience, reduced case volume, and disrupted education activities are major concerns. Further studies should be conducted with a focus on the learning outcomes of residency training during the pandemic and the effectiveness of assisted teaching methods.","[{""name"": ""Shou-Yen Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hsiang-Yun Lo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shang-Kai Hung"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1056/NEJMsb2021088"", ""10.3390/ijerph17082690"", ""10.1111/acem.14048"", ""10.1097/ALN.0000000000003303"", ""10.4103/jfcm.JFCM_332_20"", ""10.21873/invivo.11950"", ""10.7326/M18-0850"", ""10.1007/s00268-020-05826-2"", ""10.2147/OPTH.S283073"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.087"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2020.07.014"", ""10.1016/j.amsu.2020.07.025"", ""10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138789"", ""10.1016/j.jaip.2020.09.036"", ""10.1007/s00701-020-04460-0"", ""10.1136/flgastro-2020-101504"", ""10.1007/s13304-020-00811-9"", ""10.4103/ijo.IJO_1067_20"", ""10.1177/0846537120933215"", ""10.1007/s00264-020-04714-7"", ""10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.08.766"", ""10.1016/j.jtcvs.2020.05.052"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.036"", ""10.1007/s00405-020-06228-9"", ""10.1111/jocs.14954"", ""10.1016/j.jcot.2020.07.018"", ""10.1097/JU.0000000000001155"", ""10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.07.057"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.037"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02267-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110217"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2020.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.surg.2020.06.003"", ""10.1111/ijcp.13559"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2020.09.125"", ""10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.09.026"", ""10.1016/j.gie.2020.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.urology.2020.05.051"", ""10.1177/0036933020949217"", ""10.1007/s10620-020-06655-y"", ""10.1017/S1047951120003996"", ""10.1038/s41433-020-1061-3"", ""10.1016/j.amsu.2020.10.031"", ""10.1177/0003134820956355"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.06.004"", ""10.1590/s1677-5538.ibju.2020.s120"", ""10.1080/01676830.2020.1839919"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2020.09.010"", ""10.1177/2374289520953548"", ""10.1007/s00264-020-04742-3"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.263"", ""10.1016/j.joms.2020.05.026"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.063"", ""10.1016/j.crad.2020.07.022"", ""10.1002/ccd.29198"", ""10.1002/ccd.28977"", ""10.1002/hed.26368"", ""10.5435/JAAOS-D-20-00397"", ""10.1111/jce.14805"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2020.10.016"", ""10.1093/asj/sjaa225"", ""10.1016/j.euros.2021.01.006"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa710"", ""10.1161/JAHA.120.017175"", ""10.1007/s00464-020-08149-4"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.3288"", ""10.3201/eid2608.201229"", ""10.1017/ice.2016.171"", ""10.12968/ijtr.2009.16.1.37935"", ""10.36076/ppj.2020/23/S367"", ""10.2196/20963""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Oncology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1007/s11423-024-10351-3,ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,0401 Education,Virtual reality and gamification in education: a systematic review,"AbstractThis study aims to analyze the use of virtual reality and gamification in education by examining the existing literature. In addition to virtual reality, this study focuses on gamified virtual reality learning environments which refer to virtual reality learning environments that integrate gamification elements and mechanisms. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a systematic literature review was carried out. No limitations were set regarding educational level, type of study, subject, and publication year. The related articles were retrieved from 5 databases (ERIC, Google Scholar, IEEE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science). A total of 112 articles were included, 16 research questions were explored, and a thematic analysis was conducted. To evaluate the quality of the articles included, the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used. According to the findings, gamification and virtual reality support several pedagogical theories and approaches. Their adoption to and integration into education can enrich and transform traditional teaching and learning and were assessed positively by students and teachers. Gamification elements significantly affected students’ achievements. In comparison to traditional learning environments, gamified virtual reality learning environments were more motivating, engaging, and interactive and offered more opportunities for personalized and collaborative learning. Through the realistic and interactive experiences offered, students’ immersion and social presence can be enhanced, knowledge acquisition can be improved, and material comprehension can be facilitated. Positive changes in student attitude, behavior, and mentality as well as improved cognitive, physical, and social–emotional development were observed. When using learning environments that integrate both virtual reality and gamification, students’ learning outcomes, motivation, engagement, and self-efficacy were increased. Additionally, students’ academic performance, active involvement, and satisfaction were improved. Students’ curiosity, imagination, focus, and interest were enhanced and their skills and competences were developed. Finally, gamified virtual reality emerged as an effective educational tool that can improve learning at all educational levels, subjects, and contexts.","[{""name"": ""Georgios Lampropoulos"",

10.1007/s11165-021-10018-6,RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION,0401 Education,Translanguaging as Inclusive Pedagogical Practices in English-Medium Instruction Science and Mathematics Classrooms for Linguistically and Culturally Diverse Students,"AbstractIn English-medium instruction (EMI), English-as-a-second-language students will learn all/some subjects through English. Although there are a considerable number of studies which explore classroom interaction in Hong Kong (HK) secondary EMI schools, few studies have investigated EMI lessons which involve South Asian ethnic minorised students. These students share different linguistic and cultural backgrounds and they may not share a common first language with the teacher and other classmates. This study conducts a multimodal conversation analysis of science and mathematics lessons at a HK EMI secondary school, triangulated with interview data, in order to explore how the EMI teacher mobilises various resources to make discipline-specific knowledge accessible and cater for the different needs of all students in the classroom. This study argues that the process of enacting inclusive practices is a process of translanguaging which requires the EMI teacher to mobilise various available multilingual and semiotic resources and draw on what students know collectively for transcending cultural boundaries from the students’ everyday culture to cultures of school science and mathematics.","[{""name"": ""Kevin W.

10.1186/s12909-020-02121-5,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,The role of accreditation in 21st century health professions education: report of an International Consensus Group,"AbstractBackgroundAccreditation is considered an essential ingredient for an effective system of health professions education (HPE) globally. While accreditation systems exist in various forms worldwide, there has been little written about the contemporary enterprise of accreditation and even less about its role in improving health care outcomes.We set out to 1) identify a global, contemporary definition of accreditation in the health professions, 2) describe the relationship of educational accreditation to health care outcomes, 3) identify important questions and recurring issues in twenty-first century HPE accreditation, and 4) propose a framework of essential ingredients in present-day HPE accreditation.MethodsWe identified health professions accreditation leaders via a literature search and a Google search of HPE institutions, as well as by accessing the networks of other leaders. These leaders were invited to join an international consensus consortium to advance the scholarship and thinking about HPE accreditation. We describe the consensus findings from the International Health Professions Accreditation Outcomes Consortium (IHPAOC).ResultsWe define accreditation asthe process of formal evaluation of an educational program, institution, or system against defined standards by an external body for the purposes of quality assurance and enhancement.In the context of HPE, accreditation is distinct from other forms of program evaluation or research. Accreditation can enhance health care outcomes because of its ability to influence and standardize the quality of training programs, continuously enhance curriculum to align with population needs, and improve learning environments. We describe ten fundamental and recurring elements of accreditation systems commonly found in HPE and provide an overview of five emerging developments in accreditation in the health professions based on the consensus findings.ConclusionsAccreditation has taken on greater importance in contemporary HPE. These consensus findings provide frameworks of core elements of accreditation systems and both recurring and emerging design issues. HPE scholars, educators, and leaders can build on these frameworks to advance research, development, and operation of high-quality accreditation systems worldwide.","[{""name"": ""Jason R.

A total of 4,302 teachers completed four open-ended questions as part of a larger survey. Deductive and inductive qualitative analysis led to three themes: (a) Teachers’ Proud Moments, (b) Help! So Many Obstacles, and (c) Future Challenges. Teachers stated many successes and challenges that they experienced through the COVID-19 pandemic. Many items specifically focused on use and access to technology, student participation, and meeting students’ needs in various ways. Results can provide guidance for how to address the essential components of physical education in the online environment. In addition, results may provide insight to those who educate, train, and prepare teachers to teach in a virtual and/or physically distanced environment.","[{""name"": ""Erin Centeio"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Hawaii at Manoa""]}, {""name"": ""Kevin Mercier"", ""affiliation"": [""Adelphi University""]}, {""name"": ""Alex Garn"", ""affiliation"": [""Louisiana State University""]}, {""name"": ""Heather Erwin"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Kentucky""]}, {""name"": ""Risto Marttinen"", ""affiliation"": [""George Mason University""]}, {""name"": ""John Foley"", ""affiliation"": [""State University of New York at Cortland""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jshs.2020.05.006"", ""10.1123/jtpe.31.1.86"", ""10.1186/s12889-020-09429-3"", ""10.1177/2158244014522633"", ""10.1155/2017/3757489"", ""10.1016/j.jshs.2020.06.005"", ""10.3390/ijerph17197279"", ""10.1123/kr.2019-0003"", ""10.1177/0031721720970702"", ""10.1177/1559827609331562"", ""10.1080/02701367.2014.931203"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2020-0272"", ""10.1080/07303084.2012.10598727"", ""10.1080/17408989.2018.1455820"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2017-0084"", ""10.1080/02701367.2013.844018"", ""10.1002/oby.22813"", ""10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.1133"", ""10.1016/j.pcad.2020.04.013""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0403 体育学', 0.7413), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7214)]]"

This article provides results for a three‐level random‐effects meta‐analysis examining the average effect of the COVID‐19‐related school closures with respect to several moderator variables. The results showed a robust average effect of , . The moderator analysis was largely insignificant; however, the results tentatively point out that younger students in schools were more negatively affected compared to older students, and that the negative effect reduced with subsequent lockdowns in autumn and winter 2020/2021. The results are discussed with respect to potential explanations.","[{""name"": ""Christoph König"", ""affiliation"": [""Goethe University Frankfurt""]}, {""name"": ""Andreas Frey"", ""affiliation"": [""Goethe University Frankfurt""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2021.102480"", ""10.4324/9780203771587"", ""10.31244/9783830993315.03"", ""10.31235/osf.io/ve4z7"", ""10.1080/00220671.2021.1930986"", ""10.1007/s13384-021-00436-w"", ""10.3138/cpp.2020-055"", ""10.26481/umaror.2021009"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.746289"", ""10.1007/s11618-021-01000-z"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2020.102326"", ""10.3102/0013189X20965918"", ""10.1027/1614-2241.1.3.86"", ""10.1080/00273171.2016.1167008"", ""10.31234/osf.io/8un6x"", ""10.1080/07350015.2016.1247004"", ""10.31234/osf.io/pqtgf"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0255629"", ""10.1136/bmj.i4919"", ""10.31234/osf.io/fr2v8"", ""10.18637/jss.v036.i03"", ""10.3390/educsci11060252""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

We have witnessed many innovative uses of ChatGPT in STEM classrooms. However, studies regarding students’ perceptions of ChatGPT as a virtual tutoring tool in STEM education are rare. The current study investigated undergraduate students’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in a physics class as an assistant tool for addressing physics questions. Specifically, the study examined the accuracy of ChatGPT in answering physics questions, the relationship between students’ ChatGPT trust levels and answer accuracy, and the influence of trust on students’ perceptions of ChatGPT. Our finding indicates that despite the inaccuracy of GenAI in question answering, most students trust its ability to provide correct answers. Trust in GenAI is also associated with students’ perceptions of GenAI. In addition, this study sheds light on students’ misconceptions toward GenAI and provides suggestions for future considerations in AI literacy teaching and research.","[{""name"": ""Lu Ding"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tong Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shiyan Jiang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Gapud"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jcps.2011.11.012"", ""10.30935/cedtech/13152"", ""10.1007/s12369-014-0263-x"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4312358"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4337484"", ""10.1002/mar.21532"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100143"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2021.795284"", ""10.30935/cedtech/13176"", ""10.3390/healthcare11091298"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00411-8"", ""10.1016/j.patter.2022.100676"", ""10.1016/j.ipm.2022.102940"", ""10.1002/sce.3730740504"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1037/0033-295x.114.4.864"", ""10.17220/mojet.2018.03.005"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4627814"", ""10.1111/j.1949-8594.2002.tb18217.x"", ""10.3390/healthcare10040723"", ""10.5465/annals.2018.0057"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2018.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.004"", ""10.1007/s40593-015-0086-4"", ""10.1016/j.swevo.2016.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004"", ""10.1016/S0361-476X(02)00012-7"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2023.102274"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-11600-3"", ""10.2307/2529310"", ""10.1145/3531146.3533182"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100790"", ""10.3390/educsci13040410"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2021.664"", ""10.1037/a0031955"", ""10.3758/s13428-012-0258-1"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100095"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4354422"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.06450"", ""10.35542/osf.io/dzqju"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2022.103537"", ""10.1177/10776958221149577"", ""10.1002/mar.21813"", ""10.1109/EDUCON54358.2023.10125121"", ""10.1111/bjet.12994"", ""10.1007/s10956-015-9592-2"", ""10.1108/JEIM-01-2022-0025"", ""10.3390/healthcare11060887"", ""10.54855/acoj.231417"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls0302_1"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2023.100752"", ""10.1145/3490099.3511119"", ""10.1145/3290605.3300768""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The survey for this study was created by a library student team and vetted through focus groups. A total of 2555 students participated in the survey. Results showed that only 7% of students who responded had not heard of any GAI technologies, whilst over half had used or considered using these for academic purposes. The majority of students (54.1%) were supportive or somewhat supportive of using tools such as Grammarly, but 70.4% were unsupportive or somewhat unsupportive towards students using tools such as ChatGPT to write their whole essay. Students who had higher levels of confidence in their academic writing were less likely to use or consider using them for academic purposes, and were also less likely to be supportive of other students using them. Most students (41.1%) also thought there should be a university wide policy on when these technologies are or are not appropriate to use. The results of this research suggest that students require clear policies on the use of GAI and that these technologies should not be banned from university, but consideration must be made to ensure different groups of students have equal access to the technologies.","[{""name"": ""Heather Johnston"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rebecca F.

Exploring relationships between science capital and technology, engineering, and maths aspirations and attitudes among young people aged 17/18","AbstractWe previously proposed that science capital (science‐related forms of cultural and social capital) can be used as a theoretical lens for explaining the patterned nature of aspirations and educational participation among young people aged 11–16. Building on these findings, the present article investigates whether science capital is related to post‐18 aspirations to pursue further STEM study and whether science capital can be extended to related disciplines including engineering, maths and technology. Specifically, we report on correlational analyses exploring the relationships between science, technology, engineering and maths attitudes and science capital. Drawing on data from a new survey of 7,013 17/18 year old English secondary school students, analyses showed that science capital, while strongly related to engineering and physical science future study aspirations, was not strongly related to the pursuit of either maths or technology postsecondary study. The findings also suggest that engineering and maths attitudes have a stronger relationship to science capital than attitudes relating to technology. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings and propose that science capital might be more usefully applied to “SEM,” with links to technology fields and aspirations needing further exploration.","[{""name"": ""Julie Moote"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London, Institute of Education  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Louise Archer"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London, Institute of Education  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Jennifer DeWitt"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London, Institute of Education  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Emily MacLeod"", ""affiliation"": [""University College London, Institute of Education  London UK""]}]","[""10.1002/tea.21227"", ""10.4324/9781315761077"", ""10.1002/sce.20399"", ""10.3102/0002831211433290"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41933-2_2"", ""10.1093/teamat/hrw016"", ""10.1007/s10649-009-9217-x"", ""10.1080/14794800801915814"", ""10.1080/00131946.2017.1369082"", ""10.1177/0963662516678351"", ""10.1525/sp.2003.50.1.136"", ""10.1080/01425692.2016.1245129"", ""10.1590/0103-6513.220516"", ""10.1080/09500693.2019.1708510"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2006.tb00886.x"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1071899"", ""10.1080/09500693.2016.1248520"", ""10.1080/09500693.2013.871659"", ""10.1080/09500693.2011.608197"", ""10.1080/03043790500430185"", ""10.1177/0361684313480694"", ""10.1080/21548455.2017.1423128"", ""10.1177/0306312717692172"", ""10.1615/JWomenMinorScienEng.v12.i2-3.50"", ""10.1002/jee.20118"", ""10.1080/09500693.2016.1188332"", ""10.1080/02671520802048687"", ""10.1073/pnas.0403723101"", ""10.1111/j.1549-0831.2001.tb00054.x"", ""10.1146/annurev.so.21.080195.000401"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2009.tb01003.x"", ""10.1525/sop.2009.52.2.185"", ""10.1080/0954025042000301465"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00017.x"", ""10.1080/02671522.2019.1678062"", ""10.1002/jee.20302"", ""10.1080/03054985.2013.840279"", ""10.1080/14926156.2016.1235743"", ""10.1080/09500693.2018.1433896"", ""10.12973/ejmste/75396"", ""10.1080/0950069032000032199"", ""10.1002/jee.20060"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1013075"", ""10.1007/s11422-009-9184-7"", ""10.1177/030631277200200402"", ""10.1002/berj.3150"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2017.08.002"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2010.502886"", ""10.1080/00131911003637014"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2006.tb00875.x"", ""10.56021/9780801839740"", ""10.1080/14794802.2016.1141113"", ""10.1080/08993408.2017.1292604"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2017.1325443"", ""10.1177/0963662513505397"", ""10.1080/1361332052000341006""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Safety Research']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1111/jcal.12493,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,STEM learning attitude predicts computational thinking skills among primary school students,"AbstractComputational thinking (CT) plays a vital role in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). However, whether students' learning attitude towards STEM is related to their CT skills remains unknown. Two studies were conducted to address this knowledge gap. In Study 1, we validated a newly developed STEM learning attitude scale among a sample of Chinese primary school students (N = 489). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results revealed that the scale which consisted of three factors (mathematics, science and information technology) could sufficiently measure primary school students' STEM learning attitude in the current sample. In Study 2, we explored the association between students' STEM learning attitude and their CT skills. Evidence revealed that learning attitude towards STEM significantly predicted CT skills. We also found that girls had a more positive learning attitude towards STEM than boys, and the fourth grade might be the key period for the development of CT skills. Implications for promoting primary school students' STEM learning and CT skills were also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Lihui Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education Tianjin University  Tianjin 300354 China""]}, {""name"": ""Linlin Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education Tianjin University  Tianjin 300354 China""]}, {""name"": ""Weipeng Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""S R Nathan School of Human Development Singapore University of Social Sciences  Singapore 599494 Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Danhua Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education Tianjin University  Tianjin 300354 China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoqian Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education Tianjin University  Tianjin 300354 China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2019.106185"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.018"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.09.223"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2015.10.008"", ""10.1145/1929887.1929905"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.10.020"", ""10.1002/yd.377"", ""10.1145/2602484"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.03.001"", ""10.1177/0956797617735528"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103613"", ""10.1111/cdev.13139"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46747-4_3"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11740.001.0001"", ""10.1186/2193-1801-2-222"", ""10.1177/1094428108323758"", ""10.1145/2829875.2829904"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.4.3.272"", ""10.1007/s11199-007-9348-4"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.069"", ""10.3102/0013189X12463051"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.004"", ""10.1109/MIM.2018.8360917"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.005"", ""10.9708/jksci.2015.20.12.181"", ""10.1007/s10956-019-09803-w"", ""10.1007/s10956-019-09802-x"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9628-2"", ""10.1002/9780470479193"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2015.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103759"", ""10.1016/j.jecp.2017.03.013"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103832"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.05.015"", ""10.1007/BF00191473"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2017.03.014"", ""10.2466/pr0.100.2.375-378"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-6528-7_6"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.08.047"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0080-z"", ""10.19030/cier.v9i1.9547"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.761"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103798"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.11.025"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.08.013"", ""10.1145/1118178.1118215"", ""10.1111/jcal.12348"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103633""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The majority of patients have nonimmune causes driving the refractoriness, such as bleeding, medications, or diffuse intravascular coagulation; however, this article is dedicated to the diagnosis and support of patients with immune-based platelet refractoriness. Antibodies to class I HLA molecules (A and B alleles) are responsible for most immune-based refractory cases, with antibodies to platelet antigens seen much less frequently. Patients may be supported with either crossmatch-compatible or HLA-matched/compatible platelet units. When trying to select HLA units it can be difficult to find a perfect “4 of 4” match for the patient’s class IA and IB alleles. In these cases, it is better to use the antibody specificity prediction method, which identifies compatible units that lack antigens recognized by the patient’s anti-HLA antibodies. For an algorithmic approach to the patient with platelet refractoriness, see Visual Abstract.","[{""name"": ""Claudia S.

However, with alternating current (AC) pulse and huge inherent impedance, the TENGs usually exhibit low‐energy supply efficiency when either powering conventional electronics or charging energy storage devices directly. Efficient power management has always been a technical bottleneck for the TENGs toward practical applications in self‐powered microsystems. Over the past years, several strategies of power management have been proposed, such as rectification, electromagnetic transformation, capacitive transformation, and direct current (DC) conversion, which can be used for voltage regulation, impedance matching, and efficiency improvement for electronics. Herein, the recent advances on power management for TENGs are systematically reviewed and analyzed, which has exhibited manageable triboelectric power by electronics as an important research issue of TENGs. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives in this field are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Chunlong Fang"", ""affiliation"": [""CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience Beijing Key Laboratory of Micro-nano Energy and Sensor Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems Chinese Academy of Sciences  Beijing 100083 P.

Thus, we aimed to measure the effectiveness of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as medical students’ preferences regarding e-learning and classroom teaching, and the possibility of applying it post-pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional online survey of medical students (N = 376) in six medical schools was carried out after their second semester, from August 15 to 20, 2020. Ten parameters were measured for the effectiveness of e-learning based on a 5-point Likert-scale and five parameters were measured for satisfaction. Results e-learning was more or equally effective in four parameters such as assignment submission and meeting individual needs, but less effective in six parameters, including building skills and knowledge, and interaction level. Satisfaction was either high or neutral in all five parameters. Conclusions Our findings have shown that e-learning can assist the teaching process in medical schools in some respects, but cannot be used for the entire teaching process.","[{""name"": ""Abdullh AlQhtani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nasser AlSwedan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdullelah Almulhim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raghad Aladwan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yara Alessa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kholoud AlQhtani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Malak Albogami"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Khalid Altwairqi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fahad Alotaibi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdulmajeed AlHadlaq"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Osama Aldhafian"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30073-6"", ""10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055"", ""10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2785"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-12-1"", ""10.1016/j.cmpb.2006.03.005"", ""10.1097/00001888-200603000-00002"", ""10.1001/jama.300.10.1181"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1240-0"", ""10.5455/njppp.2020.10.04096202028042020"", ""10.1016/s0260-6917(98)80038-5"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2003.02960.x"", ""10.3163/1536-5050.96.3.007"", ""10.2196/16504"", ""10.2196/20963"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042378""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

This study utilized tenets found in disability critical race theory (DisCrit) and inclusive school leadership literature to examine the perceptions, practices, and challenges associated with meaningful change in inclusive schools. Purpose: The purpose of this article was to understand how six elementary school principals, identified as effective inclusive leaders, perceived students with disabilities within a low-income Mexican American immigrant community along the U.S.–Mexico border. Findings: Our study highlights the important role principals play in creating inclusive schools and the ways in which race, disability, family background, language, and immigration status effect principals in their efforts to promote inclusion. While each principal recognized the noted factors above and confronted a multitude of challenges, they differed in their beliefs and approaches to creating inclusive schools. Some leadership practices were aligned to research focused on effective school leadership while others more closely resembled social justice leadership practices.

10.1186/s40594-020-00254-z,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,How to foster the formation of STEM identity: studying diversity in an authentic learning environment,"AbstractBackgroundSTEM identity has been shown to have a powerful role in an individual’s success in educational environments, as well as on their career goals and trajectories. Historically, however, STEM identity formation for underrepresented students has been hampered by the lack of representation of in STEM fields, which predominantly consist of white males. One educational challenge is diversifying STEM classrooms, both in terms of the students themselves and also in terms of the science and scientists they learn about.MethodsWe piloted a 4-credit History, Philosophy, and Sociology of Science course at Michigan State University. Students were tasked with creating exhibits focused on themes of diversity and inclusion in science for a real client. Using a STEM identity survey, we assessed students’ attitudes towards the sciences, issues of diversity in science, and their sense of belonging to their educational communities. We also had the students respond to various short-answer questions throughout the semester to better understand their experiences working on a collaborative authentic learning task.ResultsOur results suggest that authentic learning experiences based around ideas of diversity and inclusion can help students develop sense of belonging and positive STEM identities. Students demonstrated shifts in their self-identities as scientists, focusing more on the intersection between their gender, ethnicity, and self-perception as a scientist. Through qualitative analysis of short-answer questions, we were able to ascertain that working in groups in an authentic learning environment helped the students improve their communication and collaboration skills.ConclusionsStudents’ increased focus on gender and ethnicity suggests that they are thinking critically about how their personal identities intersect with their scientific identities. Additional research would help us better understand if the coupling of authentic learning and inclusive teaching practices have significant impacts on the formation of students’ STEM identities.","[{""name"": ""Alison Singer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Georgina Montgomery"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shannon Schmoll"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/tea.21465"", ""10.1038/s41561-018-0116-6"", ""10.2307/2579670"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06468-0"", ""10.3102/0013189X019005002"", ""10.1002/tea.20237"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01710.x"", ""10.1080/1047840X.2011.607313"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0215795"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls0504_3"", ""10.1073/pnas.1319030111"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0187285"", ""10.1037/a0029691"", ""10.1007/BF02319856"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_32"", ""10.1108/JME-06-2016-0035"", ""10.1007/s11165-012-9345-7"", ""10.1177/160940690900800305"", ""10.1002/ir.357"", ""10.1353/csd.2012.0028"", ""10.1353/csd.2007.0054"", ""10.1007/s11162-005-2966-1"", ""10.1177/019263659608058409"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0150-3"", ""10.1187/cbe.16-01-0062"", ""10.1080/0161956X.2014.913451"", ""10.2505/4/jcst18_048_01_68"", ""10.1002/tea.21417"", ""10.1037/a0034027"", ""10.1126/science.aai9054"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0115-6"", ""10.1007/s11218-013-9218-6"", ""10.1177/1046496412453622"", ""10.1007/s41979-020-00034-y"", ""10.1080/15313220.2015.1059306"", ""10.1037/a0021385"", ""10.4324/9780203118924"", ""10.1615/JWomenMinorScienEng.v5.i4.60"", ""10.1126/science.1198364"", ""10.1353/csd.2005.0069""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Safety Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Stress, Depression, and Coping in Undergraduate Medical Students","Abstract Objectives Up to 90% of medical students experience stress. Studies have observed a relationship between stress and depression. Coping strategies to deal with stress and depression are of great interest. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of stress and depression and the efficacy of coping strategies in undergraduate medical students. Methods This survey was conducted with 589 second-year and sixth-year students in 2017 at the Medical University of Vienna. The questionnaire included a stress and coping questionnaire, depression screening, substance use questionnaire, and questionnaire concerning leisure time activities. Results The coping strategies were included in a regression model to assess their predictive value for stress and depression screening scores. The most common stressor was performance pressure overload (92.1%). Overall, 52.4% of the participating students reached critical scores in the depression screening. Positive thinking and active coping were associated with lower stress scores. Positive thinking also was a protective factor against depressive symptoms. Less than 2% of all students reached high-risk values for substance use. Conclusion Accessible counseling for students in need of psychological care should be provided. Different interventions of positive psychology showed a positive impact on depression screening scores.","[{""name"": ""Verena Steiner-Hofbauer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anita Holzinger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4103/1947-2714.177299"", ""10.1097/00001888-200604000-00009"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2003.01405.x"", ""10.1007/s40596-015-0413-y"", ""10.1055/s-0031-1280544"", ""10.1155/2014/737382"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2005.02176.x"", ""10.3390/ijerph120911072"", ""10.1023/A:1014576505223"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0114967"", ""10.1007/s11136-010-9754-x"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00491.x"", ""10.1016/j.addbeh.2006.05.017"", ""10.1016/S0376-8716(01)00128-4"", ""10.15288/jsa.2002.63.486"", ""10.1177/2165079915570917"", ""10.1093/occmed/kqn081"", ""10.1177/014662167700100306"", ""10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.02114.x"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.17324"", ""10.1007/s00115-010-3039-z"", ""10.1177/1403494813503055"", ""10.1186/1477-7525-8-66"", ""10.4103/0253-7176.85392"", ""10.1007/s10964-015-0395-9"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03754.x"", ""10.1007/s40596-016-0526-y"", ""10.1007/s40596-014-0189-5"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-13-119"", ""10.1007/s10943-011-9555-8"", ""10.1080/10872981.2018.1535738"", ""10.1080/10872981.2017.1392824"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001138"", ""10.1007/s00608-016-0392-6"", ""10.1007/s40596-018-0926-2"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S137384""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02381-1,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,How much is needed? Patient exposure and curricular education on medical students' LGBT cultural competency,"AbstractBackgroundFor medical students, providing exposure to and education about the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) patient population are effective methods to increase comfort, knowledge, and confidence in caring for LGBT people. However, specific recommendations on the number of patient exposures and educational hours that relate to high LGBT cultural competency are lacking.MethodsMedical students (N = 940) at three universities across the United States completed a survey consisting of demographics, experiential variables (i.e., number of LGBT patients and LGBT hours), and the 7-point Likert LGBT-Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS). LGBT-DOCSS scores were stratified by 1-point increments, and experiential variable means were computed per each stratification to characterize the mean LGBT patients and hours of medical students with higher scores and those with lower scores.ResultsMedical students reported caring for some LGBT patients annually (M = 6.02, SD = 20.33) and receiving a low number of annual LGBT curricular hours (M = 2.22, SD = 2.85) and moderate number of annual LGBT extracurricular hours (M = 6.93, SD = 24.97). They also reported very high attitudinal awareness (M = 6.54, SD = 0.86), moderate knowledge (M = 5.73, SD = 1.01), and low clinical preparedness (M = 3.82, SD = 1.25). Medical students who cared for 35 or more LGBT patients and received 35 or more LGBT total hours reported significantly higher preparedness and knowledge.ConclusionsMedical students have shortcomings in LGBT cultural competency and limited LGBT patient exposure and education. To improve LGBT cultural competency, medical schools and accrediting bodies should consider providing medical students with at least a total of 35 LGBT patient contacts and 35 LGBT education hours (10 h of required curricular education and 25 h of supplemental education).","[{""name"": ""Dustin Z.

10.1002/ase.2036,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,Gross Anatomy Education in China during the Covid-19 Pandemic: A National Survey,"The Covid‐19 pandemic launched the use of online courses in Chinese medical schools during February 2020. To evaluate the state of gross anatomy education in China during the pandemic, a nationwide survey was conducted through convenience sampling by email or respondent invitations on social media. A total of 359 questionnaires were received from the respondents. The first response from a given school was included in the study to represent that school, thus, 77 questionnaires were used for analyses. Schools represented were from all provinces in mainland China as well as Hong Kong and Macao. The survey found that before the pandemic, 74.0% and 33.8% of the 77 schools conducted online theoretical and practical sessions, respectively, on gross anatomy, and 36 (46.8% of 77) had temporarily suspended practical sessions at the time the survey was conducted. Body donation programs were also affected with 26.0% and 27.3% of the 77 schools having suspended donation programs or saw a decreased number of donations. During the pandemic, 40.3% of the 77 schools kept or initiated the implementation of active learning, and online assessment was continued in 49.4% of the 77 medical schools. Another 26 (33.8%) schools initiated online assessment during the pandemic.

10.1182/hematology.2022000388,HEMATOLOGY-AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY EDUCATION PROGRAM,0401 Education; 1002 Clinical Medicine,Gene therapy for hemophilia,"Abstract The cloning of the factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) genes in the 1980s has led to a succession of clinical advances starting with the advent of molecular diagnostic for hemophilia, followed by the development of recombinant clotting factor replacement therapy. Now gene therapy beckons on the back of decades of research that has brought us to the final stages of the approval of 2 products in Europe and United States, thus heralding a new era in the treatment of the hemophilias. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec, the first gene therapy for treatment of hemophilia A, has been granted conditional marketing authorization in Europe. Another approach (etranacogene dezaparvovec, AMT-061) for hemophilia B is also under review by regulators. There are several other gene therapy approaches in earlier stages of development. These approaches entail a one-off infusion of a genetically modified adeno-associated virus (AAV) engineered to deliver either the FVIII or FIX gene to the liver, leading to the continuous endogenous synthesis and secretion of the missing coagulation factor into the circulation by the hepatocytes, thus preventing or reducing bleeding episodes. Ongoing observations show sustained clinical benefit of gene therapy for &amp;gt;5 years following a single administration of an AAV vector without long-lasting or late toxicities. An asymptomatic, self-limiting, immune-mediated rise in alanine aminotransferase is commonly observed within the first 12 months after gene transfer that has the potential to eliminate the transduced hepatocytes in the absence of treatment with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids. The current state of this exciting and rapidly evolving field, as well as the challenges that need to be overcome for the widespread adaptation of this new treatment paradigm, is the subject of this review.","[{""name"": ""Amit C.

10.1186/s41239-024-00455-4,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Feedback sources in essay writing: peer-generated or AI-generated feedback?,"AbstractPeer feedback is introduced as an effective learning strategy, especially in large-size classes where teachers face high workloads. However, for complex tasks such as writing an argumentative essay, without support peers may not provide high-quality feedback since it requires a high level of cognitive processing, critical thinking skills, and a deep understanding of the subject. With the promising developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly after the emergence of ChatGPT, there is a global argument that whether AI tools can be seen as a new source of feedback or not for complex tasks. The answer to this question is not completely clear yet as there are limited studies and our understanding remains constrained. In this study, we used ChatGPT as a source of feedback for students’ argumentative essay writing tasks and we compared the quality of ChatGPT-generated feedback with peer feedback. The participant pool consisted of 74 graduate students from a Dutch university. The study unfolded in two phases: firstly, students’ essay data were collected as they composed essays on one of the given topics; subsequently, peer feedback and ChatGPT-generated feedback data were collected through engaging peers in a feedback process and using ChatGPT as a feedback source. Two coding schemes including coding schemes for essay analysis and coding schemes for feedback analysis were used to measure the quality of essays and feedback. Then, a MANOVA analysis was employed to determine any distinctions between the feedback generated by peers and ChatGPT. Additionally, Spearman’s correlation was utilized to explore potential links between the essay quality and the feedback generated by peers and ChatGPT. The results showed a significant difference between feedback generated by ChatGPT and peers. While ChatGPT provided more descriptive feedback including information about how the essay is written, peers provided feedback including information about identification of the problem in the essay. The overarching look at the results suggests a potential complementary role for ChatGPT and students in the feedback process. Regarding the relationship between the quality of essays and the quality of the feedback provided by ChatGPT and peers, we found no overall significant relationship. These findings imply that the quality of the essays does not impact both ChatGPT and peer feedback quality. The implications of this study are valuable, shedding light on the prospective use of ChatGPT as a feedback source, particularly for complex tasks like argumentative essay writing. We discussed the findings and delved into the implications for future research and practical applications in educational contexts.","[{""name"": ""Seyyed Kazem Banihashem"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nafiseh Taghizadeh Kerman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Omid Noroozi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jewoong Moon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hendrik Drachsler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10212-017-0342-0"", ""10.1080/17501229.2019.1654482"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2022.100489"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2023.2255301"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125873"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00436-z"", ""10.12928/eltej.v4i1.2371"", ""10.1007/s11409-015-9142-6"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2304.08191"", ""10.35542/osf.io/hcgzj"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2023.104967"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104094"", ""10.1007/s10763-014-9561-x"", ""10.25656/01:26787"", ""10.1111/jcal.121352"", ""10.1080/02602938.2020.1764490"", ""10.1080/14703297.2023.2195846"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.697045"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2023.100588"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.07.012"", ""10.1007/s40593-023-00387-6"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.17763/haer.69.1.pl5m5083286l77t2"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2022.104684"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2305.11882"", ""10.1080/10494820.2022.2093914"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-12273-8"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip4101_6"", ""10.1177/004005990403600608"", ""10.3389/frai.2021.622364"", ""10.1007/s11409-010-9056-2"", ""10.1080/00220671.2018.1514357"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1799032"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00968.x"", ""10.1080/13562510600680582"", ""10.24256/ideas.v8i1.1344"", ""10.1007/s11251-008-9053-x"", ""10.1080/10494820.2022.2034887"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.05.002"", ""10.1007/s10639-023-11683-y"", ""10.2307/jeductechsoci.17.4.49"", ""10.1111/bjet.12592"", ""10.1037/edu0000103"", ""10.4324/9780203507711"", ""10.1016/j.iotcps.2023.04.003"", ""10.1007/s40593-016-0102-3"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2019.01.004"", ""10.1080/10494820.2023.2215822"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2302.11382"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2019.101826"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100118"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0"", ""10.1016/j.asw.2021.100586"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2302.13793""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1108/ET-05-2021-0173,EDUCATION AND TRAINING,0401 Education,Exploring the link between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intentions: the moderating role of educational fields,"PurposeThe purpose of this research is to integrate the prediction from entrepreneurship education with the theory of planned behaviors (TPB) to build a conceptual framework and estimate the effect of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial intention over and above key predictors from an extended TPB model. Also, the moderating impacts of educational fields in the paths from entrepreneurial education, attitude toward entrepreneurship, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control to entrepreneurial intention are tested in this study.Design/methodology/approachThe study used a sample of 559 university students who received entrepreneurship education at 12 universities from Vietnam. Confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to test the validity and reliability of all variables and regression analyses were used to estimate coefficient paths. Then, bootstrapping method with the PROCESS approach was utilized to test the indirect correlations.FindingsThe study reveals that attitude toward entrepreneurship and perceived behavioral control were positively and strongly associated with entrepreneurial intention, while the linkage between subjective norms and entrepreneurial intention was not significant. Also, the findings show that even though entrepreneurship education did not have a direct effect on entrepreneurial intention, it increased entrepreneurial intention via attitude toward entrepreneurship and perceived behavioral control. In addition, this study finds that educational fields moderate the associations between predictors and entrepreneurial intention.Practical implicationsThis study offers both universities and policymakers options to foster youths' entrepreneurial activities.Originality/valueThis study is expected to significantly contribute to entrepreneurship literature by enriching our understanding of the interesting and crucial linkages between entrepreneurship education, attitude toward entrepreneurship, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and entrepreneurial intention. Additionally, the current research reveals that for economic and business management students, the paths are driven from entrepreneurial education, attitude toward entrepreneurship, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control to intention to engage in entrepreneurial activities has become stronger when compared to students of majors in engineering and others.","[{""name"": ""Cong Doanh Duong"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1504/IJESB.2015.068775"", ""10.1002/hbe2.195"", ""10.1108/ET-04-2020-0096"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2020.100379"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2020.100450"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2016-0024"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06381"", ""10.1108/APJBA-05-2021-0200"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2021.100458"", ""10.1007/s11365-016-0389-4"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.06.010"", ""10.1108/ET-09-2018-0194"", ""10.1108/03090590610715022"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.11.024"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.11.088"", ""10.1177/1069072717714541"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.11.069"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2020-0033"", ""10.1108/ET-05-2020-0142"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.5465/amle.2017.0079"", ""10.1177/104225870002400301"", ""10.1080/08985629300000020"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-04-2018-0236"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.10.026"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00318.x"", ""10.1007/s11365-011-0199-7"", ""10.1177/2158244020933877"", ""10.1108/ET-02-2021-0074"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1060.0597"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2015.11.006"", ""10.1108/00400910610710119"", ""10.1108/14626000810871745"", ""10.3390/educsci10090257"", ""10.1111/j.1540-627X.2010.00314.x"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.01.039"", ""10.1108/JED-10-2019-0044"", ""10.1007/s40299-018-0399-9"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.11.005"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1365359"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2020.103474"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2009.08.002"", ""10.1108/ET-01-2019-0005"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.09.051"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12116"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.3758/BF03206553"", ""10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104379"", ""10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.154"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12025"", ""10.1177/2393957514555255"", ""10.1108/00400911311309314"", ""10.1016/S0148-2963(03)00040-7"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-09-2016-0299"", ""10.1016/j.ijme.2019.100333"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2015.10.003"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.132.2.249"", ""10.1016/j.jik.2016.01.005"", ""10.1177/0266242615612534""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"
10.1186/s40594-020-00209-4,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Effects of school climate and teacher self-efficacy on job satisfaction of mostly STEM teachers: a structural multigroup invariance approach,"Abstract Background Identification and retention of effective teachers in STEM education play cardinal roles in teacher recruitment exercises worldwide. Studies on factors that characterize effective teachers have therefore gained popularity in recent times. Teacher self-efficacy, job satisfaction and school climate are among other factors that have attracted global attention. Thus, proper understanding of the relations between these factors is equally important. The purpose of this study is to validate and cross-validate a model of direct/indirect effects of school climate and teacher self-efficacy on job satisfaction. Results The data used for the current study are extracted from a publicly available data of Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2018 survey. Structural equation modeling approach was used in the analyses coupled with robust maximum likelihood to ensure accurate estimations in the models. The results of the validated models show a strong direct impact of school climate on job satisfaction, a direct impact of teacher self-efficacy on job satisfaction and a mediating effect of teacher self-efficacy between school climate and job satisfaction. This model exhibits structural invariance in factor loadings, intercepts and regression weights across two independent samples from a population of 3951 lower secondary school teachers in Norway. Conclusion The findings of this study do provide empirical evidence for the relations between teacher self-efficacy, job satisfaction and school climate among Norwegian lower secondary school teachers. The cross-validation of these relations was also established using an independent sample to enhance generalization of the findings. Two methodological observations concerning recoding of some items as well as an addition of item cross-loading in the measurement model of the job satisfaction scales are raised and addressed. It is therefore recommended that researchers who will be using TALIS 2018 data should take note of these observations.","[{""name"": ""Yusuf F.

The role of age, gender and degree background","Purpose Considering entrepreneurship education (EE) theory as a base, this paper aims to examine the impact of EE upon building entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, it investigates the impact of student’s age, gender and degree or course background in developing students entrepreneurial intentions. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 309 student respondents from higher education institution (HEI’s) was used to understand the relationship and its impact over intention building. Regression and ANOVA technique was used to understand the cause and effect as well as mean differences between the construct. Findings The results signify a positive impact of EE for stimulating the start-up intention in these interdisciplinary students of HEIs. These results resemble the existing studies in this endeavour. Findings also verify that individual intention to start a new business in terms of the theory of planned behaviour (attitude, perceived behavioural control and social norms), student background (gender and degree specialization) are positively related to individual intention to start a new business. Research limitations/implications The results confirm previous studies in this field and highlight the need for EE in HEI. The paper highlights the vitality for EE for India’s start-up growth. Originality/value This study adds to the paucity of research on EE and its impact on entrepreneurial intentions in higher education institutions in India.","[{""name"": ""Zahoor Ahmad Paray"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sumit Kumar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/s40497-017-0073-3"", ""10.1108/14626001211250180"", ""10.1111/etap.12095"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.495"", ""10.1142/S1084946711001768"", ""10.1108/00400910410569579"", ""10.1108/03090591211220339"", ""10.1177/104225879101500406"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12019"", ""10.1108/00400910210449231"", ""10.1016/0883-9026(95)00037-9"", ""10.1177/0971355713513346"", ""10.1108/EJTD-02-2013-0019"", ""10.1108/00400911111147686"", ""10.1108/ET-01-2015-0004"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12137"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(02)00098-8"", ""10.1111/etap.12056"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.008"", ""10.1177/104225879401800307"", ""10.1007/s11365-005-6674-2"", ""10.1007/s11365-006-0003-2"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00318.x"", ""10.1142/S0218495813500064"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2015.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.11.135"", ""10.1108/14626000810871745"", ""10.1108/JEEE-12-2014-0053"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1177716"", ""10.1016/j.jik.2016.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2009.08.002"", ""10.1108/00400911011088926"", ""10.1046/j.1540-6520.2003.00035.x"", ""10.1177/0266242607080656"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2006.05.002"", ""10.1108/02683941211235373"", ""10.5296/jmr.v6i2.5444"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-3319-3_9"", ""10.1016/j.joep.2011.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2010.02.015"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00427.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2007.00179.x"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.09.093"", ""10.1007/s11365-012-0246-z"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.90.6.1265"", ""10.22215/timreview/817"", ""10.1108/ET-12-2014-0149"", ""10.5465/amr.1988.4306970"", ""10.1177/0266242611432360"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2014.12.020"", ""10.1108/13552551011020063"", ""10.1016/S1697-2600(14)70040-7"", ""10.1504/IJESB.2013.054310"", ""10.1177/104225879602100104"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2007.00177.x"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(02)00112-X"", ""10.2139/ssrn.856227"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2008.10.005"", ""10.1080/13594320701595438"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12025"", ""10.5465/amr.2011.0078"", ""10.1207/S15327752JPA8001_18"", ""10.1108/03090590910939049"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2010.04.001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Business and International Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)]]"

Calls from national agencies look to increase computation in STEM education. This review identifies key areas for future study by reviewing recent empirical studies that investigate computational thinking in teaching and learning contexts within higher education. Using a systematic process, this review identified four different databases for peer‐reviewed research articles using keywords. Results were evaluated against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were analyzed for types of methods, target population, the role of computational thinking, pedagogical designs used, and significant findings of the study. This process resulted in a final set of 13 studies. The results indicate that computational thinking research in higher education is growing, yet there are opportunities for more research. The findings of this study highlight the need for more concrete definitions and implementations of computational thinking within higher education spaces.","[{""name"": ""Joseph A.

We address research questions focused on (a) the characteristics of studies using CCW in STEM education, (b) examples of the six types of capital (aspirational, linguistic, familial, navigational, social, and resistant) in STEM educational settings, and (c) gaps and opportunities in how CCW is being applied in STEM education.Design/MethodWe identified 33 dissertations, theses, journal articles, and conference papers using systematic review procedures. To qualify, each study must present empirical data and include at least one type of CCW capital in its results or discussion. We coded study characteristics, such as methods, participant populations, and research setting. We qualitatively analyzed each of the six types of CCW capital.ResultsStudies tended to focus on higher education settings, engineering, and qualitative methods, particularly student interviews. We identified several specific engineering‐relevant examples of assets for each type of capital. Future work should collect data from faculty, staff, and family members identified in several studies as important to CCW in addition to foregrounding student voices.ConclusionsIn synthesizing existing studies, this review provides insight into how an assets‐based framework is being interpreted and provides a foundation for more assets‐based perspectives in future engineering education work.","[{""name"": ""Maya Denton"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Engineering Education University of Texas at Austin  Austin Texas USA""]}, {""name"": ""Maura Borrego"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Engineering Education University of Texas at Austin  Austin Texas USA""]}, {""name"": ""Audrey Boklage"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Engineering Education University of Texas at Austin  Austin Texas USA""]}]","[""10.1007/s11422-013-9512-9"", ""10.1002/he.190"", ""10.1002/jee.20038"", ""10.1002/jee.20069"", ""10.1187/cbe.15-07-0155"", ""10.1037/a0018608"", ""10.18260/p.24404"", ""10.1353/jhe.2011.0006"", ""10.1109/FIE.2015.7344119"", ""10.4159/9780674056367"", ""10.1598/RRQ.43.2.3"", ""10.3102/0013189X032005019"", ""10.1002/ir.362"", ""10.20853/32-3-2575"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(85)90062-8"", ""10.1007/s10734-010-9394-7"", ""10.1002/tea.21485"", ""10.18260/p.27087"", ""10.1080/10668926.2018.1484823"", ""10.1080/00405849209543534"", ""10.1007/s11422-013-9520-9"", ""10.1002/9780470754887"", ""10.1177/1538192717719132"", ""10.1002/jee.20110"", ""10.1080/19378629.2016.1155593"", ""10.1177/0042085901363002"", ""10.1187/cbe.13-06-0115"", ""10.1109/FIE.2016.7757648"", ""10.4324/9780203853214"", ""10.1002/jee.20117"", ""10.1080/1361332052000341006""]","['Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Safety Research', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"

While some academics working in the area of educational technology have raised concerns, many others have so far failed to respond to what is a significant shift in the ongoing development of digital education. The paper considers how academic researchers and other educational technology stakeholders can respond to what might be perceived as the curtailment of some forms of digital education. In particular, the paper argues that this current turn away from digital devices offers an opportunity to advance understandings about a number of seemingly problematic issues regarding the continued use of digital technologies in schools. In particular, the paper reconsiders five such areas of concern that are associated with banning phones from school: (1) technology addition; (2) digital distraction; (3) cyberbullying; (4) surveillance capitalism; and (5) environmental sustainability of digital education.","[{""name"": ""Neil Selwyn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesper Aagaard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.03.010"", ""10.1177/0959354318815766"", ""10.1556/2006.4.2015.009"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.047"", ""10.2304/elea.2011.8.3.181"", ""10.1080/17439880701343394"", ""10.1177/1478210314566732"", ""10.1145/3232617.3232618"", ""10.4324/9780203994610"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2009.05.004"", ""10.1145/3183582"", ""10.1038/s41562-018-0506-1"", ""10.1111/bjet.12136"", ""10.1080/13645579.2016.1161346"", ""10.1177/1461444818799523"", ""10.1556/2006.7.2018.49"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.022"", ""10.1016/S2352-4642(17)30011-1"", ""10.1016/j.jaac.2019.06.017"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.12.002""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Hence, this paper attempts to design strategies for applying AI in art teaching. For this purpose, the authors reviewed the current application status of AI in art teaching and summed up the problems with these applications. Next, the promotive role of AI in art teaching was analyzed in detail, and three strategies were developed to promote AI applications in modern art teaching, namely: expand the adaptability of AI-based art teaching; improve the intelligent teaching mode of art teaching; and enhance the artistic experience and atmosphere of AI-based art teaching. At the same time, to evaluate the application effect of AI in art teaching, a performance analysis model was designed based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and grey clustering. The proposed model can quantify the application effect of AI in art teaching, and it has a good application potential.","[{""name"": ""Fanwen Kong"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7662), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7556)]]"
10.1111/medu.14296,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Acute and chronic sleep deprivation in residents: Cognition and stress biomarkers,"AbstractObjectivesInsufficient sleep affects circadian hormonal profiles and inflammatory markers and may modulate attention, executive functioning and decision‐making. Medical professionals and specifically resident physicians, who are involved in long‐term nightshift schedules during their post‐graduate training, are prone to acute and chronic sleep deprivation and disruption, putting them at risk for making medical errors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of chronic and acute‐on‐chronic sleep deprivation and disruption among residents on selected physiological and cognitive measures.MethodsThirty‐three medical and surgical residents were evaluated twice ‐ at baseline and after a 26‐hour shift. Eighteen young attending physicians who did not engage in nightshift schedules served as controls and were evaluated once. Measures included morning cortisol and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP), computerised tests of attention and behaviour, the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function, a risk‐taking questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.ResultsResidents, but not attendings, reported chronic sleep disruption and deprivation. Residents at baseline exhibited reduced morning cortisol levels and elevated hs‐CRP levels, compared to attendings. Residents at baseline had impaired global executive function compared to attendings. A nightshift with acute sleep deprivation further reduced residents' executive function. Residents at baseline and after a nightshift demonstrated increased impulsivity and slower processing time than attendings. Residents and attendings did not differ in risk‐taking tendencies which were assessed in a separate cohort.ConclusionsIn a real‐life setting, resident physicians exhibit increased low‐grade systemic inflammation (hs‐CRP) and impaired HPA‐axis function. Their chronic sleep curtailment is associated with greater impulsivity, slower cognitive processing, and impaired executive function. Future research is warranted to understand how improving working schedule by increasing sleep duration may minimise the short‐term and potential long‐term risks to physicians in training.","[{""name"": ""Shoham Choshen‐Hillel"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Business Administration and the Federmann Center for the Study of Rationality Hebrew University of Jerusalem Jerusalem Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Ishqer"", ""affiliation"": [""Pediatric Pulmonary and Sleep Unit Hadassah‐Hebrew University Medical Center Jerusalem Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Fadi Mahameed"", ""affiliation"": [""Pediatric Pulmonary and Sleep Unit Hadassah‐Hebrew University Medical Center Jerusalem Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Joel Reiter"", ""affiliation"": [""Pediatric Pulmonary and Sleep Unit Hadassah‐Hebrew University Medical Center Jerusalem Israel""]}, {""name"": ""David Gozal"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Child Health MU Women’s and Children’s Hospital University of Missouri School of Medicine Columbia MO USA""]}, {""name"": ""Alex Gileles‐Hillel"", ""affiliation"": [""Pediatric Pulmonary and Sleep Unit Hadassah‐Hebrew University Medical Center Jerusalem Israel"", ""The Wohl Institute for Translational Medicine Hadassah‐Hebrew University Medical Center Jerusalem Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Itai Berger"", ""affiliation"": [""Pediatric Neurology Department of Pediatrics Assuta‐Ashdod University Medical Center Ashdod Israel"", ""Faculty of Health Sciences Ben‐Gurion University of the Negev Beer‐Sheva Israel""]}]","[""10.5665/sleep.3298"", ""10.1016/j.smrv.2010.01.003"", ""10.1093/sleep/33.5.585"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115205"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-53702-7.00007-5"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00499"", ""10.1093/sleep/22.2.171"", ""10.1136/bmj.i5210"", ""10.1016/j.smrv.2006.08.002"", ""10.1152/physrev.00010.2018"", ""10.1093/aje/kwt072"", ""10.1016/j.bbi.2015.02.023"", ""10.3109/10253890.2015.1087503"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2111-14.2014"", ""10.1155/2016/4576012"", ""10.1177/1745691616689091"", ""10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.04.017"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.1994.tb02737.x"", ""10.1016/j.conb.2013.02.008"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001831"", ""10.3810/pgm.2012.07.2583"", ""10.1007/s00408-007-9010-5"", ""10.1001/jama.288.9.1116"", ""10.1093/sleep/28.11.1392"", ""10.1001/jama.2012.34490"", ""10.1080/0014013031000085671"", ""10.1001/jama.294.9.1104"", ""10.1542/peds.2009-0351"", ""10.1164/rccm.201604-0708ST"", ""10.1016/j.chest.2019.07.008"", ""10.1001/jama.294.9.1025"", ""10.1016/0165-1781(89)90047-4"", ""10.1016/j.smrv.2015.01.009"", ""10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.10.012"", ""10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.05.006"", ""10.1257/aer.100.3.1238"", ""10.1016/j.ahj.2013.03.017"", ""10.1111/jsr.12581"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750"", ""10.1093/sleep/zsx200"", ""10.5935/1984-0063.20180029"", ""10.3109/07420528.2011.635235"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00214"", ""10.1016/j.jadohealth.2013.12.034"", ""10.1542/peds.2016-1406"", ""10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.03.020"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa041406"", ""10.3389/fneur.2019.00595"", ""10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.2973"", ""10.1136/bmj.l4134"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa1900669"", ""10.1007/s00134-016-4671-2"", ""10.1177/0272989X15626398"", ""10.1016/j.smrv.2018.03.006"", ""10.1038/npp.2016.148"", ""10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.05.014"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000134"", ""10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.11.052"", ""10.1542/peds.2016-2163"", ""10.1007/s11886-017-0919-x"", ""10.1093/sleep/zsx064"", ""10.1210/jc.2013-4254"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(99)01376-8"", ""10.1210/jc.2004-1003"", ""10.1080/07853890802508934"", ""10.1037/hea0000517"", ""10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.04.006"", ""10.1177/107155769900600110"", ""10.1056/NEJM199109053251016"", ""10.1176/appi.ap.11100187"", ""10.1136/oemed-2017-104371"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.064"", ""10.1056/NEJMsa020846"", ""10.1016/j.amjsurg.2008.07.030"", ""10.1093/arclin/act031"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2013.00691"", ""10.1097/EDE.0b013e318187a7b0"", ""10.1111/medu.13757""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Endocrine and Autonomic Systems']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7135), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7131)]]"

Thus, valid and reliable measures of cognitive load are important to support instructional design in VLE. Through three studies, we investigated the validity and reliability of Leppink's Cognitive Load Scale (CLS) and developed the extraneous cognitive load (EL) dimension into three sub‐scales relevant for VLE: EL instructions, EL interaction, and EL environment. We investigated the validity of the measures using the Partial Credit Model (PCM), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and correlations with retention tests. Study 1 (n = 73) investigated the adapted version of the CLS. Study 2 describes the development and validation of the Multidimensional Cognitive Load Scale for Virtual Environments (MCLSVE), with 140 students in higher education.

10.1186/s12909-021-02870-x,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,The impact of artificial intelligence on clinical education: perceptions of postgraduate trainee doctors in London (UK) and recommendations for trainers,"AbstractBackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly used in clinical practice. Although there is robust evidence that AI innovations can improve patient care, reduce clinicians’ workload and increase efficiency, their impact on medical training and education remains unclear.MethodsA survey of trainee doctors’ perceived impact of AI technologies on clinical training and education was conducted at UK NHS postgraduate centers in London between October and December 2020. Impact assessment mirrored domains in training curricula such as ‘clinical judgement’, ‘practical skills’ and ‘research and quality improvement skills’. Significance between Likert-type data was analysed using Fisher’s exact test. Response variations between clinical specialities were analysed using k-modes clustering. Free-text responses were analysed by thematic analysis.ResultsTwo hundred ten doctors responded to the survey (response rate 72%). The majority (58%) perceived an overall positive impact of AI technologies on their training and education. Respondents agreed that AI would reduce clinical workload (62%) and improve research and audit training (68%). Trainees were skeptical that it would improve clinical judgement (46% agree,p = 0.12) and practical skills training (32% agree,p &lt; 0.01). The majority reported insufficient AI training in their current curricula (92%), and supported having more formal AI training (81%).ConclusionsTrainee doctors have an overall positive perception of AI technologies’ impact on clinical training. There is optimism that it will improve ‘research and quality improvement’ skills and facilitate ‘curriculum mapping’. There is skepticism that it may reduce educational opportunities to develop ‘clinical judgement’ and ‘practical skills’. Medical educators should be mindful that these domains are protected as AI develops. We recommend that ‘Applied AI’ topics are formalized in curricula and digital technologies leveraged to deliver clinical education.","[{""name"": ""Maya Banerjee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daphne Chiew"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Keval T.

10.1111/bjet.13106,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Technology integration for young children during COVID-19: Towards future online teaching,"AbstractTo support young children's learning during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, preschool educators in Hong Kong were required to teach with digital technologies. In this study, 1035 educators from 169 preschools reported their views and practices in an online survey, which we examined via multilevel mixed‐response analysis and thematic analysis. More than half of the respondents (53%) expected future online teaching to continue, and only 11% of educators believed that parents would reject this form of delivery. Administrators and teaching assistants were more likely than teachers to expect online preschool teaching to continue in the future. In addition, respondents with existing online platform experience, who taught the upper levels of preschool, or incorporated specific teaching practices (eg, after the online lesson, they assessed children and assigned homework tasks), were more likely than others to expect online teaching in the future. Many of these respondents also reported (a) difficulty with engaging their children when online and (b) inadequate support from parents for learning activities, which reduced the respondents' perceived likelihood of future online teaching. Administrators and teaching assistants were more likely than teachers to believe that parents would accept online teaching in the future. Respondents who felt they had inadequate training to teach online, children in families with inadequate technical skills and parents who believed that online lessons harmed children's well‐being, were less likely than others to believe that parents would accept online teaching in the future. These educators believed that online learning communities could connect parents and schools and foster interaction that could help align with educator's support for children's learning needs. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about technology integration for young children during COVID‐19 COVID‐19 led to the closure of many schools, requiring teachers to teach online. Barriers to integrating technologies in preschool settings existed before the pandemic. Online teaching can support students' learning, but few studies have examined technology integration for preschoolers at home during a pandemic. What this paper adds This paper adds new data on schooling during a pandemic. During the closures, preschool teachers applied two major online teaching approaches: (a) digital content interaction and (b) online human interaction. Technology integration was added to provide evidence of how teachers applied online learning resources for young children during COVID‐19. During closures, teachers often delivered learning resources via digital‐mediated learning platforms, but they were less likely than other educators to expect online teaching in the future. Educators who perceived greater engagement of children or support from parents were more likely to expect online teaching in the future. Implications for practice and/or policy This study showed that some preschool teachers integrated technology into their teaching during a pandemic, and future studies can explore how to facilitate or extend this integration after the pandemic. This study showed the need for more interactive online teaching preparation to address young children's learning needs. Some teachers were responsive to feedback from children and monitored their learning during the online teaching process.","[{""name"": ""Xinyun Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Early Childhood Education The Education University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Ming Ming Chiu"", ""affiliation"": [""Assessment Research Centre The Education University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Wai Man Vivienne Leung"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Early Childhood Education The Education University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China""]}, {""name"": ""Nicola Yelland"", ""affiliation"": [""Melbourne Graduate School of Education The University of Melbourne Parkville VIC Australia""]}]","[""10.31314/british.9.1.48-64.2020"", ""10.2991/assehr.k.200711.001"", ""10.30659/pendas.7.2.68‐83"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104345"", ""10.1353/cye.2011.0014"", ""10.1111/cdep.12041"", ""10.1093/biomet/93.3.491"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.024"", ""10.1007/s11423‐020‐09744‐x"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1542/peds.2011‐1753"", ""10.1080/21532974.2012.10784689"", ""10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105440"", ""10.1111/bjet.12882"", ""10.59668/2"", ""10.1111/bjet.12649"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2011.09.006"", ""10.1111/bjet.12525"", ""10.1080/10901027.2017.1335664"", ""10.1163/25902539‐00102005"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.010"", ""10.1111/bjet.12247"", ""10.1007/s13158‐020‐00272‐6"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-8928-2"", ""10.18848/1836‐6236/cgp/v03i01/51313"", ""10.1207/s15327906mbr3901_4"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0152879"", ""10.1002/jbmr.2890"", ""10.1007/s10643‐013‐0608‐3"", ""10.24036/jelt.v9i2.109293"", ""10.3102/00346543074004525"", ""10.4324/9780203863619"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.04.003"", ""10.1080/01587919.2018.1476840"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.001"", ""10.1007/s10643‐011‐0447‐z"", ""10.2196/mental.5842"", ""10.70725/994542ifqvlm"", ""10.1007/s10643‐019‐00989‐7"", ""10.70725/818537xikamp"", ""10.70725/307718pkpjuu""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Gender Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1177/1356336X19835240,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW,0401 Education,Teachers as role models for physical activity: Are preschool children more active when their teachers are active?,"Teachers are considered important role models for the behavior of children during early childhood. The purposes of this study are to: (a) compare activity levels of preschool children in a structured physical education (PE) class taught by an active or less active teacher; (b) examine the interaction effect of gender, school size, and teacher activity levels on the activity levels of children. The participants were 248 preschool children (134 boys, 114 girls; mean age = 5.5 years) and teachers from 12 preschools in Hong Kong. Regular classroom teachers conducted a 30-min structured PE class, and the participants’ physical activity (PA) levels were measured using pedometers. The recorded step counts of teachers were employed to classify whether children were in the classes taught by active or less active teachers. Factorial analysis of variance was used to examine differences in the pedometer-determined activity regarding gender and school size between the different types of classes. The results indicated that preschool children had higher PA levels in PE classes taught by more active teachers than in those taught by less active teachers (1712 versus 951 steps). Future studies could explore other teacher-related factors that might facilitate appropriate strategies to engage preschoolers in higher PA during PE classes.","[{""name"": ""Peggy Cheung"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Health and Physical Education, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong""]}]","[""10.1186/1471-2458-12-582"", ""10.4172/2573-0312.1000111"", ""10.1177/1053815109331858"", ""10.1080/02701367.2001.10608937"", ""10.1186/1479-5868-5-11"", ""10.1123/jsep.34.3.365"", ""10.1177/1356336X17705274"", ""10.4236/ape.2015.53024"", ""10.4236/ape.2015.51005"", ""10.1542/peds.2008-2498"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2011.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.pcad.2014.09.010"", ""10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181c619b2"", ""10.3102/00346543074004443"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2005.03.006"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9507.2006.00353.x"", ""10.1080/0300443022000022459"", ""10.1080/02701367.2007.10599440"", ""10.1123/jtpe.25.1.36"", ""10.1177/1356336X07081799"", ""10.1111/j.1746-1561.2008.00327.x"", ""10.2478/v10197-012-0027-9"", ""10.1086/529102"", ""10.1249/MSS.0000000000000181"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2008.08.005"", ""10.1249/01.mss.0000230212.55119.98"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.11.008"", ""10.1080/19325037.2011.10599179"", ""10.1080/07303084.2000.10605112""]","['Medicine', 'Psychology', 'Health Professions']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0403 体育学', 0.7413), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7214)]]"
10.21449/ijate.820140,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS IN EDUCATION,0401 Education,Remote Assessment in Higher Education during COVID-19 Pandemic,"Universities have made a compulsory shift to distance education due to the Covid-19 pandemic. All of the higher education instutitions in Turkey have completed 2019-2020 Spring semester using online tools. However, most of these institutions were not fully-prepared to have all of their courses online. Technical inadequencies, lack of qualified online tools, inexperience of instructors and students in distance education have emerged as major issues that instutitions have to face. In addition to all, a new question arised; which approaches will be used for assessment. This study aimed to seek the common assessment approaches used through pandemic, how students perceived the quality of the assessment and the pros and cons of using these practices. Additionally, we examined whether participants’ perceptions about quality of the assessment differ according to interaction with faculty members and use of online tests. Researchers employed survey design to reply four research questions and used a three-part instrument to collect qualitative and quantitative data. 486 students from 61 universities voluntarily participated in the study. Results indicated assignments are the mostly used tools and students are generally satisfied about the quality of the assessment practices. Another result is that students who interact with faculty members are more satisfied with the quality of the assessment practices. This emphasizes the importance of formative assessment and feedback in remote assessment. Further, students who took online tests are more satisfied with the quality of assessment. Suggestions were made for future research.","[{""name"": ""Selma ŞENEL"", ""affiliation"": [""BALIKESIR UNIVERSITY, NECATİBEY FACULTY OF EDUCATION""]}, {""name"": ""Hüseyin Can ŞENEL"", ""affiliation"": [""NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY""]}]","[""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.021"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.01250a"", ""10.1186/s41039-020-00129-5"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.02.001"", ""10.1007/s11092-008-9064-9"", ""10.1109/ICDAMT.2017.7904957"", ""10.4018/IJDET.20210101.oa1"", ""10.1109/ISM.2006.92"", ""10.1007/s11125-020-09464-3"", ""10.4135/9781506326139"", ""10.1080/17439880902759919"", ""10.14742/ajet.5187"", ""10.17718/tojde.340402"", ""10.3102/0013189X020008015"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.10.001"", ""10.28945/1592"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00790"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00891"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(01)00028-8"", ""10.4018/978-1-59140-497-2.ch013"", ""10.1080/02602938.2011.557496"", ""10.1080/01587919.2017.1369005"", ""10.1080/01587919.2019.1681893"", ""10.1007/s11159-019-09792-3"", ""10.4018/978-1-59140-747-8""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Despite their vast development, a strain sensor having broad strain sensing range, ultralow detection limit, and negligible hysteresis still remains a challenge. Herein, a liquid metal (LM)‐based stretchable resistive strain sensor, prepared by selective wetting and transferring process to attain improved compatibility between LM and polydimethylsiloxane substrate, is reported. This sensor exhibits broad strain sensing range (105%), with ultralow detection limit (0.05%), minimal hysteresis, fast response time (58 ms), and excellent repeatability. When practically demonstrated, this sensor successfully monitored various human activities, such as blink motion monitoring, voice intensity differentiation, heartbeat and wrist pulse monitoring. Moreover, when the current sensor is used in the form of smart kneecap and smart glove, it efficiently detected various human gestures, which confirms its great application potential in the fields of human health and motion monitoring, human–machine interface, and virtual reality applications.","[{""name"": ""Yuanzhao Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Materials and Devices Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences  Ningbo 315201 P.

10.1002/rrq.477,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,Forty Years of Reading Intervention Research for Elementary Students with or at Risk for Dyslexia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"ABSTRACTThis meta‐analysis included experimental or quasi‐experimental intervention studies conducted between 1980 and 2020 that aimed to improve reading outcomes for Grade K‐5 students with or at risk for dyslexia (i.e., students with or at risk for word reading difficulties, defined as scoring at or below norm‐referenced screening or mean baseline performance thresholds articulated in our inclusion criteria). In all, 53 studies reported in 52 publications met inclusion criteria (m = 351; total student N = 6,053). We employed robust variance estimation to address dependent effect sizes arising from multiple outcomes and comparisons within studies. Results indicated a statistically significant main effect of instruction on norm‐referenced reading outcomes (g = 0.33; p &lt; .001). Because there was significant heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies (p &lt; .01), we used meta‐regression to identify the degree to which student characteristics (i.e., grade level), intervention characteristics (i.e., dosage, instructional components, multisensory nature, instructional group size), reading outcome domain (i.e., phonological awareness, word reading/spelling, passage reading, or reading comprehension), or research methods (i.e., sample size, study design) influenced intervention effects. Dosage and reading outcome domain were the only variables that significantly moderated intervention effects (p = .040 and p = .024, respectively), with higher dosage studies associated with larger effects (b = 0.002) and reading comprehension outcomes associated with smaller effects than word reading/spelling outcomes (b = −0.080).","[{""name"": ""Colby Hall"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Virginia  Charlottesville Virginia USA""]}, {""name"": ""Katlynn Dahl‐Leonard"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Virginia  Charlottesville Virginia USA""]}, {""name"": ""Eunsoo Cho"", ""affiliation"": [""Michigan State University  East Lansing Michigan USA""]}, {""name"": ""Emily J.

10.1017/S0265051720000133,BRITISH JOURNAL OF MUSIC EDUCATION,1302 Music and Dance; 0401 Education,Editorial Research: Music education in a time of pandemic,"AbstractThis article, written at the time it was taking place, discusses the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on music education in schools, focusing on the UK. It discusses how schools and teachers have had to make a sudden shift to a largely on-line modality, and the effects of these on teaching and learning in music. It asks questions of curriculum and assessment, especially with regard to the fact that classroom teachers in England are having to use their professional judgment to provide grades for external examinations, where hitherto these would have come from examination boards. It questions the ways in which teachers have been inadequately prepared and supported for this, by years of neoliberal undermining of confidence. It goes on to question accountability, and teacher training, raising issues which, at the time of writing, are of significant concern or music education.","[{""name"": ""Alison Daubney"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Fautley"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/h0054346"", ""10.2304/pfie.2013.11.4.423"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1503gxj"", ""10.2979/philmusieducrevi.28.1.06"", ""10.1177/1029864910393417"", ""10.1017/S0265051719000329""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Education', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1186/s41239-020-00189-z,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Does sociability quality of web-based collaborative learning information system influence students' satisfaction and system usage?,"AbstractThe use of collaborative learning technologies is a stimulating element of collaborative learning process, where social interaction and collaboration are key factors. This research examines the impact of sociability quality on the usage of web-based collaborative learning information system (WBCLIS) and user satisfaction. We propose a theoretical model by integrating the construct of ‘sociability quality’ in the DeLone and McLean’s (Journal of Management Information Systems 19:9–30, 2003) updated information system success model. Proposed theoretical model was empirically validated, in a service-learning course with undergraduate students, where data was collected using an online questionnaire and evaluated through partial least square, structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) statistical approach. Results suggest that, sociability quality has a direct positive impact on the system use and overall user satisfaction, along with a strong indirect impact on the net benefits of the WBCLIS. Findings also confirmed that, system use and user satisfaction are strong predictors of the net benefits. These results about sociability quality, contribute significantly in the domain of IS success literature, by identifying a novel and critical IS success dimension. Further, theoretical contribution in the context of sociability quality for IS success, and practical implications entailing the use of WBCLIS in the domain of service learning are also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Maimoona Salam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Shoaib Farooq"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/IJILT-11-2017-0116"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.08.004"",

10.1002/tesq.581,TESOL QUARTERLY,0401 Education,Development and Initial Validation of the L2-Teacher Grit Scale,"Grit—“perseverance and passion for long‐term goals” (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, &amp; Kelly, 2007, p. 1087)—has attracted the attention of researchers in fields ranging from psychology to business to education (e.g., Robertson‐Kraft &amp; Duckworth, 2014; Robins, 2019). Continuing the line of research that explores the domain specificity of grit (e.g., F. T. C. Schmidt, Fleckenstein, Retelsdorf, Eskreis‐Winkler, &amp; Möller, 2017), this study introduces the L2‐Teacher Grit Scale (L2TGS) developed to measure grit specifically among English language teachers (N = 202). The results demonstrated, first, that the L2TGS possessed sufficient internal‐consistency reliability (ω = .77). A subsequent principal components analysis revealed a two‐component structure (POV = 50.87%), thus yielding evidence in favor of construct validity. A one‐tailed Pearson’s test for positive correlation between Duckworth and Quinn’s (2009) domain‐general Grit–S and L2TGS scores established concurrent validity of the new measure (rc = .84). Lastly, the L2TGS exhibited a stronger predictive validity, explaining approximately 21% of the variance in L2‐teacher retention‐related scores compared to the Grit–S, which was a statistically nonsignificant predictor accounting for 4% of the total variance. Of note, female teachers had higher levels of grit than male teachers. In sum, our findings indicate support for an occupation‐specific approach to grit.","[{""name"": ""Ekaterina Sudina"", ""affiliation"": [""Northern Arizona University Flagstaff Arizona United States""]}, {""name"": ""Tony Vernon"", ""affiliation"": [""Camosun College Victoria British Columbia Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Henry Foster"", ""affiliation"": [""Bukkyo University Kyoto Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Heather Del Villano"", ""affiliation"": [""Camosun College Victoria British Columbia Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Shoshannah Hernandez"", ""affiliation"": [""Huntington University Huntington Indiana United States""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Beck"", ""affiliation"": [""Rikkyo University Tokyo Japan"", ""Waseda University Tokyo Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Luke Plonsky"", ""affiliation"": [""Northern Arizona University Flagstaff Arizona United States""]}]","[""10.1177/0033688214523345"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00096"", ""10.21909/sp.2013.04.645"", ""10.1037/h0046016"", ""10.5465/amr.2009.40633190"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.11.014"", ""10.1016/j.jsp.2018.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2018.11.026"", ""10.1037/pspp0000102"", ""10.1007/BF02310555"", ""10.1177/0013164416658325"", ""10.1002/tesq.217"", ""10.1080/00273170902938969"", ""10.1177/0963721414541462"", ""10.1177/1948550610385872"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1087"", ""10.1080/00223890802634290"", ""10.1111/bjop.12046"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00036"", ""10.1007/BF02289447"", ""10.17485/ijst/2015/v8iS7/70421"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2014.06.001"", ""10.1111/lang.12115"", ""10.1016/j.system.2019.03.002"", ""10.4324/9781315870908-9"", ""10.4324/9781315394749"", ""10.1177/0734282907313767"", ""10.1177/1088868310366253"", ""10.1037/met0000144"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9922.2007.00421.x"", ""10.1016/j.joep.2016.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2017.02.001"", ""10.2132/personality.24.167"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.5.3.343"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2018.09.007"", ""10.1111/modl.12335"", ""10.1111/lang.12111"", ""10.1111/lang.12079"", ""10.1177/016146811411600306"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2017.08.004"", ""10.3138/cmlr.68.1.078"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00769"", ""10.1027/1015-5759/a000424"", ""10.18806/tesl.v31i1.1164"", ""10.1016/j.jrp.2018.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.ajem.2018.02.021"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00839""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Social Psychology', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

Approach In 2019, the Zucker School of Medicine and Northwell Health piloted a virtual reality (VR) racism experience as a component of professional development for medical school and health system leaders, faculty, and staff. Participants experienced a 60-minute, interactive, large-group session on microaggressions and, as individuals, a 20-minute VR module. These were followed by group reflection and debriefing. The sessions, developed in collaboration with a VR academic team, represented a response to institutional climate assessment surveys, which indicated the need for expanded professional training on cross-cultural communication and enhancing inclusion. Outcomes In October 2019, 112 faculty and staff participated in the workshop. On a postworkshop survey, completed by 76 participants (67.9%), most respondents (90.8%) reported feeling engaged in the VR experience. Additionally, the majority agreed that VR was an effective tool for enhancing empathy (94.7%), that the session enhanced their own empathy for racial minorities (85.5%), and that their approach to communication would change (67.1%). In open-ended responses, participants frequently conveyed enthusiasm, powerful emotional and physiologic responses, and enhanced empathy. They also suggested more time for follow-up discussions. Next Steps Next steps include assessing the scalability of the VR module; determining effective complementary engagements; and measuring the module’s longitudinal effects on racial empathy, discrimination, and institutional climate. As VR becomes more common in medical education, developing VR modules to address other forms of discrimination (e.g., sexism, homophobia) could also benefit the institutional climates of medical schools and health systems as academic medicine continues to build toward health equity.","[{""name"": ""Robert O.

10.1002/ase.2152,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,An analysis of anatomy education before and during Covid-19: August-December 2020,"AbstractCoronavirus disease‐2019 (Covid‐19) disrupted the in‐person teaching format of anatomy. To study changes in gross anatomy education that occurred during August–December, 2020 compared to before the pandemic, an online survey was distributed to anatomy educators. The 191 responses received were analyzed in total and by academic program, geographic region, and institution type. Cadaver use decreased overall (before: 74.1 ± 34.1%, during: 50.3 ± 43.0%, P &lt; 0.0001), as well as across allopathic and osteopathic medicine, therapy, undergraduate, and veterinary programs (P &lt; 0.05), but remained unchanged for other programs (P &gt; 0.05). Cadaver use decreased internationally and in the US (P &lt; 0.0001), at public and private (P &lt; 0.0001) institutions, and among allopathic medical programs in Northeastern, Central, and Southern (P &lt; 0.05), but not Western, US geographical regions. Laboratories during Covid‐19 were delivered through synchronous (59%), asynchronous (4%), or mixed (37%) formats (P &lt; 0.0001) and utilized digital resources (47%), dissection (32%), and/or prosection (21%) (P &lt; 0.0001). The practical laboratory examination persisted during Covid‐19 (P = 0.419); however, the setting and materials shifted to computer‐based (P &lt; 0.0001) and image‐based (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively. In‐person lecture decreased during Covid‐19 (before: 88%, during: 24%, P = 0.003). When anatomy digital resources were categorized, dissection media, interactive software, and open‐access content increased (P ≤ 0.008), with specific increases in BlueLink, Acland's Videos, and Complete Anatomy (P &lt; 0.05). This study provided evidence of how gross anatomy educators continued to adapt their courses past the early stages of the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Stefanie M.

10.1017/S0261444819000077,LANGUAGE TEACHING,0401 Education,A transnational model of virtual exchange for global citizenship education,AbstractVirtual exchange is a well-known pedagogical approach in foreign language (FL) education which involves engaging classes in online intercultural collaboration projects with international partners as an integrated part of their educational programmes. This paper begins by reviewing e-tandem and telecollaborative approaches to virtual exchange which are currently being used extensively in FL education and presents two case studies which illustrate the common learning outcomes and limitations of such approaches. I then propose an alternative model of virtual exchange which maintains many of the key characteristics of earlier approaches but which incorporates the principles of global citizenship education and which moves away from bilingual–bicultural approaches. I conclude by outlining the main characteristics of this model and presenting some examples of how this approach could be put into practice.,"[{""name"": ""Robert O'Dowd"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9781118482070"", ""10.4324/9781315716954"", ""10.21832/9781847690104-005"", ""10.4324/9781315678931"", ""10.1057/9780230240766"", ""10.4324/9781315678931"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2014.12057.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2005.00274.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2006.00395_3.x"", ""10.5465/amle.2012.0195"", ""10.14705/rpnet.2018.jve.1"", ""10.21832/9781847690807"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2014.12065.x"", ""10.1080/14708477.2014.890625"", ""10.4135/9781452218397.n16"", ""10.1002/9781118914069.ch12"", ""10.1057/9780230235823"", ""10.21832/9781853599613"", ""10.1111/modl.12341"", ""10.5565/rev/jtl3.522""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Education', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

The author explores how the monolingual and monoglossic view of literacy has been responsible for the failure of many Latinx bilingual students. A translanguaging perspective turns its attention toward the language actions of a bilingual reader and away from the language of a written text. Focusing on the actions of three Latinx bilingual readers—a pre‐reader, an elementary school student, and a middle school student—the author explores how bilingual readers leverage their translanguaging, turning what are said to be static monolingual texts into multilingual/multimodal ones. Through the actions of three Latinx readers in different types of educational contexts, the author shows how literacy educators can take steps to acknowledge bilingual readers’ translanguaging and enter with them into a translanguaging space to do literacy.","[{""name"": ""Ofelia García"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/rrq.286"", ""10.1057/9781137385765"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2010.07.035"", ""10.1515/applirev-2015-0014"", ""10.1515/applirev-2018-0020""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Linguistics and Language']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)]]"
10.1186/s12909-021-02983-3,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,The perceived impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on medical student education and training - an international survey,"Abstract Background The Covid-19 pandemic led to significant changes and disruptions to medical education worldwide. We evaluated medical student perceived views on training, their experiences and changes to teaching methods during the pandemic. Methods An online survey of medical students was conducted in the Autumn of 2020. An international network of collaborators facilitated participant recruitment. Students were surveyed on their perceived overall impact of Covid-19 on their training and several exposure variables. Univariate analyses and adjusted multivariable analysis were performed to determine strengths in associations. Results A total of 1604 eligible participants from 45 countries took part in this survey and 56.3% (n = 860) of these were female. The median age was 21 (Inter Quartile Range:21–23). Nearly half (49.6%, n = 796) of medical students were in their clinical years. The majority (n = 1356, 84.5%) were residents of a low or middle income country. A total of 1305 (81.4%) participants reported that the Covid-19 pandemic had an overall negative impact on their training. On adjusted analysis, being 21 or younger, females, those reporting a decline in conventional lectures and ward based teaching were more likely to report an overall negative impact on their training (p ≤ 0.001). However, an increase in clinical responsibilities was associated with lower odds of participants reporting a negative impact on training (p &lt; 0.001). The participant’s resident nation economy and stage of training were associated with some of the participant training experiences surveyed (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion An international cohort of medical students reported an overall significant negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their undergraduate training. The efficacy of novel virtual methods of teaching to supplement traditional teaching methods warrants further research.","[{""name"": ""Kasun Wanigasooriya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""William Beedham"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ryan Laloo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rama Santhosh Karri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adnan Darr"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Georgia R.

10.1186/s40594-022-00346-y,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,"The exploration of continuous learning intention in STEAM education through attitude, motivation, and cognitive load","Abstract Background This study proposes a learning cycle and a comprehensive research framework that integrates Bloom’s taxonomy: the cognitive domain (cognitive load), affective domain (attitude and motivation) and psychomotor domain (implementation of science, technology, engineering, arts, and math [STEAM] activities) to explore the relationship between these learning domains and learning intention. The proposed innovative mediated-moderation model includes second-order factors derived from the technology acceptance model (TAM) (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment), the attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction (ARCS) model, and cognitive load (mental load and mental effort) to explain the continuous learning intention of STEAM education. Results A teaching material was designed for the STEAM activity, and an empirical experiment was subsequently conducted. The empirical experiment of STEAM activities with our design teaching material (micro:bit with artificial intelligence-based concept) was conducted at a university and an elementary school; a total of 145 questionnaire survey data were collected after the activities. University student participants were 20–24 years old and the elementary school student participants were at the K5–K6 level. The results showed that perceived usability directly influenced learning intention and strengthened the relationship between learning attitudes and intention. The ARCS plays a critical moderating role that positively influenced perceived usability and strengthened its effects on learning attitudes. Regarding the mediating effects, cognitive load negatively influenced perceived usability. Conclusions The findings of this study revealed that critical factors affect students’ learning attitudes and intentions regarding STEAM education.

10.1007/s10734-022-00946-1,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,The expansion of doctoral education and the changing nature and purpose of the doctorate,"AbstractDoctorate level attainment has increased significantly in developed economies. In 2019, the average share of 25–64-year-olds with a doctorate across the OECD was around 1%. However, if current trends continue, 2.3% of today’s young adults will enter doctoral studies at some point in their life. This essay starts by describing the expansion of doctoral education. It then reflects on the causes of this growth and the consequences for the nature and purpose of the doctorate. This reflection is mostly based on published research in Higher Education in the last 50 years and the author’s work on policy analysis for the OECD on this topic. The paper finishes with a research agenda on doctoral education and the career of doctorate holders.","[{""name"": ""Cláudia S.

10.1186/s12909-021-02638-3,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Scaffolding medical student knowledge and skills: team-based learning (TBL) and case-based learning (CBL),"Abstract Background Two established small-group learning paradigms in medical education include Case-based learning (CBL) and Team-based learning (TBL). Characteristics common to both pedagogies include the use of an authentic clinical case, active small-group learning, activation of existing knowledge and application of newly acquired knowledge. However, there are also variances between the two teaching methods, and a paucity of studies that consider how these approaches fit with curriculum design principles. In this paper we explore student and facilitator perceptions of the two teaching methods within a medical curriculum, using Experience based learning (ExBL) as a conceptual lens. Methods A total of 34/255 (13%) Year 2 medical students completed four CBLs during the 2019 Renal and Urology teaching block, concurrent to their usual curriculum activities, which included weekly TBLs. Questionnaires were distributed to all students (n = 34) and CBL facilitators (n = 13). In addition, all students were invited to attend focus groups. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results In total, 23/34 (71%) of students and 11/13 (85%) of facilitators completed the questionnaires. Twelve students (35%) participated in focus groups. Findings indicate their experience in CBL to be positive, with many favourable aspects that built on and complemented their TBL experience that provided an emphasis on the basic sciences. The learning environment was enriched by the CBL framework that allowed application of knowledge to solve clinical problems within the small groups with consistent facilitator guidance and feedback, their capacity to focus discussion, and associated efficiencies in learning. Conclusion While the TBL model was integral in developing students’ knowledge and understanding of basic science concepts, the CBL model was integral in developing students’ clinical reasoning skills. The strengths of CBL relative to TBL included the development of authentic clinical reasoning skills and guided facilitation of small group discussion. Our findings suggest that delivery of a medical curriculum may be enhanced through increased vertical integration, applying TBL in earlier phases of the medical program where the focus is on basic science principles, with CBL becoming more relevant as students move towards clinical immersion.","[{""name"": ""Annette Burgess"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elie Matar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Inam Haq"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lucy Wynter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julian Singer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eszter Kalman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jane Bleasel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01421590500136352"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-1068-z"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.680939"", ""10.4137/JMECD.S20377"", ""10.1080/01421590802217199"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-6106-7_128-1"", ""10.3138/jvme.35.2.310"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.651179"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318244759e"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2017.1340636"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2005.02248.x"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2017.1408899"", ""10.1007/s10459-014-9501-0"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318193ae85"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e31822c5b9a"", ""10.4137/JMECD.S20377"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000086"", ""10.1097/00001888-199512000-00010"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.993951"", ""10.1111/j.1743-498X.2011.00523.x"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d5dd0d""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Family Practice', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.3916/C66-2021-07,COMUNICAR,0503 Journalism and Communication; 0401 Education,Presidential Twitter in the face of COVID-19: Between populism and pop politics,"This paper analyses the use of Twitter as a presidential communication channel during the first few months of the COVID-19 crisis. The aim is to determine how four recently elected presidents (those of Spain, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil) managed their political communication, and to explore the thesis that they resorted to populist messages during the first months of their terms in office. Using a qualitative methodology and the XL Node tool to capture data, a comparative analysis was performed on the messages posted on their personal Twitter accounts during the first 20 weeks of 2020, classified in six categories: polarization; conspiracy; exaltation and leadership; personalisation and privacy; emotions and feelings; and media publicity. The results indicate that the four presidents share populist traits, but to a different extent. López Obrador and Bolsonaro display a more populist profile, with emotional appeals to the people and to their saving action as regards the implementation of health policies. Conversely, Alberto Fernández and Pedro Sánchez are more akin to the pop politician profile, posting photographs and media messages with a view to receiving press coverage. Both post tweets, based on values and historical events, aimed at their grassroots supporters. The main conclusion is that the pandemic has enhanced the presidential and personalist profiles of the four leaders, although their actions during the COVID-19 crisis were not necessarily in keeping with the populist paradigm. Thus, Sánchez and Bolsonaro implemented a health management communication strategy, while López Obrador and Fernández paid scant attention to health policy. El trabajo analiza el uso de Twitter como canal de comunicación presidencialista en el periodo inicial de la COVID-19. El objetivo es conocer el manejo de cuatro presidentes (España, Argentina, México y Brasil) y analizar la tesis del presidencialismo populista en líderes en su primera mitad de mandato. El método es cualitativo y compara los mensajes de la cuenta personal de Twitter las primeras 20 semanas de 2020. Se analizan en seis categorías: polarización, conspiración, exaltación y liderazgo carismático, personalización y vida privada, emoción y sentimientos, y publicidad en medios. Los cuatro presidentes comparten rasgos populistas, pero en distinto grado o caracterización. López Obrador y Bolsonaro ofrecen un perfil más populista con apelaciones emotivas al pueblo y su acción sanitaria salvífica. En cambio, Alberto Fernández y Pedro Sánchez responden al perfil de política pop, de liderazgo mediatizado para que la prensa amplifique sus logros. Se concluye que la pandemia ha acentuado el perfil presidencialista y personalista, aun cuando no encajen en el paradigma populista. Así, Sánchez y Bolsonaro sí despliegan una estrategia de comunicación de gestión sanitaria, mientras que López Obrador y Fernández apenas prestan atención a la política sanitaria.","[{""name"": ""Juan-Luis Manfredi-Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adriana Amado-Suárez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Silvio Waisbord"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.18042/cepc/rep.173.01"", ""10.5209/hics.66298"", ""10.1177/1461444818797591"", ""10.1177/0267323118760317"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328522"", ""10.3145/epi.2017.sep.01"", ""10.1111/1467-9248.00184"", ""10.1093/ia/iiy038"", ""10.1177/1464884918807344"", ""10.1080/13688790.2017.1363846"", ""10.1017/S0022381607080206"", ""10.1080/23808985.2017.1392251"", ""10.1177/0163443718772192"", ""10.1017/S0003055404001182"", ""10.1177/0002764219835279"", ""10.3916/C59-2019-05 Hallin, D.C.

10.1111/bjet.12959,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Multimodal Learning Analytics research with young children: A systematic review,"AbstractLearning Analytics and Multimodal Learning Analytics are changing the way of analysing the learning process while students interact with an educational content. This paper presents a systematic literature review aimed at describing practices in recent Multimodal Learning Analytics and Learning Analytics research literature in order to identify tools and strategies useful for the assessment of the progress and behaviour of children under 6 years old in respect of their learning. The purpose is to provide guidance for Multimodal Learning Analytics research with children under 6 years old to assess their engagement in a task, their emotions, attention, understanding and achievement of a goal. The current state of knowledge on Multimodal Learning Analytics research suggests how performance analytics, face and speech recognition systems, eye tracking, Kinect analytics and wristbands could be used with children. The results show the complexity of collecting data using non‐invasive methodologies with children under 6 years old. Ethical implications related to multimodal data from audio, visual, biometric and quantitative measures of child behaviour are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Lucrezia Crescenzi‐Lanna"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1159/000443153"", ""10.37134/ajatel.vol8.4.2018"", ""10.1109/ITechA.2015.7317390"", ""10.18608/jla.2016.32.11"", ""10.7203/realia.22.14113"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.02.003"", ""10.1002/aur.2151"", ""10.1109/ICARCV.2016.7838707"", ""10.1080/00131910123753"", ""10.1111/jcal.12262"", ""10.48084/etasr.1902"", ""10.1111/bjet.12868"", ""10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461812"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66610-5_9"", ""10.1080/09523987.2018.1547948"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2016.10.009"", ""10.18608/hla17"", ""10.1111/bjet.12861"", ""10.1002/jee.20113"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.030"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.055"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.12.019"", ""10.18608/jla.2016.32.10"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-09852-5"", ""10.1145/3107990.3108003"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.01.004"", ""10.1109/FIE.2018.8659216"", ""10.3233/JIFS-169513"", ""10.1145/2567574.2567581"", ""10.1109/ITechA.2015.7317425"", ""10.1109/FG.2019.8756529"", ""10.1080/17482798.2016.1140489"", ""10.1111/bjet.12858"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aao6760"", ""10.1111/bjet.12854"", ""10.1145/3311927.3323145"", ""10.1111/jcal.12263"", ""10.1108/ILS-06-2018-0045"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.058"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.032"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170420""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Information Systems', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"

Different modes of delivery of a training simulation of laparoscopy operation were presented to students and learning motivation corresponding to which were evaluated using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. The study was conducted from September 2018 to May 2019. Undergraduate medical students from 8 medical colleges and universities across Punjab, Pakistan participated in this study. A total of 87 students with a mean age of 22.5 ± 4 years were recruited for the study. Of these, 57.4% (n = 50) were males and 42.6% (n = 37) were females. Paired sampled t-test was chosen for the statistical investigation for the study. The tests were conducted by comparing means of text, video, and virtual reality learning methodologies in medical students. All executed statistical models are having significance value P=.000. Therefore, results are generalizable and can be implemented across the population. Medical student motivation was observed to be the greatest in Virtual Reality settings as compared to video-based and text-based learning settings. Both theoretical and practical studies have importance in medical studies, whereas practical hand-on-practice can enhance medical students’ professional proficiency. Virtual reality was at the top in User experience, perceived competence, usefulness, and motivation for final year medical students. It can play a signficant role in contemporary teaching and learning methodology with medical educationist and students can get benefit from this technology.","[{""name"": ""Mian Usman Sattar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sellappan Palaniappan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Asiah Lokman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nauman Shah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Usman Khalid"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raza Hasan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Physiology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02099-0,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Medical, nursing, and physician assistant student knowledge and attitudes toward climate change, pollution, and resource conservation in health care","AbstractBackgroundClimate change and pollution generated by the health care sector impose significant public health burdens. This study aimed to assess medical, nursing and physician assistant student knowledge and attitudes regarding climate change, pollution from the health care sector, and responsibility for resource conservation within professional practice.MethodsIn February–March, 2018, medical, nursing, and physician assistant students at Yale University (1011 potential respondents) were sent a 17-question online Qualtrics survey. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, as well as Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression to assess associations between variables of interest and the personal characteristics of gender, age, geographic place of origin, school, and year in school (among medical students).ResultsThe response rate was 28% (280 respondents). 90% felt that physicians, nurses, and physician assistants have a responsibility to conserve resources and prevent pollution within their professional practice. 63% agreed or strongly agreed that the relationship between pollution, climate change, and health should be covered in the classroom and should be reinforced in the clinical setting. 57% preferred or strongly preferred reusable devices. 91% felt lack of time and production pressure, and 85% believed that lack of education on disease burden stemming from health care pollution, were barriers to taking responsibility for resource conservation and pollution prevention. Women and physician assistant students exhibited a greater commitment than men and medical students, respectively, to address pollution, climate change, and resource conservation in patient care and professional practice.ConclusionWe found that health professional students are engaged with the concept of environmental stewardship in clinical practice and would like to see pollution, climate change, and health covered in their curriculum. In order for this education to be most impactful, more research and industry transparency regarding the environmental footprint of health care materials and specific clinician resource consumption patterns will be required.","[{""name"": ""Emma C.

Our research aimed to explore the awareness of health issues and attitudes of medical students towards LGBT patients’ health including barriers to health services, their attitudes towards inclusion of LGBT content in the curriculum and their confidence with providing care for their LGBT patients in the future. Methods Medical students were recruited to take part in a cross-sectional survey. We used a 28-item survey to explore views about the undergraduate medical curriculum. Results 252 surveys were analysed from 776 eligible participants. Attitudes towards LGBT patients were positive but awareness and confidence with respect to LGBT patients were variable. Confidence discussing sexual orientation with a patient significantly increased with year of study but confidence discussing patient gender identity did not. The majority of participants (n = 160; 69%) had not received specific training on LGBT health needs, and 85% (n = 197) wanted to receive more training. Conclusions Increasing the amount of LGBT teaching in undergraduate medical curricula could help to increase the quality of doctor-patient interactions, to facilitate patients’ disclosure of sexual orientation and gender identity in healthcare and increase the quality of healthcare.","[{""name"": ""Sophie Arthur"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abigail Jamieson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Harry Cross"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kate Nambiar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carrie D.

10.1002/tesq.571,TESOL QUARTERLY,0401 Education,Making the Shift From a Codeswitching to a Translanguaging Lens in English Language Teacher Education,"There has been increasing ambiguity and debate about the meaning and applicability of the terms codeswitching and translanguaging in English language classrooms. To address this issue, this article first offers a historical overview of the literature on codeswitching and translanguaging. This overview serves as the basis for an updated framework that highlights necessary areas of shift in conceptualization from codeswitching to translanguaging, and dimensions of codeswitching research that can still be integrated into a translanguaging lens. This framework is illuminated through an autobiographical narrative inquiry analysis of a teacher educator and a student‐researcher at an English‐medium university in Kazakhstan, a country that is officially bilingual and developing policies and practices to promote trilingualism. The article reinforces the argument that teachers, teacher educators, and ESOL researchers need to shift from a separate (monoglossic) view of languaging practices to a holistic (heteroglossic) view. Research on teachers’ beliefs and language practices need to be reviewed critically to identify whether they take a monoglossic or heteroglossic view of language practices. The preponderance of spontaneous rather than strategic pedagogical use of translanguaging suggests that teachers and teacher educators in English‐language classrooms need to be explicitly taught ways to incorporate heteroglossic ideologies and intentional translanguaging pedagogies into their teaching practice.","[{""name"": ""Bridget Goodman"", ""affiliation"": [""Nazarbayev University Nur‐Sultan Kazakhstan""]}, {""name"": ""Serikbolsyn Tastanbek"", ""affiliation"": [""Astana IT University Nur‐Sultan Kazakhstan""]}]","[""10.1080/15235882.2017.1306597"", ""10.1177/13670069990030040101"", ""10.1057/9780230596047_12"", ""10.1111/j.1467-1770.1977.tb00125.x"", ""10.1016/0024-3841(94)00035-K"", ""10.1177/13670069040080040101"", ""10.1007/s10993-012-9243-x"", ""10.21832/9781853595790"", ""10.1016/S0898-5898(96)90007-8"", ""10.1017/S0047404500018583"", ""10.1080/10228195.2016.1153135"", ""10.1017/S026719051300007X"", ""10.1080/15348458.2017.1327816"", ""10.1080/09500782.2013.788022"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-044894-7.01387-7"", ""10.1080/00405840903192664"", ""10.1017/S0267190514000233"", ""10.21832/9781853596964"", ""10.1080/09500782.2012.663552"", ""10.1016/S0271-5309(99)00021-X"", ""10.4018/978-1-7998-1962-2.ch010"", ""10.2307/416324"", ""10.1017/S0047404500006692"", ""10.1177/002205741019000304"", ""10.1080/00437956.1959.11659702"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1967.tb00573.x"", ""10.1016/j.langcom.2018.06.002"", ""10.1002/tesq.182"", ""10.1016/S0388-0001(80)80007-6"", ""10.1177/13670069000040030301"", ""10.1080/15348450903305155"", ""10.1080/19313152.2016.1258190"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01208.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511609787"", ""10.1080/19313152.2014.981775"", ""10.1017/S0047404500018807"", ""10.1080/09500782.2014.994529"", ""10.1080/13670050408667806"", ""10.1002/9780470694138.ch20"", ""10.1080/13670050.2012.658016"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9841.2010.00445.x"", ""10.1080/19313152.2012.639246"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551185.006"", ""10.21832/9781847692849-007"", ""10.1080/13670050.2014.884211"", ""10.1016/j.linged.2013.12.002"", ""10.1080/13803611.2012.718488"", ""10.1016/S0898-5898(96)90006-6"", ""10.1515/applirev-2013-0009"", ""10.1111/0026-7902.00124"", ""10.1007/0-387-24565-0_5"", ""10.21832/9781847691972-005"", ""10.3102/0002831216683935"", ""10.1080/09500782.2014.994524"", ""10.1080/15348450903305098"", ""10.4135/9781452226552.n12"", ""10.1017/S004740450000049X"", ""10.1017/S0047404500017449"", ""10.1515/applirev-2015-0014"", ""10.1515/applirev-2018-0020"", ""10.1016/j.linged.2018.07.005"", ""10.1080/14790718.2017.1315810"", ""10.1017/S0047404500005340"", ""10.1515/ling.1980.18.7-8.581"", ""10.1080/13670050802153137"", ""10.1016/j.langcom.2017.11.003"", ""10.1002/tesq.53"", ""10.1075/llsee.39"", ""10.1017/S004740450001842X"", ""10.1080/09500782.2014.890215"", ""10.1177/13670069040080040201"", ""10.1080/19463014.2014.893896"", ""10.1093/applin/amx039"", ""10.1080/13670050008667703"", ""10.1525/ae.1985.12.4.02a00090"", ""10.1016/j.linged.2015.01.009""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Although academics are already using it to draft papers or develop search queries for systematic reviews, its use as a tool aiding the learning process has not been examined. To address this research gap, I conducted an autoethnographic study examining my experience using ChatGPT as a more knowledgeable other that scaffolded my learning about a particular topic—the technical aspects of how ChatGPT works. Overall, ChatGPT provided me with enough content to form a general idea of its technical aspects, and I experienced its feedback as motivating and relevant. However, the answers were somewhat superficial, the text it generated was not always consistent or logical and sometimes contradictory. The instantaneous replies to my questions contributed to an experience of a 'flow'. Being 'in the zone' also meant I overestimated my knowledge and understanding, as I could not detect the contradictory responses it provided 'on the spot'. I conclude that caution is advised when ChatGPT is used as a learning aid, as we learn more about its capabilities and limitations and how humans tend to perceive and interact with these technologies.","[{""name"": ""Ana Stojanov"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11747-020-00762-y"", ""10.1016/j.patter.2022.100676"", ""10.1080/14703297.2023.2190148"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_14"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1016/j.frl.2023.103662"", ""10.1080/13825585.2012.754399"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4316084"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480"", ""10.7189/jogh.13.01003"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4346827"", ""10.1016/s2589-7500(23)00021-3"", ""10.1101/2023.02.02.23285399"", ""10.1002/wcs.1336"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2301.08653"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0017.2010.01394.x"", ""10.1080/13562517.2010.507300"", ""10.1038/d41586-023-00107-z"", ""10.1080/14623940903525140"", ""10.1126/science.adg7879""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

We used bibliometric analysis to identify the most impactful journals and articles, and the intellectual structure of the field. We used content analysis to synthesize the results within each research stream and suggest future research directions. We established two major research streams: second-language proficiency and interactions in the host country. We found inconclusive results about the role of communication with co-nationals in students’ adaptation, which contradicts the major adaptation theories. New contextualized research and the use of other theories could help explain the contradictory results and develop the existing theories. Our review suggests the need to theoretically refine the interrelationships between the interactional variables and different adaptation domains. Moreover, to create a better fit between the empirical data and the adaptation models, research should test the mediating effects of second-language proficiency and the willingness to communicate with locals. Finally, research should focus on students in non-Anglophone countries and explore the effects of remote communication in online learning on students’ adaptation. We document the intellectual structure of the research on the role of language and communication in international students’ adaptation and suggest a future research agenda.","[{""name"": ""Michał Wilczewski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ilan Alon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s12144-015-9303-4"", ""10.1007/s10490-018-9597-5"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(94)90035-3"", ""10.1177/1475240906065589"", ""10.1080/07294361003598824"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.1997.tb01087.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2005.07.013"", ""10.2307/40228014"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.04.067"", ""10.1108/S1871-3173(2009)0000003007"", ""10.4324/9780203133026"", ""10.1177/1028315307299422"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2016.08.003"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.91.3.540"", ""10.1177/002202219502600610"", ""10.1108/JSTP-10-2020-0233"", ""10.1080/00207594.2011.585158"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2008.01.001"", ""10.1093/applin/ams023"", ""10.1037/cou0000085"", ""10.1002/tsr.30708"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2013.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2015.03.012"", ""10.1007/S10734-019-00489-Y"", ""10.1375/ajgc.21.2.203"", ""10.4135/9781452233253"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.45.3.338"", ""10.1177/1028315313513036"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0129-x"", ""10.1787/b35a14e5-en"", ""10.1787/5A49E448-EN"", ""10.1080/15348458.2013.818469"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.06.003"", ""10.1007/BF02207908"", ""10.1016/J.IJINTREL.2007.12.002"", ""10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00012.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2009.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.041"", ""10.1023/A:1007108614571"", ""10.1177/1028315311435418"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(90)90030-Z"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01245.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.08.004"", ""10.1007/s00127-009-0042-4"", ""10.1111/flan.12054"", ""10.1108/S0749-7423(2012)0000017012"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2013.09.013"", ""10.1177/0022022193242006"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(94)90036-1"", ""10.1016/S0147-1767(99)00014-0"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2005.11.010"", ""10.1177/0022022194254003"", ""10.1080/01434632.2014.884099"", ""10.1080/01434632.2013.796957"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.11.004"", ""10.1080/03634529509379022"", ""10.1177/1094428114562629""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Communication', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1186/s12909-023-04373-3,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,LGBTQ plus cultural competency training for health professionals: a systematic review,"Abstract Background Health disparities experienced by LGBTQ + individuals have been partially attributed to health professionals’ lack of cultural competence to work with them. Cultural competence, the intricate integration of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors that improve cross-cultural communication and interpersonal relationships, has been used as a training framework to enhance interactions between LGBTQ + patients and health professionals. Despite multiple published LGBTQ + cultural competency trainings, there has been no quantitative appraisal and synthesis of them. This systematic review assessed articles evaluating the design and effectiveness of these trainings and examined the magnitude of their effect on cultural competence outcomes. Methods Included studies quantitatively examined the effectiveness of LGBTQ + cultural competency trainings for health professionals across all disciplines in various healthcare settings. 2,069 citations were retrieved from five electronic databases with 44 articles meeting inclusion criteria. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed by two authors utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklists. Data extracted included study design, country/region, sample characteristic, training setting, theoretical framework, training topic, modality, duration, trainer, training target, measurement instrument, effect size and key findings. This review followed the PRISMA statement and checklist to ensure proper reporting. Results 75% of the studies were published between 2017 and 2023. Four study designs were used: randomized controlled trial (n = 1), quasi-experimental pretest–posttest without control (n = 39), posttest only with control (n = 1) and posttest only without control (n = 3). Training modalities were multiple modalities with (n = 9) and without simulation (n = 25); single modality with simulation (n = 1); and with didactic lectures (n = 9). Trainings averaged 3.2 h. Ten studies employed LGBTQ + trainers. The training sessions resulted in statistically significant improvements in the following cultural competence constructs: (1) knowledge of LGBTQ + culture and health (n = 28, effect size range = 0.28 – 1.49), (2) skills to work with LGBTQ + clients (n = 8, effect size range = 0.12 – 1.12), (3) attitudes toward LGBTQ + individuals (n = 14, effect size range = 0.19 – 1.03), and (4) behaviors toward LGBTQ + affirming practices (n = 7, effect size range = 0.51 – 1.11). Conclusions The findings of this review highlight the potential of LGBTQ + cultural competency training to enhance cultural competence constructs, including (1) knowledge of LGBTQ + culture and health, (2) skills to work with LGBTQ + clients, (3) attitudes toward LGBTQ + individuals, and (4) behaviors toward LGBTQ + affirming practices, through an interdisciplinary and multi-modal approach. Despite the promising results of LGBTQ + cultural competency training in improving health professionals’ cultural competence, there are limitations in study designs, sample sizes, theoretical framing, and the absence of longitudinal assessments and patient-reported outcomes, which call for more rigorous research. Moreover, the increasing number of state and federal policies that restrict LGBTQ + health services highlight the urgency of equipping health professionals with culturally responsive training. Organizations and health systems must prioritize organizational-level changes that support LGBTQ + inclusive practices to provide access to safe and affirming healthcare services for LGBTQ + individuals.","[{""name"": ""Hyunmin Yu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dalmacio Dennis Flores"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephen Bonett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""José

10.1007/s10639-022-11214-1,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,"Impact of digital technologies upon teaching and learning in higher education in Latin America: an outlook on the reach, barriers, and bottlenecks","Abstract Digital technology and literacy can heighten the transformation of teaching and learning in higher education institutions (HEIs). This study uncovers the extent to which digital technologies have been used to advance the teaching and learning process in HEIs, and the barriers and bottlenecks to why it may not have been effectively implemented across the HEIs. The study used nine selected countries in Latin America (LATAM) based on the main focus of the educators, commercial, and financial investors; to show the level of impact/implications of computer technologies on the teaching and learning processes. We applied a two-step (mixed) methodology (through a quantitative and qualitative lens) for the research investigation, using data collected from survey we administered to faculty members in HEIs across the different countries in LATAM. In turn, we implemented a Text Mining technique (sentiment and emotional valence analysis) to analyze opinions (textual data) given by the participants to help determine challenges and obstacles to using the digital technologies for teaching and learning in the region. Quantitatively, we applied a Kruskal–Wallis H-test to analyze the collected multiple choice and ranked items in the questionnaire in order to identify prominent factors that consummately influence the reach, barriers, and bottlenecks, and where the differences may lie across the different LATAM countries. The results show that the users upheld the emphasis on lack of training, infrastructures and resources, access to internet and digital platforms, as the main challenges to the teaching–learning process. The study also empirically discussed and shed light on critical factors the HEIs, particularly in LATAM, should resolve and adopt in support of the decision-making strategies, operational policies and governance, financial investments, and policymaking, at a time when “digital technologies” have become an inevitable and indispensable part of education and learning.","[{""name"": ""Kingsley Okoye"",

10.1111/jcal.12613,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,Higher education students' experiences and opinion about distance learning during the Covid-19 pandemic,"AbstractBackgroundThe Covid‐19 pandemic has created significant challenges for the global higher education community. Understanding of students' perception has important implications for the quality of the learning process, as it affects students' engagement in learning, helps educators rethink the principles of the learning design and further improve the developed programs.ObjectivesUnderstanding of how rapid and necessary changes of learning caused by the pandemic are related to students' intrinsic motivation and awareness.MethodsThere were 832 participants in this study. Quantitative and qualitative research methods employing relevant statistical techniques were used to research students' opinions regarding the distance learning process.Results and ConclusionsOur analysis showed that first‐year students were significantly less motivated during the learning process than older students, they saw distance learning as less valuable and less interesting than the others. Our research found several positive consequences of the pandemic: working according to students' own schedule in a relaxed environment, looking at the lecture again if necessary, feeling free to ask questions and communicate with teachers and saving travel time.ImplicationsTeachers should have more understanding for the first‐year students who are threatened when it comes to developing motivation to learn and help them cope with learning anxieties, encourage their self‐belief and give them extra support during the learning process.","[{""name"": ""Aleksandra Stevanović"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Information Technology Belgrade Metropolitan University  Belgrade Serbia""]}, {""name"": ""Radoslav Božić"", ""affiliation"": [""Highschool “Svetozar Markovic”  Novi Sad Serbia""]}, {""name"": ""Slaviša Radović"", ""affiliation"": [""Open University of the Netherlands  Heerlen The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.6007/IJARBSS/v10-i5/7236"", ""10.3386/w27392"", ""10.4324/9780203463772"", ""10.1108/AEDS-05-2020-0097"", ""10.1177/1094428114555994"", ""10.3844/jssp.2010.399.403"", ""10.1080/01421590400029541"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-27104-0_34"", ""10.3390/su122410367"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00797.x"", ""10.31578/jebs.v5i2.197"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00194-2"", ""10.1080/02607476.2020.1799709"", ""10.3390/educsci10120374"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-0700-2"", ""10.3390/educsci11030134"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.1986.tb05256.x"", ""10.1007/s11092-020-09322-y"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.12.371"", ""10.17275/per.16.06.3.2"", ""10.1080/01621459.1952.10483441"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.556"", ""10.1080/01587910701305327"", ""10.1080/02701367.1989.10607413"", ""10.1152/advan.00017.2010"", ""10.1080/02607476.2020.1755205"", ""10.29333/ejmste/8345"", ""10.53300/001c.6236"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.611.115"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2008.00294.x"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1767053"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.43.3.450"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1020"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195399820.013.0002"", ""10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.09.002"", ""10.1111/jcal.12142""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/ssm.12382,SCHOOL SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS,0401 Education,Exploring the state of science stereotypes: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the Draw-A-Scientist Checklist,"AbstractThis systematic review and meta‐analysis examined recent articles that have used the 1995 Draw‐A‐Scientist Checklist (DAST‐C). This study was focused on the current state of students' stereotypes of scientists and the appropriateness of the DAST‐C as a tool to assess these perceptions. Articles included in the review were published between 2003 and 2018, resulting in n = 30 studies. Mean results across studies are presented to describe current stereotypes of scientists, and the current format of the DAST‐C is evaluated. Findings suggest that students' perceptions of scientists have largely remained consistent across time: scientists are still perceived as Caucasian, middle‐aged or elderly males who wear lab coats and work indoors. However, while the DAST‐C is a generally appropriate measure to assess students' perceptions of scientists, recommended revisions to the DAST‐C could assist in capturing more modern scientist stereotypes and culturally bound perceptions of scientists.","[{""name"": ""Sarah L.

10.1111/eje.12937,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,1003 Stomatology; 0401 Education,ChatGPT-A double-edged sword for healthcare education? Implications for assessments of dental students,"AbstractIntroductionOpen‐source generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications are fast‐transforming access to information and allow students to prepare assignments and offer quite accurate responses to a wide range of exam questions which are routinely used in assessments of students across the board including undergraduate dental students. This study aims to evaluate the performance of Chat Generative Pre‐trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a generative AI‐based application, on a wide range of assessments used in contemporary healthcare education and discusses the implications for undergraduate dental education.Materials and MethodsThis was an exploratory study investigating the accuracy of ChatGPT to attempt a range of recognised assessments in healthcare education curricula. A total of 50 independent items encompassing 50 different learning outcomes (n = 10 per item) were developed by the research team. These included 10 separate items based on each of the five commonly used question formats including multiple‐choice questions (MCQs); short‐answer questions (SAQs); short essay questions (SEQs); single true/false questions; and fill in the blanks items. Chat GPT was used to attempt each of these 50 questions. In addition, ChatGPT was used to generate reflective reports based on multisource feedback; research methodology; and critical appraisal of the literature.ResultsChatGPT application provided accurate responses to majority of knowledge‐based assessments based on MCQs, SAQs, SEQs, true/false and fill in the blanks items. However, it was only able to answer text‐based questions and did not allow processing of questions based on images. Responses generated to written assignments were also satisfactory apart from those for critical appraisal of literature. Word count was the key limitation observed in outputs generated by the free version of ChatGPT.ConclusionNotwithstanding their current limitations, generative AI‐based applications have the potential to revolutionise virtual learning. Instead of treating it as a threat, healthcare educators need to adapt teaching and assessments in medical and dental education to the benefits of the learners while mitigating against dishonest use of AI‐based technology.","[{""name"": ""Kamran Ali"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Dental Medicine QU Health Qatar University  Doha Qatar""]}, {""name"": ""Noha Barhom"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Dental Medicine QU Health Qatar University  Doha Qatar""]}, {""name"": ""Faleh Tamimi"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Dental Medicine QU Health Qatar University  Doha Qatar""]}, {""name"": ""Monty Duggal"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Dental Medicine QU Health Qatar University  Doha Qatar""]}]","[""10.1002/ajim.23037"", ""10.1007/s10439-022-03121-w"", ""10.1007/978-1-84628-943-9_12"", ""10.1016/j.sftr.2019.100004"", ""10.1613/jair.1.11222"", ""10.36227/techrxiv.21789434"", ""10.1038/sj.ebd.6400834"", ""10.2196/45312"", ""10.1080/10872981.2023.2171700"", ""10.1111/eje.12343"", ""10.21815/JDE.017.105"", ""10.1111/eje.12451"", ""10.1111/eje.12535"", ""10.1186/s12909-021-02521-1"", ""10.1111/eje.12807"", ""10.1111/eje.12236"", ""10.1111/eje.12149""]",['Medicine'],"['Family Practice', 'Health Informatics', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"
10.1002/cae.22243,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,0401 Education; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,A review of the uses of virtual reality in engineering education,"AbstractThe use of virtual environments as pedagogical tools within the domain of education has become an increasingly popular phenomenon over the last few decades especially. However, the uses and effects of virtual environments as pedagogical tools within the specific domain of engineering education have not been explored in extensive detail. The limited body of current research regarding the uses of virtual environments in engineering education affords a unique opportunity. This review provides an overview and synthesis of the uses of virtual reality within the domain of engineering education through the systematic analysis of journal articles and conference proceedings published across two databases (IEEE Xplore and Scopus) between 2015 and 2019. In summary, 17 studies were analysed utilising a systematic approach and using a coding scheme including four main categories and 12 binary items. The findings indicate an escalation in the use of virtual classroom environments as supplementary to traditional teaching environments, as well as reported substantial benefits to cognitive and skill‐based learning outcomes. The findings suggest that evaluation metrics and processes that lack clarity, together with unrealistic virtual scenarios and small evaluation sample sizes, may confound comparison and, hence, the reported substantive and beneficial use of virtual reality environments in engineering education. Scholars and educators within the domain of engineering education should continue investigating the uses and merits of virtual reality environments as pedagogical tools, taking these issues into consideration.","[{""name"": ""Jaiden A. di Lanzo"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University  Murdoch Western Australia Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew Valentine"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland  Brisbane Queensland Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Ferdous Sohel"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Science, Health, Engineering and Education, Murdoch University  Murdoch Western Australia Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Angie Y.

10.1002/rrq.311,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,A Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Text Structure Instruction on Reading Comprehension in the Upper Elementary Grades,"AbstractIn this meta‐analysis, the authors synthesize results from 44 (quasi‐)experimental studies on informational and narrative text structure interventions involving students in grades 4–6 in regular school settings. Findings show that text structure instruction had positive immediate effects on students’ reading comprehension but that effect sizes varied largely across outcome measures: questions (Hedges’g = 0.25), summarization (g = 0.57), recall (g = 0.37), and knowledge about text structure (g = 0.38). However, students who received text structure instruction no longer outperformed control groups at delayed posttests. Content‐related features, such as a focus on paragraph‐level structure, active construction of graphic organizers, and teaching rule‐based summarization techniques, moderated the effectiveness of text structure instruction, but these effects also varied across outcome measures. Instructional features moderated delayed effects: Interventions with opportunities for individual student practice resulted in higher delayed effects for comprehension questions. The authors argue that text structure instruction deserves a place in the primary school curriculum so the positive effects on reading will be maintained.","[{""name"": ""Suzanne T.M.

En concreto, la competencia digital docente (CDD) es el primer paso hacia el mejor uso de las TD en el aula. Sin embargo, no se han propuesto instrumentos que puedan ayudar a los futuros maestros en formación a autoevaluar su propia competencia y obtener un feedback instantáneo sobre el desarrollo de su propia CDD. Este estudio tiene como objetivo validar una herramienta (COMDID-A) de autoevaluación de CDD para la formación inicial de docentes, en términos de validez dimensional y externa, y en relación con la edad, el género y el acceso a la universidad. La muestra es de 144 estudiantes del grado de educación en una universidad catalana. Los resultados muestran que la estructura dimensional propuesta por el modelo teórico es altamente confiable, con cuatro dimensiones: 1. Aspectos didácticos, curriculares y metodológicos; 2. Planificación, organización y gestión de recursos y espacios tecnológicos digitales; 3. Aspectos éticos, legales y de seguridad; y 4. Desarrollo personal y profesional. Además, se miden correlaciones significativas entre la edad y la CDD, en particular, los estudiantes mayores se autoevalúan a sí mismos como menos competentes que los más jóvenes. No se observaron diferencias de género. Los resultados de este estudio ayudarán a futuros docentes e instituciones educativas, aportando una herramienta válida y confiable para guiarles en el desarrollo de su CDD. COMDID-A se puede implementar como parte de la evaluación formativa, ayudando a los estudiantes a ser conscientes de su nivel de CDD y de los siguientes pasos a realizar en su desarrollo.","[{""name"": ""Mireia Usart Rodríguez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""José Luis Lázaro Cantabrana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mercè Gisbert Cervera"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1186/s40594-020-00259-8,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Understanding coherence and integration in integrated STEM curriculum,"Abstract Background Few tools or rubrics exist to assess the quality of integrated STEM curricula, and existing tools focus on checklists of characteristics of integrated STEM. While such instruments provide important information about the presence and quality of certain curricular components, they do not assess the level and nature of integration of the curriculum as a whole. Thus, this study explores the development of a process focused to understand the nature of integration within a STEM curriculum unit. Findings A conceptual flow graphic (CFG) was constructed for 50 integrated STEM curriculum units. Patterns in the nature of the interdisciplinary connections were used to categorize and understand the nature of integration and curricular coherence within each unit. The units formed four broad types of integrated STEM curricula: (i) coherent science unit with loosely connected engineering design challenge (EDC), (ii) engineering design-focused unit with limited connections to science content, (iii) engineering design unit with science content as context, and (iv) integrated and coherent STEM units. All physical science units were in the integrated and coherent category with strong conceptual integration between the main science concepts and the EDC. Curricula based in the Earth and life sciences generally lacked conceptual integration between the science content and the EDC and relied on the engineering design process to provide a coherent storyline for the unit. Conclusions Our study shows that engineering practices can serve as a contextual integrator within a STEM unit. The utilization of an EDC also provides the potential for conceptual integration because engineering is grounded in the application of science and mathematics. Integrated STEM curricula that purposefully include science and mathematics concepts necessary to develop solutions to the EDC engage students in authentic engineering experiences and provide conceptual integration between the disciplines. However, the alignment of grade-level science standards with the EDC can be problematic, particularly in life science and Earth science. The CFG process provides a tool for determining the nature of integration between science and mathematics content and an EDC. These connections can be conceptual and/or contextual, as both forms of integration are appropriate depending on the instructional goals.","[{""name"": ""Gillian H.

The aim of this review was to summarise the evidence for implementation of IPE, and identify challenges and key lessons to guide faculty in IPE implementation. Methods Five stage scoping review of methodological characteristics, implementation components, challenges and key lessons in primary studies in IPE. Thematic analysis using a framework of micro (teaching), meso (institutional), and macro (systemic) level education factors was used to synthesise challenges and key lessons. Results Twenty-seven primary studies were included in this review. Studies were predominantly descriptive in design and implementation components inconsistently reported. IPE was mostly integrated into curricula, optional, involved group learning, and used combinations of interactive and didactic approaches. Micro level implementation factors (socialisation issues, learning context, and faculty development), meso level implementation factors (leadership and resources, administrative processes), and macro level implementation factors (education system, government policies, social and cultural values) were extrapolated. Sustainability was identified as an additional factor in IPE implementation. Conclusion Lack of complete detailed reporting limits evidence of IPE implementation, however, this review highlighted challenges and yielded key lessons to guide faculty in the implementation of IPE.","[{""name"": ""Fiona Bogossian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karen New"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kendall George"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nigel Barr"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Natalie Dodd"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anita L.

Two special purpose files were released recently. One is Photo-nuclear Data File 2016 (JENDL/PD-2016) which contains the data of photo-nuclear reaction cross sections covering a wide area of the nuclear chart. The other one is the JENDL Activation Cross Section File for Nuclear Decommissioning 2017 (JENDL/AD-2017) which provides production cross sections of radioactive nuclei by neutrons. A special purpose file JENDL/ImPACT-2018 dedicated to transmutation of long-lived fission products will be released in 2019. Regarding the general-purpose file, we are preparing to release the next version, which would be made available by 2022 as JENDL-5. Evaluation efforts on nuclides across wide range of nuclei form light to heavy have being made. The first test version JENDL-5α1 was created in 2018. The evaluated data will be updated on the basis of benchmark tests on reactor criticalities and neutron shieldings.","[{""name"": ""Osamu Iwamoto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nobuyuki Iwamoto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Keiichi Shibata"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Akira Ichihara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Satoshi Kunieda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Futoshi Minato"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shinsuke Nakayama"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/18811248.2011.9711675"", ""10.3327/jaesj.26.191"", ""10.1016/B978-0-44-463780-2.00001-3"", ""10.1080/18811248.2007.9711857"", ""10.1016/j.nds.2015.12.004"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.88.015805"", ""10.1080/00223131.2019.1588801"", ""10.1051/epjconf/201714612029"", ""10.1016/j.nds.2014.12.028"", ""10.1016/j.nds.2014.04.050"", ""10.1080/00223131.2016.1192005"", ""10.1080/00223131.2018.1479989"", ""10.1080/00223131.2017.1419887"", ""10.1080/00223131.2013.772447"", ""10.1080/00223131.2011.649085"", ""10.1080/00223131.2013.838912"", ""10.1080/00223131.2013.872585"", ""10.1080/00223131.2014.999729"", ""10.1080/00223131.2013.810125"", ""10.1080/00223131.2012.704159"", ""10.1080/00223131.2015.1083492"", ""10.1080/00223131.2016.1140599"", ""10.1080/00223131.2016.1223561"", ""10.1051/epjconf/20159306001"", ""10.1080/00223131.2018.1485519"", ""10.1080/00223131.2019.1598508"", ""10.1016/j.nds.2018.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2013.10.024"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.98.044606"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.94.014618""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Radiation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)]]"

However, the inadequate energy and noncontrollable moving directions remain the grand challenges for their promising applications. Recently, an increasing attention has been paid to these issues and numerous reported researches have focused to design and develop more efficient and precisely controllable micro/nanomotors with different methods. This review aims to summarize those studies and to introduce newly developed micro/nanomotors including synthetic micro/nanomotors and biohybrid motors, discussing the control mechanisms as well as advantages and limitations thereof.

PE teachers (n = 4,362) from all 50 states completed a survey identifying their experiences with remote instruction in May, 2020. Survey responses were analyzed by geographic region, district type, and school level. Teachers reported having students submit assignments (51% yes), using video instruction (37% yes), being less effective when instructing remotely (20% yes), and emphasizing student outcomes focused on health-related fitness (32% yes), and physical activity value/enjoyment (43% yes). Access to technology (40% yes) and required student assignments (43% yes) were lowest among teachers from the South.

10.1093/her/cyaa030,HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH,0401 Education; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine,Modelling the antecedent factors that affect online fake news sharing on COVID-19: the moderating role of fake news knowledge,"AbstractWe proposed a conceptual model combining three theories: uses and gratification theory, social networking sites (SNS) dependency theory and social impact theory to understand the factors that predict fake news sharing related to COVID-19. We also tested the moderating role of fake news knowledge in reducing the tendency to share fake news. Data were drawn from social media users (n = 650) in Nigeria, and partial least squares was used to analyse the data. Our results suggest that tie strength was the strongest predictor of fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic. We also found perceived herd, SNS dependency, information-seeking and parasocial interaction to be significant predictors of fake news sharing. The effect of status-seeking on fake news sharing, however, was not significant. Our results also established that fake news knowledge significantly moderated the effect of perceived herd, SNS dependency, information-seeking, parasocial interaction on fake news sharing related to COVID-19. However, tie strength and status-seeking effects were not moderated.","[{""name"": ""Oberiri Destiny Apuke"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Communication, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Pulau Penang, Malaysia"", ""Department of Mass Communication, Taraba State University, Jalingo, Nigeria""]}, {""name"": ""Bahiyah Omar"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Communication, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Pulau Penang, Malaysia""]}]","[""10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112552"", ""10.1108/OIR-10-2013-0239"", ""10.1002/pra2.2015.145052010083"", ""10.1177/2056305118785639"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9788-y"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.36.4.343"", ""10.1108/JSIT-05-2019-0088"", ""10.1177/1461444816643922"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2017.12.017"", ""10.1145/3242734.3242740"", ""10.1177/0739532920919825"", ""10.1177/8756972819882132"", ""10.1007/s11747-017-0517-x"", ""10.1007/s40685-018-0072-4"", ""10.1504/IJMDA.2017.10008574"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2019.05.026""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Communication', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Der Review umfasst 97 Online-Befragungen, die in der Zeit vom 24. März 2020 bis 11. November 2020 durchgeführt wurden und 255.955 Fälle (Schüler*innen, Eltern, Lehrkräfte, Schulleitungen u. a.) erfassten. Die Analyse und Synthese der Befunde erfolgt entlang zweier Modelle, dem Phasenmodell des Forschungsprozesses und einem integrativen Modell zur Distance Education. Der Review macht deutlich, dass zentrale Aspekte des Lehrens und Lernens während den coronabedingten Schulschließungen im Frühjahr 2020, wie bspw. Merkmale des Fernunterrichts (z. B. Qualitätsdimensionen), Schülermerkmale (z. B. Selbständigkeit) und Merkmale der häuslichen Ressourcen für das Lernen (z. B. die elterliche Unterstützung), bereits Gegenstand vieler Befragungen waren. Die Schulsituation während der Corona-Pandemie stellt daher kein unerforschtes Phänomen mehr dar. Vielmehr fordert das wissenschaftliche Ethos von Forscher*innen dieses Feldes, den aktuellen Forschungsstand in ihren Arbeiten zu berücksichtigen. Der vorgelegte Review soll diese Aufgabe erleichtern, indem nicht nur die existierenden Befragungen gelistet, sondern deren zentrale Erkenntnisse synthetisiert werden. Darüber hinaus liefert der Review eine relevante Informationsbasis für Entscheidungen und für das Handeln in den jeweiligen Verantwortungsbereichen der Politik, Verwaltung und Schulpraxis. Gleichzeitig warnt der Review vor einer unreflektierten Übernahme der Befunde, indem die wissenschaftliche Qualität der Befragungen kritisch diskutiert wird.","[{""name"": ""Christoph Helm"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephan Huber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tina Loisinger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2004.tb02636.x"", ""10.3102/00346543074003379"", ""10.31234/osf.io/tnrdj"", ""10.1348/096317909X481382"", ""10.1007/s10639-019-10027-z"", ""10.2307/2136404"", ""10.3102/00346543076001001"", ""10.31244/9783830993315.03"", ""10.1080/14616696.2020.1826556"", ""10.1037/a0034100"", ""10.3389/feduc.2019.00092"", ""10.31235/osf.io/ve4z7"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.11.003"", ""10.31244/9783830993315"", ""10.1016/j.rssm.2020.100554"", ""10.1177/0013164405278573"", ""10.1007/s11092-020-09322-y"", ""10.31244/9783830992318.02"", ""10.31244/9783830942160"", ""10.33902/JPR.2020062805"", ""10.31244/9783830992318.07"", ""10.31244/9783830992318.10"", ""10.1515/edu-2020-0122"", ""10.1177/016146811311500307"", ""10.1080/10872981.2019.1666538"", ""10.24059/OLJ.V21I3.1225"", ""10.31244/9783830992318.03"", ""10.1111/1471-3802.12481"", ""10.1080/15582159.2017.1395638"", ""10.1002/he.20176"", ""10.1080/08923649909527014"", ""10.31219/osf.io/r724z"", ""10.1002/ijop.12728"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.98.2.438"", ""10.1007/s42010-020-00088-2"", ""10.31244/9783830992318.04"", ""10.13140/RG.2.2.26729.93288""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

But criticism has been voiced against the heavy reliance on quantification within SNA. Recent work suggests combining quantitative and qualitative approaches in SNA—mixed methods social network analysis (MMSNA)—as a remedy. MMSNA is helpful for addressing research questions related to the formal or structural side of relationships and networks, but it also attends to more qualitative questions such as the meaning of interactions or the variability of social relationships. In this chapter, we describe how researchers have applied and presented MMSNA in publications from the perspective of general mixed methods research. Based on a systematic review, we summarize the different applications within the field of education and learning research, point to potential shortcomings of the methods and its presentation, and develop an agenda to support researchers in conducting future MMSNA research.","[{""name"": ""Dominik E.

10.1007/s10639-021-10832-5,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Key factors in digital literacy in learning and education: a systematic literature review using text mining,"AbstractThis research aims at providing an overview of the research field of digital literacy into learning and education. Using text mining, it reviews 1037 research articles published on the topic between 2000 and 2020. This review reveals that there is a plurality of terms associated with digital literacy. Moreover, our research identifies six key factors that define the literature, which are information literacy, developing digital literacy, digital learning, ICT, social media, and twenty-first century digital skills.

The authors sought to evaluate the fidelity of implementation and identify early outcomes of CBME implementation using Rapid Evaluation to facilitate transformative change. Method Case-study methodology was used to explore the lived experience of implementing CBME in the emergency medicine postgraduate program at Queen’s University, Canada, using iterative cycles of Rapid Evaluation in 2017–2018. After the intended implementation was explicitly described, stakeholder focus groups and interviews were conducted at 3 and 9 months post-implementation to evaluate the fidelity of implementation and early outcomes. Analyses were abductive, using the CBME core components framework and data-driven approaches to understand stakeholders’ experiences. Results In comparing planned with enacted implementation, important themes emerged with resultant opportunities for adaption. For example, lack of a shared mental model resulted in frontline difficulty with assessment and feedback and a concern that the granularity of competency-focused assessment may result in “missing the forest for the trees,” prompting the return of global assessment. Resident engagement in personal learning plans was not uniformly adopted, and learning experiences tailored to residents’ needs were slow to follow. Conclusions Rapid Evaluation provided critical insights into the successes and challenges of operationalizing CBME. Implementing the practical components of CBME was perceived as a sprint, while realizing the principles of CBME and changing culture in postgraduate training was a marathon requiring sustained effort in the form of frequent evaluation and continuous faculty and resident development.","[{""name"": ""Andrew K.

10.1002/rrq.401,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,Is the Science of Reading Just the Science of Reading English?,"ABSTRACTThe science of reading has made genuine progress in understanding reading and the teaching of reading, but is the science of reading just the science of reading English? Worldwide, a majority of students learn to read and write in non‐European, nonalphabetic orthographies such as abjads (e.g., Arabic), abugidas/alphasyllabaries (e.g., Hindi), or morphosyllabaries (e.g., Chinese). Over a decade ago, I argued that the extreme inconsistency of English spelling–sound correspondence had confined the science of reading to an insular, Anglocentric research agenda addressing theoretical and applied issues with limited relevance for a universal science of reading. Here, I ask if the science of reading has moved forward. Acknowledging some limited progress over the past decade, it is evident that even today, mainstream reading research remains entrenched in Anglocentrism, Eurocentrism, and another form of ethnocentrism that I call alphabetism. Even the two dominant theoretical frameworks for describing cross‐script diversity, orthographic depth and psycholinguistic grain size theory, give little or no consideration to non‐European alphabets or nonalphabetic scripts, promoting a one‐dimensional view of script variation (i.e., spelling–sound consistency). Consideration of the full spectrum of the world’s languages and writing systems reveals multiple dimensions of writing system complexity, each liable to create obstacles for the developing reader. If the science of reading is to contribute meaningfully to assessment, diagnosis, instruction, and intervention for all readers around the world, then we must extricate our field from entrenched ethnocentrism and embrace global diversity.","[{""name"": ""David L.

10.1186/s12909-020-02024-5,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Interprofessional team-based learning (TBL): how do students engage?,"Abstract Background Although challenging to integrate within university curricula, evidence suggests that interprofessional education (IPE) positively impacts communication and teamwork skills in the workplace. The nature of Team-based learning (TBL) lends itself to interprofessional education, with the capacity to foster a culture of collaboration among health professional students. Our study was designed to pilot an interprofessional ‘back pain’ TBL module for physiotherapy and medical students, and to explore their experience of the TBL process, using the conceptual framework of ‘knowledge reconsolidation’ to discuss our finding. Methods Three hundred and eleven students participated in the TBL session: 222/277 (80%) of Year 1 medical students and 89/89 (100%) of Year 2 physiotherapy students. Students completed one interprofessional Musculoskeletal Sciences TBL session on the topic of ‘back pain’. A questionnaire including closed and open-ended items, was distributed to students immediately following completion of the TBL session. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the quantitative data. Thematic analysis was used to code and categorise qualitative data into themes. Pre-class quiz scores were compared between the groups using a one-way between groups Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test with Tukeys Post Hoc test. Results In total, 117/311 (38%) of participants completed the questionnaire. Both medicine and physiotherapy students appreciated the opportunity to learn about the curriculum of another healthcare discipline, and their scope of practice; gain multiple perspectives on a patient case from different disciplines; and recognised the importance of multidisciplinary teams in patient care. Students felt having an interprofessional team of facilitators who provided immediate feedback helped to consolidate student learning and promoted clinical reasoning. An analysis of variance revealed no difference between Physiotherapy and Medical students’ pre-class quiz scores. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the small group and task-focused characteristics of TBL provided a student-centred teaching strategy to support the achievement of interprofessional learning goals. Students valued their interactions with other students from a different professional degree, the opportunity to problem solve together, and learn different perspectives on a patient case. The pre-class quiz results demonstrate that both groups of students had a comparative level of prior knowledge to be able to work together on the in-class activities.","[{""name"": ""Annette Burgess"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eszter Kalman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Inam Haq"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrew Leaver"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jane Bleasel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3109/0142159X.2016.1173663"", ""10.1002/14651858.CD002213.pub3"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.04143.x"", ""10.3109/13561820.2012.715604"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61854-5"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000162"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2013.849802"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2017.1340636"", ""10.1097/NNE.0000000000000370"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000002810"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318244759e"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e318193ae85"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.1999.00298.x"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.81.3.392"", ""10.1080/00461520903213592"", ""10.1007/BF03341667"", ""10.1080/01421590802585561"", ""10.1037/h0022100"", ""10.1177/1046496491222001"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.651179"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0210912"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1497.2003.21049.x"", ""10.1080/13562517.2016.1221811"", ""10.1080/1356182021000044139"", ""10.18552/ijpblhsc.v4i2.351"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0717-y""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Regression analysis indicates the minimal factors for enrollment in future classes—when students consider convenience and scheduling—were Basic Online Modality, Cognitive Presence, and Online Social Comfort. Students who accepted or embraced online courses on their own merits wanted a minimum of Basic Online Modality, Teaching Presence, Cognitive Presence, Online Social Comfort, and Social Presence. Students, who preferred face-to-face classes and demanded a comparable experience, valued Online Interactive Modality and Instructional Support more highly.

10.1186/s41239-021-00314-6,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Gamification suffers from the novelty effect but benefits from the familiarization effect: Findings from a longitudinal study,"AbstractThere are many claims that gamification (i.e., using game elements outside games) impact decreases over time (i.e., the novelty effect). Most studies analyzing this effect focused on extrinsic game elements, while fictional and collaborative competition have been recently recommended. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no long-term research has been carried out with STEM learners from introductory programming courses (CS1), a context that demands encouraging practice and mitigating motivation throughout the semester. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to better understand how the impact of a gamification design, featuring fictional and competitive-collaborative elements, changes over a 14-week period of time, when applied to CS1 courses taken by STEM students (N = 756). In an ecological setting, we followed a 2x7 quasi-experimental design, where Brazilian STEM students completed assignments in either a gamified or non-gamified version of the same system, which provided the measures (number of attempts, usage time, and system access) to assess user behavior at seven points in time. Results indicate changes in gamification’s impact that appear to follow a U-shaped pattern. Supporting the novelty effect, the gamification’s effect started to decrease after four weeks, decrease that lasted between two to six weeks. Interestingly, the gamification’s impact shifted to an uptrend between six and 10 weeks after the start of the intervention, partially recovering its contribution naturally. Thus, we found empirical evidence supporting that gamification likely suffers from the novelty effect, but also benefits from the familiarization effect, which contributes to an overall positive impact on students. These findings may provide some guidelines to inform practitioners about how long the initial contributions of gamification last, and how long they take to recover after some reduction in benefits. It can also help researchers to realize when to apply/evaluate interventions that use gamification by taking into consideration the novelty effect and, thereby, better understand the real impact of gamification on students’ behavior in the long run.","[{""name"": ""Luiz Rodrigues"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Filipe D.

10.1111/jcal.12423,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,0401 Education,"Face-to-face, blended, flipped, or online learning environment? Impact on learning performance and student cognitions","AbstractThis study compares four learning environments: face‐to‐face learning (F2F), fully e‐learning (EL), blended learning (BL), and flipped classroom (FC) with respect to students' learning performance. Moreover, this present research studies changes in perceived flexibility, intrinsic motivation, self‐efficacy beliefs of students, and the interaction effects in these student variables on learning performance. Two learning environment design elements: (1) lectures (2) group discussions building on guiding questions, were manipulated to create the four learning environments. Third‐year undergraduate students (n = 106), enrolled in the “Animal and Human Physiology” course at CanTho University (Vietnam), were randomly assigned to one of the four learning environments. The results suggest a significant positive differential effect on learning performance when studying in a FC and BL setting. No significant interaction effects could be observed regarding changes in perceived flexibility, intrinsic motivation and self‐efficacy. However, significant differences between learning conditions were observed in perceived flexibility. Analysis of focus group data corroborate the finding that students experience more flexibility in time and place when studying in FC, BL and EL environments. In addition, students in a FC environment reflect significantly larger positive changes in their self‐efficacy. But, the qualitative data show how positive perceptions about flexibility, motivation and self‐efficacy are often cancelled out by negative perceptions.","[{""name"": ""Ngoc Thuy Thi Thai"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Studies Ghent University  Ghent Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Bram De Wever"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Studies Ghent University  Ghent Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Valcke"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Educational Studies Ghent University  Ghent Belgium""]}]","[""10.1080/08832323.2014.929559"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2005.00454.x"", ""10.1348/000712608X377117"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.37.2.122"", ""10.1002/ase.1396"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v13i2.1124"", ""10.1016/j.ijosm.2013.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.06.001"", ""10.1097/JOM.0b013e3182a50016"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.2011.02031.x"", ""10.3102/00346543065003245"", ""10.1080/15213269.2015.1049276"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.07.004"", ""10.1111/1467-8535.00026"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9605-9"", ""10.1080/07294360903277380"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2005.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.08.008"", ""10.1002/cae.20476"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2005.03.002"", ""10.1080/00461520.1996.9653264"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.03.020"", ""10.1080/09523980410001680879"", ""10.1080/09687760601130057"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4609.2006.00114.x"", ""10.1080/00461520.2012.748005"", ""10.1080/87567555.1986.9926766"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-0657-3_12"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2004.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2011.02.003"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9605-9"", ""10.1080/09687769.2010.529111"", ""10.1080/09687769.2010.529111"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.03.001"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.07.001"", ""10.1080/03075070120099368"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2958.2010.01393.x"", ""10.1002/job.4030140409"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.10.023"", ""10.1109/TE.2010.2102028"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.050"", ""10.1007/s10755-009-9108-1"", ""10.1007/BF00155664"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.03.119"", ""10.1080/03075070600572090"", ""10.1177/1477878509104318"", ""10.1080/03634529609379053"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.58.3.472"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2013.03.002"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_1"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2003.08.003"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(02)00130-6"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2006.10.001"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1020"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.02.025"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2004.07.010"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-6868-5_10"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.017"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.94.3.429"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2011.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.05.009"", ""10.1177/030630700903400305"", ""10.5539/elt.v6n5p141"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2014.02.017"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2008.09.006"", ""10.1016/0959-4752(94)90003-5"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.926"", ""10.1007/s10734-013-9677-x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2005.06.004"", ""10.1177/0022427814538033"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.07.020"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2012.02.098"", ""10.1177/009365096023001001"", ""10.1080/15213269.2010.524913"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00621.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.03.004"", ""10.14742/ajet.869"", ""10.1007/s11251-005-1280-9"", ""10.1089/cpb.2006.9.441"", ""10.1007/s11162-004-4139-z"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.002"", ""10.1145/986213.986216""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

To provide transparency and create a nuanced picture of learning, we problematized the measurement of equity by using two competing operationalizations of equity: Equity of Individuality and Equality of Learning. These two models led to conflicting conclusions. The analyses used hierarchical linear models to examine student's conceptual learning as measured by gains in scores on research‐based assessments administered as pretests and posttests. The data came from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes' (LASSO) national database and included data from 13,857 students in 187 first‐semester college physics courses. Findings showed differences in student gains across gender and race. Large gender differences existed for White and Hispanic students but not for Asian, Black, and Pacific Islander students. The models predicted larger gains for students in collaborative learning than in lecture‐based courses. The Equity of Individuality operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction improved equity because all groups learned more with collaborative learning. The Equality of Learning operationalization indicated that collaborative instruction did not improve equity because differences between groups were unaffected. We discuss the implications of these mixed findings and identify areas for future research using critical quantitative perspectives in education research.","[{""name"": ""Ben Van Dusen"", ""affiliation"": [""California State University Chico  Chico California""]}, {""name"": ""Jayson Nissen"", ""affiliation"": [""California State University Chico  Chico California""]}]","[""10.1080/00221546.2016.1257313"", ""10.18637/jss.v067.i01"", ""10.1207/s15327906mbr4003_5"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.6.010106"", ""10.5993/AJHB.32.1.8"", ""10.1119/1.3703517"", ""10.1037/bul0000052"", ""10.1080/15348431.2011.556519"", ""10.1080/13613324.2017.1377412"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020104"", ""10.1063/1.3680022"", ""10.1186/2193-1801-2-222"", ""10.1080/19407882.2017.1331854"", ""10.3102/1076998614563393"", ""10.1080/00131880701717198"", ""10.1073/pnas.1319030111"", ""10.1002/ir.363"", ""10.5951/jresematheduc.39.4.0357"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-9803-0_2"", ""10.1119/1.18809"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.020103"", ""10.1119/1.2343497"", ""10.1119/perc.2017.pr.041"", ""10.3102/0091732X18759072"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.13.020135"", ""10.3102/0002831218777225"", ""10.1300/J501v27n03_09"", ""10.1002/sce.20208"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.5.010101"", ""10.3102/0013189X035007003"", ""10.1177/016146819509700104"", ""10.1002/tea.20292"", ""10.3102/00346543069001083"", ""10.1080/13613324.2017.1375185"", ""10.1119/1.2162549"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.010115"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.9.020121"", ""10.1007/s11162-014-9344-9"", ""10.1063/1.1807248"", ""10.1080/07370008.2017.1355211"", ""10.1615/JWomenMinorScienEng.2016013400"", ""10.1057/fr.2008.4"", ""10.1002/sce.21032"", ""10.1525/sp.2005.52.4.593"", ""10.1002/tea.21268"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.8.020103"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020113"", ""10.1177/096228029900800102"", ""10.1002/ir.200"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.5.010105"", ""10.1119/1.18863"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.010103"", ""10.18637/jss.v045.i03"", ""10.1119/perc.2017.pr.095"", ""10.1119/perc.2016.pr.085""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Safety Research']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Increasing studies report students’ language-related challenges and linguistic preparedness to be major barriers to successful implementation of EMI. These challenges, which have accompanied an unfettered growth in EMI provision, impact on practitioners and students and highlight the role of ELT practitioners in providing language support. This paper outlines how EMI is changing the role of ELT practitioners in the internationalized and ‘Englishized’ higher education sector, who increasingly teach on EAP programmes. EMI research is in a relative stage of infancy, yet a growing body of evidence highlights the importance of academic and language support. Drawing on evidence from recent research, we explore the integral role that ELT instructors have in helping students with their content learning, and make suggestions to facilitate greater integration of ELT within EMI contexts.","[{""name"": ""Nicola Galloway"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Heath Rose"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.esp.2011.01.001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-51976-0"", ""10.1558/wap.v8i1.30051"", ""10.1016/j.jeap.2020.100846"", ""10.1080/13670050.2018.1493084"", ""10.1080/13670050.2016.1231166"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-51976-0_4"", ""10.1007/s10734-013-9660-6"", ""10.30687/978-88-6969-227-7/001"", ""10.1080/13670050.2019.1707768""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1186/s41239-021-00306-6,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Effects of using mobile instant messaging on student behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement: a quasi-experimental study","AbstractMobile instant messaging (MIM) has become the most popular means for young people to communicate. MIM apps typically come with a myriad of features that educators may leverage to increase student learning. However, it remains poorly understood to what extent and in what aspect MIM can facilitate student engagement. We address the gap by comparing the effects of using MIM and asynchronous online discussion (AOD) on student online engagement, using a quasi-experimental study involving a historical cohort control group. Understanding which communication mode can better promote student online engagement is particularly important during the current widespread use of online learning. Specifically, we examined engagement from the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions. The results showed that the MIM group was more behaviorally engaged in discussion activities, producing more messages, more words, and higher rates of participation, task completion, and interaction. Emotionally, no statistically significant difference was found in students’ affective evaluation of course interaction and satisfaction between the two groups. However, MIM appeared to help students with improved intimacy and interpersonal relationships. Cognitively, the MIM group was more engaged than the AOD group. In particular, MIM seemed to facilitate interactive idea exchange and thus contributing to more “creating” activities. We conclude by providing suggestions for future instructional practice and research directions.","[{""name"": ""Ying Tang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Khe Foon Hew"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1504/IJMLO.2014.067022"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-7286-2.ch008"", ""10.1016/j.system.2016.07.004"", ""10.1002/pits.20303"", ""10.1080/00461520701621079"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.024"", ""10.1177/1094670511411703"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2016.1522a"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.047"", ""10.3102/00346543053004445"", ""10.14260/jemds/2015/2030"", ""10.2307/25148857"", ""10.1177/0894439318806853"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00199-x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_5"", ""10.1089/cpb.2008.0107"", ""10.3102/00346543074001059"", ""10.1207/S15327973rls3204_2"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(00)00016-6"", ""10.1080/08923649709526970"", ""10.14742/ajet.1714"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.10.010"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00789.x"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.39.10.1123"", ""10.1080/10494820.2015.1113706"", ""10.1016/0147-1767(85)90062-8"", ""10.1111/bjet.12671"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v19i5.3765"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.1.33"", ""10.1111/bjet.12057"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7_1"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.jmir.2015.06.007"", ""10.4054/DemRes.2018.39.22"", ""10.1111/bjet.12571"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.05.001"", ""10.14742/ajet.4571"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-00188-0"", ""10.1207/S15389286AJDE1603_2"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-4542-4.ch005"", ""10.7275/17hj-1k58"", ""10.14742/ajet.2640"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v15i2.1709"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01140.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103956"", ""10.1007/s11423-019-09679-y"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.084"", ""10.1007/s11251-006-0004-0""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02483-w,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Digital learning designs in physiotherapy education: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"AbstractBackgroundDigital learning designs have the potential to support teaching and learning within higher education. However, the research on digital learning designs within physiotherapy education is limited. This study aims to identify and investigate the effectiveness of digital learning designs in physiotherapy education.MethodsThe study was designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized trials. A search of eight databases on digital learning designs and technology was conducted. Study selection, methodology and quality assessment were performed independently by three reviewers. The included studies were mapped according to the types of digital interventions and studies. For similar interventions, the learning effects were calculated using meta-analyses.ResultsAltogether, 22 studies were included in the review (17 randomized controlled trials and five cohort studies). A blended learning design was used in 21 studies, a flipped classroom model in five and a distance learning design in one. Altogether, 10 of the 22 articles were included in meta-analyses, which showed statistically significant effects for flipped classrooms on knowledge acquisition (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20, 0.62), for interactive websites or applications (apps) on practical skills (SMD: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.71,1.43) and for students self-produced videos on a practical skill in a cervical spine scenario (SMD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.93). Overall, the effects indicated that blended learning designs are equally as or more effective than traditional classroom teaching to achieve learning outcomes. Distance learning showed no significant differences compared to traditional classroom teaching.ConclusionsThe current findings from physiotherapy education indicate that digital learning designs in the form of blended learning and distance learning were equally or more effective compared to traditional teaching. The meta-analyses revealed significant effects on student learning in favour of the interventions using flipped classrooms, interactive websites/apps and students self-produced videos. However, these results must be confirmed in larger controlled trials. Further, research should investigate how digital learning designs can facilitate students’ learning of practical skills and behaviour, learning retention and approaches to studying as well as references for teaching and learning in digital learning environments.","[{""name"": ""Nina Bjerketveit Ødegaard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hilde Tinderholt Myrhaug"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tone Dahl-Michelsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yngve Røe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2004.tb00809.x"", ""10.1097/NNE.0000000000000554"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1144-z"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.642831"", ""10.1177/2382120517720428"", ""10.1080/10833196.2018.1447423"", ""10.1186/s12909-015-0429-8"", ""10.3109/09593985.2010.493192"", ""10.1136/bmj.g7647"", ""10.1108/14676370810842201"", ""10.1186/s13643-016-0384-4"", ""10.1136/bmj.d5928"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2004.02.001"", ""10.1080/07294360.2014.934336"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2016.03.008"", ""10.1002/ase.1602"", ""10.1007/s10459-012-9355-2"", ""10.1007/s10459-012-9356-1"", ""10.1016/j.math.2012.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.jmpt.2012.10.007"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0775-1"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.007"", ""10.2196/16258"", ""10.1007/s13187-015-0979-9"", ""10.20396/etd.v19i2.8645950"", ""10.1590/S1413-35552012000100012"", ""10.1080/10494820.2019.1579234"", ""10.1097/CPT.0000000000000112"", ""10.1097/00001416-201307000-00007"", ""10.1080/14703297.2012.728876"", ""10.1002/ase.1772"", ""10.1097/JTE.0000000000000035"", ""10.1097/00001416-201407000-00006"", ""10.1515/fon-2018-0032"", ""10.1177/2332858419870489"", ""10.1007/BF02505024"", ""10.2196/12937"", ""10.1002/cae.21979"", ""10.1007/BF00138871"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104022""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.3390/educsci11080402,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Digital Competence Assessment Methods in Higher Education: A Systematic Literature Review,"The rapid increase in recent years in the number of different digital competency frameworks, models, and strategies has prompted an increasing popularity for making the argument in favor of the need to evaluate and assess digital competence. To support the process of digital competence assessment, it is consequently necessary to understand the different approaches and methods. This paper carries out a systematic literature review and includes an analysis of the existing proposals and conceptions of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education, with the aim of better understanding the field of research. The review follows three objectives: (i) describe the characteristics of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education; (ii) provide an overview of current trends; and, finally, (iii) identify challenges and issues in digital competence assessment in higher education with a focus on the reliability and validity of the proposed methods. On the basis of the findings, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital competence assessment in higher education requires more attention, with a specific focus on instrument validity and reliability. Furthermore, it will be of great importance to further investigate the use of assessment tools to support systematic digital competence assessment processes. The analysis includes possible opportunities and ideas for future lines of work in digital competence evaluation in higher education.","[{""name"": ""Linda Helene Sillat"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Digital Technologies, Tallinn University, 10120 Tallinn, Estonia""]}, {""name"": ""Kairit Tammets"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Digital Technologies, Tallinn University, 10120 Tallinn, Estonia""]}, {""name"": ""Mart Laanpere"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Digital Technologies, Tallinn University, 10120 Tallinn, Estonia""]}]","[""10.1108/EUM0000000007083"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883900"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010"", ""10.1080/00220272.2012.668938"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104212"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2016.05.002"", ""10.1002/9780470754887"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0065-y"", ""10.1016/j.lisr.2016.05.004"", ""10.1007/s10639-017-9599-9"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0119-9"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.546"", ""10.1145/2808580.2808633"", ""10.2190/EC.38.3.a"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.11.015"", ""10.1109/SIIE.2015.7451655"", ""10.1177/0735633115620432"", ""10.1145/3012430.3012510"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.05.002"", ""10.1109/ICEEI.2017.8312429"", ""10.1145/3144826.3145372"", ""10.5455/jcme.20170119025603"", ""10.14812/cuefd.299864"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.05.016"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.04.040"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2018.02.009"", ""10.7575/aiac.ijalel.v.10n.1p.63"", ""10.1051/shsconf/20184801012"", ""10.1515/commun-2017-0051"", ""10.20944/preprints201806.0285.v2"", ""10.1016/j.acalib.2018.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.11.012"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.jobcr.2017.10.001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91152-6_6"", ""10.1080/02619768.2020.1809650"", ""10.1002/j.2333-8504.2003.tb01908.x""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Computer Science']","['Information Systems', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7711), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7598)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02433-6,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Vertical integration in medical education: the broader perspective,"AbstractCurricular integration represents collaborations between disciplines to establish a coherent curriculum and has become the dominant recommendation for medical education in the second half of the twentieth century. Vertical integration specifically is the integration between the clinical and basic science parts throughout the program. Vertically integrated curricula present basic sciences imbedded in a clinical context from the start of medical school.The authors briefly discuss vertical integration in relationship with context theory, motivation theory, professional identity formation, transition to practice and the continuum of education and practice. They conclude that vertical integration, rather than horizontal integration, extends far beyond curriculum structure. They consider vertical integration a philosophy of education, with impact on students’ maturation and engagement with the profession, and which applies not only to undergraduate education but to the lifelong learning of professionals.

Furthermore, moderator analyses revealed that the effects varied as a function of three prompts features: feedback, specificity and adaptability.ImplicationsDeveloping task‐specific, individual‐adaptive prompts and feedback should be a design principle in CBLEs, such that the prompt effect could be retained, sustainably enhanced and transferred to novel situations.","[{""name"": ""Lin Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Languages, Literatures and Linguistics Department Syracuse University  Syracuse New York USA""]}]","[""10.1002/tea.21272"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4004_2"", ""10.1080/00461520.2015.1004069"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.96.3.523"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2003.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.025"", ""10.1007/s11251-005-1272-9"", ""10.3390/computers6010007"", ""10.2190/94V6-R58H-3367-G388"", ""10.1024/1010-0652.23.2.139"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2008.07.002"", ""10.1007/s11409-007-9009-6"", ""10.1007/s11251-011-9167-4"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.038"", ""10.1080/00461520.2013.838920"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.09.007"", ""10.1016/s0883-0355(99)00014-2"", ""10.1002/9780470743386"", ""10.1080/15623599.2018.1492760"", ""10.1016/0364-0213(94)90016-7"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2004.09.007"", ""10.1080/00220973.2018.1448744"", ""10.1080/095006900412293"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2018.03.002"", ""10.3102/0034654314540006"", ""10.1007/s10648-015-9320-8"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2011.00476.x"", ""10.1007/s11409-008-9029-x"", ""10.1007/s10648-008-9083-6"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.041"", ""10.1080/00461520.2011.538645"", ""10.1136/bmj.315.7109.629"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.05.002"", ""10.1186/s41039-021-00148-w"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.02.019"", ""10.1037/a0028088"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2011.11.017"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2009.00320.x"", ""10.1016/j.erap.2011.12.005"", ""10.1007/s11409-020-09227-7"", ""10.1024/1010-0652.23.2.95"", ""10.1080/14623943.2021.1995856"", ""10.1177/016146811111300204"", ""10.1007/s11409-007-9016-7"", ""10.3102/10769986006002107"", ""10.1136/bmj.327.7414.557"", ""10.1007/BF02504914"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2008.12.001"", ""10.1080/13803610903444519"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.100292"", ""10.1080/00461520.2012.748006"", ""10.2190/ax2d-y9vm-v7px-0tad"", ""10.2190/EC.38.2.a"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2011.04.001"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1"", ""10.2190/EC.50.3.a"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00157.x"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.05.003"", ""10.1080/09500790.2010.519024"", ""10.1007/s11423-010-9153-6"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2013.07.051"", ""10.1007/s11251-018-9472-2"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199909)36:7<837::AID-TEA6>3.0.CO;2-U"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2008.07.010"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2013.04.003"", ""10.1007/s40593-018-0164-5"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2010.02.007"", ""10.1007/s11251-010-9154-1"", ""10.1007/s11251-007-9028-3"", ""10.1007/s10758-015-9269-1"", ""10.1080/13803610903444592"", ""10.1207/S1532690XCI1902_02"", ""10.1007/s10648-007-9047-2"", ""10.1002/sce.21295"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.102"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2008.05.002"", ""10.1080/00461520.2012.693354"", ""10.1080/01443410903353294"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.022"", ""10.1007/s10648-004-0006-x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9817.2010.01450.x"", ""10.1207/s15327809jls1303_2"", ""10.1037/a0026838"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2010.07.004"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2014.07.003"", ""10.1007/s11409-007-9015-8"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100791"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2005.01.002"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.2009.01155.x"", ""10.1037/a0018080"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2007.01.023"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.10.004"", ""10.1046/j.0266-4909.2003.00005.x"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2021.101976"", ""10.1024/1010-0652.23.2.105"", ""10.1007/s11423-014-9343-8"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106318"", ""10.1007/s10648-010-9127-6"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2003.10.001"", ""10.1007/s11409-006-6893-0"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjf9vz4"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1015"", ""10.3200/GENP.132.4.408-428"", ""10.1007/s10648-008-9080-9"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03087"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep3804_1"", ""10.1080/10447318.2018.1543084"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2020.106596"", ""10.1111/j.1469-7610.1976.tb00381.x"", ""10.1348/000709901158514"", ""10.33225/jbse/18.17.43"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50031-7"", ""10.3102/0002831207312909""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Education', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"
10.1039/c9rp00158a,CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,0401 Education,Trends and perceptions of choosing chemistry as a major and a career,"In many countries, the choice of a STEM career, especially in chemistry, is decreasing. A shortage of appropriately skilled workers can become a threat to any country's future achievements. Our research strives to understand behavioral trends and career choice factors related to personal and environmental themes. Building on the foundations of the Social Cognitive Career Theory, the research sheds light on prospective trends and retrospective perceptions of chemistry-related professionals in choosing chemistry in high school, as a career, and as a STEM occupation. To analyze the prospective trends in choosing chemistry, we used data curated by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics on 545 778 high school graduates. For the retrospective perceptions of choosing a chemistry career, we investigated three research groups (N = 190): chemists and chemical engineers, chemistry teachers, and third year undergraduate chemistry students. We found that choosing chemistry as a major and profession decreases from high school to higher education. Women tend to choose chemistry more than men at high school and university levels, and minorities tend to choose it more in high school but less in higher education compared to non-minorities. Task-oriented self-efficacy was the factor which contributed the most to chemistry career choice in all three research groups. The theoretical contribution is the unique SCCT application through the integration of both the prospective views on the behavioral theme and the retrospective views on the personal and environmental themes. Furthermore, we present new chemistry-related factors within the personal theme of this theoretical framework that can extend the SCCT framework.","[{""name"": ""Shirly Avargil"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education in Science and Technology, Technion"", ""Israel Institute of Technology"", ""Haifa 3200003"", ""Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Zehavit Kohen"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education in Science and Technology, Technion"", ""Israel Institute of Technology"", ""Haifa 3200003"", ""Israel""]}, {""name"": ""Yehudit Judy Dori"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education in Science and Technology, Technion"", ""Israel Institute of Technology"", ""Haifa 3200003"", ""Israel"", ""Samuel Neaman Institute""]}]","[""10.1002/tea.21102"", ""10.1039/C6RP00212A"", ""10.1016/0022-1031(86)90045-4"", ""10.1002/j.1556-6676.1999.tb02470.x"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.90.3.516"", ""10.1039/C8RP00098K"", ""10.1002/tea.3660320104"", ""10.1521/jscp.1986.4.3.359"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90022-L"", ""10.1177/1069072707305759"", ""10.1521/jscp.1986.4.3.279"", ""10.1016/S0001-8791(02)00034-9"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0118-3"", ""10.1002/tea.21341"", ""10.1002/chem.201600474"", ""10.1002/tea.10103"", ""10.1039/C4RP00025K"", ""10.1002/tea.21542"", ""10.1080/09500693.2017.1360532"", ""10.1039/C6RP00148C"", ""10.1177/0002716211416925"", ""10.1039/C1RP90050A"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199601)33:1<5::AID-TEA1>3.0.CO;2-Z"", ""10.1002/tea.20363"", ""10.1177/0162353211425100"", ""10.1037/h0077731"", ""10.1007/s10763-009-9177-8"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0165037"", ""10.1007/s10956-010-9269-9"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2008.01.002"", ""10.1007/s11165-005-9008-z"", ""10.1002/sce.20441"", ""10.1002/j.2161-0045.2014.00075.x"", ""10.1080/09500693.2015.1017863"", ""10.1039/C6RP00248J"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9617-5"", ""10.1080/03057267.2018.1442900"", ""10.1002/sce.21007"", ""10.1039/C7RP00221A"", ""10.1039/C2RP20053H"", ""10.1039/C8RP90006J"", ""10.1080/09500693.2019.1570380"", ""10.1021/ed400667q"", ""10.1007/s10648-015-9355-x"", ""10.1177/0956797612458937"", ""10.1177/0020715218780475"", ""10.1002/tea.20195"", ""10.1006/ceps.1999.1016""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Safety Research']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000004523,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,The Role of Technology in Health Professions Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked radical shifts in the ways that both health care and health professions education are delivered. Before the pandemic, some degree programs were offered fully online or in a hybrid format, but in-person learning was considered essential to the education and training of health professionals. Similarly, even as the use of telehealth was slowly expanding, most health care visits were conducted in-person. The need to maintain a safe physical distance during the pandemic rapidly increased the online provision of health care and health professions education, accelerating technology adoption in both academic and professional health care settings. Many health care professionals, educators, and patients have had to adapt to new communication modalities, often with little or no preparation. Before the pandemic, the need for cost-effective, robust methodologies to enable teaching across distances electronically was recognized. During the pandemic, online learning and simulation became essential and were often the only means available for continuity of education and clinical training.

10.3390/educsci11030099,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,The Impact of COVID-19 on Learning: Investigating EFL Learners' Engagement in Online Courses in Saudi Arabia,"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, most learning around the world has been transferred online. Learners who previously engaged in traditional learning now face a new challenge, a distinctive rise in e-learning. This drastic change could impact their learning behavior and acceptance of the change. As a result, their learning engagement could be affected massively. The present study therefore explores learners’ level of engagement in online courses using a designated school platform within the context of Saudi Arabia. A reliable measure was implemented in the study based on the Student Course Engagement Questionnaire (SCEQ). A survey was consequently conducted in a high school in Saudi Arabia, with a sample of 379 female English as a foreign language (EFL) learners studying a general English language course. The results revealed a high level of engagement among EFL Saudi learners. This helped to generate recommendations to improve EFL practices, primarily through the use of an online environment either at the national level in the Saudi context or the international level.","[{""name"": ""Iman Oraif"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English Language and Literature, College of Languages and Translation, Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, Riyadh 3204, Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Tariq Elyas"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of European Languages and Literature, Faculty of Arts and Humanities, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia""]}]","[""10.1007/978-981-13-6031-2"", ""10.1177/2158244020926570"", ""10.4236/ce.2020.117071"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.12.020"", ""10.1109/VS-GAMES.2013.6624228"", ""10.1002/hbe2.191"", ""10.1177/016146811411600411"", ""10.1177/0145482X1510900215"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2013.11.039"", ""10.3200/JOER.98.3.184-192"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.01.006"", ""10.1111/weng.12073"", ""10.3390/educsci11020047"", ""10.3390/educsci10090232"", ""10.1080/0307507052000307786"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00234"", ""10.1016/j.jare.2020.03.005"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.1.22""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1007/s10798-021-09657-7,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Students' attitudes toward technology: exploring the relationship among affective, cognitive and behavioral components of the attitude construct","AbstractWhen studying attitudes toward technology education, the affective attitudinal component has primarily been the focus. This study focuses on how the affective, cognitive and behavioral attitudinal components of technology education can be incorporated using a two-step survey: the traditional PATT-questionnaire (PATT-SQSE) and the recently developed Mitcham Score questionnaire. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship among the cognitive, affective and potential behavioural components of students’ attitudes toward technology in a Swedish context, using the PATT-SQ-SE instrument including the Mitcham score open items. Results of the analyses show that relationships among the attitudinal components are observable. The results also imply that relationships among the attitudinal components are different for girls than boys. A key factor for the participating students’ attitudinal relations was interest (affective component) in technology education. An individual interest in technology education was related to both the cognitive component and behavioral intention. Another key relationship, for girls, was that the cognitive component had a strong relationship with behavioral intention, which was not the case for boys. Based on the observed relations between the cognitive, affective and behavioural components we have identified two key implications for educational practice: Girls should learn a broader conception of technology in technology education, if we want them to pursue technology-related careers to a higher degree; Students’ interest in technology should be stimulated through engaging tasks in technology education.","[{""name"": ""Johan Svenningsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gunnar Höst"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Magnus Hultén"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonas Hallström"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09500693.2015.1098789"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.27"", ""10.1007/s10798-017-9434-z"", ""10.1007/s10798-018-9443-6"", ""10.1007/s10798-014-9268-x"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.47.6.1191"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2010.513419"", ""10.1080/19312450709336664"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_4"", ""10.1187/cbe.12-11-0197"", ""10.11613/BM.2012.031"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226825397.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00131911.2018.1483892"", ""10.1080/00958964.2017.1310083"", ""10.1002/tea.21416"", ""10.1007/s10798-016-9392-x"", ""10.1007/s10798-019-09530-8"", ""10.1002/sce.20467""]","['Environmental Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"
10.1111/medu.14201,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Situational judgement test validity for selection: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"AbstractContextSituational judgement tests (SJTs) are widely used to evaluate ‘non‐academic’ abilities in medical applicants. However, there is a lack of understanding of how their predictive validity may vary across contexts. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to synthesise existing evidence relating to the validity of such tools for predicting outcomes relevant to interpersonal workplace performance.MethodsSearches were conducted in relevant databases to June 2019. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Results were pooled using random effects meta‐analysis and meta‐regressions.ResultsInitially, 470 articles were identified, 218 title or abstracts were reviewed, and 44 full text articles were assessed with 30 studies meeting the final inclusion criteria and were judged, overall, to be at moderate risk of bias. Of these, 26 reported correlation coefficients relating to validity, with a pooled estimate of 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.39, P &lt; .0001). Considerable heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 96.5%) with the largest validity coefficients tending to be observed for postgraduate, rather than undergraduate, selection studies (β = 0.23, 0.11 to 0.36, P &lt; .001). The correction of validity coefficients for attenuation was also independently associated with larger effects (β = 0.13, 0.03 to 0.23, P = .01). No significant associations with test medium (video vs text format), cross‐sectional study design, or period of assessment (one‐off vs longer‐term) were observed. Where reported, the scores generally demonstrated incremental predictive validity, over and above tests of knowledge and cognitive ability.ConclusionsThe use of SJTs in medical selection is supported by the evidence. The observed trend relating to training stage requires investigation. Further research should focus on developing robust criterion‐relevant outcome measures that, ideally, capture interpersonal aspects of typical workplace performance. This will facilitate additional work identifying the optimal place of SJTs within particular selection contexts and further enhancing their effectiveness.","[{""name"": ""Elin S.

10.1002/berj.3816,BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL,0401 Education,Putting climate change at the heart of education: Is England's strategy a placebo for policy?,"AbstractIn this paper we present an analysis of the sustainability and climate change strategy for education and children's services systems in England, produced by the Department for Education. Using critical discourse analysis, we juxtapose qualitative data collected from &gt;200 youth teachers and teacher educators in the context of co‐creating a manifesto for education and environmental sustainability. Through analysis of these two datasets, we evaluate the government's proposals for climate education and sustainability. We find that the strategy foregrounds economic concerns, with educational priorities driven by the ‘net zero’ policy agenda, and an over‐reliance on increased science‐focused knowledge and skills. The strategy suggests an absence of governmental responsibility and attention to the political dimensions of climate change. This is in contrast to stakeholder perspectives which see economic priorities as part of the problem and call for pro‐environmental action at all levels, including from policymakers. The strategy has a depoliticising effect as it introduces additional demands for teachers and schools without the associated enabling policy environment. We argue that the strategy runs the risk of becoming a placebo for policy, with the appearance of ‘doing something’ whilst failing to address the fundamental policy problem.","[{""name"": ""Lynda Dunlop"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Education University of York  Heslington UK""]}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth A.

Early diagnosis of students with a high dropout risk enables interventions to be provided early on, which can help these students to complete their studies, graduate, and enhance their future competitiveness in the workplace. Effective prelearning interventions are necessary, therefore students’ learning backgrounds should be thoroughly examined. This study investigated how big data and artificial intelligence can be used to help universities to more precisely understand student backgrounds, according to which corresponding interventions can be provided. For this study, 3552 students from a university in Taiwan were sampled. A statistical learning method and a machine learning method based on deep neural networks were used to predict their probability of dropping out. The results revealed that student academic performance (regarding the dynamics of class ranking percentage), student loan applications, the number of absences from school, and the number of alerted subjects successfully predicted whether or not students would drop out of university with an accuracy rate of 68% when the statistical learning method was employed, and 77% for the deep learning method, in the case of giving first priority to the high sensitivity in predicting dropouts. However, when the specificity metric was preferred, then the two approaches both reached more than 80% accuracy rates. These results may enable the university to provide interventions to students for assisting course selection and enhancing their competencies based on their aptitudes, potentially reducing the dropout rate and facilitating adaptive learning, thereby achieving a win-win situation for both the university and the students. This research offers a feasible direction for using artificial intelligence applications on the basis of a university’s institutional research database.","[{""name"": ""Shuo-Chang Tsai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cheng-Huan Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yi-Tzone Shiao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jin-Shuei Ciou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Trong-Neng Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/s41239-019-0160-3"", ""10.1038/s41591-019-0447-x"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1500523"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2010.01.003"", ""10.1016/S1352-2310(97)00447-0"", ""10.1111/mbe.12109"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103724"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2007.09.004"", ""10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0043-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-55345-0_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03023-0_10"", ""10.1148/radiol.2019182716"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0171-0""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Health Information Management', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7414), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7405)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Trained in these traditions, HPE researchers engage in science and the building of new knowledge from different paradigmatic orientations. Collaborating across these traditions is particularly generative, a phenomenon the authors call the multidisciplinary edge effect. However, to harness this productivity, scholars need to understand their own paradigms and those of others so that collaboration can flourish. This Invited Commentary introduces the Philosophy of Science series—a collection of articles that introduce readers to 7 different paradigms that are frequently used in HPE research or that the authors suggest will be increasingly common in future studies. Each article in the collection presents a concise and accessible description of the main principles of a paradigm so that researchers can quickly grasp how these traditions differ from each other. In this introductory article, the authors define and illustrate key terms that are essential to understanding these traditions (i.e., paradigm, ontology, epistemology, methodology, and axiology) and explain the structure that each article in this series follows.","[{""name"": ""Lara Varpio"", ""affiliation"": [""is professor and associate director of research, Graduate Programs in Health Professions Education, Department of Medicine, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland; ORCID:.""]}, {""name"": ""Anna MacLeod"", ""affiliation"": [""is professor of continuing professional development and medical education, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00196.x"", ""10.1007/s11192-008-2197-2"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2015.09.003"", ""10.1086/678973"", ""10.1111/medu.12508"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2005.02177.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2010.03921.x"", ""10.1126/science.303.5662.1257"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003093"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003089"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2009.03611.x"", ""10.1177/107780049700300302"", ""10.1007/s10459-016-9684-7""]",['Medicine'],"['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Family Practice', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1012 法医学', 0.702), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7008)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13337,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Learning to work with the black box: Pedagogy for a world with artificial intelligence,"AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrating into our society. University education needs to maintain its relevance in an AI‐mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI according to a relational epistemology, where,in the context of a particular interaction,acomputational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a ‘black box’. Rather than seeking to explain ‘black boxes’, we argue that a pedagogy for an AI‐mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts of its use. We outline two particular approaches to achieve this: (a) orienting students to quality standards that surround AIs, what might be called the tacit and explicit ‘rules of the game’; and (b) providing meaningful interactions with AI systems.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicArtificial intelligence (AI) is conceptualised in many different ways but is rarely defined in the higher education literature.Experts have outlined a range of graduate capabilities for working in a world of AI such as teamwork or ethical thinking.The higher education literature outlines an imperative need to respond to AI, as underlined by recent commentary on ChatGPT.What this paper addsA definition of an AI that is relational: A particular interaction where a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action, which cannot be easily traced.Focusing onworking withAI black boxes rather than trying tosee insidethe technology.Describing a pedagogy for an AI‐mediated world that promotes working in complex situations with partial and indeterminate information.Implications for practice and/or policyFocusing on quality standards helps learners understand the social regulating boundaries around AI.Promoting learner interactions with AI as part of a sociotechnical ensemble helps build evaluative judgement in weighting AI's contribution to work.Asking learners to work with AI systems prompts understanding of the evaluative, ethical and practical necessities of working with a black box.","[{""name"": ""Margaret Bearman"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Research in Assessment and Digital Learning (CRADLE) Deakin University Docklands Victoria Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Rola Ajjawi"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Research in Assessment and Digital Learning (CRADLE) Deakin University Docklands Victoria Australia""]}]","[""10.1080/13562517.2019.1678579"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11456.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315109251-16"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1637842"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000003716"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-41956-1_5"", ""10.1007/s10734‐022‐00937‐2"", ""10.1177/2053951718819569"", ""10.1097/acm.0000000000004501"", ""10.1108/13665621011012898"", ""10.4324/9780203406373"", ""10.58680/la198525786"", ""10.1109/DSAA.2018.00018"", ""10.1177/1741659020917434"", ""10.1080/03085147.2020.1733842"", ""10.1007/s11023‐017‐9417‐6"", ""10.1002/9781444304992.ch7"", ""10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100056"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1807493"", ""10.1080/1356251042000216642"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.112928"", ""10.1080/02602930601117068"", ""10.7821/naer.2021.1.616"", ""10.1080/09695940701592097"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00005756"", ""10.4324/9781315768656"", ""10.1007/s10734-017-0220-3"", ""10.1007/s13347‐019‐00382‐7""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

However, issues that inhibit learning have been found when media are used inappropriately. Based on an examination of extant media research, this study arranges common media delivery problems into five main categories: pace, intelligibility, quality, media diversity, and congruence. Students taking online courses were asked to comment on the media used in their classes. Each of their comments was paired with one of the five categories with justification provided for the categorizations. Through analysis of these learner comments, this study examines the extent to which media delivery problems occur among a specific sample of online university learners in South Korea. The underlying pedagogy that explains the issues caused by inadequate delivery of media is also discussed, followed by recommended solutions that can address such pedagogical concerns. The results not only highlight existing solutions to these types of media problems but also build on them by suggesting other techniques in which media can be delivered so that the overall online learning experience may be enhanced.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Lange"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jamie Costley"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10916-015-0381-5"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.006"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v18i5.3103"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.015"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2008.12.020"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v18i2.2860"", ""10.1108/ITSE-08-2016-0025"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v11i1.774"", ""10.1111/bjet.12203"", ""10.17705/1thci.00090"", ""10.1145/2556325.2566239"", ""10.1108/ITSE-03-2018-0018"", ""10.1080/01587919.2018.1553559"", ""10.1080/147032901300002837"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01145.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.02.005"", ""10.1037/edu0000013"", ""10.1080/23796529.2013.11674711"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.956060"", ""10.3758/s13428-013-0334-1"", ""10.4304/jsw.3.4.51-61"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_31"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_6"", ""10.1007/s11042-016-4062-2"", ""10.1037/h0084295"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.09.018"", ""10.1080/01421590802144302"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.02.008"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.05.007"", ""10.29140/jaltcall.v1n2.r5"", ""10.1145/1240624.1240755""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Their online and/or offline course provision before and during the epidemic was retrospectively inquired. If live online education was provided, the number of courses, duration and number of participants per week were further investigated. Time distributions of live online dental courses were recorded and classified as within working time and out of working time. The test period of COVID‐19 epidemic was for two weeks between 16 February and 29 February 2020. The control period of pre‐COVID‐19 epidemic was for ten weeks between 01 November 2019 and 09 January 2020.ResultsThe percentages of offline and online courses provided by 21 dental continuing education institutions before COVID‐19 epidemic were 95.2% (20 out of 21) and 28.6% (6 out of 21), respectively. All the institutions suspended offline courses whilst providing two live online courses, on average, per week with 188 minutes duration and 7290 participants during the epidemic. The total number of online courses for 10 weeks before the epidemic was 33, and that for two weeks during the epidemic was 119. The proportion of courses provided within working time raised from 6.1% (2 out of 33) of pre‐COVID‐19 to 46.2% (55 out of 119) during COVID‐19. There were significant differences between before and during the epidemic (P &lt; .001).ConclusionThe dental continuing education transferred from offline to online dramatically, and live online dental continuing education increased significantly during COVID‐19 epidemic in China.","[{""name"": ""Xiaoqiang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Prosthodontics Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jianfeng Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Prosthodontics Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Li Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Prosthodontics Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yang Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Prosthodontics Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jianguo Tan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Prosthodontics Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1056/NEJMoa2001316"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa2001017"", ""10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.02.034"", ""10.1007/s00784-020-03267-8"", ""10.1016/j.jds.2020.02.002"", ""10.3889/oamjms.2018.373"", ""10.1002/chp.1340240308"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.512"", ""10.1111/eje.12045"", ""10.3390/admsci7020017"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2014.78.6.tb05739.x"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v11i3.867"", ""10.1080/01421590701551698"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-10-42"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2014.78.10.tb05820.x"", ""10.14295/bds.2014.v17i4.930""]","['Dentistry', 'Medicine']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Infectious Diseases', 'General Dentistry']","[[('1003 口腔医学', 0.78), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7342), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7246), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7141), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7138)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6353), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6254)], [('1003 口腔医学', 0.7328), ('1002 临床医学', 0.6867)]]"
10.1177/1356336X19826603,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW,0401 Education,"Flipped learning, pedagogy and digital technology: Establishing consistent practice to optimise lesson time","Flipped learning (FL) is a pedagogical approach that has scarcely been examined in physical education (PE). As a result, we have little information regarding what PE teachers think of the approach, how they apply it, or what perceived value it has for their teaching. This research explores the reasons which two UK-based PE teachers gave for why and how they used FL to complement their use of digital technology (DigiTech). Their experiences and views are explored through a case study/appreciative inquiry approach. Data were generated from: (a) interviews with the teachers; (b) lesson observations and field notes and (c) document analysis, all of which were analysed using grounded theory. The findings showed that each teacher used FL and DigiTech in nuanced ways to support their teaching. Despite personal differences, FL was established by both teachers as a consistent routine of practice to support the use of DigiTech. The teachers’ rationales for using FL hinged on their belief that: (a) it optimised the lesson time in which students could be physically active and (b) it supported their examination PE students. Overall, the results indicated that, when used in conjunction with DigiTech, FL has the potential to pedagogically support teachers’ teaching of PE. This is particularly pertinent given the limited time allocated in the curriculum to PE (some of which is inevitably lost in the changing rooms) and the perceived need for students to be physically active in lessons.","[{""name"": ""Julia Sargent"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Educational Technology, The Open University, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Ashley Casey"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, UK""]}]","[""10.1080/07294360.2014.934336"", ""10.4324/9780203704011-7"", ""10.1080/17408989.2017.1294672"", ""10.1111/jcal.12250"", ""10.1177/1356336X12465508"", ""10.1177/1356336X15623774"", ""10.1080/17408989.2013.837439"", ""10.1080/13573322.2016.1226792"", ""10.1080/00131911.2018.1457010"", ""10.1080/13573322.2013.854764"", ""10.1080/13573322.2014.938036"", ""10.4324/9780203879382"", ""10.1080/13573322.2017.1374942"", ""10.4135/9781446215876.n9"", ""10.1080/07303084.2018.1440263"", ""10.1123/jtpe.2015-0176"", ""10.4135/9781473914995"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.04.003"", ""10.1123/jtpe.22.3.245"", ""10.4324/9780203704011"", ""10.1080/0020739X.2013.822582"", ""10.1080/13573322.2014.962496"", ""10.1080/13573320701600647"", ""10.23865/jased.v2.916"", ""10.1080/13573322.2013.831343"", ""10.1177/1747954116637497"", ""10.1080/13562517.2017.1379481"", ""10.1007/s10758-015-9262-8"", ""10.1080/17408980701282076""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/medu.14654,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Evaluation in health professions education-Is measuring outcomes enough?,"AbstractIntroductionIn an effort to increase the rigour of evaluation in health professions education (HPE), a range of evaluation approaches are used. These largely focus on outcome evaluation as opposed to programme evaluation. We aim to review and critique the use of outcome evaluation models, using the Kirkpatrick Model as an example given its wide acceptance and use, and advocate for the use of programme evaluation models that help us understand how and why outcomes are occurring.MethodsWe systematically searched OVID medline, Scopus, CINAHL and Pubmed, and hand searched six leading HPE journals to provide an overview of the use of the Kirkpatrick Model as well as a range of programme evaluation models in HPE. In addition to this, we synthesised the existing critiques of the Kirkpatrick Model as an example of outcome evaluation, to highlight the limitations of such models.ResultsThe use of the Kirkpatrick Model in HPE is widespread and increasing; however, studies focus on categorising outcomes, rather than explaining how and why they occur. The main criticisms of the model are as follows: it is outcomes focused and fails to consider factors that can impact training outcomes; it assumes positive casual linkages between the levels; there is an assumption that the higher‐level outcomes are more important; and unintended impacts are not considered. The use of the Kirkpatrick Model by the MERSQI, BEME and WHO contribute to the myth that the Kirkpatrick Model is the gold standard for programme evaluation.DiscussionMoving forward, evaluations of HPE interventions must shift from focusing largely on measuring outcomes of interventions with little consideration for how and why these outcomes are occurring to programme evaluation that investigates what contributes to these outcomes. Other models that facilitate the evaluation of the complex processes that occur in HPE should be used instead of Kirkpatrick's.","[{""name"": ""Louise M.

10.1186/s12909-021-03052-5,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Enhancing the effectiveness of flipped classroom in health science education: a state-of-the-art review,"Abstract Background In a flipped classroom, students acquire knowledge before class and deepen and apply this knowledge during class. This way, lower-order learning goals are achieved before class and higher-order skills are reached during class. This study aims to provide an overview of the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of the flipped classroom and how these factors can be stimulated. The effectiveness of the flipped classroom is conceptualized in this study as test scores, the achievement of higher learning goals, and student perceptions. Methods A state-of-the-art review was conducted. The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were consulted. The timeframe is 2016 till 2020. The studies were qualitatively analyzed according to the grounded theory method. Results After screening the studies based on the inclusion-and exclusion criteria, 88 studies were included in this review. The qualitative analysis of these studies revealed six main factors that affect the effectiveness of the flipped classroom: student characteristics, teacher characteristics, implementation, task characteristics, out-of-class activities, and in-class activities. Mediating factors are, amongst other factors, the learner’s level of self-regulated learning, teacher’s role and motivation, assessment approach, and guidance during self-study by means of prompts or feedback. These factors can be positively stimulated by structuring the learning process and focusing the teacher training on competencies and learning-and teaching approaches that are essential for the flipped classroom. Conclusion This paper provides insight into the factors that contribute to the effectiveness of the flipped classroom and how these factors could be stimulated. In order to stimulate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom, the positively and negatively affecting factors and mediating factors should be taken into account in the design of the flipped classroom. The interventions mentioned in this paper could also be used to enhance the effectiveness.","[{""name"": ""Janique Oudbier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gerard Spaai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karline Timmermans"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tobias Boerboom"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4103/jehp.jehp_163_19"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.017"", ""10.1108/JARHE-09-2015-0069"", ""10.1016/j.iree.2018.01.004"", ""10.1007/s10758-020-09478-y"", ""10.1111/jocn.15308"", ""10.15516/cje.v21i1.3006"", ""10.1007/s10639-015-9393-5"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0104-y"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.05.002"", ""10.3390/educsci10010022"", ""10.1016/j.iree.2018.01.002"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00767"", ""10.1002/cae.22069"", ""10.1080/14703297.2018.1541189"", ""10.2307/26921132"", ""10.1111/medu.13616"", ""10.1002/ase.1664"", ""10.4018/IJOPCD.2018100102"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1643303"", ""10.1111/eje.12300"", ""10.1080/07294360.2018.1455642"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2018.09.027"", ""10.3390/educsci10100260"", ""10.3138/jvme.1116-173r"", ""10.17126/jor.v8i2.787"", ""10.14742/ajet.3804"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2004.02.001"", ""10.5688/ajpe6898"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2019.02.025"", ""10.1007/s10956-016-9605-9"", ""10.1152/advan.00051.2018"", ""10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.01.032"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.020"", ""10.14257/ijsela.2016.10.12.39"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1144-z"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1495653"", ""10.1080/10494820.2020.1765391"", ""10.26803/ijlter.18.13.4"", ""10.1007/s10956-018-9740-6"", ""10.18178/ijiet.2019.9.12.1325"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.05.033"", ""10.1080/00219266.2020.1808513"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1497-y"", ""10.3205/zma001108"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1522650"", ""10.1111/bjet.12618"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.11.036"", ""10.1007/s11528-016-0045-4"", ""10.1111/bjet.12604"", ""10.1187/cbe.19-01-0004"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000086"", ""10.1177/1469787418793725"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0014-z"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182a36a07"", ""10.1525/abt.2016.78.6.471"", ""10.1002/tl.330"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00367"", ""10.1002/ase.1635"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103608"", ""10.1080/0020739X.2015.1102979"", ""10.1186/s41239-016-0032-z"", ""10.3946/kjme.2018.84"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.651179"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2016.08.043"", ""10.1152/advan.00125.2019"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2017.1340636"", ""10.18261/issn.1891-943x-2018-04-03"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.07.034"", ""10.1080/00313831.2018.1452292"", ""10.1007/s12528-019-09220-3"", ""10.14742/AJET.5600"", ""10.1007/s13312-018-1342-0"", ""10.1080/13562517.2017.1379481"", ""10.29333/iji.2020.13312a"", ""10.3138/jvme.2019-0049"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100731"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-8126-4"", ""10.12968/bjon.2017.26.11.617"", ""10.1186/s41239-019-0135-4"", ""10.1111/jpc.14366"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2019.02.025"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2019.05.003"", ""10.1007/s40037-014-0129-9"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103653"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1749-x"", ""10.3928/01484834-20200723-05"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1698535"", ""10.5688/ajpe5931"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000023096"", ""10.1007/s11423-017-9534-1"", ""10.17509/ijal.v8i3.15270"", ""10.1080/10872981.2019.1686949"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2019.104262"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip4102-2""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0403 体育学', 0.7413), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7214)]]"

I examine reflexive dialogue as pertaining to several factors: the influence of my background on the research topic; the changing nature of positionality in different cultural locations; methodological decisions that are based on my positionality and the research context; preparation to conduct fieldwork in two distinct cultural contexts; and ways to establish rapport, approachability and cultural credibility. I conclude by acknowledging the value of reflexive practice, and by determining my ambivalent insider–outsider positionality in different cultural locations.","[{""name"": ""Hanin Bukamal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1077800419846532"", ""10.1177/1473325010370188"", ""10.1086/494426"", ""10.1080/0021086042000324152"", ""10.1080/03050068.2011.634285"", ""10.1177/160940691401300115"", ""10.1177/1468794119874599"", ""10.4324/9780203029053"", ""10.2307/1229039"", ""10.2307/256875"", ""10.1080/10646175.2017.1315692"", ""10.1177/146879410200200205"", ""10.1177/104973202129120052"", ""10.1080/10503300902798375"", ""10.3167/ame.2019.140209"", ""10.1080/17513050701739509"", ""10.7202/039946ar"", ""10.1080/13562510600874292"", ""10.1177/1476750307072873"", ""10.1080/1743727X.2012.736484"", ""10.1086/428423"", ""10.1177/1468794118770078"", ""10.1177/1468794116672915"", ""10.1525/aa.1993.95.3.02a00070"", ""10.4324/9780203798706-44"", ""10.1080/0021086042000324224"", ""10.1017/S104909650606077X""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1002/tesq.568,TESOL QUARTERLY,0401 Education,Conceptualizing Language Teacher Education Centered on Language Teacher Identity Development: A Competencies-Based Approach and Practical Applications,"Language teacher identity (LTI) has become an increasingly central focus in language teaching recently, perhaps because identity is now defined as multiple, complex, shifting, socially constructed, and a site of struggle (Norton, 2013; Song, 2016)—and thus a construct that can and should be intentionally influenced (Varghese, Motha, Park, Reeves, &amp; Trent, 2016). With greater understanding that social justice and a critical orientation to education are not only important but also the duty of educators to enact (Kubota &amp; Miller, 2017), some advocate the placement of LTI development at the center of language teacher education (LTE; De Costa &amp; Norton, 2017a; Varghese et al., 2016). However, the conceptualization of such intentional models of LTE needs development (Varghese et al., 2016). This article begins to conceptualize such an LTE program. The author theorizes LTI and the need for adopting an LTI that is transformative, agentive, and advocacy (TAA)‐oriented, and proposes a competencies‐based approach as a foundation for developing an LTE program centered on the development of a TAA‐oriented LTI, suggesting key competencies to include in such an approach. She presents practical affordances and activities that could be helpful in developing these competencies. The article ends with questions aimed at furthering this emerging scholarly conversation in the field.","[{""name"": ""Mariah J.

This article reports on a longitudinal case study of a Chinese ethnic minority student’s participation in a digital multimodal composing (DMC) project and its pertinent impact on the student’s investment in EFL learning. Data were gathered through semistructured interviews, classroom observations, informal conversations, written reflections, and student‐authored multimodal videos. The study found that using DMC in mainstream English classrooms constitutes a promising empowering and culturally sustaining strategy for facilitating ethnic minority students’ investment in English learning. Through DMC, the ethnic minority student not only gained access to peer support and a collaborative learning community that was underemphasized in traditional classes, but also learned to capitalize on her ethnic knowledge as essential cultural capital for in‐class participation. Noting the empowering role of DMC in positive ethnic identity constructions of the minority student and the investment in English learning, this study calls for attention to the importance of multimodality and the relevant literacy practices in empowering ethnic minority students to cross the linguistic and digital divides in mainstream classrooms.","[{""name"": ""Lianjiang Jiang"", ""affiliation"": [""Jimei University Xiamen China"", ""University of Macau Macau China""]}, {""name"": ""Miaoyan Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Xiamen University Xiamen China""]}, {""name"": ""Shulin Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Macau Macau China""]}]","[""10.1186/2191-5059-1-1"", ""10.1075/japc.18.1.01ark"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2017.10.004"", ""10.1002/tesq.241"", ""10.1017/S0267190514000191"", ""10.1002/tesq.246"", ""10.2202/1538-0645.1263"", ""10.1080/13670050508669067"", ""10.1111/j.1944-9720.2007.tb02854.x"", ""10.1016/j.linged.2012.12.008"", ""10.1002/tesq.138"", ""10.1002/tesq.238"", ""10.1080/14664208.2016.1213785"", ""10.1007/s10993-018-9463-9"", ""10.1177/0741088304274170"", ""10.3102/0091732X07310586"", ""10.1093/elt/ccw098"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2018.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.system.2016.04.001"", ""10.4324/9780203164754"", ""10.3102/00028312032003465"", ""10.4337/9781784717360.00015"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01209.x"", ""10.1007/978-94-6091-797-4_4"", ""10.5790/hongkong/9789622099586.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13670050.2014.988111"", ""10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u"", ""10.2307/3587803"", ""10.21832/9781783090563"", ""10.1075/japc.18.1.07nor"", ""10.1353/sof.0.0052"", ""10.3102/0013189X12441244"", ""10.1080/01434632.2015.1015540"", ""10.1598/JAAL.54.4.3"", ""10.1108/17504970910967573"", ""10.1016/j.compcom.2008.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.compcom.2005.05.004"", ""10.1177/1362168812436909"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2017.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2017.10.006"", ""10.1080/01434632.2018.1458854"", ""10.1080/10357823.2018.1552657"", ""10.1080/01434632.2019.1623225"", ""10.1016/j.compcom.2012.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.jslw.2017.10.010"", ""10.1080/13670050.2018.1502742"", ""10.1007/s40299-018-0406-1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Its proper integration into education can support teaching and learning activities and highlight the benefits of digital technologies. ChatGPT can be an intelligent learning assistant for learners and educators, supporting personalized and adaptive learning. At the same time, ChatGPT can be used unfairly and unethically, which causes severe concerns among educators, educational institutions, and society. Educators’ attitudes regarding their application, expectations, and concerns are very important in the emergence and introduction of new technological tools in education. The current paper aims to explore the opinion of university professors at a Bulgarian university regarding the possibilities and challenges of ChatGPT in carrying out teaching activities. The findings of the conducted survey show that university professors from Trakia University in Bulgaria have an overall positive attitude regarding the implementation of ChatGPT in their teaching practice (41.4%). They perceive ChatGPT as a means to support time-consuming teaching activities (60.9%), provoke interest, activate and engage learners (59.8%), and stimulate their critical thinking and creativity (47.1%). In parallel, the university professors are concerned about possible risks of its unethical use that threaten the validity and fairness of assessment practices. The most severe problem for them is the danger that learners will completely trust ChatGPT without checking the authenticity of the generated texts (73.6%), which can negatively affect the acquisition of knowledge and skills.","[{""name"": ""Gabriela Kiryakova"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Economics, Trakia University, 6000 Stara Zagora, Bulgaria""]}, {""name"": ""Nadezhda Angelova"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Economics, Trakia University, 6000 Stara Zagora, Bulgaria""]}]","[""10.1016/j.caeai.2020.100001"", ""10.1186/s41239-023-00411-8"", ""10.36348/gajhss.2023.v05i02.001"", ""10.54097/fcis.v2i2.4465"", ""10.1177/00336882231162868"", ""10.3390/educsci13040410"", ""10.1145/3587102.3588827"", ""10.20944/preprints202303.0473.v1"", ""10.31219/osf.io/9ge8m"", ""10.1186/s40561-023-00269-3"", ""10.1080/14703297.2023.2195846"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988510"", ""10.30935/cedtech/13152"", ""10.1108/JTF-02-2023-0038"", ""10.2139/ssrn.4378735"", ""10.1155/2023/1923981""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Health Informatics', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Herein, bioinspired inchworm‐ and earthworm‐like soft structures with intrinsic strain sensing achieved by seamless embedding of a graphite‐paste‐based sensor material are presented. The developed strain sensor exhibits a record stretchability (900%) and sensitivity (of 103 up to ≈200 and of the order of 105 at around 700% linear strain). With tiny permanent magnets incorporated at the ends of these soft structures, the sensory‐feedback‐based controlled movements of magnetically driven inchworm‐ and earthworm‐like soft robots are also demonstrated. The presented results potentially boost the prospects of self‐sensing in soft robots and advance the field toward cognitive soft robotics.","[{""name"": ""Prakash Karipoth"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering  University of Glasgow G12 8QQ UK""]}, {""name"": ""Adamos Christou"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering  University of Glasgow G12 8QQ UK""]}, {""name"": ""Abhilash Pullanchiyodan"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering  University of Glasgow G12 8QQ UK""]}, {""name"": ""Ravinder Dahiya"", ""affiliation"": [""Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) Group James Watt School of Engineering  University of Glasgow G12 8QQ UK""]}]","[""10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.03.002"", ""10.1002/advs.201800541"", ""10.1038/nmat4089"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0579-1"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2019.2941366"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0185-0"", ""10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418817"", ""10.1088/1748-3182/9/4/046006"", ""10.1016/j.asd.2004.06.003"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aav1488"", ""10.1002/anie.201800907"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aah3690"", ""10.1016/j.eml.2018.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104926"", ""10.1088/1748-3190/aa8448"", ""10.1126/science.aab0129"", ""10.1126/scirobotics.aan3028"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96866-7_40"", ""10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2986222"", ""10.1145/2366316.2366335"", ""10.1089/soro.2014.1504"", ""10.3390/s20174780"", ""10.1109/TRO.2020.3031264"", ""10.1002/aisy.202100036"", ""10.1088/1361-665X/ab7e36"", ""10.1016/j.polymertesting.2019.106038"", ""10.1016/j.polymertesting.2020.106478"", ""10.1098/rsif.2017.0101"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793766"", ""10.1109/BioRob.2012.6290698"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2019.100617"", ""10.1002/adfm.201504755"", ""10.1002/admi.201900985"", ""10.1007/s10514-018-9754-1"", ""10.1016/j.bios.2018.08.037"", ""10.1002/aelm.202000058"", ""10.1002/aelm.202000445"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2021.3051467"", ""10.1088/2058-8585/aa5ab2"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2019.2941665"", ""10.1038/s41528-018-0045-x"", ""10.1098/rsta.2019.0156"", ""10.1109/IMOC.2007.4404313"", ""10.1109/68.849082"", ""10.1557/adv.2019.439"", ""10.1089/soro.2018.0082"", ""10.1038/s41578-018-0001-3"", ""10.1021/acsnano.5b00599"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b12504"", ""10.1002/admt.201600053"", ""10.1002/adfm.201600580"", ""10.1021/am4050647"", ""10.1002/adfm.201601995"", ""10.1039/C6NR04467K"", ""10.1038/nature14002"", ""10.1002/adfm.201602619"", ""10.1002/admt.201800020"", ""10.1002/adma.201602425"", ""10.1002/admt.202000008"", ""10.1002/admi.201800616"", ""10.1039/C7MH00071E"", ""10.1039/C9TC02698C"", ""10.1002/aisy.202000194""]",['Engineering'],"['Biomedical Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1186/s12909-020-02004-9,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Addressing microaggressions in racially charged patient-provider interactions: a pilot randomized trial,"AbstractBackgroundRacial bias in medical care is a significant public health issue, with increased focus on microaggressions and the quality of patient-provider interactions. Innovations in training interventions are needed to decrease microaggressions and improve provider communication and rapport with patients of color during medical encounters.MethodsThis paper presents a pilot randomized trial of an innovative clinical workshop that employed a theoretical model from social and contextual behavioral sciences. The intervention specifically aimed to decrease providers’ likelihood of expressing biases and negative stereotypes when interacting with patients of color in racially charged moments, such as when patients discuss past incidents of discrimination. Workshop exercises were informed by research on the importance of mindfulness and interracial contact involving reciprocal exchanges of vulnerability and responsiveness. Twenty-five medical student and recent graduate participants were randomized to a workshop intervention or no intervention. Outcomes were measured via provider self-report and observed changes in targeted provider behaviors. Specifically, two independent, blind teams of coders assessed provideremotional rapportandresponsivenessduring simulated interracial patient encounters with standardized Black patients who presented specific racial challenges to participants.ResultsGreater improvements in observed emotional rapport and responsiveness (indexing fewer microaggressions), improved self-reported explicit attitudes toward minoritized groups, and improved self-reported working alliance and closeness with the Black standardized patients were observed and reported by intervention participants.ConclusionsMedical providers may be more likely to exhibit bias with patients of color in specific racially charged moments during medical encounters. This small-sample pilot study suggests that interventions that directly intervene to help providers improve responding in these moments by incorporating mindfulness and interracial contact may be beneficial in reducing racial health disparities.","[{""name"": ""Jonathan W.

An overall medium effect size for Gameplay design (k = 14, Nes = 14, gRE = 0.646, p = .000), and an overall small‐to‐medium effect size for Game‐mechanism design (k = 12, Nes = 13, adjusted gRE = 0.270, p = .001) are reported. Further, the results of subgroup analyses suggest that students across educational levels all significantly benefit from game‐based science learning although there is no significant difference between the subgroup mean effects. Further, learning and gaming mechanisms play equal roles significantly increasing students' scientific knowledge gains. With these promising results, however, high variance within the subgroups of educational levels and those of gaming mechanisms indicate that gaming mechanisms should be developed with care to meet students' different needs in different educational levels.","[{""name"": ""Yu‐Ling Tsai"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate Institute of Applied Science and Technology National Taiwan University of Science and Technology  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Chin‐Chung Tsai"", ""affiliation"": [""Program of Learning Sciences National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei Taiwan"", ""Institute for Research Excellence in Learning Sciences National Taiwan Normal University  Taipei City Taiwan""]}]","[""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.01.002"", ""10.1007/s10956-010-9257-0"", ""10.1007/s10956-013-9438-8"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.12.020"", ""10.1111/bjet.12113"", ""10.1007/s11121-013-0377-7"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2007.03.001"", ""10.1007/s40692-015-0039-9"", ""10.1007/s11423-013-9323-4"", ""10.4018/ijdet.2015010105"", ""10.3102/0034654315582065"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.03.004"", ""10.1007/s10956-013-9466-4"", ""10.1111/j.1742-9536.2011.00037.x"", ""10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00455.x"", ""10.18261/ISSN1891-943X-2006-03-03"", ""10.1007/BF02557922"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.03.017"", ""10.1111/spc3.12267"", ""10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1142:SIIEMA]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.3.4.486"", ""10.1002/sim.1186"", ""10.1136/bmj.327.7414.557"", ""10.1080/09500693.2014.899722"", ""10.1080/10494820.2012.705850"", ""10.1007/s10956-011-9298-z"", ""10.1080/10494820.2014.926276"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.11.2.193"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2916324"", ""10.1007/s11423-012-9241-x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2012.01285.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.008"", ""10.1080/10494820.2015.1057747"", ""10.1080/03057267.2017.1305543"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.022"", ""10.1007/s10639-017-9622-1"", ""10.1111/bjet.12467"", ""10.2307/2529786"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1007/s10956-013-9436-x"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019871"", ""10.1080/03057267.2013.839372"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_6"", ""10.1080/00461520.2015.1133307"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-102744"", ""10.1126/science.1166900"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00135"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.92.4.724"", ""10.1016/j.system.2013.07.013"", ""10.1080/00461520.2015.1122533"", ""10.1177/1046878116674399"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638"", ""10.1111/bmsp.12092"", ""10.1155/2015/549684"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.10.020"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.11.019"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1437049"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-387691-1.00002-8"", ""10.3102/0034654312450190"", ""10.1111/jcal.12347"", ""10.1386/jgvw.2.1.53_1"", ""10.3102/1076998609346961"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-0149-9.ch032"", ""10.2190/FLHV-K4WA-WPVQ-H0YM"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-9-80"", ""10.1002/tea.3660200506"", ""10.1037/a0031311"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.01.003"", ""10.1111/jcal.12267"", ""10.3102/0034654312436980""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/bjet.12717,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,What affects learner engagement in flipped learning and what predicts its outcomes?,"AbstractThe current popularity of flipped learning may be attributed to its reported successes in bringing about enhanced learner engagement and positive learning outcomes. This study aims to improve our understanding of flipped learning (FL) outcomes by examining factors of learner engagement, academic capability, and epistemological beliefs. Data were collected and statistically analyzed from 231 undergraduate students enrolled in a general biology or general chemistry course at a Korean university implemented with the FL model. The results indicated that learners’ epistemological beliefs influenced neither pre‐class nor in‐class engagement, but that academic capability did affect both pre‐class and in‐class engagement. Only content/learning‐related outcomes, not generic competencies or satisfaction, were affected by both academic capability and epistemological beliefs. Both pre‐class and in‐class engagement levels affected most types of FL outcomes except generic competencies, which were only affected by the extent of in‐class engagement. Learners’ affective engagement was not influenced by epistemological beliefs, but directly and indirectly affected FL outcomes via behavioral and cognitive engagement.

10.1186/s12909-019-1911-5,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Virtual reality technology for teaching neurosurgery of skull base tumor,"Abstract Background Neurosurgery represents one of the most challenging and delicate of any surgical procedure. Skull base tumors in particular oftentimes present as a very technically difficult procedures in the setting of neurosurgical teaching. Virtual reality technology is one of the most promising surgical planning tools. It can perform fast three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other imaging data sets under conditions of virtual reality (VR). Surgical simulation can more intuitively understand the anatomical relationship of the surgical area in significantly greater detail. Methods Thirty clinical undergraduates from the class of 2016 were randomly divided into two groups: the traditional teaching group and the virtual reality teaching group. After the study concluded, the teaching effectiveness was evaluated by combining basic theoretical knowledge, case analysis and questionnaire survey methods. Results Comparative analysis between both groups showed the response effect of the virtual reality teaching group was better than that of the traditional teaching group (P &lt; 0.05). There was also no difference between both groups in terms of the design of the surgical approach and the listing of surgical matters that required attention (P &gt; 0.05).The results of theoretical knowledge assessment between both groups showed that the scores of basic theory, location, adjacent structure, clinical manifestation, diagnosis and analysis, surgical methods and total scores in the VR group exceeded those in the traditional teaching group (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions This study showed that VR technology might improve neurosurgical skull base teaching quality, which should be promoted in the teaching of clinical subjects.","[{""name"": ""Xuefei Shao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Quan Yuan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daqing Qian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zheng Ye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gao Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kang le Zhuang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaochun Jiang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuelong Jin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Di Qiang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/SCS.0000000000004042"", ""10.1016/j.amsu.2018.08.002"", ""10.21053/ceo.2018.00906"", ""10.1093/ons/opy166"", ""10.3171/2014.1.JNS131857"", ""10.1055/s-0029-1231080"", ""10.3171/2015.3.PEDS14677"", ""10.1080/01421590310001605705"", ""10.2466/pms.1990.71.3.803"", ""10.1055/s-0037-1598049"", ""10.3171/2015.8.JNS141563"", ""10.1002/alr.21986""]","['Engineering', 'Medicine']","['Surgery', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Epidemiology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)]]"
10.1182/hematology.2020000098,HEMATOLOGY-AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY EDUCATION PROGRAM,0401 Education; 1002 Clinical Medicine,Updates in infection risk and management in acute leukemia,"Abstract Patients with hematologic malignancies are at increased risk of infection, with associated morbidity and mortality. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have qualitative and quantitative deficits in granulocytes predisposing to bacterial and fungal infections. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia results in qualitative deficits in lymphocytes, resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced cell-mediated immunity predisposing to certain bacterial and viral as well as fungal infections. Chemotherapeutic regimens often compound these deficits, result in prolonged periods of severe neutropenia, and disrupt mucosal barriers, further elevating infection risk. Despite advances in antimicrobial therapies and prophylaxis, acute leukemia patients with disease- and treatment-related immunosuppression remain at risk for life-threatening infection, including with resistant organisms, antimicrobial-related adverse events, and higher treatment costs. Additionally, our knowledge of infection risk and drug-drug interactions with new immune-targeted cancer therapeutics is evolving. Here, we review 3 areas in which standard practice is evolving as challenges arise and new experience is gained, including antibiotic use in febrile neutropenia, fungal prophylaxis, and use of targeted therapies.","[{""name"": ""C.

10.1111/bjet.13046,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Understanding university students' behavioral intention to use Edmodo through the lens of an extended technology acceptance model,"AbstractEducational social network sites have many uses in the field of education. The present paper aims to determine factors influencing students’ behavioral intention to use a popular educational social network site, Edmodo. Using an extension of the technology acceptance model, we analyzed quantitative responses of 218 university students, registered in an Edmodo supported course. Data were analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results highlighted that intention was significantly predicted by its antecedents. More specifically, the attitude was the most important factor, whilst perceived usefulness had a moderate impact on predicting intention. Perceived ease of use predicted perceived usefulness directly and also it influenced intention indirectly through attitude. External antecedents of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were all significant. Discussion and implications were drawn based on the results. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Understanding why users accept or reject a particular information system is a common research area. Technology acceptance model (TAM) is used to explain individuals’ acceptance and adoption of different technologies. Social Networking Sites (SNSs) have been used to enrich learning. However, the adoption of educational SNS studies is limited. What this paper adds This study is one of the first attempts for employing extended TAM that scrutinizes factors influencing university students’ intention to use Edmodo as an educational SNS and a learning management system (LMS) in teaching and learning environments. External antecedents included in the model (subjective norms, output quality, perceptions of external control, perceived enjoyment, technological complexity, and self‐efficacy) significantly predicted university students’ intention to use Edmodo as an educational SNS and LMS. Major factors driving the intention to use Edmodo were attitude and perceived usefulness. Implications for practice and/or policy Considering that the attitude was found to have the strongest influence on the intention to use Edmodo, instructors may attach prominent importance to foster students’ positive attitudes toward Edmodo use. Instructors may design virtual learning environments with collaborative activities on SNS to increase students’ perceived usefulness. Designers and developers of an educational SNS should design interfaces that should be not only less complex but also more enjoyable.","[{""name"": ""Erhan Unal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmet Murat Uzun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.036"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.014"", ""10.1080/14703297.2015.1093426"", ""10.28945/4389"", ""10.5539/elt.v8n1p189"", ""10.1177/2042753019863832"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2017.1417481"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.055"", ""10.1016/S0167-9236(01)00111-7"", ""10.2307/3250921"", ""10.29333/ejmste/91093"", ""10.1111/bjet.12066"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2014.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2016.08.008"", ""10.1080/10447318.2012.756333"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.049"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982"", ""10.1002/cae.21975"", ""10.15388/infedu.2018.11"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v18i1.2623"", ""10.1111/bjet.12798"", ""10.1080/10494820.2017.1421560"", ""10.3758/BRM.41.4.1149"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.048"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.02.004"", ""10.1007/s11423-016-9465-2"", ""10.1007/s11747‐014‐0403‐8"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v16i4.2351"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.02.011"", ""10.1007/s11423‐016‐9436‐7"", ""10.1016/j.im.2006.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.04.011"", ""10.1186/s41239-017-0070-1"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2011.577190"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.09.005"", ""10.1080/2331186X.2018.1536312"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.05.024"", ""10.1287/isre.2.3.173"", ""10.1111/bjet.12469"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.09.016"", ""10.1504/ijsmile.2016.075055"", ""10.1080/10447318.2011.555311"", ""10.1108/JEIM‐04‐2012‐0011"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.06.011"", ""10.1080/14703297.2018.1557068"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.07.002"", ""10.1287/isre.6.2.144"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2008.08.006"", ""10.1007/s12564‐009‐9066‐4"", ""10.1080/10494820.2017.1341940"", ""10.1111/j.1365‐2729.2007.00247.x"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1489290"", ""10.1007/s11423‐019‐09650‐x"", ""10.2307/249443"", ""10.1287/isre.11.4.342.11872"", ""10.1111/j.1540‐5915.2008.00192.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.1002/tea.21169"", ""10.1007/s12528‐018‐9200‐6"", ""10.17718/tojde.306554"", ""10.29333/iji.2019.1241a""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1108/ET-07-2020-0219,EDUCATION AND TRAINING,0401 Education,"The relationship between higher education students' perceived employability, academic engagement and stress among students in China","PurposeWith a focus on Chinese higher education students, the purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between students' perceived employability and their levels of academic engagement and stress.Design/methodology/approachThe study engaged 1,155 students from three universities in China. Students responded to an online survey, reporting their confidence in relation to their perceived employability, academic engagement and stress in life. The authors employed structural equation modelling to explore students' confidence in each employability attribute and to assess perceived employability relation to academic engagement and perceived stress.FindingsThe results suggest that self-perceptions of employability are positively associated with students' academic engagement and negatively associated with perceived stress. Perceived employability mediated the majority paths.Originality/valueThis is one of the few studies to examine perceived employability in line with academic engagement or stress and the first study to do so in China.","[{""name"": ""Yin Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dawn Bennett"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/apps.12082"", ""10.1108/CDI-08-2016-0135"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411"", ""10.1080/03797720802522627"", ""10.1002/job.4030140202"", ""10.1108/ET-06-2016-0100"", ""10.1086/258724"", ""10.1111/bjet.12931"", ""10.1080/02678370701659215"", ""10.1177/0143831X06063098"", ""10.2307/2657311"", ""10.1177/0002764215580608"", ""10.1080/07294360802444347"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.91.3.717"", ""10.1007/s11162-005-8150-9"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2017.11.001"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-13-33"", ""10.1057/hep.2014.29"", ""10.1108/ET-06-2016-0111"", ""10.1080/17544750.2010.516575"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1294152"", ""10.1080/07294360.2014.890572"", ""10.1111/ajpy.12023"", ""10.1037/a0027348"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1387107"", ""10.1111/1748-8583.12206"", ""10.1037/a0038900"", ""10.1007/s11366-018-9552-9"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2014.07.014"", ""10.1080/13547860.2018.1490069"", ""10.1002/cdq.12142"", ""10.1080/09585192.2015.1128465"", ""10.1353/rhe.2013.0002"", ""10.1177/0950017008093481"", ""10.1007/s10734-019-00369-5"", ""10.1080/13639080.2019.1679730"", ""10.1007/s10734-019-00490-5"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1229270"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2015.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2002.12.003"", ""10.1007/s10663-019-09459-0"", ""10.1177/1069072720943153"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1359823"", ""10.1080/01425692.2015.1111751"", ""10.1108/PR-01-2015-0015"", ""10.1080/03075079.2015.1091813"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.10.531"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.04.013"", ""10.1007/s40299-018-00431-3"", ""10.1080/00131857.2018.1438822"", ""10.1108/JSTPM-04-2017-0014"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1353/jod.1995.0002"", ""10.1177/1469787414544875"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2011.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2007.12.001"", ""10.32609/0042-8736-2019-6-122-141"", ""10.1108/ER-09-2018-0249"", ""10.1108/ET-11-2017-0167"", ""10.3200/JOER.99.6.323-338"", ""10.1177/0018726709353639"", ""10.1080/13562517.2012.666735"", ""10.1080/13676261.2015.1123234"", ""10.1080/135943200417966"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2018-0154"", ""10.1016/j.socnet.2015.08.002"", ""10.1057/hep.2011.26"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM1002_6"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.604408"", ""10.1080/13562517.2016.1198761"", ""10.1108/PR-07-2012-0110"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00029.x"", ""10.1080/13639080.2015.1102210"", ""10.1002/job.646"", ""10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01323.x"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00799""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Communication', 'Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"
10.1108/AEDS-05-2020-0084,ASIAN EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,0401 Education,"The impact of COVID-19 on student motivation, community of inquiry and learning performance","PurposeThis paper aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the students studying in higher education institutions pre and during Movement Control Order (MCO). MCO was introduced in March 2020, and the learning process must switch from face-to-face to online learning in schools and universities. This study particularly focuses on university students by analyzing the students' motivation, the community of inquiry and learning performance. In total, three factors are examined in the construct of the community of inquiry, namely social presence, cognitive presence and teaching presence.Design/methodology/approachThis paper provides quantitative analysis and paired sample t-tests on the students' learning motivation, the community of inquiry and learning performance. This paper presents the analysis of the online learning preference of 282 university students and examines whether there is significant difference in preference before and during MCO.FindingsThe findings indicated that the students lost motivation and learning performance using online learning methods during the MCO period. There is a lack of infrastructure to support the learning and social support from the lecturers and peers.Research limitations/implicationsThis research helps to explore improvements that are needed to manage such a pandemic to support teaching staff and students.Practical implicationsThe COVID-19 is a pandemic that has affected the learning process of the students, and it should not be neglected even when it is over. Policymakers shall consider providing more training and better infrastructures to cater to smooth Internet connection and platform for online learning. Students are not able to focus on learning using online learning methods and, they lack motivation during the pandemic. The teaching faculty also need to be well-trained in delivering online courses and to be more tech-savvy.Social implicationsWith the detailed analysis of the students' learning motivation, the community of inquiry and learning performance, it helps to promote a better education environment.Originality/valueThis is the first study to examine the learning motivation and performance model as well as the community of inquiry during the pandemic. It is evident that university students initially have a high level of motivation and community of inquiry before the pandemic but yield a significant drop during the MCO. The paper presented how COVID-19 seriously impacted on the learning experience.","[{""name"": ""Consilz Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sbspro.2009.01.324"", ""10.1080/10494820902809147"", ""10.2304/elea.2012.9.2.223"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.08.002"", ""10.1017/S026144480001315X"", ""10.1080/00336297.2020.1761843"", ""10.46328/ijtes.v4i4.110"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2013.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.02.021"", ""10.1007/s40299-014-0223-0"", ""10.1007/BF02504795"", ""10.1111/modl.12624"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.011"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.08.002"", ""10.20429/ijsotl.2015.090105"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.015"", ""10.3390/su12104061"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2010.03.002"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_1""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Such data enable researchers and instructors to collect information at scale about how each student navigates through and interacts with online education resources, potentially enabling objective and rich insight into the learning experience beyond self-reports and intermittent assessments. Yet, analyses of these data often require advanced analytic techniques, as they only provide a partial and noisy record of students’ actions. Consequently, these data are not always accessible or useful for course instructors and administrators. In this paper, we provide an overview of the use of clickstream data to define and identify behavioral patterns that are related to student learning outcomes. Through discussions of four studies, we provide examples of the complexities and particular considerations of using these data to examine student self-regulated learning.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Baker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Di Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jihyun Park"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Renzhe Yu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Qiujie Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bianca Cung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Fischer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fernando Rodriguez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Warschauer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Padhraic Smyth"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1467-9280.00441"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.96.3.523"", ""10.1177/2332858416674007"", ""10.1007/s11162-018-9521-3"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3554657"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.038"", ""10.1177/2158244015621777"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027403"", ""10.1145/3183654.3183681"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007"", ""10.1111/1467-8535.00345"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2010.11.010"", ""10.18608/jla.2017.42.8"", ""10.1257/pol.3.3.62"", ""10.3200/SOCP.145.3.245-264"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170381"", ""10.1145/2883851.2883931"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2018.03.008"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027441"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4002_6"", ""10.1207/S15328023TOP3002_13"", ""10.18608/jla.2017.42.10"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2014.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2006.07.008"", ""10.1145/2556325.2566247"", ""10.1080/03055698.2014.899487"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01137.x"", ""10.1353/foc.2013.0000"", ""10.1145/3059009.3059050"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.10.001"", ""10.1145/2460296.2460330"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100727"", ""10.1080/01587919.2016.1233050"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.05.010"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.4.760"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.025"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-72079-9_3"", ""10.1145/3051457.3051471"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027430"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.016"", ""10.1007/s10648-006-9014-3"", ""10.1007/s10648-004-0006-x"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.1.33"", ""10.1177/0013164493053003024"", ""10.1145/3303772.3303841"", ""10.18608/jla.2015.21.2"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2006.04.005"", ""10.1007/s11409-011-9081-9"", ""10.2224/sbp.2013.41.5.777"", ""10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2015.7156373"", ""10.1037/a0027977"", ""10.1145/345124.345167"", ""10.1007/BF00138396"", ""10.1177/1469787406064752"", ""10.1080/00223980309600625"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2611750"", ""10.1080/00461520.2010.517150"", ""10.1016/S0361-476X(02)00006-1"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.11.003""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

The use of animal fur (goat) in synthesis could assist in turning waste to wealth. Thus, potentials of animal fur in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AF-AgNPs), its biological activities and safety through cytogenotoxicity were investigated. Animal fur (1 g) was hydrolyzed with 100 ml of 0.1 M NaOH at 90 °C for 1 h, cooled and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min. The extract (1 ml) was added to 1 mM AgNO3 (40 ml) to reduce Ag+ to its nanoparticles. The AF-AgNPs was characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Larvicidal, antioxidant, anticoagulant and thrombolytic potentials of AF-AgNPs were studied. Onion bulbs (20) were exposed to 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 μg/ml of AF-AgNPs solution for its cytogenotoxicity study with AgNO3 solution and distilled water as controls. Microscopic (24, 48 and 72 h) assessment of the onion cells and macroscopic (72 h) evaluation of the roots were also studied. The AF-AgNPs solution was brownish with surface plasmon resonance at 419 nm. Evaluation of FTIR spectra showed that protein molecules were used as capping and stabilization agents. The AF-AgNPs had size range of 11.67-31.47 nm, caused 60-100% mortality of exposed Anopheles mosquito larvae in 12 h, and scavenged DPPH (40-59%) and hydrogen peroxide (75-94%). The nanoparticles also exhibited anticoagulant and thrombolytic potentials on human blood with 25% lysis compared to 13% observed for only extract. Various chromosomal aberrations and growth inhibition were induced by AF-AgNPs especially at 72 h of 100 μg/ml. Extract from animal fur was explored in biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles and found to have high potentials as antioxidant, anticoagulant, thrombolytic agents. Inhibition of cell growth observed especially at highest concentration can be explored in anticancer drugs though with caution due to AF-AgNPs potential to induce chromosomal aberrations.","[{""name"": ""G O Akintayo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Lateef"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M A Azeez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T B Asafa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""I C Oladipo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J A Badmus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S A Ojo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J A Elegbede"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E B Gueguim-Kana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L S Beukes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T A Yekeen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/occmed/kql051"", ""10.1007/s00436-015-4800-9"", ""10.1016/j.cocis.2007.10.001"", ""10.15835/nsb929938"", ""10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.06.003"", ""10.1049/iet-nbt.2017.0299"", ""10.1007/s12649-018-0540-2"", ""10.1002/btpr.2829"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b00022"", ""10.1109/TNB.2016.2559161"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1146-0"", ""10.1515/gps-2018-0038"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0492-9"", ""10.1007/s00449-019-02193-8"", ""10.1155/2017/5919836"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2013.04.076"", ""10.1002/btpr.511"", ""10.1007/s40089-014-0133-4"", ""10.1088/0957-4484/16/10/059"", ""10.1016/S0023-6438(95)80008-5"", ""10.1016/j.lwt.2007.04.003"", ""10.4330/wjc.v7.i8.434"", ""10.1016/j.jtusci.2017.06.005"", ""10.1080/00087114.2017.1370260"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2011.06.025"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2008.06.051"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2014.08.122"", ""10.1007/s13204-012-0125-5"", ""10.1007/s12247-014-9190-5"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0477-8"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2012.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2015.03.033"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1055-2"", ""10.1080/10826068.2018.1479864"", ""10.1055/s-0030-1254046"", ""10.1007/s00281-011-0290-8"", ""10.1016/S0049-3848(07)70143-3"", ""10.2217/nnm.13.49"", ""10.1021/nn900277t"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.06.069"", ""10.1016/S1995-7645(11)60197-1"", ""10.1007/s00436-012-2924-8"", ""10.1515/biolog-2015-0164"", ""10.33640/2405-609X.1018"", ""10.5897/AJB2013.12802"", ""10.1016/0014-4827(71)90630-6"", ""10.1508/cytologia.66.235""]",['Materials Science'],['Materials Chemistry'],"[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"
10.1007/s10639-022-11281-4,EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES,0401 Education,Supporting self-regulated learning with learning analytics interventions - a systematic literature review,"AbstractDuring the past years scholars have shown an increasing interest in supporting students' self-regulated learning (SRL). Learning analytics (LA) can be applied in various ways to identify a learner’s current state of self-regulation and support SRL processes. It is important to examine how LA has been used to identify the need for support in different phases of SRL cycle, which channels are used to mediate the intervention and how efficient and impactful the intervention is. This will help the learners to achieve the anticipated learning outcomes. The systematic literature review followed PRISMA 2020 statement to examine studies that applied LA interventions to enhance SRL. The search terms used for this research identified 753 papers in May 2021. Of these, 56 studies included the elements of LA, SRL, and intervention. The reviewed studies contained various LA interventions aimed at supporting SRL, but only 46% of them revealed a positive impact of an intervention on learning. Furthermore, only four studies reported positive effects for SRL and covered all three SRL phases (planning, performance, and reflection). Based on the findings of this literature review, the key recommendation is for all phases of SRL to be considered when planning interventions to support learning. In addition, more comparative research on this topic is needed to identify the most effective interventions and to provide further evidence on the effectiveness of interventions supporting SRL.","[{""name"": ""Sami Heikkinen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Saqr"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonna Malmberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matti Tedre"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3389/frai.2021.723447"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104085"", ""10.33200/IJCER.912897"", ""10.1080/15391523.2020.1728449"", ""10.1016/j.infsof.2018.10.006"", ""10.1186/s41039-020-00129-5"", ""10.1145/3027385.3029434"", ""10.1007/s11251-005-1272-9"", ""10.1017/9781108235631.024"", ""10.1109/TLT.2017.2740172"", ""10.1111/j.1464-0597.2005.00205.x"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3554613"", ""10.1016/J.IHEDUC.2015.04.007"", ""10.3217/JUCS-021-01-0023"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045913"", ""10.3837/tiis.2019.06.002"", ""10.33965/celda2020_202014l038"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155"", ""10.14742/apubs.2014.1300"", ""10.1145/3027385.3027411"", ""10.1111/bjet.12212"", ""10.13039/501100011033"", ""10.1080/00461520.2011.538645"", ""10.1177/1521025118790054"", ""10.1145/3386527.3406732"", ""10.18608/JLA.2020.72.4"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.021"", ""10.1007/s11423-020-09788-z"", ""10.1007/s11412-019-09313-2"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100758"", ""10.1145/3448139.3448179"", ""10.1145/3170358.3170421"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104251"", ""10.13140/RG.2.1.1733.2083"", ""10.1145/3375462.3375472"", ""10.14742/AJET.3749"", ""10.1109/IEA.2017.7939221"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.04.003"", ""10.14742/ajet.6370"", ""10.4324/9781351113038-4"", ""10.1080/10494820.2016.1278391"", ""10.1187/cbe.13-04-0082"", ""10.18608/jla.2022.7429"", ""10.4018/IJDET.2021010102"", ""10.1109/RITA.2015.2417952"", ""10.1145/3303772.3303787"", ""10.1109/TLT.2019.2916802"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-23207-8_65"", ""10.3390/s19132952"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-57717-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29736-7_3"", ""10.1080/08993408.2015.1033129"", ""10.1136/BMJ.N160"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00422"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29736-7_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98572-5_2"", ""10.1080/10615806.2020.1800656"", ""10.1080/00313830120074206"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06520-5_10"", ""10.1109/TALE48000.2019.9225939"", ""10.18608/jla.2015.21.2"", ""10.1002/WIDM.1355"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103890"", ""10.1080/10668926.2019.1666063"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100791"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66302-9_4"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.004"", ""10.4018/IJICTE.2018070108"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3188767"", ""10.1111/JCAL.12213"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2015.10.035"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.02.025"", ""10.18608/jla.2016.31.11"", ""10.1177/0002764213498851"", ""10.1111/bjet.12720"", ""10.18608/jla.2015.21.5"", ""10.5281/zenodo.3554597"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2015.08.004"", ""10.1007/s10209-021-00833-z"", ""10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0233977"", ""10.1111/BJEP.12525"", ""10.1111/BJET.13089"", ""10.1016/J.CHB.2020.106318"", ""10.1007/s10758-017-9341-0"", ""10.1145/3375462.3375483"", ""10.1007/S11409-022-09305-Y/TABLES/1"", ""10.18608/jla.2019.62.7"", ""10.18608/hla17.021"", ""10.1145/2567574"", ""10.18608/jla.2014.12.4"", ""10.24059/olj.v20i2.783"", ""10.1108/aaouj-01-2017-0009"", ""10.1080/10447318.2018.1543084"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103595"", ""10.1111/jcal.12247"", ""10.1109/APSEC.2016.031"", ""10.1016/b978-012109890-2/50031-7""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

Methods To study the impact of sleep quality, daytime somnolence, and sleep deprivation on medical students, we analyzed data from a multicenter study with medical students in Brazil (22 medical schools, 1350 randomized medical students). We applied questionnaires of daytime sleepiness, quality of sleep, quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms and perception of educational environment. Results 37.8% of medical students presented mild values of daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale - ESS) and 8.7% presented moderate/severe values. The percentage of female medical students that presented ESS values high or very high was significantly greater than male medical students (p &lt; 0.05). Students with lower ESS scores presented significantly greater scores of quality of life and perception of educational environment and lower scores of depression and anxiety symptoms, and these relationships showed a dose-effect pattern. Medical students reporting more sleep deprivation showed significantly greater odds ratios of presenting anxiety and depression symptoms and lower odds of good quality of life or perception of educational environment. Conclusions There is a significant association between sleep deprivation and daytime sleepiness with the perception of quality of life and educational environment in medical students.","[{""name"": ""Bruno Perotta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fernanda M.

Thus, this paper focuses on ER and carries out a literature review on educational robotics simulators with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The review searches for relevant papers which were published in the period 2013–2020 and extracted the characteristics of the simulators used. The simulators that we describe in this article cover various robotic technologies, offering students an easy way to engage with virtual robots and robotics mechanisms, such as wheeled robots or drones. Using these simulators, students might cover their educational needs or prepare themselves for educational robotic competitions by working in as realistic as possible conditions without hardware restrictions. In many cases, simulators might reduce the required cost to obtain a robotic system and increase availability. Focusing on educational robotics simulators, this paper presents seventeen simulators emphasizing key features such as: user’s age, robot’s type and programming language, development platform, capabilities, and scope of the simulator.","[{""name"": ""Sokratis Tselegkaridis"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Information and Electronic Engineering, International Hellenic University (IHU), 57400 Thessaloniki, Greece""]}, {""name"": ""Theodosios Sapounidis"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Information and Electronic Engineering, International Hellenic University (IHU), 57400 Thessaloniki, Greece""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-55553-9_16"", ""10.22492/issn.2188-1162.2020.19"", ""10.1109/SIIE.2015.7451669"", ""10.1109/BRC.2011.5740667"", ""10.1007/s10758-018-9366-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-19913-5_9"", ""10.1007/s12008-020-00670-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21975-7_7"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2994196"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.12.001"", ""10.1109/TALE.2018.8615190"", ""10.29333/ejmste/8206"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.02.010"", ""10.1145/3017680.3017700"", ""10.1177/155534340700100105"", ""10.23919/SOFTCOM.2018.8555860"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47247-8_6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-35990-4_40"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-35990-4_37"", ""10.1109/TAEE46915.2020.9163694"", ""10.20944/preprints201810.0372.v1"", ""10.1145/1868358.1868363"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-35990-4_41"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.07.157"", ""10.1109/LARS-SBR-WRE48964.2019.00086"", ""10.1177/1729881416658166"", ""10.1109/MITE.2014.7020248""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Software', 'Media Technology', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/medu.14166,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Simulation in psychiatry for medical doctors: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"AbstractContextMost medical doctors are likely to work with patients experiencing mental health conditions. However, educational opportunities for medical doctors to achieve professional development in the field of psychiatry are often limited. Simulation training in psychiatry may be a useful tool to foster this development.ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of simulation training in psychiatry for medical students, postgraduate trainees and medical doctors.MethodsFor this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we searched eight electronic databases and trial registries up to 31 August 2018. We manually searched key journals and the reference lists of selected studies. We included randomised and non‐randomised controlled studies and single group pre‐ and post‐test studies. Our main outcomes were based on Kirkpatrick levels. We included data only from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using random‐effects models.ResultsFrom 46 571 studies identified, we selected 163 studies and combined 27 RCTs. Interventions included simulation by role‐play (n = 69), simulated patients (n = 72), virtual reality (n = 22), manikin (n = 5) and voice simulation (n = 2). Meta‐analysis found significant differences at immediate post‐tests for simulation compared with active and inactive control groups for attitudes (standardised mean difference [SMD] = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31‐0.73 [I2 = 0.0%] and SMD = 0.28, 95% CI 0.04‐0.53 [I2 = 52.0%], respectively), skills (SMD = 1.37, 95% CI 0.56‐2.18 [I2 = 93.0%] and SMD = 1.49, 95% CI 0.39‐2.58 [I2 = 93.0%], respectively), knowledge (SMD = 1.22, 95% CI 0.57‐1.88 [I2 = 0.0%] and SMD = 0.72, 95% CI 0.14‐1.30 [I2 = 80.0%], respectively), and behaviours (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI 0.49‐1.65 [I2 = 68.0%] and SMD = 0.45, 95% CI 0.11‐0.79 [I2 = 41.0%], respectively). Significant differences in terms of patient benefit and doctors’ behaviours and skills were found at the 3‐month follow‐up.ConclusionsDespite heterogeneity in methods and simulation interventions, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simulation training in psychiatry training.","[{""name"": ""Marie‐Aude Piot"", ""affiliation"": [""Epidemiological and Public Health Research Centre Villejuif

10.1097/ACM.0000000000003079,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Physician Fertility: A Call to Action,"Infertility is more prevalent in female physicians than in the U.S. general population. While pregnancy and its potential medical and career development consequences among physicians have been explored in the literature, infertility and its consequences remain understudied and unaddressed. Fertility issues are important for all physicians hoping to start families, including male physicians, transgender physicians, single physicians, and physicians with same-sex partners. Infertility has numerous physical, emotional, and financial consequences and may have a negative impact on physician well-being. Options to preserve fertility (such as egg, embryo, and sperm cryopreservation) are available, yet physicians may not be aware of or have the financial ability to make use of such resources. Physician reproductive health, including the ability to build a family if and when a physician chooses, is a vital aspect of well-being. The risks and consequences of infertility and the management of fertility should be studied and addressed from policy and advocacy standpoints. The authors, who have experienced and sought treatment for infertility, bring attention to the challenges around both physician infertility and preservation of fertility. They propose 3 strategies to address physician infertility: increasing fertility education and awareness starting at the undergraduate medical education level and continuing throughout training and practice, providing insurance coverage for and access to fertility assessment and management, and offering support for those undergoing fertility treatments. The authors believe that implementing these suggestions would make a significant positive impact on trainees and practicing physicians and help build a health care workforce that is healthy and well physically, emotionally, and financially.","[{""name"": ""Ariela L.

The research aims to disclose the impact of the developed system of assignments on the consolidation of knowledge of humanities in pupil-athletes in the process of training. The pedagogical experiment was conducted in Ukrainian comprehensive schools (142 participants in the experimental group and 150 participants in the control group). The diagnostic toolset includes questionnaires for identifying cognitive interest of pupils in humanities, questionnaires for teachers and parents, tests for identifying abilities to observe, concentrate attention, memorize and apply the content of educational material, tests for studying types of memory, methods of adolescents’ self-assessment, methods of unfinished sentences, notes, reading diaries, compositions. Thus, the indicator of creative nature in acquiring knowledge of humanities has increased (+ 19,1%) in the experimental group. Analyzing the results from the experiment, one can conclude that the designed system of assignments aimed at consolidating pupil-athletes’ knowledge of humanities has contributed to increasing the levels of their overall performance, responsibility and discipline.","[{""name"": ""Maryna Komogorova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Borys Maksymchuk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olena Bernatska"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Svitlana Lukianchuk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iryna Gerasymova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olena Popova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tetiana Matviichuk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Valeriy Solovyov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nataliia Kalashnik"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hanna Davydenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olena Stoliarenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oksana Stoliarenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iryna Maksymchuk"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Health Professions'],"['Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0403 体育学', 0.7413), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7214)]]"
10.1002/ase.1866,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Neuroanatomy, the Achille's Heel of Medical Students. A Systematic Analysis of Educational Strategies for the Teaching of Neuroanatomy","Neuroanatomy has been deemed crucial for clinical neurosciences. It has been one of the most challenging parts of the anatomical curriculum and is one of the causes of “neurophobia,” whose main implication is a negative influence on the choice of neurology in the near future. In the last decades, several educational strategies have been identified to improve the skills of students and to promote a deep learning. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify the most effective method/s to teach human neuroanatomy. The search was restricted to publications written in English language and to articles describing teaching tools in undergraduate medical courses from January 2006 through December 2017. The primary outcome was the observation of improvement of anatomical knowledge in undergraduate medical students. Secondary outcomes were the amelioration of long‐term retention knowledge and the grade of satisfaction of students. Among 18 selected studies, 44.4% have used three‐dimensional (3D) teaching tools, 16.6% near peer teaching tool, 5.55% flipped classroom tool, 5.55% applied neuroanatomy elective course, 5.55% equivalence‐based instruction‐rote learning, 5.55% mobile augmented reality, 5.55% inquiry‐based clinical case, 5.55% cadaver dissection, and 5.55% Twitter. The high in‐between study heterogeneity was the main issue to identify the most helpful teaching tool to improve neuroanatomical knowledge among medical students. Data from this study suggest that a combination of multiple pedagogical resources seems to be the more advantageous for teaching neuroanatomy.","[{""name"": ""Maria Alessandra Sotgiu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery University of Sassari Sassari Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Vittorio Mazzarello"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery University of Sassari Sassari Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Pasquale Bandiera"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery University of Sassari Sassari Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Roberto Madeddu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery University of Sassari Sassari Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Montella"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery University of Sassari Sassari Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Bernard Moxham"", ""affiliation"": [""Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University Cardiff United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.3402/meo.v21.32476"", ""10.1002/ase.1719"", ""10.1002/ase.1604"", ""10.1002/ase.1686"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2010.05.002"", ""10.1007/s00276-007-0180-x"", ""10.3389/fnana.2016.00069"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2010.536276"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2005.07.007"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181b36ec6"", ""10.1111/joa.12160"", ""10.1002/ase.1260"", ""10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00231.x"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-6-5"", ""10.1212/WNL.0b013e318294b1cf"", ""10.1002/ase.1469"", ""10.1002/ase.240"", ""10.1097/MD.0000000000009516"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(199802)253:1<28::AID-AR11>3.0.CO;2-E"", ""10.1002/ar.10082"", ""10.1111/joa.12054"", ""10.1002/ase.117"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2016.02.010"", ""10.1002/ase.186"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2012.06.005"", ""10.1002/ca.20662"", ""10.1111/j.1468-1331.2007.01911.x"", ""10.1007/s40670-015-0115-9"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2018.05.006"", ""10.1111/j.1743-498X.2009.00330.x"", ""10.1016/j.wneu.2017.07.119"", ""10.3352/jeehp.2016.13.32"", ""10.1111/tct.12001"", ""10.1002/ase.1419"", ""10.1002/ase.1601"", ""10.1080/10401334.2011.611777"", ""10.1002/ase.1610"", ""10.1002/ase.1711"", ""10.1007/s10278-017-9951-z"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.05.008"", ""10.1002/ase.1296"", ""10.1001/archneur.1994.00540160018003"", ""10.47102/annals-acadmedsg.V42N11p559"", ""10.1007/s10278-018-0125-4"", ""10.1002/ca.21059"", ""10.1002/ase.1355"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2015.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2007.10.001"", ""10.1002/ase.1603"", ""10.1002/ase.1573"", ""10.1007/s10459-006-9049-8"", ""10.1007/s00276-007-0201-9"", ""10.1080/01421590802064880"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-13-164"", ""10.1002/ase.1760"", ""10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.03.021"", ""10.1111/ene.12144"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02401.x"", ""10.1002/ase.1475"", ""10.1001/archneur.57.3.418"", ""10.1007/s10869-010-9164-7"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.06.005"", ""10.1002/ase.1635"", ""10.1002/ca.22742"", ""10.1002/ca.22953"", ""10.1002/ca.20453"", ""10.1002/ase.1456"", ""10.1002/ca.22577"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0136198"", ""10.1002/ca.22417"", ""10.1002/ase.1638"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2929.2006.02643.x"", ""10.1002/ca.20249"", ""10.1002/ca.20584"", ""10.1002/ase.1380"", ""10.1002/ase.1345"", ""10.1002/ase.1611"", ""10.1002/ase.152"", ""10.1002/ase.1275"", ""10.1136/jnnp.72.5.557"", ""10.1002/ca.20342"", ""10.1111/joa.12405"", ""10.1002/alr.21986"", ""10.1002/ca.22700"", ""10.1002/ca.23280"", ""10.1007/s00276-016-1700-3"", ""10.1308/003588407X168244"", ""10.1177/0956797614545133"", ""10.1002/ase.1740"", ""10.1007/s12565-014-0257-7"", ""10.5115/acb.2015.48.2.138"", ""10.1002/ca.20101"", ""10.1186/1472-6920-10-49"", ""10.1007/s00276-010-0721-6""]","['Engineering', 'Medicine']","['Surgery', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)]]"

This study examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on high school students shortly after closure of public schools in spring 2020, and whether this impact varies by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and grade level.METHODSA cross‐sectional, one‐time online survey was completed by racial/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse students in 9th through 12th grade at 2 semi‐rural Georgia public high schools (N = 761).RESULTSOverall, almost one‐fourth of high school students were extremely or very worried about the pandemic, with higher rates of worry among students who are racial/ethnic minorities, lower SES, female and in older grades. Results indicated a concerning impact on the stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness that students are feeling, particularly among girls and those in older grades. Students of color and low SES, who are already disproportionately impacted by COVID‐19, are also more likely to experience mental health challenges.CONCLUSIONSFindings highlight important demographic differences of the impact of COVID‐19 on the mental health of high school students and have implications for schools with addressing these needs.","[{""name"": ""Julie Gazmararian"", ""affiliation"": [""Professor, (jagazma@emory.edu), Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health Emory University  1518 Clifton Road Atlanta GA 30322.

An individual student’s understanding of knowledge is increased when they are able to actively compare and build on their own understanding in conjunction with their peers. Small group teaching provides opportunities for learners to work collaboratively, and promotes team-building skills – skills that are essential to work within healthcare settings. The aim of this paper is to provide health professional students and early career health professionals involved in peer and near peer teaching, with an overview of approaches and tips to improve learner engagement when facilitating small groups.","[{""name"": ""Annette Burgess"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christie van Diggele"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Craig Mellis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000162"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.948828"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2017.1340636"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2013.849802"", ""10.1080/10401334.2015.1107484"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0579.2009.00593.x"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.680939"", ""10.12968/ippr.2015.5.1.22"", ""10.1080/01421590802061613"", ""10.1177/0969733017731916"", ""10.1007/BF00138870"", ""10.1080/0142159031000136743"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1365-1"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-1037-6"", ""10.1111/tct.12756"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e31829a3b2b"", ""10.12669/pjms.294.3609"", ""10.1111/j.1743-498X.2011.00493.x"", ""10.4324/9780203465066"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9066-6"", ""10.3109/01421599609034162"", ""10.12968/hmed.2009.70.11.45059"", ""10.1037/h0022100"", ""10.5694/j.1326-5377.2005.tb06615.x"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2010.505454""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

Two hundred forty‐three university students were asked to construct different types of supportive arguments—social, ethical, economic, scientific, ecological—as well as counterarguments and rebuttals after they had read a scenario on a SSI. Participants’ epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge were assessed separately. Results showed that students’ epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge predicted the quantity, quality, and diversity of the different types of arguments the students constructed. In particular, students who held sophisticated epistemic beliefs about the structure of knowledge and exhibited relativelymore robustprior knowledge scores, produced arguments of greater quantity, better quality, and higher diversity than students with less sophisticated epistemic beliefs and low prior knowledge scores.

This study began with a simple but vital question: What factors influenced the success of online learning during the COVID‐19 pandemic with a focus on online learning self‐efficacy?ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to examine the structural relationship among self‐efficacy (SE) in time management, SE in technology use, SE in an online learning environment, and learning engagement.MethodsThe participants of the study were 1205 undergraduates who were enrolled in a residential undergraduate program in South Korea in spring semester, 2020. The online survey was administered to collect data for this research and the survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling.Results and ConclusionsSE in technology use had a significant but negative influence on learning engagement and had a positive impact on SE in an online learning environment. SE in time management had a significant positive impact on SE in an online learning environment and learning engagement. SE in an online learning environment also significantly influenced learning engagement.ImplicationsSE in technology use itself did not enhance learning engagement. In addition, indirect effects of SE in technology use and SE in time management on learning engagement through SE in an online learning environment were confirmed in this study. This indicates the influential role of SE in an online learning environment on learning engagement of online learners.","[{""name"": ""Heeok Heo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Education, College of Education Sunchon National University  Suncheon‐si South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Curtis J.

10.1002/rrq.256,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,Critically Reviewing GraphoGame Across the World: Recommendations and Cautions for Research and Implementation of Computer-Assisted Instruction for Word-Reading Acquisition,"AbstractOverall, game‐based technology for early reading instruction has not robustly met the learning potentials of young readers. To better understand the effects and limitations of computer‐assisted instruction in classrooms, researchers have called for more critical attention to learning theory, methodological selection, and context for learning. GraphoGame (GG), an adaptive serious game designed to prevent reading difficulties through the promotion of sound–symbol connections, has been implemented in over 20 countries. Therefore, the GG research base provides an opportunity to synthesize research on a single computer‐assisted instruction across diverse contexts. Surprisingly, despite extensive use and further implementation plans, no review has yet synthesized GG's effects. Specifically, this systematic literature review, with an embedded meta‐analysis, synthesized 28 empirical studies for theory, methodological quality, and outcomes. The GG research base was dominated by theories of reading disabilities and psycholinguistics. Methodologically, quantitative methods, focusing on phonological and decoding outcome measures only, were most common. The meta‐analysis (n = 19), measuring GG's impact on word‐reading outcomes, did not yield an overall meaningful effect size (g = −0.02). However, among moderators (language complexity, duration of intervention, and adult interaction), adult interaction was significant, favoring implementation contexts with high levels of adult interaction. Specifically, studies with high adult interaction produced an average positive effect size (g = 0.48), which suggests implications for classroom use. Regarding future research, the authors recommend stronger clarity of theory, attention to learning context, and a more purposeful collection of process data, which can be obtained through greater plurality of methodology.","[{""name"": ""Erin M.

10.1002/tea.21734,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING,0401 Education,Constructing STEM identity: An expanded structural model for STEM identity research,"AbstractIdentity development frameworks provide insight into why and to what extent individuals engage in STEM‐related activities. While studies of “STEM identity” often build off previously validated disciplinary and/or science identity frameworks, quantitative analyses of constructs that specifically measure STEM identity and its antecedents are scarce, making it challenging for researchers or practitioners to apply a measurement‐based perspective of participation in opportunities billed as “STEM.” In this study, we tested two expanded structural equation models of STEM identity development, building off extensions of science and disciplinary‐identity frameworks, that incorporated additional factors relevant to identity development: gender, ethnicity, home science support, parental education, and experiencing science talk in the home. Our models test theorized relationships between interest, sense of recognition, performance‐competence, and identity in the context of STEM with undergraduate students (N = 522) enrolled in introductory STEM courses at a Hispanic Serving Institution. Our findings support our measurement of STEM identity and its indicators, providing researchers with a predictive model associated with academic intentions across disciplinary domains in STEM. Further, our expanded model (i.e., Model I+) indicates significant contributions of participant gender, which has a larger indirect effect on STEM identity (β = 0.50) than the direct effect of STEM interest (β = 0.29), and of home support in relation to performance‐competence in academic contexts. Our model also posits a significant contribution of family science talk to sense of recognition as a STEM person, expanding our understandings of the important role of the home environment while challenging prior conceptions of science capital and habitus. We situate our results within a broader discussion regarding the validity of “STEM identity” as a concept and construct in the context of communities often marginalized in STEM fields.","[{""name"": ""Remy Dou"", ""affiliation"": [""STEM Transformation Institute Florida International University  Miami Florida USA"", ""Department of Teaching and Learning Florida International University  Miami Florida USA""]}, {""name"": ""Heidi Cian"", ""affiliation"": [""STEM Transformation Institute Florida International University  Miami Florida USA"", ""Department of Teaching and Learning Florida International University  Miami Florida USA""]}]","[""10.1002/tea.21227"", ""10.1007/s11422-015-9667-7"", ""10.1002/sce.21146"", ""10.3102/0002831211433290"", ""10.1002/sce.21602"", ""10.1007/s11422-017-9855-8"", ""10.1007/s11422-019-09954-7"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.1"", ""10.1080/0194262X.2017.1371658"", ""10.1007/s11199-008-9400-z"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2007.09.003"", ""10.1353/ff.2012.0027"", ""10.3102/0002831212458142"", ""10.1080/10508400903530044"", ""10.1177/0361684315622645"", ""10.1002/tea.20237"", ""10.1109/FIE.2011.6142881"", ""10.1002/tea.21146"", ""10.1007/s11422-015-9723-3"", ""10.1007/s11422-019-09947-6"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01710.x"", ""10.1002/tea.21443"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8317.1991.tb00966.x"", ""10.1111/cdev.12363"", ""10.1007/s11199-016-0593-2"", ""10.1007/s11218-013-9232-8"", ""10.1002/sce.21060"", ""10.4324/9781315266763"", ""10.1080/09540253.2018.1557322"", ""10.1080/09500693.2011.608197"", ""10.1177/0956797610377342"", ""10.1007/s11422-015-9713-5"", ""10.1007/s11165-020-09928-8"", ""10.1002/sce.21499"", ""10.1007/s11422-012-9441-z"", ""10.3102/0002831213482038"", ""10.1080/00461520902832368"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0157447"", ""10.1002/tea.21425"", ""10.31235/osf.io/k7kwn"", ""10.1177/1948550617693063"", ""10.1007/s11422-018-9900-2"", ""10.3102/0091732X025001099"", ""10.1016/S0898-5898(00)00045-0"", ""10.1109/FIE.2013.6684787"", ""10.1002/jee.20118"", ""10.1002/tea.21695"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.53.3.379"", ""10.4324/9781315832746"", ""10.1002/tea.20363"", ""10.1080/00131946.2017.1369085"", ""10.18637/jss.v045.i07"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1002/tea.21665"", ""10.1007/s11165-012-9345-7"", ""10.1007/s11162-008-9114-7"", ""10.1007/s11218-018-9469-3"", ""10.1002/tea.21687"", ""10.3102/0034654318779957"", ""10.1177/0042085915618708"", ""10.19030/cier.v4i3.4116"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2012.08.004"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.50.4.458"", ""10.1080/19419899.2020.1729844"", ""10.1002/tea.21437"", ""10.1145/3365571"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2009.tb01003.x"", ""10.1002/sce.21522"", ""10.1111/cdev.13039"", ""10.1111/ssm.12079"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511489990"", ""10.1002/tea.21628"", ""10.1002/tea.21065"", ""10.1080/00220671.2017.1289775"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.49.3.290"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.54.3.320"", ""10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.12.020105"", ""10.7709/jnegroeducation.88.3.0311"", ""10.1002/sce.21486"", ""10.1126/science.1198062"", ""10.1016/j.dr.2016.06.004"", ""10.1002/tea.21268"", ""10.1073/pnas.1314788111"", ""10.1037/dev0000567"", ""10.1177/1538192717739958"", ""10.1007/s11199-011-9945-0"", ""10.18637/jss.v048.i02"", ""10.1080/01621459.1996.10476908"", ""10.1080/21548455.2020.1853270"", ""10.1002/sce.21007"", ""10.1007/s11336-009-9135-y"", ""10.4324/9781410610904"", ""10.1186/s40594-018-0137-0"", ""10.1002/tea.21251"", ""10.1002/tea.21246"", ""10.1080/09500693.2011.590543"", ""10.1037/0022-0167.46.4.461"", ""10.2307/270723"", ""10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00053.x"", ""10.1002/tea.21623"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00716"", ""10.1177/0890207020962326"", ""10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01709.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjf9vz4"", ""10.1080/09500693.2018.1486522"", ""10.1007/s10648-015-9355-x"", ""10.1016/0898-5898(94)90021-3"", ""10.1007/s11422-020-10005-9"", ""10.1080/1361332052000341006"", ""10.1002/tea.20195"", ""10.3102/00028312037001215""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Safety Research']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

The main objective of this paper focuses on conducting a systematic review of studies regarding the impact of Assistive Technology for the inclusion of students with disabilities. In order to achieve the above, a review of relevant empirical studies published between 2009 and 2020 in four databases (Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, ERIC and PsycINFO) was carried out. The sample consists of 31 articles that met the inclusion criteria of this review, out of a total of 216 identified.

The study described in this paper was a systematic literature review of the literature on modelling competencies published over the past two decades. Based on a full-text analysis of 75 peer-reviewed studies indexed in renowned databases and published in English, the study revealed the dominance of an analytical, bottom-up approach for conceptualizing modelling competencies and distinguishing a variety of sub-competencies. Furthermore, the analysis showed the great richness of methods for measuring modelling competencies, although a focus on (non-standardized) tests prevailed. Concerning design and offering for fostering modelling competencies, the majority of the papers reported training strategies for modelling courses. Overall, the current literature review pointed out the necessity for further theoretical work on conceptualizing mathematical modelling competencies while highlighting the richness of developed empirical approaches and their implementation at various educational levels.","[{""name"": ""Mustafa Cevikbas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gabriele Kaiser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stanislaw Schukajlow"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10763-018-9936-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62968-1_16"", ""10.1080/10986065.2018.1474532"", ""10.1093/teamat/hry002"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37673-4_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37673-4_12"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62968-1_49"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0910-2_37"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37673-4_34"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-29822-1_3"", ""10.1093/teamat/22.3.123"", ""10.1027/2151-2604/a000194"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0910-2_3"", ""10.3390/math9040399"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-66996-6_44"", ""10.51272/pmena.42.2020"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37673-4_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62968-1_50"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-66996-6_45"", ""10.18820/2519593X/pie.v38i1.15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37673-4_37"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0910-2_39"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1521/3/032077"", ""10.1007/s10649-013-9491-5"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0910-2_40"", ""10.1533/9780857099419.3.130"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-18272-8_37"", ""10.1080/00273171.2019.1707061"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37673-4_38"", ""10.35763/aiem.v0i17.303"", ""10.1007/s11858-018-0924-6"", ""10.30935/scimath/9444"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6540-5_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-18272-8_14"", ""10.12973/eurasia.2017.00803a"", ""10.1533/9780857099419"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37673-4_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-14931-4_8"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-29822-1_23"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03800"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0206211"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-0561-1_22"", ""10.1002/14651858.MR000001.pub2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10121-7_11"", ""10.1080/0020739X.2020.1725165"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0910-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-18272-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-29822-1_8"", ""10.1007/BF02652813"", ""10.1080/14794802.2018.1473160"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62968-1_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37673-4_27"", ""10.1007/s13138-010-0006-y"", ""10.54870/1551-3440.1481"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6540-5_27"", ""10.1007/s13138-010-0005-z"", ""10.1007/BF02655885"", ""10.1533/9780857099419.2.63"", ""10.1007/s11858-019-01048-6"", ""10.11114/jets.v1i1.24"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097"", ""10.4324/9781315189314"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-29822-1_1"", ""10.1007/s10649-019-09903-9"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.1007/s11858-018-0933-5"", ""10.1007/s11858-015-0707-2"", ""10.1007/s10649-020-09971-2"", ""10.1007/BF03546488"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0910-2_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-18272-8_1"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-0561-1_33"", ""10.1023/A:1003246329257"", ""10.26803/ijlter.18.11.2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-62968-1_15"", ""10.1007/s11858-017-0909-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-66996-6_20"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-66996-6_21"", ""10.1063/1.4983946"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-6540-5_33"", ""10.18404/ijemst.39145"", ""10.1007/s13138-010-0008-9"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0910-2_42"", ""10.1080/0020739X.2018.1527404"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-14931-4_12""]","['Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Software', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"
10.1177/1356336X19850852,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW,0401 Education,"A student-centred digital technology approach: The relationship between intrinsic motivation, learning climate and academic achievement of physical education pre-service teachers","There is a lack of research on the use of digital technology in physical education teacher education (PETE) and its relationship with the learning and engagement of pre-service teachers. Furthermore, research reports low engagement of pre-service teachers in digital approaches that do not promote active learning and are mostly teacher-centred. This paper aims to: (a) explore the relationship between a student-centred digital technology approach and the pre-service teachers’ intrinsic motivation, learning climate and academic achievement; and (b) test the relationship between learning climate and intrinsic motivation as possible predictors of academic achievement. The student-centred digital technology approach was designed following an adaptation of the five-phase pedagogical guidelines for teaching with emerging technologies. Two intact classes ( n = 110 students) and one teacher educator were involved in the study. Following a mixed-method approach, quantitative data was collected on pre-service teachers’ intrinsic motivation, learning climate and academic achievement. Qualitative data explored pre-service teachers’ tweets and learning blogs. Choice and novelty were two central tenets that conditioned high levels of intrinsic motivation and academic achievement. The study provides support for the use of active learning environments where pre-service teachers are involved in creative content production using digital technology in PETE programmes. Given the growing role of digital technology for learning in educational policies and new physical education curricula, we advocate for the publication of more research-based experiences on the integration of digital technology in PETE programmes. The transferability of such teaching and learning experiences to pre-service teachers’ and physical education teachers’ practice would be especially worthwhile.","[{""name"": ""Antonio Calderón"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Limerick, Ireland""]}, {""name"": ""Lourdes Meroño"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Sport, UCAM Catholic University of Murcia, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Ann MacPhail"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Limerick, Ireland""]}]","[""10.1080/1475939X.2016.1163283"", ""10.1080/14703297.2013.863735"", ""10.1177/1469787418782817"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17727-4_62-1"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1080/17439884.2015.1107097"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.06.006"", ""10.1080/13573322.2016.1226792"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2011.12.005"", ""10.1007/s10956-011-9316-1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00865.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.09.005"", ""10.1111/bjet.12431"", ""10.1080/13573322.2014.938036"", ""10.1080/15265161.2016.1276644"", ""10.1177/1356336X16645611"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2013.06.002"", ""10.14221/ajte.2011v36n6.1"", ""10.1177/1356336X18783980"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.036"", ""10.1080/2159676X.2017.1303790"", ""10.1080/00336297.2015.1051236"", ""10.1080/13573322.2013.858624"", ""10.3402/rlt.v3i2.9606"", ""10.1080/03075079.2015.1007946"", ""10.1080/14703297.2019.1579665"", ""10.1080/13562517.2010.507307"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.12.011"", ""10.3102/0013189X033007014"", ""10.1007/s11251-014-9343-4"", ""10.1111/bjet.12428"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.12.002"", ""10.1080/13573322.2014.962496"", ""10.1080/13583881003629814"", ""10.1080/02701367.1989.10607413"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.01.002"", ""10.1108/9781787144873"", ""10.1111/bjet.12053"", ""10.1177/1356336X13486050"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.134.2.270"", ""10.1108/978-1-78714-487-320181002"", ""10.1521/978.14625/28806"", ""10.1177/1356336X19826603"", ""10.3200/JOER.99.6.323-338"", ""10.1080/13562517.2016.1213229"", ""10.1080/13562517.2016.1273205"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2016.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.01.002"", ""10.1207/S15327752JPA8001_18"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.09.003"", ""10.1007/s11135-017-0469-8"", ""10.1080/02619760701845016"", ""10.1037/a0023353"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.09.026"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00680.x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.009"", ""10.1007/s11218-013-9245-3"", ""10.11120/elss.2012.04030013"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.70.4.767"", ""10.1080/02602938.2016.1260091""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Education', 'Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0403 体育学', 0.7413), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7214)]]"

This interest has resulted in growth of the number of researchers participating in the field and the quantity of their resulting contributions, stressing the community's ability to comprehend and build upon the literature. In this work, a data‐driven review is presented that addresses the recent surge of research by providing a quantitative snapshot of the field. Relevant data are catalogued with three levels of analysis. First, publication‐level analysis explores high‐level trends in the field and bibliometric relationships across the more detailed analyses. Second, device‐level analysis examines the tethering of robots and the incorporation of component types (actuators, sensors, controllers, power sources) into each robot. Finally, component‐level analysis investigates the compliances, material compositions, and “function media” (energetic methods by which components operate) of each soft robotic component in the analyzed literature. The reported data indicate a significant reliance on elastomeric materials, electrical and fluidic media, and physical tethering; meanwhile, controllers and power sources remain underdeveloped relative to actuators and sensors. These gaps in the surveyed literature are elaborated upon, and promising future directions for the field of soft robotics are identified.","[{""name"": ""Barclay Jumet"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Rice University  6100 Main Street.

10.1111/bjet.13336,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,Using natural language processing to support peer-feedback in the age of artificial intelligence: A cross-disciplinary framework and a research agenda,"Advancements in artificial intelligence are rapidly increasing. The new‐generation large language models, such as ChatGPT and GPT‐4, bear the potential to transform educational approaches, such as peer‐feedback. To investigate peer‐feedback at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and educational research, this paper suggests a cross‐disciplinary framework that aims to facilitate the development of NLP‐based adaptive measures for supporting peer‐feedback processes in digital learning environments. To conceptualize this process, we introduce a peer‐feedback process model, which describes learners' activities and textual products. Further, we introduce a terminological and procedural scheme that facilitates systematically deriving measures to foster the peer‐feedback process and how NLP may enhance the adaptivity of such learning support. Building on prior research on education and NLP, we apply this scheme to all learner activities of the peer‐feedback process model to exemplify a range of NLP‐based adaptive support measures. We also discuss the current challenges and suggest directions for future cross‐disciplinary research on the effectiveness and other dimensions of NLP‐based adaptive support for peer‐feedback. Building on our suggested framework, future research and collaborations at the intersection of education and NLP can innovate peer‐feedback in digital learning environments. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic There is considerable research in educational science on peer‐feedback processes. Natural language processing facilitates the analysis of students' textual data. There is a lack of systematic orientation regarding which NLP techniques can be applied to which data to effectively support the peer‐feedback process. What this paper adds A comprehensive overview model that describes the relevant activities and products in the peer‐feedback process. A terminological and procedural scheme for designing NLP‐based adaptive support measures. An application of this scheme to the peer‐feedback process results in exemplifying the use cases of how NLP may be employed to support each learner activity during peer‐feedback. Implications for practice and/or policy To boost the effectiveness of their peer‐feedback scenarios, instructors and instructional designers should identify relevant leverage points, corresponding support measures, adaptation targets and automation goals based on theory and empirical findings. Management and IT departments of higher education institutions should strive to provide digital tools based on modern NLP models and integrate them into the respective learning management systems; those tools should help in translating the automation goals requested by their instructors into prediction targets, take relevant data as input and allow for evaluating the predictions.","[{""name"": ""Elisabeth Bauer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Psychology Ludwig‐Maximilians‐Universität München  Munich Germany"", ""School of Social Sciences and Technology Technical University of Munich  Munich Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Greisel"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty for Philosophy and Social Sciences University of Augsburg  Augsburg Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Ilia Kuznetsov"", ""affiliation"": [""Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, Department of Computer Science and Hessian Center for AI (hessian.AI) Technical University of Darmstadt  Darmstadt Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Markus Berndt"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Medical Education, University Hospital of LMU Munich  Munich Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Ingo Kollar"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty for Philosophy and Social Sciences University of Augsburg  Augsburg Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Markus Dresel"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty for Philosophy and Social Sciences University of Augsburg  Augsburg Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Martin R.

10.1111/lang.12528,LANGUAGE LEARNING,0401 Education,"Undoing Competence: Coloniality, Homogeneity, and the Overrepresentation of Whiteness in Applied Linguistics","AbstractConceptualizations of competence that permeate applied linguistics systematically fail to account for the role of racialization in language learning and assessments thereof. To interrogate the racialization of linguistic competence, we first examine its discursive emergence in conjunction with the ideological construction of linguistic homogeneity as central to the naturalization of race within the context of European colonialism. We then track how ideas about linguistic competence took shape jointly with a genre of the human that is overrepresented as white, as well as how this particular genre of the human informed foundational conceptualizations of communicative competence. After analyzing relevant examples of how communicative competence has been taken up in ways that reify this racializing ideology, we end with an alternative conceptualization of the goals of language learning that focuses on the worldviews and lifeways of racialized communities to move beyond universalizing conceptions of competence as the desired outcome.","[{""name"": ""Nelson Flores"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Pennsylvania""]}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Rosa"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University""]}]","[""10.1093/elt/56.1.57"", ""10.1002/tesq.315"", ""10.4324/9781315682280"", ""10.2307/3585958"", ""10.4324/9781315147383"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511486647"", ""10.2307/451863"", ""10.1017/S0267190522000083"", ""10.1353/lan.2020.0074"", ""10.1017/S0140525X00001515"", ""10.1080/02188790802236006"", ""10.1017/S0267190521000209"", ""10.1353/lan.2020.0077"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-30424-3_36"", ""10.1017/S0047404522000094"", ""10.17763/1943‐5045‐89.2.177"", ""10.1007/s10993‐017‐9436‐4"", ""10.1353/aq.2021.0045"", ""10.1080/15427587.2013.846210"", ""10.1002/tesq.114"", ""10.1080/00405841.2019.1665411"", ""10.1080/15348458.2015.1019787"", ""10.17763/0017‐8055.85.2.149"", ""10.4324/9780203774977-12"", ""10.1017/9781108649209"", ""10.1080/15427587.2021.1935957"", ""10.2307/1341787"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511841057"", ""10.4324/9780367815103-6"", ""10.1093/applin/amab055"", ""10.1111/j.1540‐4781.2006.00395_3.x"", ""10.1093/applin/amu045"", ""10.1002/tesq.613"", ""10.1093/applin/amz033"", ""10.1016/B978‐0‐12‐754850‐0.50014‐3"", ""10.17953/aicr.35.2.f3r173r46m261844"", ""10.1111/j.1473‐4192.2000.tb00141.x"", ""10.1177/0739986300221001"", ""10.21832/9781853599255"", ""10.1002/trtr.1679"", ""10.1080/00405841.2019.1665414"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816674244.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0047404520000330"", ""10.1017/S0267190520000100"", ""10.1093/applin/amaa031"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐971X.1985.tb00412.x"", ""10.1093/applin/amab018"", ""10.1111/j.1548‐1395.2010.01046.x"", ""10.17763/haer.84.1.982l873k2ht16m77"", ""10.1080/00664677.2012.694170"", ""10.1111/lic3.12544"", ""10.1177/0022185618792990"", ""10.1111/jola.12116"", ""10.1111/amet.12468"", ""10.1017/S0047404517000562"", ""10.1111/aman.13353"", ""10.1002/9781118786093.iela0275"", ""10.1353/lan.2016.0080"", ""10.1002/tesq.530"", ""10.1215/9781478007401"", ""10.2307/811913"", ""10.1093/applin/10.2.138"", ""10.1017/S0047404517000379"", ""10.1080/13670050408667804"", ""10.1017/S0047404516000804"", ""10.1353/ncr.2004.0015""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Linguistics and Language', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.746), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7418)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"
10.1007/s11409-020-09237-5,METACOGNITION AND LEARNING,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,Transfer of metacognitive skills in self-regulated learning: an experimental training study,"AbstractTraining interventions for self-regulated learning foster the use of strategies and skills as well as their transfer to new learning tasks. Because cognitive strategies or motivation regulation strategies are task-specific, their transfer is limited. In contrast, metacognitive skills are task-general and transferable to a wide variety of learning tasks. Questions arise, therefore, as to whether students transfer metacognitive skills spontaneously and how to support metacognitive skill transfer. Previous research shows that hybrid training, which addresses both metacognitive skills and cognitive strategies, supports near transfer. However, it is not clear whether hybrid training also fosters far transfer of metacognitive skills. In investigating this research question, 233 fifth-grade students were randomly assigned to six different conditions: two hybrid-training conditions (metacognitive skills and one out of two cognitive strategies), two non-hybrid training conditions (“only” one out of two cognitive strategies), and two control training conditions (neither metacognitive skills nor cognitive strategies). After 15 weeks of training, transfer of metacognitive skills to learning tasks similar to training tasks (near transfer) was tested. In the following 15 weeks, all students received a second, non-hybrid training involving a new cognitive strategy. Far transfer of metacognitive skills to the new cognitive strategy was tested afterward. The results show that hybrid training, compared to non-hybrid and control training, improved both students’ near and far transfer of metacognitive skills. Moreover, cognitive strategy use increased in at least one of the hybrid-training conditions. However, since the level of metacognitive skills use remained low, further means to support transfer are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Corinna Schuster"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ferdinand Stebner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Detlev Leutner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joachim Wirth"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11251-011-9202-5"", ""10.1027/1016-9040.1.2.100"", ""10.1016/S0883-0355(99)00014-2"", ""10.1111/bjep.12022"", ""10.1002/asi.5090080406"", ""10.1108/00483480710726136"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.95.1.188"", ""10.1007/s11409-008-9029-x"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2008.02.003"", ""10.14786/flr.v4i5.247"", ""10.1007/s10648-008-9083-6"", ""10.1080/00461520.2011.538645"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2016.10.011"", ""10.1080/00461520.2012.695678"", ""10.3758/BF03193146"", ""10.7771/1932-6246.1118"", ""10.1016/j.cpr.2010.09.007"", ""10.1006/cogp.1993.1013"", ""10.3102/00346543042003237"", ""10.1016/0749-596X(87)90063-5"", ""10.4324/9781315697048-6"", ""10.1007/s11409-014-9119-x"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.101245"", ""10.1080/19345740802539325"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep2203&4_4"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.03.014"", ""10.1002/acp.2350050404"", ""10.1177/0895904818802086"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog1201_1"", ""10.1023/A:1016282811724"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199907)20:4<421::AID-JOB896>3.0.CO;2-#"", ""10.5539/ies.v11n10p42"", ""10.1007/s11409-014-9130-2"", ""10.1891/1945-8959.12.3.391"", ""10.1007/BF01463939"", ""10.1023/A:1003088013286"", ""10.1007/s11409-017-9173-2"", ""10.1007/s10212-010-0040-7"", ""10.1016/0022-0965(84)90126-7"", ""10.1007/s11409-018-9183-8"", ""10.1207/s1532690xci0102_1"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3602_4"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2005.04.010"", ""10.3102/0013189X018001016"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50043-3"", ""10.1177/0013164493053003024"", ""10.1023/A:1003884601109"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.11.009"", ""10.20343/teachlearninqu.5.1.6"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-2243-8_1"", ""10.1006/ceps.1994.1033"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.90.2.236"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.87.3.433"", ""10.1007/s11165-005-3917-8"", ""10.1007/s42010-018-0028-6"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2009.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2005.12.006"", ""10.1024/1010-0652/a000014"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2014.09.002"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-27172-5_3"", ""10.1007/s11409-008-9027-z"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.2.306"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2017.05.005"", ""10.2307/1129583"", ""10.1007/s11423-017-9539-9"", ""10.1016/S1041-6080(02)00094-8"", ""10.1016/S0959-4752(96)00025-4"", ""10.1007/s11251-004-2274-8"", ""10.1007/s11409-006-6893-0"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50051-2"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.54.8.594"", ""10.4324/9781315697048-3"", ""10.1027/0044-3409.216.2.102"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.90.2.224"", ""10.1016/S0883-0355(00)00051-3"", ""10.1037/edu0000022"", ""10.1037/edu0000300""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)]]"
10.1002/berj.3654,BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL,0401 Education,The role of research ethics committees: Friend or foe in educational research? An exploratory study,"Ethics committees have an important role to play in ensuring ethical standards (e.g. BERA, ESRC, RCUK recommendations) are met by educational researchers. Balancing obligations to participants, society, institutions and the researchers themselves is not, however, easy. Researchers often experience the ethics committee as unsympathetic to their research endeavour, whilst ethics committees find some research approaches do not make ethical implications sufficiently explicit. This potential for misunderstanding is evident in the literature, but studies investigating how participants perceive this relationship are missing. This research comprises a novel empirical study which explores researcher perceptions of research ethics committees. Fifty‐five participants in higher education departments of education responded to an online survey. Open and closed‐ended questions were used to collect data on roles, methodological stance, experiences of the research ethics committee, perceived tensions and examples of good practice. The results indicated that contemporary educational researchers regard research ethics committees as friends when researcher and reviewer are transparently engaged in a shared endeavour. When this shared endeavour breaks down, for a variety of reasons—including apparently unreasonable demands or mutual misunderstanding—the research ethics committees can become foes. The difference between foe and friend lies in the quality of communication, clear systems and a culture of respectful mutual learning. The contributions of this study have practical implications for the ways that education researchers and research ethics committees relate to one another within university settings, both to alleviate areas of tension and to arrive at a shared understanding which will enable best ethical research practice.","[{""name"": ""Carol Brown"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Brookes University UK""]}, {""name"": ""Jane Spiro"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Brookes University UK""]}, {""name"": ""Sarah Quinton"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford Brookes University UK""]}]","[""10.1080/13645570500435207"", ""10.4135/9781446268377"", ""10.1080/13504622.2012.709823"", ""10.4324/9780203995877"", ""10.1080/00218499.1981.12468155"", ""10.4135/9781473909762"", ""10.1177/1077800407304456"", ""10.1080/03075070500392375"", ""10.1080/13562510701278716"", ""10.1177/1077800407300785"", ""10.1080/17449642.2011.632718"", ""10.1086/428419"", ""10.1177/1077800406297651"", ""10.1080/13645570802170288"", ""10.5153/sro.2247"", ""10.4135/9781849209779"", ""10.1080/1743727X.2018.1533939"", ""10.1177/0969733011403807"", ""10.3138/9781442683204-005"", ""10.1037/h0076268"", ""10.1080/13645579.2011.565635"", ""10.1080/03054980601094651"", ""10.1037/h0040525"", ""10.1080/14733280701791918"", ""10.1111/j.1099-0860.1996.tb00461.x"", ""10.1186/s41073-017-0038-7"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2016.03.009"", ""10.1080/03075079.2011.647766"", ""10.1002/berj.3160"", ""10.1177/0038038507082318"", ""10.1080/1743727X.2010.511838"", ""10.4324/9780203354896"", ""10.5153/sro.2265"", ""10.1080/1364557092000045294"", ""10.1177/1077800406297655"", ""10.1177/1747016116652650"", ""10.1177/0013164411431162"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02416.x""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'General Health Professions', 'Law']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"
10.1007/s10734-020-00553-y,HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,The prestige economy of higher education journals: a quantitative approach,"AbstractThis study addresses stratification in the global higher education research community and the changing geography of country affiliations in six elite journals. The distribution of country affiliations is analyzed from a longitudinal perspective (1996–2018), and full-time and part-time authors in the field are contrasted. The prestige maximization model and principal-agent theory provide the theoretical framework for the study, which examines 6334 articles published in six elite journals in the context of 21,442 articles in 41 core journals. The findings indicate that about 3.3% of academics have authored at least five articles (full-timers). These authors constitute the publishing core of the research community, while the 80% who have authored one article (part-timers) constitute its periphery.Higher Education(HE) andStudies in Higher Education(SHE) emerge as elite global journals, with an increasing share of non-Anglo-Saxon authors. Previously globally invisible countries became visible almost exclusively through HE and SHE. Global trends include the diminishing role of American researchers and the increasing role of researchers from Continental Europe, East Asia, and the cluster of 66 “other” countries. The single biggest affiliation loser is the United States, which had 42.5% of country affiliations in 1996–2003 but only 26.9% in 2012–2018. This reflects both the increasing share of non-American affiliations and the increasing yearly volume of HE and SHE publications, in which US academics tend not to publish massively.","[{""name"": ""Marek Kwiek"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10967490801887889"", ""10.1162/qss_a_00019"", ""10.1093/scipol/scy052"", ""10.1353/rhe.1983.0024"", ""10.1080/23322969.2018.1498300"", ""10.1080/13596748.2011.626971"", ""10.3152/147154303781780290"", ""10.1353/jhe.2011.0020"", ""10.1007/s11162-009-9155-6"", ""10.1177/000312240406900205"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2009.11.008"", ""10.1007/s11293-005-1647-y"", ""10.1007/s11024-016-9292-y"", ""10.1126/science.1197286"", ""10.2307/256535"", ""10.1111/j.1465-7295.2011.00381.x"", ""10.1108/AJIM-01-2017-0006"", ""10.1080/02671520802348590"", ""10.3386/w25093"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674497900"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-4989-7_2"", ""10.1007/s10734-013-9695-8"", ""10.1023/B:RIHE.0000027392.94172.d2"", ""10.1111/hequ.12015"", ""10.1080/07294360.2017.1411337"", ""10.1080/13600800802383018"", ""10.1177/1028315315572898"", ""10.1007/s10734-015-9910-x"", ""10.1177/1028315317747084"", ""10.1093/scipol/scx020"", ""10.1007/s11192-018-2644-7"", ""10.1111/hequ.12221"", ""10.1080/03075079.2020.1749254"", ""10.1007/s11192-020-03460-2"", ""10.1002/asi.21232"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2018.04.002"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000695"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-01523-1_8"", ""10.1007/s11162-006-9045-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-21325-1"", ""10.1007/s11192-007-1681-4"", ""10.1080/1360080X.2017.1354756"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2273.2008.00393.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-56791-4"", ""10.1162/qss_a_00039"", ""10.1353/jhe.2016.0000"", ""10.1007/s10734-018-0230-9"", ""10.12688/f1000research.16493.1"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2015.01.012"", ""10.1353/rhe.1987.0007"", ""10.3917/mana.165.0707"", ""10.1287/orsc.1040.0107"", ""10.1093/wentk/9780190640118.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61830-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21512-9_6"", ""10.1080/07294360.2012.692361"", ""10.1007/s10734-014-9718-0"", ""10.1080/07294360.2017.1389858"", ""10.1007/s11192-005-0248-5"", ""10.5530/jscires.5.1.3"", ""10.1016/S0048-7333(98)00049-3"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199240531.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10734-011-9414-2""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.3390/educsci10100262,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Teacher Recruitment and Retention: A Critical Review of International Evidence of Most Promising Interventions,"Background: A raft of initiatives and reforms have been introduced in many countries to attract and recruit school teachers, many of which do not have a clear evidence base, so their effectiveness remains unclear. Prior research has been largely correlational in design. This paper describes a rigorous and comprehensive review of international evidence, synthesising the findings of some of the strongest empirical work so far. Methods: The review synthesises a total of 120 pieces of research from 13 electronic databases, Google/Google scholar and other sources. Each study is weighted by strength of evidence. Results: The strongest evidence suggests that targeted money can encourage people into teaching but does not necessarily keep them in the teaching profession. The money needs to be large enough to compensate for the disadvantages of working in certain schools and areas, and competitive enough to offset the opportunity costs of not being in more lucrative occupations, and its effect is only short-term. Conclusions: Continuing professional development (CPD) and early career support could be promising approaches for retaining teachers in the profession, but the evidence for them is weak. There is no evidence that any other approaches work, largely because of the lack of robust studies.","[{""name"": ""Beng Huat See"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education, Durham University, Durham DH1 1TA, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Rebecca Morris"", ""affiliation"": [""Department for Education Studies, Warwick University, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen Gorard"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education, Durham University, Durham DH1 1TA, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Dimitra Kokotsaki"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education, Durham University, Durham DH1 1TA, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Sophia Abdi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK""]}]","[""10.1002/jae.2539"", ""10.1023/A:1008067210518"", ""10.1177/003172171109200608"", ""10.1080/02671522.2019.1568535"", ""10.3102/0002831210370711"", ""10.54300/247.242"", ""10.3386/w18237"", ""10.12698/cpre.2011.rr69"", ""10.1177/0042085914549367"", ""10.1080/00071005.2019.1589417"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2006.10.001"", ""10.22230/ijepl.2009v4n8a132"", ""10.3386/w9878"", ""10.2307/3559017"", ""10.1920/re.ifs.2017.0674"", ""10.3102/00346543066003361"", ""10.1080/2331186X.2014.967477"", ""10.1080/00940771.2016.1059725"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2016.10.015"", ""10.3102/0002831210380788"", ""10.1177/016146811211401004"", ""10.1111/j.1744-7984.2004.tb00036.x"", ""10.1353/hsj.2002.0017"", ""10.1177/00224669040380010401"", ""10.3102/0034654309355994"", ""10.3102/0034654308321455"", ""10.4324/9781315456898"", ""10.1002/pam.20505"", ""10.1177/0019793916651040"", ""10.1177/016146811511700908"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3296427"", ""10.1080/03055698.2021.1915751"", ""10.3102/0002831211434579"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2020.104212"", ""10.3102/0002831217716540"", ""10.3102/0162373715609687"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2007.07.003"", ""10.1177/1091142106291662"", ""10.1086/667757"", ""10.1257/aer.101.3.460"", ""10.1002/pam.22037"", ""10.1177/0019793916650452"", ""10.2307/145729"", ""10.1353/jef.2016.0001"", ""10.3102/0162373713503185"", ""10.1002/pam.21818"", ""10.1016/j.jpubeco.2013.11.001"", ""10.1080/09243453.2015.1035731"", ""10.1177/0022487113488945"", ""10.1108/IJMCE-09-2017-0064"", ""10.1177/019263650408863803"", ""10.1177/0022487106297840"", ""10.3102/0162373712454328"", ""10.1177/0022487117702583"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2017.03.016"", ""10.54300/454.278"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3962307"", ""10.1016/j.econedurev.2013.09.005"", ""10.1257/jep.25.4.191""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1111/bjet.13215,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,"Robot programming versus block play in early childhood education: Effects on computational thinking, sequencing ability, and self-regulation","AbstractProgrammable robotics is recently used in early childhood education (ECE) to introduce programming and computational thinking (CT) skills. However, there is a further need for research to contrast the efficacy of children's participation in robot programming and traditionally beneficial ECE activities. The present study thus investigated the effects of a robot programming intervention versus a block play program on kindergarteners' CT, sequencing ability, and self‐regulation. The experiment (robot programming) versus comparison (block play) condition was randomly assigned to four kindergarten classes, which included 101 kindergarteners (M = 64.78 months, SD = 7.64). Statistical analyses revealed that the robot programming group (N = 54) had experienced greater gains over time in sequencing ability relative to those in the block play group (N = 47; F = 5.09, p &lt; 0.05). Children in the robot programming group with lower level of self‐regulation at baseline showed larger improvements in sequencing ability over time relative to the block play group (F = 2.37, p = 0.01). Also, children in the robot programming group with older age showed larger improvements in CT over time relative to the block play group (F = 2.40, p &lt; 0.01). The study demonstrates the positive benefits of robot programming to early childhood development in terms of CT and sequencing ability, compared to a traditional curriculum activity in ECE—block play. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Screen‐free robot programming can enhance preschool children's computational thinking (CT). Block play can enhance preschool children's mathematics and executive functioning. Both robot programming and block play are engaging for preschool children. What this paper adds An unplugged CT assessment is used to measure and compare the effects of both robot programming and block play interventions among preschool children. Robot programming outperforms block play in promoting children's school readiness skills such as sequencing ability. Children with lower self‐regulation skills benefited more from the robot programming intervention. Implications for practice and/or policy Robot programming and CT education should be expanded in diverse early childhood settings to boost the positive effects. Technology‐enhanced curricula should be integrated into early childhood education. Teachers should receive training on robot programming in addition to more traditional skills such as scaffolding children's block play.","[{""name"": ""Weipeng Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Early Childhood Education The Education University of Hong Kong  Hong Kong SAR China""]}, {""name"": ""Davy Tsz Kit Ng"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Education The University of Hong Kong  Hong Kong SAR China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongyu Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Preschool Education Capital Normal University  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.chb.2019.106185"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.018"", ""10.1109/SIIE.2017.8259649"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02713"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103807"", ""10.1016/S1364‐6613(00)01804‐0"", ""10.1016/j.jsp.2009.10.001"", ""10.1111/j.2044‐835X.1986.tb01003.x"", ""10.1111/j.2044‐8317.1988.tb00901.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐8535.2007.00793.x"", ""10.20897/ejsteme/3868"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.10.020"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.04.013"", ""10.1111/j.1467‐8624.2008.01227.x"", ""10.1145/2485760.2485786"", ""10.3102/0034654317710096"", ""10.1080/02699930500172515"", ""10.1080/03004430.2018.1534844"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2017.03.001"", ""10.1080/03004430.2016.1223064"", ""10.1080/02568540709594596"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103832"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.018"", ""10.1126/science.1204529"", ""10.1504/IJMLO.2020.106179"", ""10.1037/a0038256"", ""10.1080/03004430802671171"", ""10.1109/CSCI49370.2019.00152"", ""10.1007/BF02480880"", ""10.3390/su10040905"", ""10.1007/s10639‐018‐9736‐0"", ""10.2190/EC.50.4.f"", ""10.1007/s10643‐012‐0554‐5"", ""10.1080/1350293X.2021.1968458"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.005"", ""10.1080/10409289.2020.1795333"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-60128-7_35"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2021.100396"", ""10.1111/bjet.12355"", ""10.1145/3230977.3230984"", ""10.1037/0012‐1649.43.4.947"", ""10.1080/10409289.2011.569317"", ""10.1006/cogp.1999.0734"", ""10.1007/s40299‐019‐00438‐4"", ""10.1080/10986065.2021.1969866"", ""10.1504/IJMLO.2016.077867"", ""10.1080/02568540809594652"", ""10.1016/0732‐118X(84)90018‐7"", ""10.1504/IJSD.2020.115206"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2007.01.004"", ""10.1037/a0015365"", ""10.1007/s10798‐015‐9325‐0"", ""10.4324/9780429453755-5"", ""10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453926"", ""10.1007/s10956‐020‐09831‐x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104222"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-3927-9_13"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.08.047"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2018.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.09.003"", ""10.1348/135910708X389042"", ""10.1145/2930674.2930703"", ""10.1007/s10798‐018‐9483‐y"", ""10.1177/1476718X16664557"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2012.05.003"", ""10.1080/10409289.2011.536132"", ""10.1145/1118178.1118215"", ""10.1098/rsta.2008.0118"", ""10.1080/02568540109594958"", ""10.1111/jcal.12348"", ""10.1177/183693911103600202"", ""10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125368"", ""10.1037/1089‐2680.1.2.198"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103607""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1007/s11162-020-09591-y,RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,Peer Feedback Improves Students' Academic Self-Concept in Higher Education,"AbstractPeer feedback has been shown to be an effective strategy to improve academic achievement. However, little evidence is available about the effects of peer feedback on academic outcomes other than achievement, such as academic self-concept (ASC). ASC and achievement are reciprocally related and thus mutual reinforce themselves. The present study focuses on the effect of a four week long structured web-based peer feedback intervention on ASC in the domain of academic writing as a part of a seminar assignment in a sample of undergraduate psychology students. The study investigated the effectiveness with 49 students in a randomized-controlled trial with a pre-and post-test. Each student acted as an author and a reviewer. Results indicated significant improvements in ASC for the domain of academic writing over time as compared to a control group. Furthermore, the causal effect of peer feedback compared to no feedback on ASC for academic writing was strong with d = 0.72. The effect was domain specific, as the ASCs for the sub-domains statistics and language remained unchanged by the intervention. Overall, the results revealed that participation in a peer feedback system is an effective method to enhance ASC in the context of higher education.","[{""name"": ""Bianca A.

10.1108/ITSE-08-2020-0181,INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION,0401 Education,Online university education is the new normal: but is face-to-face better?,"PurposeFollowing the rapid shift to online learning due to COVID-19, this paper aims to compare the relative efficacy of face-to-face and online university teaching methods.Design/methodology/approachA scoping review was conducted to examine the learning outcomes within and between online and face-to-face (F2F) university teaching programmes.FindingsAlthough previous research has supported a “no significant difference” position, the review of 91 comparative studies during 2000–2020 identified 37 (41%) which found online teaching was associated with better learning outcomes, 17 (18%) which favoured F2F and 37 (41%) reporting no significant difference. Purpose-developed online content which supports “student-led” enquiry and cognitive challenge were cited as factors supporting better learning outcomes.Research limitations/implicationsThis study adopts a pre-defined methodology in reviewing literature which ensures rigour in identifying relevant studies. The large sample of studies (n= 91) supported the comparison of discrete learning modes although high variability in key concepts and outcome variables made it difficult to directly compare some studies. A lack of methodological rigour was observed in some studies.Originality/valueAs a result of COVID-19, online university teaching has become the “new normal” but also re-focussed questions regarding its efficacy. The weight of evidence from this review is that online learning is at least as effective and often better than, F2F modalities in supporting learning outcomes, albeit these differences are often modest. The findings raise questions about the presumed benefits of F2F learning and complicate the case for a return to physical classrooms during the pandemic and beyond.","[{""name"": ""Garry John Stevens"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tobias Bienz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nidhi Wali"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jenna Condie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Spyros Schismenos"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.25304/rlt.v25.1973"", ""10.1080/1364557032000119616"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-4912-5.ch011"", ""10.1080/14759390802383769"", ""10.3102/00346543074003379"", ""10.1016/S0883-0355(98)00060-3"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2007.09.017"", ""10.1080/01626620.2004.10463335"", ""10.1257/000282802320191778"", ""10.1080/00091383.1996.9937757"", ""10.1177/2043820620930832"", ""10.1111/dsji.12093"", ""10.3102/00346543053004445"", ""10.1007/BF02299088"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_42"", ""10.2202/1949-6605.1475"", ""10.1080/08841241.2018.1453910"", ""10.1080/01425692.2014.982861"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2019.1660089"", ""10.14742/ajet.2924"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v18i5.3096"", ""10.1016/S0360-1315(97)00067-5"", ""10.1177/0047239520934018"", ""10.1177/0092055X12446624"", ""10.1108/00251749710176190"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2005.03.001"", ""10.1207/s15389286ajde1903_2"", ""10.4304/tpls.4.6.1296-1302"", ""10.14297/jpaap.v2i3.113"", ""10.1136/bmjspcare-2014-000654.86"", ""10.1108/ijilt-09-2017-0096"", ""10.1002/jsc.679"", ""10.1111/j.1083-6101.2005.tb00244.x"", ""10.1145/1089107.1089139"", ""10.5861/ijrse.2017.1858"", ""10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.05.008"", ""10.1504/IJDET.2019.097846"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2016.03.008"", ""10.3102/00346543061002179"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.12.299"", ""10.18665/sr.22463"", ""10.1080/01587919.2014.899053"", ""10.1111/jan.12509"", ""10.1007/s10459-012-9430-8"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000086"", ""10.1080/0309877x.2019.1576859"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1123."", ""10.1108/IJEM-07-2018-0197"", ""10.1080/10371656.2018.1472914"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2012.09.006"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v4i2.153"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.011"", ""10.1080/19439342.2012.710641"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-80045-1_9"", ""10.1080/09540253.2013.834864"", ""10.1080/10494820.2018.1451897"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.12.020"", ""10.1108/13527591011053232"", ""10.1111/bjet.12849."", ""10.24059/olj.v8i2.1832"", ""10.1007/s10639-018-9707-5""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

10.1017/S0261444819000326,LANGUAGE TEACHING,0401 Education,Moving the field of vocabulary assessment forward: The need for more rigorous test development and validation,"AbstractRecently, a large number of vocabulary tests have been made available to language teachers, testers, and researchers. Unfortunately, most of them have been launched with inadequate validation evidence. The field of language testing has become increasingly more rigorous in the area of test validation, but developers of vocabulary tests have generally not given validation sufficient attention in the past. This paper argues for more rigorous and systematic procedures for test development, starting from a more precise specification of the test's purpose, intended testees and educational context, the particular aspects of vocabulary knowledge which are being measured, and the way in which the test scores should be interpreted. It also calls for greater assessment literacy among vocabulary test developers, and greater support for the end users of the tests, for instance, with the provision of detailed users' manuals. Overall, the authors present what they feel are the minimum requirements for vocabulary test development and validation. They argue that the field should self-police itself more rigorously to ensure that these requirements are met or exceeded, and made explicit for those using vocabulary tests.","[{""name"": ""Norbert Schmitt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul Nation"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benjamin Kremmel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0265532211417211"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511732942"", ""10.1080/15434303.2016.1237516"", ""10.1017/S0272263105050023"", ""10.7763/IJLLL.2015.V1.26"", ""10.1075/itl.168.1.02web"", ""10.1177/0265532209340194"", ""10.1002/tesq.329"", ""10.4324/9781315779553"", ""10.1177/1362168814567889"", ""10.1057/9780230293977"", ""10.1177/0265532212459028"", ""10.1111/emip.12181"", ""10.1075/itl.166.2.04gyl"", ""10.1177/0265532211417210"", ""10.1111/jedm.12000"", ""10.1177/0033688212439359"", ""10.1177/026553229901600103"", ""10.3758/s13428-011-0146-0"", ""10.1191/0265532204lt277oa"", ""10.1016/S0346-251X(99)00058-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511667268.004"", ""10.1177/0033688210390264"", ""10.1111/lang.12077"", ""10.1177/026553220101800103"", ""10.1111/j.0023-8333.2004.00260.x"", ""10.1007/s40841-015-0002-3""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

Inspired by the characteristics of the human brain for processing complicated tasks with low power, neuromorphic computing is intensively investigated for decreasing power consumption and enriching computation functions. Hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing with emerging devices substantially reduces power consumption down to a few mW cm−2, compared with the central processing unit based on conventional Si complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies (50–100 W cm−2). Herein, a brief introduction on the characteristics of neuromorphic computing is provided. Then, emerging devices for low‐power neuromorphic computing are overviewed, e.g., resistive random access memory with low power consumption (&lt; pJ) per synaptic event. A few computation models for artificial neural networks (NNs), including spiking neural network (SNN) and deep neural network (DNN), which boost power efficiency by simplifying the computing procedure and minimizing memory access are discussed. A few examples for system‐level demonstration are described, such as mixed synchronous–asynchronous and reconfigurable convolution neuron network (CNN)–recurrent NN (RNN) for low‐power computing.","[{""name"": ""Dingbang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Microeletronics (SME) Southern University of Science and Technology  Shenzhen 518000 P.

10.1002/rrq.341,READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology,Lost in Translation? Challenges in Connecting Reading Science and Educational Practice,"AbstractCan the science of reading contribute to improving educational practices, allowing more students to become skilled readers? Much has been learned about the behavioral and brain bases of reading, how students learn to read, and factors that contribute to low literacy. The potential to use research findings to improve literacy outcomes is substantial but remains largely unrealized. The lack of improvement in literacy levels, especially among students who face other challenges such as poverty, has led to new pressure to incorporate the science of reading in curricula, instructional practices, and teacher education. In the interest of promoting these efforts, the authors discuss three issues that could undermine them: the need for additional translational research linking reading science to classroom activities, the oversimplified way that the science is sometimes represented in the educational context, and the fact that theories of reading have become more complex and less intuitive as the field has progressed.

Crisis management, however, has not received sufficient attention from school leadership preparation programs or education leadership researchers. This article synthesizes research spanning schools and other organizations, including those in the private sector, to describe a framework for understanding crises and crisis management in schools and districts and the key competences this literature suggests for successful navigation of crisis situations. We use this framework to discuss leaders’ responses to the COVID-19 school closures in spring 2020. We conclude with an argument for more consciously incorporating crisis management training into both preservice and in-service preparation and support for education leaders and for opening new lines of inquiry into crisis leadership at the school and district levels.","[{""name"": ""Jason A.

10.1002/ase.2015,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,0401 Education,Improvement in Student Performance and Perceptions through a Flipped Anatomy Classroom: Shifting from Passive Traditional to Active Blended Learning,"One of the major challenges facing anatomy educators is delivering the anatomy materials in fewer hours with a reduction of anatomy courses in the integrated curricula. The flipped classroom modality may be an innovative solution. However, its effectiveness remains under debate due to a lack of outcome‐based research and the mixed results of students' performance. The present study aimed to determine the outcome of the flipped classroom based upon the level of student cognition. The study investigated performance on 17 multiple‐choice anatomy questions as a part of the final examination of the musculoskeletal system module. The results were compared between the first‐year female students of Qassim Medical College, specifically the flipped classroom group (46 students) of the academic year (2018–2019) and the traditional group (49 students) of the academic year (2017–2018). The mean differences in the students' grades on the anatomy questions at the level of knowledge, application, and analysis using Cohen's d test were 0.43, 1.41, and 1.01, respectively. These results suggest the positive impact of flipping the students' classrooms on improving their levels of thinking according to Bloom's taxonomy. Perception surveys also revealed students' enthusiasm for the pre‐class activities, leading to a better performance in the class with more engagement with their peers and teachers. The present study suggested that the flipped classroom modality can be performed to compensate for the reduction of anatomy educational hours. However, further studies are recommended to investigate the best practices of the flipped classroom that fit with the students' needs and workloads.","[{""name"": ""Abir El Sadik"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Anatomy and Histology College of Medicine Qassim University  Qassim Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"", ""Department of Anatomy and Embryology College of Medicine Cairo University  Cairo Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Waleed Al Abdulmonem"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Pathology College of Medicine Qassim University  Qassim Kingdom of Saudi Arabia""]}]","[""10.1080/07294360.2014.934336"", ""10.3163/1536-5050.103.3.010"", ""10.5455/mjhs.2019.03.004"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2012.656751"", ""10.1080/10872981.2019.1710328"", ""10.1111/bjet.12353"", ""10.1187/cbe.11-07-0061"", ""10.1111/dsji.12054"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2010.06.001"", ""10.1155/2016/7097398"", ""10.1155/2016/8506251"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41855-1_1"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2014.11.003"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2010.536276"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2015.12.010"", ""10.1007/s10734-016-0104-y"", ""10.1007/s40670-015-0184-9"", ""10.1002/cae.22069"", ""10.1111/medu.13272"", ""10.1002/ase.1664"", ""10.29045/14784726.2018.03.2.4.1"", ""10.1111/eje.12300"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155"", ""10.1097/NNE.0b013e3182a0e56a"", ""10.1002/1098-2353(2000)13:6<444::AID-CA9>3.0.CO;2-W"", ""10.1002/ase.1772"", ""10.1097/NNE.0000000000000112"", ""10.1126/science.1201783"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1861-y"", ""10.3138/jvme.1116-173r"", ""10.1016/j.aanat.2016.02.010"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17981-1"", ""10.1039/C4RP00230J"", ""10.1186/s12909-016-0757-3"", ""10.1002/ase.1755"", ""10.1073/pnas.1319030111"", ""10.1152/advan.00179.2016"", ""10.5951/mathteacher.109.3.0186"", ""10.5688/ajpe75235"", ""10.5688/ajpe6922"", ""10.1126/science.1096022"", ""10.1016/j.nepr.2015.09.001"", ""10.5811/westjem.2015.9.27256"", ""10.18178/ijlt.5.4.285-291"", ""10.1186/s12909-018-1144-z"", ""10.4137/JMECD.S23895"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-4987-3.ch002"", ""10.1007/s40692-015-0043-0"", ""10.1016/j.jtumed.2015.01.004"", ""10.1187/cbe.14-08-0129"", ""10.3390/dj6030023"", ""10.4103/2230-8229.102320"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.04.003"", ""10.5688/ajpe80233"", ""10.5811/westjem.2019.2.40979"", ""10.5688/ajpe7044"", ""10.1186/s12245-016-0123-6"", ""10.1002/jee.20293"", ""10.1109/TE.2013.2249066"", ""10.1126/science.1168927"", ""10.1111/jan.12509"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000086"", ""10.1177/1469787418793725"", ""10.3928/01484834-20130919-03"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.943710"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S70160"", ""10.1186/s12909-015-0317-2"", ""10.1187/cbe.10-04-0063"", ""10.1002/ase.1635"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2016.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.02.002"", ""10.1002/bmb.20926"", ""10.18295/2075-0528.2758"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2015.79.5.tb05916.x"", ""10.1002/ca.22983"", ""10.5688/ajpe7610196"", ""10.1002/cae.22035"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1202451"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182a368bd"", ""10.2147/AMEP.S109037"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1728-2"", ""10.14307/JFCS105.2.12"", ""10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00717"", ""10.1186/s12909-019-1599-6"", ""10.1152/advan.00021.2018"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2014.923821"", ""10.1007/s40692-019-00142-8"", ""10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.009"", ""10.1007/s10984-012-9108-4"", ""10.1007/s40670-014-0092-4"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100314"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2020.100731"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.09.003"", ""10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2"", ""10.1002/bmb.20992"", ""10.1002/ase.1405"", ""10.1152/advan.00091.2013"", ""10.5115/acb.2015.48.2.138"", ""10.1002/ca.20101"", ""10.7899/JCE-14-28"", ""10.1002/bmb.21126"", ""10.5688/ajpe7810185"", ""10.5688/ajpe786128"", ""10.1152/advan.00153.2015"", ""10.1186/s12909-020-02023-6""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Education']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1097/ACM.0000000000003400,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,Health Systems Science in Medical Education: Unifying the Components to Catalyze Transformation,"Medical education exists in the service of patients and communities and must continually calibrate its focus to ensure the achievement of these goals. To close gaps in U.S. health outcomes, medical education is steadily evolving to better prepare providers with the knowledge and skills to lead patient- and systems-level improvements. Systems-related competencies, including high-value care, quality improvement, population health, informatics, and systems thinking, are needed to achieve this but are often curricular islands in medical education, dependent on local context, and have lacked a unifying framework. The third pillar of medical education—health systems science (HSS)—complements the basic and clinical sciences and integrates the full range of systems-related competencies. Despite the movement toward HSS, there remains uncertainty and significant inconsistency in the application of HSS concepts and nomenclature within health care and medical education. In this Article, the authors (1) explore the historical context of several key systems-related competency areas; (2) describe HSS and highlight a schema crosswalk between HSS and systems-related national competency recommendations, accreditation standards, national and local curricula, educator recommendations, and textbooks; and (3) articulate 6 rationales for the use and integration of a broad HSS framework within medical education. These rationales include: (1) ensuring core competencies are not marginalized, (2) accounting for related and integrated competencies in curricular design, (3) providing the foundation for comprehensive assessments and evaluations, (4) providing a clear learning pathway for the undergraduate–graduate–workforce continuum, (5) facilitating a shift toward a national standard, and (6) catalyzing a new professional identity as systems citizens. Continued movement toward a cohesive framework will better align the clinical and educational missions by cultivating the next generation of systems-minded health care professionals.","[{""name"": ""Jed D.

However, few studies to date have explored student perspectives on these tools. This article reports on one of the first large-scale quantitative studies of student views on generative artificial intelligence at an Australian university (n = 1,135). When the survey was conducted, most students had low knowledge, experience, and confidence in using these tools. These results varied across disciplines and across some student sub-groups, such as mature-age students and international students. Confidence appeared to increase with experience, although the data also revealed a portion of students that have never used these tools yet still felt confident in using them. In exploring these results, this article aims to shed new light on this fast-evolving landscape and inform the future direction of supporting students to engage with generative artificial intelligence tools appropriately.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Kelly"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Miriam Sullivan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katrina Strampel"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Health Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1011 护理学', 0.752), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7508)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1111/eje.12492,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1003 Stomatology,Evaluation of HoloHuman augmented reality application as a novel educational tool in dentistry,"AbstractAimsTo investigate dental student's perception of the augmented reality (AR) head and neck anatomy application and to determine whether the learning environment was beneficial for students compared with traditional cadaver learning.MethodsA total of 88 students participated in a self‐administered questionnaire prior to and after the use of AR. This was conducted during anatomy classes for second‐year dentistry students. Descriptive data analysis was performed to determine the perceptions of experience gained through AR.ResultsThe study revealed that over two‐thirds of participants perceived that it would assist in their learning with 52.3% of participants who agreed and 35.2% of participants who strongly agreed. After the use of HoloHuman, it was found that 43.5% of participants agreed that the 3D anatomical structures improved their understanding of anatomy and 36.5% agreed that they felt more confident about their anatomy skills. The results also demonstrated that only 34.1% agreed that it added value in training compared with relying solely on traditional methods. Overall, 75.3% of participants agreed that HoloHuman teaching should not replace traditional cadaver training.ConclusionThis study suggested that the use of AR offers an additional mean of dental anatomy training; however, it cannot be used as a replacement for traditional modes of cadaver anatomy training. AR has the potential to be used as an adjunct tool in the learning of dental head and neck anatomy as it has demonstrated increased student engagement and enjoyment; however, limitations with the device still remain.","[{""name"": ""Sobia Zafar"", ""affiliation"": [""Discipline Lead for Paediatric Dentistry School of Dentistry The University of Queensland Brisbane Qld Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Jessica Joanna Zachar"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Dentistry The University of Queensland Brisbane Qld Australia""]}]","[""10.1016/j.aanat.2005.07.007"", ""10.1002/ase.1696"", ""10.1002/ca.10113"", ""10.1002/ase.214"", ""10.1016/j.surge.2014.10.007"", ""10.5858/arpa.2017-0189-OA"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2011.75.11.tb05198.x"", ""10.21815/JDE.019.050"", ""10.1111/eje.12269"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2015.12.012"", ""10.1016/j.hpe.2016.05.002"", ""10.1002/j.0022-0337.2015.79.11.tb06033.x"", ""10.1186/s12903-019-0853-y"", ""10.1002/ca.23249"", ""10.1080/01421590802512953"", ""10.1007/s00276-007-0180-x"", ""10.1002/ase.1524"", ""10.5694/j.1326-5377.2002.tb04290.x"", ""10.7717/peerj.5847""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Surgery', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7085), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.6932)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

This study describes the background of entrepreneurship education in China’s higher education institutes and explores the influences of entrepreneurship education on student entrepreneurial intention. Using data from a survey on students in China, this study finds that students in different types of institutions and different major fields had a different level of engagement in entrepreneurship education. Further, the higher the level of entrepreneurship education the students received, the stronger their self-efficacy of entrepreneurial decision-making was, and the stronger their entrepreneurial intention was. Student entrepreneurial decision-making self-efficacy played a mediating role between entrepreneurship education and student entrepreneurial intention. We found that entrepreneurship education has a positive effect on entrepreneurial intention. Entrepreneurship education course-taking has a positive effect on entrepreneurial decision-making. Furthermore, the positive effect of self-efficacy of entrepreneurial decision-making on entrepreneurial intention was also confirmed. We also found that self-efficacy of entrepreneurial decision-making played the significant role of mediator between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention. The findings also showed a difference between the current China context and the western context that taking entrepreneurship-related classes had more considerable influences on student entrepreneurial intention than entrepreneurship-related practicum. We discuss the implications of the improvement of higher education in China and relevance to other contexts.","[{""name"": ""Hong Mei"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Policy and Administration, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an 710049, China""]}, {""name"": ""Ching-Hung Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Public Policy and Administration, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an 710049, China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuanyuan Xiang"", ""affiliation"": [""Savannah College of Art and Design, Atlanta, GA 30309, USA""]}]","[""10.1080/0218879030230103"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2016.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2019.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2019.113062"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2009.00321.x"", ""10.1016/0001-8791(83)90006-4"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(97)00009-8"", ""10.1108/00400910310508829"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2016.05.012"", ""10.5465/amle.2004.14242226"", ""10.1111/j.1540-627X.2006.00163.x"", ""10.1108/03090590610715022"", ""10.3390/educsci7040092"", ""10.1177/2158244020933877"", ""10.5465/amle.2012.0293"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68222-8"", ""10.3390/su12104004"", ""10.3390/su12030796"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1177716"", ""10.1108/14626000810871745"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2016.12.004"", ""10.3390/educsci4010108"", ""10.3390/educsci4040247"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-3319-3_9"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02048"", ""10.1177/0266242615612534"", ""10.5465/AMBPP.2019.10206abstract"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(98)00033-0"", ""10.1177/104225879602100104"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00236.x"", ""10.1080/02188791.2013.822789"", ""10.1016/S0883-9026(97)00029-3"", ""10.1002/j.2161-0045.1996.tb00448.x"", ""10.1016/j.system.2014.01.015"", ""10.2307/258004"", ""10.1177/1069072703254499"", ""10.1007/s11365-009-0123-6"", ""10.1007/s11187-016-9755-4"", ""10.1108/14626000810917843"", ""10.1108/14626000410537137""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Business and International Management', 'Education']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1186/s41239-024-00447-4,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION,0401 Education,"Empowering ChatGPT with guidance mechanism in blended learning: effect of self-regulated learning, higher-order thinking skills, and knowledge construction","AbstractIn the evolving landscape of higher education, challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic have underscored the necessity for innovative teaching methodologies. These challenges have catalyzed the integration of technology into education, particularly in blended learning environments, to bolster self-regulated learning (SRL) and higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). However, increased autonomy in blended learning can lead to learning disruptions if issues are not promptly addressed. In this context, OpenAI's ChatGPT, known for its extensive knowledge base and immediate feedback capability, emerges as a significant educational resource. Nonetheless, there are concerns that students might become excessively dependent on such tools, potentially hindering their development of HOTS. To address these concerns, this study introduces the Guidance-based ChatGPT-assisted Learning Aid (GCLA). This approach modifies the use of ChatGPT in educational settings by encouraging students to attempt problem-solving independently before seeking ChatGPT assistance. When engaged, the GCLA provides guidance through hints rather than direct answers, fostering an environment conducive to the development of SRL and HOTS. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was employed to examine the impact of the GCLA compared to traditional ChatGPT use in a foundational chemistry course within a blended learning setting. This study involved 61 undergraduate students from a university in Taiwan. The findings reveal that the GCLA enhances SRL, HOTS, and knowledge construction compared to traditional ChatGPT use. These results directly align with the research objective to improve learning outcomes through providing guidance rather than answers by ChatGPT. In conclusion, the introduction of the GCLA has not only facilitated more effective learning experiences in blended learning environments but also ensured that students engage more actively in their educational journey. The implications of this study highlight the potential of ChatGPT-based tools in enhancing the quality of higher education, particularly in fostering essential skills such as self-regulation and HOTS.

10.1002/dys.1612,DYSLEXIA,0401 Education; 0402 Psychology; 1002 Clinical Medicine,Early childhood educators' knowledge about language and literacy: Associations with practice and children's learning,"Educators' language and literacy knowledge is considered important for informing classroom practices and thereby supporting children's early language and literacy development. This includes both disciplinary content knowledge (knowledge concerning how oral and written language are structured and map to one another) and knowledge for practice (knowledge of effective strategies and practices for supporting early language and literacy). In this study, we examined the associations among 485 early childhood educators' content knowledge and knowledge for practice, their observed language and literacy practices, and the emergent literacy learning of 2004 children enrolled in their classrooms. We found significant, positive correlations between measures of educators' content knowledge and knowledge for practice and classroom practice, indicating that early childhood educators with greater levels of knowledge tended to exhibit more desirable classroom language and literacy practices. We also found significant, positive associations between educators' knowledge and children's print concept, letter naming, and phonological awareness learning, but not children's oral language learning. The associations between educators' knowledge and children's print concept learning were mediated by classroom practice. Together, these results reiterate the importance of educators' language and literacy knowledge and also provide some support for practice as the mechanism through which knowledge relates to children's learning.","[{""name"": ""Shayne B.

10.1177/0013161X20926548,EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION QUARTERLY,0401 Education,Distributed Leadership Globally: The Interactive Nature of Principal and Teacher Leadership in 32 Countries,"Purpose: This study provides cross-country evidence regarding the extent to which distributed leadership operates in schools globally and offers preliminary insights about country education policies that explain the reported distributed leadership results. The researchers also investigate the relationship between principals’ reports of distributed leadership and teachers’ reports of the school culture, demonstrating the alignment of principal and teacher perspectives of distributed leadership. The conceptual framework highlights the interaction between leaders in varied situations characterized by leadership functions and country contexts. Research Design: Researchers use both principal and teacher surveys from the 2013 TALIS. In the first analytical stage, latent measures using confirmative factor analysis capture the extent to which principals and teachers were responsible for each of the three leadership functions; scatterplots explore distribution of interactive leadership, and further explanation is offered by document analysis of country policy profiles. In the second stage, the research uses hierarchical linear models for the effect of distributed leadership, specifically principal leadership, teacher leadership, and interactive leadership, on school culture for each country, synthesizing country results with meta-analysis. Findings: Distributed leadership varies by leadership function and appears to be influenced by country education policy. Teachers report that their school culture is conducive to distributed leadership when, in fact, they have the opportunity to lead. Conclusions: Findings add global evidence that country context is an important part of the situation for distributed leadership. The patterns of distributed leadership by function invite further research within each country, particularly to examine the influence of educational policy.","[{""name"": ""Susan Printy"", ""affiliation"": [""Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Yan Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Central Connecticut State University, New Britain, CT, USA""]}]","[""10.1080/19404476.2010.11462068"", ""10.1080/13603124.2016.1147608"", ""10.1177/0049124189017003004"", ""10.1002/jrsm.12"", ""10.1177/1741143217739543"", ""10.1080/13632434.2011.642354"", ""10.1080/13632430600737140"", ""10.3102/01623737025004347"", ""10.1086/668764"", ""10.3102/01623737025004375"", ""10.1007/1-4020-5516-1"", ""10.1016/j.cct.2006.04.004"", ""10.1080/18146627.2016.1224583"", ""10.1136/bmj.315.7121.1533"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199734177.001.0001"", ""10.1086/681925"", ""10.1016/S1048-9843(02)00120-0"", ""10.1086/461445"", ""10.1108/02621711211190961"", ""10.1177/1741143209359716"", ""10.3102/0002831209340042"", ""10.1037//1082-989X.3.4.486"", ""10.1002/sim.1186"", ""10.4135/9781506374581"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00917.x"", ""10.1108/9781787434035"", ""10.4135/9781412984522"", ""10.1177/1741143209359714"", ""10.1080/15700760601091267"", ""10.1504/IJQRE.2014.060972"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195326543.001.0001"", ""10.1177/0013161X20907128"", ""10.1177/1741143220910438"", ""10.14321/j.ctt1qd8zjk.11"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2019.05.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-50980-8_5"", ""10.1177/0013161X03253412"", ""10.1177/0013161X10383411"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-1335-2"", ""10.2307/2391284"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-50980-8_11"", ""10.2307/271070"", ""10.1177/0013161X07312958"", ""10.1177/1741143213502192"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-6330-6_7"", ""10.3102/0013189X030003023"", ""10.4000/dse.1283"", ""10.1016/j.ijer.2018.09.006"", ""10.3102/0034654316653478"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0542-5""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.3390/educsci10120374,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,Distance Learning Perceptions from Higher Education Students-The Case of Portugal,"This research study examines the attitudes of Portuguese higher education students regarding compulsory digital and distance learning university courses during the second semester of the academic year 2019–2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology was quantitative, being the undergraduate and postgraduate students surveyed to find their perceptions about distance and online education in Portugal. The findings of the study highlighted the relationship between distance and online learning. The key concern of the respondents is related to the formal and contextual dimensions of the online class regime. The values examined, taken as a whole, allow us to conclude that with this teaching regime, in terms of awareness, there is acceptance and benefit. The sense of ambiguity in which this transformation took place, as well as the climate surrounding this phase, are worth noting. The teaching and evaluation methodologies used have been embraced and show a very wide range of choices on the part of the teaching teams and the students’ various interests, just as in the teaching regime of the classroom. The fact that students feel the need for face-to-face classes, however, is of great importance for practical and laboratory classes. This reality, which is a challenge to face in the future, is hard to overcome.","[{""name"": ""Sónia P.

10.1111/bjet.12919,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,0401 Education,"Development and validation of the DIGIGLO, a tool for assessing the digital competence of educators","AbstractEducators must be able to adapt to the opportunities provided by information and communication technologies, making use of those which are best suited to meeting their students' needs and identifying areas of practice in which they themselves need to develop their skills. The European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) proposes 22 basic competences, organised into six areas, which educators should ideally acquire. The present study seeks to build on this Framework by developing and validating an assessment tool that considers a total of eight areas: the six areas covered by DigCompEdu and two new areas corresponding to extrinsic factors in the digital competence of educators. The latter refers specifically to the digital resources and support services that are available to educators in their working environment. A total of 509 teacher educators from across Spain and Latin America completed the 29‐item DIGIGLO questionnaire. Analysis of the Spanish language instrument's construct validity and psychometric properties showed it to be a valid and reliable tool for assessing the digital competence of educators across the eight areas considered. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Educators must be able to adapt (habituate) to the opportunities provided by information and communication technologies. The European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) proposes 22 basic competences, organised into six areas, which educators should ideally acquire. The speed with which digital technology is developing means that educators need to keep track of their own digital skills. What this paper adds We develop and validate an instrument for assessing educators' digital competence (the DIGIGLO) that considers external factors not included within the DigCompEdu. These external factors refer to the digital resources and support services that are available to educators in their working environment. The total score on the 29‐item questionnaire provides a measure of educators' overall digital competence across eight different areas. Implications for practice and/or policy The DIGIGLO is a brief and easy‐to‐use tool for assessing the digital competence of educators, a key issue in the educational field today. It extends the scope of the DigCompEdu Framework by including two further areas of digital competence (digital environment and extrinsic digital engagement). Application of the instrument can provide individual educators and their institutions with useful feedback about both strengths and areas in need of improvement with regard to the use of digital technology in teaching.","[{""name"": ""Rafael Alarcón"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elena del Pilar Jiménez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""María Isabel de Vicente‐Yagüe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/0033-2909.107.2.238"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.112.3.400"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.88.3.588"", ""10.4995/redu.2012.6108"", ""10.6018/j/324191"", ""10.15366/reice2019.17.2.002"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.04.040"", ""10.1080/10705519909540118"", ""10.37132/isl.v0i8.218"", ""10.1145/3230977.3230993"", ""10.1109/FIE.2017.8190673"", ""10.1108/10748120110424816"", ""10.37132/isl.v0i6.153"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2003.10.007"", ""10.4135/9781452224749"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM0702_1"", ""10.1177/0011000006286345"", ""10.5210/fm.v16i9.3171""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"

10.1186/s40594-019-0201-4,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,Defining interdisciplinary collaboration based on high school teachers' beliefs and practices of STEM integration using a complex designed system,"Abstract Background Teachers’ beliefs play an important role in how teachers think about how students learn, and how content should be organized and taught. Integrated STEM is pushing the boundaries of some of the traditional assumptions in education—disciplined-based courses, courses taught independently by teachers, standards and content-driven, and no collaborative planning time for teachers. Six teachers, located in two high schools, participated in a year-long program to develop interdisciplinary collaboration to implement integrated STEM learning in their courses. A qualitative instrumental case study of the two teams of teachers was conducted to gain insights and understandings of the teachers’ beliefs and instructional practices of STEM integration through interdisciplinary approaches in a complex system (i.e., hydroponics). Results Themes regarding features, beliefs and practices, and challenges emerged from cross-case analysis of the teachers’ stories, which resulted in two interdisciplinary collaboration models, multi-classroom and extracurricular activity, from each of the teams at each of the two high schools. Multi-classroom and extracurricular activity models had some resemblances, but also had differences. Both cases had the same goals to use real-world problems to help students see STEM connections, learn STEM knowledge and skills, and apply STEM knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems. Conclusions Based on teachers’ beliefs and their interdisciplinary STEM collaboration practices, three components were identified. Team size, teaching goal, and collaboration structure highly affect a successful interdisciplinary STEM collaboration model in high school settings. The study also contributes to expend the concept of a continuum of STEM approaches to curriculum integration, disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary (Vasquez, Sneider, &amp; Comer, STEM lesson essentials: Integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, 2013), and provides frameworks for structuring a successful interdisciplinary collaboration model in high school settings.","[{""name"": ""Hui-Hui Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mingla Charoenmuang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Neil A.

10.1186/s12909-020-02274-3,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Assessment of burnout in medical students using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey: a cross-sectional data analysis,"Abstract Background Medical student burnout can cause emotional and physical exhaustion and detachment. The objectives of this study were to evaluate burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS), identify factors that may predict burnout, and assess wellness initiatives effectiveness at reducing burnout. Methods The MBI-SS was administered to all medical students (Classes 2019 to 2022) at the University of Illinois College of Medicine (UICOM) from February to May 2019. Factor analysis and internal consistency of the MBI-SS were assessed. Mean MSBI-SS subscale scores for burnout were calculated for cynicism (CY), emotional exhaustion (EE), and academic efficacy (AE). Multiple regression analysis was used to identify student factors that may predict burnout. Results A total of 273 (21.6%) UICOM students completed the survey and 110 (40.3%) respondents reported self-perceived burnout. MBI-SS subscale scores were significantly higher for CY and EE, and significantly lower for AE in students who reported suffering from burnout versus students who did not report burnout. Mean ± SD subscale scores for CY, EE, and AE in burnout students were 14.44 ± 5.59, 23.23 ± 4.74, and 24.81 ± 5.35, respectively. In comparison, mean ± SD subscale scores for CY, EE, and AE in non-burnout students were 7.59 ± 5.16, 14.96 ± 5.71, and 28.74 ± 3.21, respectively. Regression analysis denoted significant associations between burnout and being out-of-phase in the curriculum, the effectiveness of wellness initiatives, and strength of motivation for medical school (SMMS) in both the two- and three-dimensional MBI-SS models. Gender was significantly associated with burnout in only the two-dimensional model. Conclusions Self-reported burnout in medical students at UICOM was validated using the MBI-SS. Being out-of-phase in the curriculum, being female, rating wellness initiatives as less effective, and demonstrating lower motivation for continued medical school education may be used as predictors of medical student burnout. This investigation may act as a guide for measuring burnout in medical student populations and how the implementation of wellness initiatives may ameliorate burnout.","[{""name"": ""Michael Obregon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jessica Luo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jarod Shelton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Terri Blevins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin MacDowell"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-4560.1974.tb00706.x"", ""10.7759/cureus.3681"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31279-X"", ""10.7326/M18-1422"", ""10.1111/tct.12014"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-1064-3"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000204"", ""10.1111/medu.12083"", ""10.1080/10872981.2017.1358579"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-1006-0"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001138"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.17324"", ""10.1080/10401334.2018.1523010"", ""10.1002/job.4030020205"", ""10.1177/0022022102033005003"", ""10.1007/s00420-011-0623-x"", ""10.1186/s12955-018-1048-y"", ""10.3402/meo.v9i.4355"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2009.03.004"", ""10.1002/smi.2481"", ""10.1016/j.hpe.2018.05.004"", ""10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2"", ""10.15766/mep_2374-8265.9645"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0191746"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2018.1457213"", ""10.7249/RB9740"", ""10.22454/FamMed.2019.270753"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2010.04.006"", ""10.1097/SMJ.0b013e3181e6d6d4"", ""10.1016/j.eurpsy.2018.08.006"", ""10.1097/CCM.0000000000002751"", ""10.1200/JCO.2013.51.8480"", ""10.1080/135485000106016"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000655"", ""10.5688/aj720243"", ""10.1017/ice.2016.171"", ""10.1097/00001888-200604000-00010"", ""10.3402/meo.v19.25209""]","['Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

It is complex to mimic key skin features using existing tactile sensors, and there exists no somatosensor that responds to real stimuli of pressure, temperature, and touch. Herein, three critical skin receptors created by realizing integrated electronic systems that mimic the feedback response of somatosensors are experimentally demonstrated. Fully functional Pacinian corpuscles, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors are realized using a combination of stretchable pressure sensors, phase‐change oxide thin films, and threshold‐based resistive switching (memristor) memory elements. The ability to detect and respond to pressure, temperature, and pain stimuli above a threshold with real‐life performance characteristics is demonstrated with explanation of underlying mechanisms. The ability to design and realize artificial skin receptors enables replacement of affected human skin regions, augment skin sensitivity for agile applications in defense and sports, and drive advancements in intelligent robotics.","[{""name"": ""Md.

10.1111/medu.15402,MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1204 Public Administration,A systematic review of large language models and their implications in medical education,"AbstractIntroductionIn the past year, the use of large language models (LLMs) has generated significant interest and excitement because of their potential to revolutionise various fields, including medical education for aspiring physicians. Although medical students undergo a demanding educational process to become competent health care professionals, the emergence of LLMs presents a promising solution to challenges like information overload, time constraints and pressure on clinical educators. However, integrating LLMs into medical education raises critical concerns and challenges for educators, professionals and students. This systematic review aims to explore LLM applications in medical education, specifically their impact on medical students' learning experiences.MethodsA systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Embase for articles discussing the applications of LLMs in medical education using selected keywords related to LLMs and medical education, from the time of ChatGPT's debut until February 2024. Only articles available in full text or English were reviewed. The credibility of each study was critically appraised by two independent reviewers.ResultsThe systematic review identified 166 studies, of which 40 were found by review to be relevant to the study. Among the 40 relevant studies, key themes included LLM capabilities, benefits such as personalised learning and challenges regarding content accuracy. Importantly, 42.5% of these studies specifically evaluated LLMs in a novel way, including ChatGPT, in contexts such as medical exams and clinical/biomedical information, highlighting their potential in replicating human‐level performance in medical knowledge. The remaining studies broadly discussed the prospective role of LLMs in medical education, reflecting a keen interest in their future potential despite current constraints.ConclusionsThe responsible implementation of LLMs in medical education offers a promising opportunity to enhance learning experiences. However, ensuring information accuracy, emphasising skill‐building and maintaining ethical safeguards are crucial. Continuous critical evaluation and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential for the appropriate integration of LLMs in medical education.","[{""name"": ""Harrison C.

10.1186/s40594-020-00267-8,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION,0401 Education,A scoping review of literature assessing the impact of the learning assistant model,"AbstractMuch of modern education reform is focused on implementation of evidenced-based teaching, but these techniques are sometimes met with trepidation from faculty, due to inexperience or lack of necessary resources. One near-peer teaching model designed to facilitate evidenced-based teaching in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics classrooms is the Learning Assistant (LA) model. Here, we describe the details of the LA model, present a scoping review of literature using the four original goals of the LA model as a framework, and suggest future areas of research that would deepen our understanding of the impact that the LA model may have on education. We summarize how the LA model improves student outcomes and teacher preparation and identify a relative deficiency of literature that addresses how the LA model impacts faculty and departmental/institutional change. Additionally, of the 39 papers reviewed, 11 are strictly pre-experimental study designs, 28 use quasi-experimental designs or a combination of quasi and pre-experimental, and none of them included a true experimental design. Thus, we conclude that current studies suggest that LA model positively impacts education, but more refined assessment would improve our understanding of the model. Furthermore, despite the encouraging research on the impact of the LA model and the proliferation of LA programs at institutions across the world, the study of the LA model has been, for the most part, limited to a small group of education researchers. Therefore, a major objective of this review is to introduce the LA model to a new group of instructors and researchers who can further our understanding of this promising model.","[{""name"": ""Anthony P.

10.3390/educsci11090483,EDUCATION SCIENCES,0401 Education,A Framework of Implementing Strategies for Active Student Engagement in Remote/Online Teaching and Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a drastic shift of face-to-face teaching and learning to remote/online teaching and learning at all levels of education worldwide. Active student engagement is always a challenging task for educators regardless of the teaching modalities. The degree of challenge for active student engagement increases significantly in remote/online teaching and learning. This paper presents a framework that implements activities/strategies to ensure active student engagement in remote/online teaching and learning during this COVID-19 pandemic. The structure of the developed framework combines the balanced use of adjusted teaching pedagogy, educational technologies, and an e-learning management system. Teaching pedagogy involves various active learning techniques, synchronous teaching, asynchronous teaching, and segmentation. The educational technologies, such as Google Meet, Jamboard, Google Chat, Breakout room, Mentimeter, Moodle, electronic writing devices, etc., enable the developed framework for active student engagement. An e-learning management system, Moodle, is used for course management purposes. Over the last three semesters (Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021), the framework is tested for three different engineering courses. A questionnaire draws out student perception on the developed framework in terms of active student engagement that ensures student–student interactions, student–instructor interactions, social presence, reinforces learning and deepens understanding of the materials in remote teaching. The feedback also indicates that combining the utilized technologies, synchronous teaching, and active learning activities in the developed framework is effective for interactive learning; hence a practical approach for active student engagement in remote/online teaching and learning. The article focuses on contributing to present research and infusing future research direction about technology-enhanced active student engagement in Engineering Education.","[{""name"": ""Razzaqul Ahshan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat 123, Oman""]}]","[""10.3102/00346543074003379"", ""10.1007/s12528-013-9077-3"", ""10.3390/soc10040086"", ""10.20944/preprints202101.0085.v1"", ""10.3390/educsci11060268"", ""10.3390/educsci11070349"", ""10.3390/educsci11030099"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039628"", ""10.3389/feduc.2021.647986"", ""10.1080/09669760.2020.1765091"", ""10.3102/0034654309333844"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.01.014"", ""10.3389/frobt.2018.00114"", ""10.1111/jcal.12005"", ""10.24059/olj.v21i3.1231"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.001"", ""10.1007/s11423-018-9633-7"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2015.12.010"", ""10.24059/olj.v19i3.668"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.2004.tb00809.x"", ""10.3390/educsci10080198"", ""10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125109"", ""10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125257"", ""10.3390/educsci11020071"", ""10.3390/educsci11020046"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3036976"", ""10.1109/TE.2016.2637327"", ""10.1109/TE.2013.2256424"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929507"", ""10.1080/03043797.2021.1934406"", ""10.1109/TE.2020.2989921"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3065248""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

Comparably, designing a strategy that can easily tune the synaptic plasticity of artificial synapses can benefit constructing an artificial neural system, where synapses with different short‐term plasticity (STP) and long‐term plasticity (LTP) are required. Herein, a strategy is designed that can easily tune the plasticity of crystallized conjugated polymer nanowire‐based synaptic transistors (STs) by low‐temperature solvent engineering. Essential synaptic functions are achieved, such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF), spike‐frequency‐dependent plasticity (SFDP), spike‐duration‐dependent plasticity (SDDP) and spike‐number‐dependent plasticity (SNDP), and potentiation/depression. The balance between crystallinity and roughness is successfully adjusted by altering solvent compositions, and plasticity of the synaptic device is easily tuned between short term and long term. The evident transition from STP to LTP, good linearity and symmetry of potentiation and depression, and the broad dynamic working range of synaptic weight are achieved. This provides a facile way to tune synaptic plasticity at low temperatures and is applicable to future organic and flexible artificial nervous systems.","[{""name"": ""Hong Han"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhipeng Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Kexin Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Yao Ni"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Mingxue Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Haiyang Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Huanhuan Wei"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiangdong Gong"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Shuo Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}, {""name"": ""Wentao Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Thin Film Devices and Technology of Tianjin Nankai University  Tianjin 300350 China""]}]","[""10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00553"", ""10.1002/aisy.201900003"", ""10.1002/admt.201900037"", ""10.1002/adfm.201904602"", ""10.1002/aisy.201900034"", ""10.1126/science.aao0098"", ""10.1002/adma.201606088"", ""10.1002/adma.201801291"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-07572-5"", ""10.1002/adma.201803961"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104035"", ""10.1002/aelm.201900008"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.03.037"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b17227"", ""10.1002/advs.201800747"", ""10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00624"", ""10.1002/adfm.201902105"", ""10.1021/acsomega.9b00172"", ""10.1002/adfm.201805599"", ""10.1002/admt.201900471"", ""10.1063/1.2734387"", ""10.1021/ma901955c"", ""10.1039/c1py00275a"", ""10.1021/ma2000515"", ""10.1002/adma.200502442"", ""10.1039/C4RA06311B"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.206406"", ""10.1002/polb.23022"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.02.058"", ""10.1002/aelm.201970045"", ""10.1002/smll.201701193"", ""10.1126/sciadv.1501326"", ""10.1002/adfm.201804170"", ""10.1109/LED.2015.2418342""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience', 'Polymers and Plastics', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7525), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7489)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Several automated software packages facilitate conducting NMA using either of two alternative approaches, Bayesian or frequentist frameworks. Researchers must choose a framework for conducting NMA (Bayesian or frequentist) and select appropriate model(s), and those conducting NMA need to understand the assumptions and limitations of different approaches. Bayesian models are more frequently used and can be more flexible but require checking additional assumptions and greater statistical expertise that are often ignored. The present paper describes the important theoretical aspects of Bayesian and frequentist models for NMA and the applications and considerations of contrast-synthesis and arm-synthesis NMAs. In addition, we present evidence from a limited number of simulation and empirical studies that compared different frequentist and Bayesian models and provide an overview of available automated software packages to perform NMA. We will conclude that when analysts choose appropriate models, there are seldom important differences in the results of Bayesian and frequentist approaches and that network meta-analysts should therefore focus on model features rather than the statistical framework.","[{""name"": ""Behnam Sadeghirad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Farid Foroutan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael J Zoratti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jason W Busse"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Romina Brignardello-Petersen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gordon Guyatt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lehana Thabane"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2016.11.002"", ""10.1136/archdischild-2018-315224"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1195"", ""10.1016/j.jid.2018.10.028"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2017.10.005"", ""10.1371/journal.pmed.1003082"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.04.018"", ""10.1007/s11739-016-1583-7"", ""10.1136/bmjebm-2017-110887"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2017.11.018"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.04.009"", ""10.1186/s13643-017-0473-z"", ""10.1136/bmj.m3900"", ""10.1136/bmj.j3932"", ""10.1177/1475725719874542"", ""10.1136/bmj.317.7166.1151"", ""10.3758/s13423-016-1221-4"", ""10.1016/S0895-4356(97)00049-8"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1058"", ""10.1002/sim.1201"", ""10.1177/0962280207080643"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1045"", ""10.1002/9781118951651"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1397"", ""10.1002/sim.8360"", ""10.1002/sim.4780142408"", ""10.1093/biostatistics/kxp032"", ""10.1198/016214505000001302"", ""10.1177/0272989X12458724"", ""10.18637/jss.v080.i05"", ""10.1002/sim.9076"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-13-2"", ""10.1007/s11606-020-06357-1"", ""10.1002/sim.8580"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1184"", ""10.1177/0272989X13485155"", ""10.1177/0962280215596185"", ""10.1186/s13643-017-0511-x"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.08.022"", ""10.4310/sii.2020.v13.n4.a1"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1167"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1054"", ""10.1186/s12874-019-0829-2"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0115065"", ""10.1111/rssa.12579"", ""10.1002/sim.8759"", ""10.1177/1536867X1501500402"", ""10.1177/1536867X1501500403"", ""10.1016/j.jval.2020.08.1466"", ""10.1177/0272989X13481110"", ""10.1186/s12874-020-0917-3"", ""10.1002/jrsm.1153""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Mathematics']","['Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Statistics and Probability']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('0701 数学', 0.7202)]]"
10.1007/s10643-020-01074-0,EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION JOURNAL,0401 Education,The Prevalence of Risky Play in Young Children's Indoor and Outdoor Free Play,"AbstractResearch on children’s risky play and young children’s risk taking is a relatively new research area that has drawn the attention of many researchers in the last decades. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no earlier studies have measured the prevalence of risky play when children can freely choose what to play, with whom, and where. Most research on risky play has also exclusively focused on outdoor play. This study aims at examining the occurrence and characteristics of children’s risky play, indoors and outdoors, in early childhood education and care (ECEC) institutions. Children (N = 80) were observed in two-minute sequences during periods of the day when they were free to choose what to do. The data consists of 1878 randomly recorded two-minute videos, which were coded second by second for the occurrence of several categories of risky play. Results revealed that risky play was registered in 10.3% of the total data material.

10.1186/s12909-020-02023-6,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,0401 Education,Self-regulated learning: the effect on medical student learning outcomes in a flipped classroom environment,"Abstract Background The flipped-classroom model is increasingly being adopted in competency-based medical education. However, it poses a major challenge to students who have not mastered self-regulated learning strategies. This study explores which self-regulated learning skills affect student learning performance in the first 2 years of medical school at a university in the midwestern United States. Methods Survey data were used to assess how 146 first- and second-year medical students’ use of self-regulated learning strategies affected their performance on standardized tests. Results Based on the results of regression analysis and content analysis, it was found that the use of peer learning and help-seeking positively affected the performance of first- and second-year students, respectively; whereas the use of rehearsal had a negative effect on student learning outcomes. Conclusions The study findings imply that during the transition period from traditional lecture-intensive learning to flipped-classroom learning, promoting peer learning and help-seeking could significantly improve students’ academic achievement.","[{""name"": ""Binbin Zheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yining Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182a368bd"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e3182a36a07"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.02.002"", ""10.1111/medu.13272"", ""10.1109/TE.2013.2249066"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2016.05.006"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50043-3"", ""10.1016/B978-012109890-2/50031-7"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001363"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.03929.x"", ""10.1002/ase.1463"", ""10.1186/s12909-017-0956-6"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2923.2000.00473.x"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2011.577464"", ""10.1080/10872981.2019.1686949"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000001583"", ""10.1080/08923640802039024"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.04.007"", ""10.1348/000709905X25049"", ""10.1007/s40692-015-0043-0"", ""10.22492/ije.3.1.10"", ""10.3928/0148-4834-20011101-11"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.07.021"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.01.032"", ""10.1177/0013164493053003024"", ""10.1111/medu.14079"", ""10.1037/spq0000198"", ""10.1007/s10758-015-9269-1"", ""10.1111/medu.12975"", ""10.1007/s10763-014-9514-4""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

10.1002/sce.21612,SCIENCE EDUCATION,0401 Education,Recognition and operationalization of Future-Scaffolding Skills: Results from an empirical study of a teaching-learning module on climate change and futures thinking,"AbstractThis article takes its point of departure from the younger generation's problematic relationship with time and the future. A general sense of changeability and directionlessness in society compromises young people's confidence in themselves to make a difference as individuals in important global issues affecting their futures, such as climate change. Given recent aims and commitments of science education to promote sustainable development and student agency, this study explores how science teaching can help students imagine and face possible future scenarios and develop agency in the present to influence them. This article presents a science education approach to equip secondary school students with skills of futures thinking and agency that we call “future‐scaffolding skills.” It also shows the process of building an operational definition for recognizing those skills in students' discourse and actions. For this purpose, an empirical study was carried out in the context of a teaching–learning module on climate change, consisting of activities inspired by the field of futures studies. Essays, individual and group interviews, questionnaires, and video recordings of students' final projects were collected from 24 students (16–19‐years old) from three European countries. The results contribute to operationally defining “future‐scaffolding skills,” consisting of “structural skills” (the ability to recognize temporal, logical and causal relationships and build systemic views) and “dynamical skills” (the ability to navigate scenarios, relating local details to global views, past to present and future, and individual to collective actions).","[{""name"": ""Olivia Levrini"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics and Astronomy “A.
