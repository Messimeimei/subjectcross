Developing new design methodologies and tools to unlock the potentials of data technologies such as the Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the everyday job of design is necessary but not sufficient. There is now a need to fundamentally question what happens when human-centered design is unable to effectively give form to technology, why this might be the case, and where we could look for alternatives.","[{""name"": ""Elisa Giaccardi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Johan Redström"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Though some articles have been written regarding its impact on the construction industry in other countries, much is yet to be known concerning the current impact in Ghana. This study aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 on Ghana’s construction industry and assess how construction companies are contributing to the fight against COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews with nine key professionals working with D1K1 firms currently working on projects of almost similar sizes within the confines of a reputable tertiary institution in Ghana were conducted over a span of three weeks. Thematic analysis was conducted with Nvivo 12 Pro Application software. Findings From the findings, the major impact includes: a decrease in work rate, delays in payments and an increase in the cost of materials arising from border closure. On the measures by construction companies in contributing to the fight against the pandemic, findings indicated: educating the workforce on the virus, the provision of PPEs, regular and effective checks on entry and exit from the site. Practical implications The study is significant, as knowledge of the impact posed by the pandemic will provide some idea of the measures to put in place to ensure the gradual to full recovery of the industry.

10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0164,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Internet of things in construction industry revolution 4.0 Recent trends and challenges in the Malaysian context,"Purpose In this advanced era of Industrial Revolution 4.0, as an element of cyber physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been applied in many different industries; however, its adoption in the construction industry is still limited to a few applications. This study uncovers, identifies and assesses the challenges of adopting IOT in construction projects. The challenges have been identified through the briefed literature review and a survey instrument from construction industries in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the quantitative research approach has been used and data have been collected through a questionnaire survey for construction practitioners. Whereas, respondents to the questionnaire are practitioners from the Malaysian construction industry. The method of sampling implied is random sampling technique whereby the final sample size is 132 participants. Moreover, the gathered data has been analysed using univariate approach via standard deviation and average index in SPSS Software 22.0. Findings The results of this study indicated the most dominant challenges are lack of safety and security, lack of documented standards, lack of benefit awareness, improper introduction of IOT and lack of robustness in connectivity. This study also examined that the awareness of construction practitioners toward the understanding of IOT and its possibility to be applied and extended in construction projects and determined that construction practitioners are aware of IOT benefits to improve the efficiency of construction projects. Practical implications The study presents a better understanding of IOT in the construction industry and their potential challenges, which helps the construction policymakers to avoid encounters related to challenges and provide education-based campaigns to educate construction practitioners on the concept and importance of using IOT in the construction sector. Originality/value This is a unique study because of its nature in this advance era of industry 4.0. Furthermore, it is specifying the latest trend associated with IOT in the construction industry and addressing the challenges of implementation, which is crucial to exploit and take advantage of the full potential of IoT benefits.","[{""name"": ""Yaser Gamil"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Majid A.

10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0481,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Impact of COVID-19 on project performance in the UAE construction industry,"Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the global economy and, thus, the global construction industry. This paper aims to study the impact of COVID-19 on construction project performance in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a qualitative and exploratory approach to investigate the impact of COVID-19 and its policies on project performance in the UAE construction industry in critical areas of the project management body of knowledge (e.g. schedule, cost, resources and contracts). Semi-structured interview questions were asked from ten construction professional to obtain valuable insights into the pandemic’s effects on the UAE construction industry and the effectiveness of policies implemented to rectify the damage and identify the industry’s new normal. Findings The findings indicate that the construction industry faced several challenges such as schedule delays, disrupted cashflows, delayed permits, approvals and inspections, travel restrictions, serious health and safety concerns, material and equipment shortages, among others which hindered the timely delivery of construction projects. It also indicates that efforts made by the government institutions and the construction industry of the UAE such as economic support programs, digitization of processes, fee and fine waivers, health facilities, among other statutory relaxations proved effective in supporting the construction industry against the adverse effects of the pandemic. Research limitations/implications The research findings are limited to the literature review and ten semi-structured interviews seeking an expert’s opinion from industry professionals working in the UAE construction industry. The research team did not get access to project documents, contracts and project progress reports which may be required to validate the interview findings, and to perform an in-depth analysis quantifying the impact of COVID 19 on construction projects performance, which is a limitation of this research. Practical implications The implication is that, owing to the imposed lockdowns and strict precautionary measures to curb the rapid spread of the pandemic, smooth execution of the construction project across the country was affected. The government institutions and stakeholders of the construction projects introduced and implemented various techniques and solutions which effectively handled the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the construction industry of the UAE. Originality/value This study has identified the challenges faced by the construction industry of the UAE in the context of the management of project schedule, project cost, construction contracts, health and safety of construction employees and other related aspects of the construction projects. This study also identified the techniques and solutions adopted by various public and private institutions of the country and their implications on construction projects. Therefore, this study provides guidelines for policymakers and future research studies alike.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Sami Ur Rehman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Tariq Shafiq"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muneeb Afzal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.21315/jcdc2018.23.1.6"", ""10.1108/08288661311319184"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119546"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.1994.tb01088.x"", ""10.1080/01446193.2020.1817516"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0243413"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:1(153)"", ""10.1108/CI-11-2019-0133"", ""10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102251"", ""10.3390/buildings10100171"", ""10.1080/01446190600827033"", ""10.18510/hssr.2020.8516"", ""10.1108/SASBE-05-2020-0068"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.144"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121766"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1728606"", ""10.3390/su12093826"", ""10.1002/hfm.20882"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.07.175"", ""10.31234/osf.io/jhprk"", ""10.1109/aset48392.2020.9118313"", ""10.1016/j.tmaid.2014.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141410"", ""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2020.110335"", ""10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105924"", ""10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30558-4"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9"", ""10.1002/jmv.25918""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0286,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Lessons learned from the impact of COVID-19 on the global construction industry,"Purpose The construction industry represents most of every country’s finances and vital to continued economic growth and activities, especially in developing countries. The impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 disease (COVID19) on the government’s income resulted in the expectation of many public projects being cancelled or delayed providing little opportunity for the emergence of new public projects. This study collated a global qualitative perspective (survey interviews) on the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive and negative impacts for future-proofing the construction sector. Design/methodology/approach In total, 76 respondents from five continents excluding South America responded to the online open-ended structured questionnaire. Data collected were analysed through artificial inteligence analytics tool – Zoho analytics. Findings The themes indicating the positive impact obtained from the interview were overhead cost reduction, remote working environment, focus on health and safety, improved productivity and sustainability goals while the themes signifying the negative impact were low business turnover, delays in construction payment and output, difficulties working from home and job losses. Supply chain management, construction project management improvement, concentration on health and safety and effective virtual working environment were collated as themes on lessons learned. Social implications The major findings of this study emphasise on the need to improve the occupational health and safety and onsite safety measures for future proofing of the construction industry. Originality/value The findings from the analyses made clear the imperativeness of the built environment research, with a focus on novel framework and strategies for future proofing the construction industry.","[{""name"": ""Mercy Ogunnusi"", ""affiliation"": [""Robert Gordon University Faculty of Design and Technology, , Aberdeen,""]}, {""name"": ""Temitope Omotayo"", ""affiliation"": [""Leeds Beckett University School of Built Environment, Engineering and Computing, , Leeds,""]}, {""name"": ""Mansur Hamma-Adama"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering, Kaduna Polytechnic, Kaduna, Nigeria""]}, {""name"": ""Bankole Osita Awuzie"", ""affiliation"": [""Central University of Technology Department of Built Environment, , Bloemfontein,""]}, {""name"": ""Temitope Egbelakin"", ""affiliation"": [""The University of Newcastle School of Architecture and Built Environment, , Callaghan,""]}]","[""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140524"", ""10.3390/ijerph18041559"", ""10.1080/01446193.2012.717706"", ""10.3390/su9122354"", ""10.1177/1403494821993707"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.109883"", ""10.3390/su13052670"", ""10.4236/oalib.1105665"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1786623"", ""10.11113/intrest.v14nS2.71"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)co.1943-7862.0002102"", ""10.1080/014461998372024"", ""10.3892/ijmm.13.6.923""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1057/s41289-020-00134-6,URBAN DESIGN INTERNATIONAL,0813 Architecture; 0833 Urban and Rural Planning; 1305 Design,"""In the evening, I don't walk in the park"": The interplay between street lighting and greenery in perceived safety","AbstractWalking as a means of transportation is a key feature in sustainable urban design, but few studies have examined the influence of micro-level environmental features, such as vegetation and street lighting, on perceived safety and people’s choice to walk. This study applied a non-explicit approach to examine the relationship between greenery, street lighting, perceived safety, and walking in an urban context. Participants from three neighbourhoods in Malmö, Sweden, took part in focus group discussions concerning neighbourhood qualities related to walking.A qualitative analysis revealed four inter-related themes relevant for perceived safety after dark: avoidance, entrapment, presence of others, and prospect (visual overview of the nearby surroundings). The quality of urban greenery and street lighting impacted people’s route choices after dark, and some participants felt compelled to make detours. Entrapment, partly due to unkempt greenery in combination with darkness, contributed to avoidance, whereas the presence of other people had the opposite effect. The results indicate that urban greenery and street lighting must be considered together, since their interaction influences perceived safety and impacts the walkability of the neighbourhood.","[{""name"": ""Johan Rahm"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Catharina Sternudd"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria Johansson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.trd.2004.12.001"", ""10.1068/b2725"", ""10.1080/07352166.2016.1255526"", ""10.1177/0013916504269643"", ""10.1177/0013916512453838"", ""10.1177/0049124113500475"", ""10.21834/e-bpj.v1i3.374"", ""10.1080/13574800120105779"", ""10.18848/2154-8587/CGP/v03i01/37369"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.05.026"", ""10.1186/s40410-016-0033-1"", ""10.1080/01944361003766766"", ""10.1080/09589230500264109"", ""10.4135/9781412990028"", ""10.1177/1043986209335013"", ""10.1177/0013916592241002"", ""10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.08.010"", ""10.1177/1477153514524587"", ""10.1080/00207590444000104"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2009.10.012"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2012.05.006"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(02)00109-3"", ""10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182443"", ""10.1007/s11116-014-9535-4"", ""10.1080/04419057.2001.9674248"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2013.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2019.02.011"", ""10.1177/1477153510370757"", ""10.1080/13574809.2015.1133225"", ""10.1080/01490400701394865"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2014.05.005"", ""10.1177/1477153510376794"", ""10.1016/j.jth.2014.09.002"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80254-3"", ""10.1068/a4196"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9663.1997.tb01601.x"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80173-2"", ""10.1016/0169-2046(93)90014-5"", ""10.1177/001391659702900301"", ""10.2150/jlve.33.37"", ""10.1080/09640568.2011.608548"", ""10.1177/1477153512468745"", ""10.1016/0169-2046(96)00311-8"", ""10.1080/15568318.2013.825036"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2016.10.002"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-012312-110838"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2010.07.017"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2013.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2007.12.002"", ""10.1057/udi.2013.33"", ""10.1080/00224545.1989.9711716"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2007.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.envint.2014.10.004"", ""10.1023/A:1006817400224"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2004.09.033"", ""10.1057/udi.2013.26""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Transportation', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

To achieve that aim, the objectives are to: identify the critical pandemic impact (CPI) of COVID-19 on AEC organizations; compare the CPI between the different organization characteristics; and analyze the interrelationships between the CPI.Design/methodology/approachA systematic literature review of 519 articles and in-depth interviews with 40 AEC practitioners were carried out, yielding 12 COVID-19 impacts. Then, data on the 12 impact’s criticality were collected through a survey among AEC practitioners. In total, 127 valid responses were received and analyzed using mean ranking analysis, analysis of variance and Spearman’s correlation. The findings were also compared with pandemic impacts from prior works.FindingsFive CPI exist among the 12 impacts, namely, “reduced construction productivity,” “reduced foreign investment in the construction industry,” “reduced demand on construction-related works,” “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced number of public projects.” “Reduced foreign investment in the construction industry” and “reduced demand on construction-related works” significantly impact small-medium enterprises than large enterprises. Also, “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced construction productivity” are recurring impacts in all countries compared. Finally, moderate relationships exist between “reduced foreign investment in the construction industry” and “reduced demand on construction-related works” and “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced construction productivity.”Originality/valueThe findings can be used to prioritize available resources in developing short-term responses for COVID-19. Also, action plans can be developed to mitigate the CPI from recurring.","[{""name"": ""Sze Soon King"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rahimi A.

10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0217,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Comparative analysis of drivers to BIM adoption among AEC firms in developing countries A case of Nigeria,"PurposeBuilding information modelling (BIM) adoption is vital to the productivity and competitive nature of the construction sector. However, BIM adoptions have not been generally embraced by many architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) firms, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, studies that investigate the important drivers to BIM adoptions among construction professionals through quantitative approach are limited. The purpose of this study is to address the aforementioned gap.Design/methodology/approachThis study involves a literature review, a pilot study and a questionnaire survey. The primary data were carried out using structured questionnaires distributed to four different BIM adopter AEC firms. These comprised architectural firms, facility management firms, quantity surveying firms and structural engineering firms in Lagos, Nigeria. Data obtained were analysed using mean score, standard deviation, Kruskal–Wallis test and factor analysis.FindingsThe study identified 23 drivers to BIM adoption, and the relative importance of the identified drivers was gauged from each selected BIM adopter AEC firm category. The result of the Kruskal–Wallis test showed that there is no statistically significant difference in the perceptions of the four selected AEC firms in the mean ranking of the identified 23 drivers to BIM adoption. The findings from factor analysis categorized the identified drivers into two major factors to include cost and time savings, improved communication, and BIM awareness and government supports.Practical implicationsThe study empirically identifies important drivers to BIM adoption that will be useful for construction stakeholders to formulate strategies to adopt the full implementation of BIM in the AEC firms of Nigeria and other developing countries. Also, this study is important as it identifies, analyses and compares the drivers to BIM adoptions from four different AEC firms, thereby providing robust and more reliable findings.Originality/valueThe study findings will provide information to policymakers and construction stakeholders to make policy recommendations that are capable of positively influencing the widespread adoption of BIM in AEC firms in particular and the construction industry at large. This study is important because the studies that comparatively and empirically analyzed BIM drivers in AEC firms are rare, particularly in developing countries. Hence, this study could be used to benchmark future studies in developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Solomon Olusola Babatunde"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Damilola Ekundayo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adedayo Opeyemi Adekunle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wasiu Bello"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.016"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000127"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.019"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2018-0058"", ""10.1108/13664381211274362"", ""10.1007/BF02310555"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.09.001"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)90075-8"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.11.003"", ""10.1007/BF02291575"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v13i4.3630"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.10.020"", ""10.5345/JKIBC.2013.13.3.242"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000056"", ""10.1108/JFM-09-2017-0046"", ""10.1108/BIJ-05-2018-0138"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-10-2017-0090"", ""10.1108/09699980510600099"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000102"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.07.175""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0193,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Comparison of modular and traditional UK housing construction: a bibliometric analysis,"Purpose Housing completions in the UK have fallen to 125,000 annually, while government targets have risen to 300,000. This dramatic shortfall raises concerns as to whether current traditional construction approaches remain appropriate. This study aims to compare the traditional approach with modular construction, with a view to assessing whether a shift in construction systems offers the potential to alleviate the UK's domestic housing crisis. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive interpretivist review of the available relevant literature is undertaken on construction methods within the UK; advantages and disadvantages. A bibliometric analysis is conducted to extract trends and findings relevant to the comparison at hand. The database is Web of Science; the analysis software is the VOS viewer. Findings The research illustrates that the UK housing market is in a state of crisis. A toxic combination of a rising UK population combined falling rates of housing delivery has resulted in an ever-widening housing supply gap. The construction industry’s capacity to meet this observed dearth in supply is further exacerbated by a number of chronic factors such as: falling participation in the construction sector workforce; lowering skill levels; reducing profitability; time to delivery pressures; and cost blow-outs. Originality/value While much information on the various construction methods are available, including comparative material, this study is the first to assemble the various comparative parameters regarding traditional and modular UK residential construction in one place. Thus, this study provides a definitive assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages of these forms of construction.","[{""name"": ""Falaq Nazir"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Shelbourn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Igor Martek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wellington Didibhuku Didibhuku Thwala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hatem El-Gohary"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/CI-12-2019-0141"", ""10.1108/F-07-2018-0085"", ""10.1002/asi.21525"", ""10.1108/F-05-2019-0053"", ""10.1108/13552519810369057"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.08.012"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2018-0125"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2019-0518"", ""10.3390/ma12081260"", ""10.1080/15248372.2012.646613"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.12.006"", ""10.5592/otmcj.2013.1.11"", ""10.1051/matecconf/20141501009"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2020-0016"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000173"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.09.004"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2018-0390"", ""10.1007/s11192-009-0146-3"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.07.012"", ""10.1093/ijlct/2.1.44"", ""10.5194/nhess-9-1307-2009"", ""10.1108/03090569610107427""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0500,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Multiuser immersive virtual reality application for real-time remote collaboration to enhance design review process in the social distancing era,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop and assess the real-time multiuser virtual reality (VR) application that can be used in the design review process. In particular, the application was aimed to accommodate the design review meetings conducted among participants who are in different locations, which has become commonplace during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a methodology for the development of a real-time multiuser immersive VR application, to support remote collaboration during the design review process. The developed application can immerse remote project participants into the same virtual environment and provide virtual face-to-face discussions. An experiment was conducted with 44 university students to investigate the applicability and performance of the developed application by comparing it with the traditional approach. Findings Results indicated that the group of students who used the developed immersive VR application outperformed the group that used the traditional approach. This was measured by the percentage of correctly identified design errors during a building inspection experiment. Originality/value The difficulty of bringing remote stakeholders together in a virtual environment has impeded the implementation of VR technology in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. Most research has focused on the improvement of a single user’s experience. Most of the previous multiuser VR studies were conducted in other industries while similar research in the AEC industry is limited. The study presented in this paper contributes to the AEC industry by presenting the development of multiuser immersive VR applications for real-time remote collaboration and the empirical evidence to substantiate its potential benefits.","[{""name"": ""Sunseng Tea"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kriengsak Panuwatwanich"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rathavoot Ruthankoon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Manop Kaewmoracharoen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.aej.2019.06.002"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000377"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102969"", ""10.1016/j.rcim.2014.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103160"", ""10.1080/15578771.2015.1121936"", ""10.1016/j.future.2010.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2012.05.016"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2019.02.036"", ""10.1016/j.ijnaoe.2019.02.010"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.04.002"", ""10.11120/ital.2009.08030040"", ""10.1007/3-540-32884-X_9"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.016"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.08.011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.02.003"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.828844"", ""10.1049/htl.2018.5077"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2009.09.004"", ""10.1016/j.jht.2020.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.apmr.2019.10.182"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.013"", ""10.1186/s40327-018-0065-6"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.05.006""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review to assess peer–reviewed experimental studies, proof–of–concept studies, and conference proceedings that examined the use of FIVEs in the context of interior design research, and 22 studies met our inclusion criteria. Current challenges include lack of perceived realism and immersion, lack of sensory feedback, and time constraints. Key considerations for the effective use of FIVEs include technological considerations, experimental design, measurement techniques, and evaluation methods. Key future research directions include enhancing the realism and immersiveness of FIVEs and promoting multiuser studies.","[{""name"": ""Saleh Kalantari"", ""affiliation"": [""Cornell University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jun Rong Jeffrey Neo"", ""affiliation"": [""Cornell University, USA""]}]","[""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02086"", ""10.1016/j.biopsycho.2004.03.008"", ""10.1162/pres.16.3.318"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-0605-7_15"", ""10.1007/978-1-4419-0745-5_3"", ""10.1016/j.clinph.2008.11.029"", ""10.1108/EJM-09-2014-0543"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.02.038"", ""10.22260/ISARC2014/0073"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.03.020"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2017.05.006"", ""10.2501/JAR-2017-011"", ""10.1080/17533010903488517"", ""10.1016/j.appet.2013.09.006"", ""10.1108/EJM-12-2016-0805"", ""10.1093/abm/kax041"", ""10.1145/2838739.2838817"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2018.04.008"", ""10.1186/s40691-017-0116-y"", ""10.1177/193758671400800105"", ""10.2501/S0021849906060041"", ""10.1086/209397"", ""10.1207/s15327663jcp1404_2"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2008.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.foodres.2018.02.033"", ""10.2307/j.ctvjghtgs"", ""10.1016/j.jretconser.2016.02.010"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69921-2"", ""10.1177/193758670800100306"", ""10.1016/j.foodqual.2017.07.007"", ""10.1017/S0033291716002208"", ""10.1007/s10055-009-0138-x"", ""10.2196/jmir.3774"", ""10.1186/1471-2458-11-589"", ""10.1080/0144619032000113690"", ""10.1177/1937586718796626"", ""10.1177/0013916507311545""]","['Environmental Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Education', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

It is worthy of note that this is the first study that analyses the DT of the construction industry in the past decade.","[{""name"": ""Samuel Adeniyi Adekunle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Obuks Ejohwomu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Abiodun Adekunle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wellington Didibhuku Thwala"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/buildings11070264"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0237"", ""10.1108/ECAM-12-2020-1012"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2020-0294"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2021.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.016"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2017.08.007"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0013"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2016.03.002"", ""10.1080/17452759.2016.1209867"", ""10.3390/app11052365"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0345"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.10.017"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.08.005"", ""10.1002/asi.21525"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100868"", ""10.1061/(asce)0887-3801(2010)24:1(25)"", ""10.1096/fj.07-9492LSF"", ""10.3390/safety5030051"", ""10.2478/bsrj-2020-0009"", ""10.1186/s40327-017-0050-5"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.002"", ""10.1080/09613218.2011.561948"", ""10.1007/S11192-015-1798-9"", ""10.4172/2168-9717.1000e101"", ""10.1080/20450249.2017.1337349"", ""10.3390/su12208492"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.195"", ""10.1108/ECAM-08-2018-0350"", ""10.3311/CCC2018-009"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.11.006"", ""10.1617/s11527-013-0201-7"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2015.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119059"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.007"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2020-0291"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103595"", ""10.1016/J.FUTURE.2021.06.020"", ""10.1016/J.JOI.2018.09.002"", ""10.1007/s12599-015-0401-5"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.03.009"", ""10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5"", ""10.3145/epi.2020.ene.03"", ""10.1007/s11301-020-00185-7"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2020-0016"", ""10.1016/j.addma.2019.100894"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.04.017"", ""10.1002/smj.397"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000203"", ""10.36680/j.itcon.2020.017"", ""10.3390/buildings9040085"", ""10.15547/tjs.2017.s.01.065"", ""10.4324/9780429286797-6"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.01.020"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2017.06.007"", ""10.1142/9789812834478_0002"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.02.009"", ""10.1080/01972240309487"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.jsis.2019.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2004.08.002"", ""10.15302/j-fem-2017006"", ""10.3390/ijerph17082963"", ""10.1016/S2095-7564(15)30279-8"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.12.002"", ""10.1080/17457300.2013.861853"", ""10.3390/s19194131"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.01.006"", ""10.1108/CI-02-2018-0010"", ""10.1016/0020-7837(79)90044-X"", ""10.1300/J105v08n01_06"", ""10.3163/1536-5050.100.2.013""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geology', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0267,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,The missing links of sustainable supply chain management and green radical product innovation between sustainable entrepreneurship orientation and sustainability performance,"Purpose Anchored on the natural resource-based view and stakeholder theories, this study aims to investigate the mediating roles of sustainable supply chain management and green radical product innovation (GRPI) in the link between sustainable entrepreneurial orientation (SEO) and sustainability performance. Design/methodology/approach The comprehensive research model developed in this study is empirically tested by using data garnered from 248 managers of Ghanaian small and medium-sized enterprises. Partial least square structural equation modeling is applied as the methodological technique to test all the hypothesized relationships. Findings Results of the study indicate that SEO has a direct significant positive impact on environmental performance and social performance but not financial performance. However, through sustainable supply chain management and GRPI (both mediating variables), SEO tends to have significant impact on all sustainability performance dimensions (environmental, financial and social performance). Originality/value This study offers fresh empirical evidence by developing a unified research model that validates the specific mediation role of sustainable supply chain management between SEO and green radical product innovation, as well as the mediating roles of both sustainable supply chain management and GRPI between SEO and sustainability performance dimensions.","[{""name"": ""Ebenezer Afum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kassimu Issau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yaw Agyabeng-Mensah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Charles Baah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Essel Dacosta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Essandoh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Agyenim Boateng"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ijmr.12068"", ""10.1002/bse.2314"", ""10.1108/JMTM-02-2020-0036"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120613"", ""10.32479/ijeep.9227"", ""10.1111/jsbm.12005"", ""10.1002/bse.2191"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102254"", ""10.1177/002224377701400320"", ""10.1504/IJETM.2019.104762"", ""10.1002/csr.1441"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119125"", ""10.1108/IJEBR-12-2018-0804"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2015.12.006"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0914-x"", ""10.1002/bse.2496"", ""10.1007/s11135-011-9535-9"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.2010.00956.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6520.2010.00432.x"", ""10.1007/s11365-018-0503-x"", ""10.1080/1331677X.2019.1694560"", ""10.1108/JBIM-02-2015-0023"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.074"", ""10.1007/s11187-017-9933-z"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.12.016"", ""10.1108/BIJ-10-2016-0165"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.071"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.01.065"", ""10.1177/0266242615577708"", ""10.1080/23311975.2020.1743616"", ""10.1108/EBR-11-2018-0203"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.093"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.104"", ""10.1108/MD-04-2015-0146"", ""10.2189/asqu.2009.54.1.123"", ""10.1007/s11187-017-9939-6"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2670-9"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2009.03.008"", ""10.3390/su9020222"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2018.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119383"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121024"", ""10.1108/JGR-03-2017-0020"", ""10.1080/13504509.2011.543565"", ""10.1007/s11365-020-00660-3"", ""10.1002/csr.1915"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-04-2017-0251"", ""10.1108/BL-10-2018-0045"", ""10.1108/01443570210427668"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8551.2012.00848.x"", ""10.1108/JMTM-12-2016-0188"", ""10.1111/1467-8691.00272"", ""10.1108/JSMA-03-2020-0053"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.211"", ""10.1002/csr.2060"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.08.032"", ""10.3390/su10061871"", ""10.1007/s10551-014-2401-7"", ""10.1002/bse.2283"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119762"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120849"", ""10.1002/sd.2010"", ""10.1080/0965254X.2012.742129"", ""10.1177/0266242615613840"", ""10.1002/sej.1344"", ""10.1080/00207543.2020.1756510"", ""10.1109/TEM.2015.2507585"", ""10.1108/JMTM-03-2018-0099"", ""10.1002/bse.2298"", ""10.1086/651257"", ""10.1002/bse.2265""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Business and International Management', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0148,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,How the COVID 19 pandemic would change the future of architectural design,"Purpose The purpose of this research is to conduct a comparative analysis of the views of architects and urban designers in the West and the Middle East on whether the COVID-19 pandemic could affect architecture and urban design shortly and what is the future of our home design? A further purpose was to explore and explain how the pandemic will change the future of architecture and urban design by reviewing, analyzing and synthesizing different and related viewpoints to create a grounded theory, hoping to provide some insight for the entire world. Design/methodology/approach Different research methods were used to achieve the research purposes including grounded theory, desk reviews, reviewing the limited existing literature and semi-structured interviews. Findings This research found that most surveyed architects believed that the COVID-19 pandemic would affect the future of architecture and urban design and help to create new design features. Future concentration will be in living, working, learning, leisure and teaching spaces. All future designs should be independent, self-sufficient in terms of power and water usage and using nonrenewable energy sources. The home design should focus on the interior design, transparency, open to the inside (introverted spaces), quality of life, natural daylighting and ventilation, healthy indoor air quality, use of plants and natural materials, green roof, the relationships between indoor and outdoor spaces and quality of building materials. Additionally, transitional space is an important primary entry point to the home. Moreover, folding furniture may be a solution to enlarge the room when needed and turn it into multifunctional spaces. The home office will no longer be a small desk, chair and lamp located at the small corner anywhere. The future home office should be equipped with all the necessary technology. The open-plan design trend and the concept of flow space will not exist anymore. The pandemic will encourage the use of touchless and smart technologies in design and construction. There is a need to separate heating and ventilation systems in detached houses and multistory buildings to avoid infectious diseases. Social norms have changed over a few weeks of social distancing. Therefore, we can change the system of negative habits, old traditions and society’s bad behaviors. Practical implications This research raises many proactive ideas, and the results are relevant to all actors in the construction sector, as it contains findings of understanding how the interaction of people with the built external or internal environment evolved during the pandemic process. In this sense, it will provide socio and economic benefits for the society in terms of seeking an answer to the question of “how should we design” for possible new bad scenarios to evolve the spaces in the “lockdown” situation. This research discusses how to make our homes comfortable and ready for an extraordinary time, suggested a practical design solution based on construction technologies. Social implications This research links theory to practice, and it facilitates the adaptation to the current situation. It has a high impact on society, as it guides designers to rethink spaces that can help occupants face the COVID-19 pandemic challenges. Therefore, it should create and implement architectural design guidelines for health and safety. The architects should think about how to create and organize multifunctional, flexible, aesthetical, healthy and clean spaces under the new roles of interaction and social distancing. Architects should incorporate technological and innovations from different fields to organize spaces, promote public health and enhance the quality of life. Originality/value Architecture and urban design suddenly become medical, and we can use the built environment as a way to control epidemic spread. Additionally, and by reviewing the literature, there is no published qualitative research that has been explored on how the COVID-19 pandemic will change the future of architecture and urban design, but there are some personal viewpoints and short interviews. This topic is a new growing concern and becoming a top social topic and priority for policymaking in the world. The topic is important in terms of design input for designers to create new living spaces, as it includes the views and observations of architects from the east and west to the pandemic process. We have all been encouraged to reimagine the space in which we live, how the place fits our needs, how we use it and enjoy it during the pandemic. Therefore, this paper appeals to an international readership by linking the COVID-19 situation to architectural design.","[{""name"": ""Ahmad A. Alhusban"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Safa A.

10.1111/joid.12179,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,"Effects of Interior Color Schemes on Emotion, Task Performance, and Heart Rate in Immersive Virtual Environments","The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of interior color schemes in immersive virtual environments (IVEs) on emotion, task performance, and heart rate to examine IVEs’ potential for interior color research. Fifty–five ( n = 55) student participants were recruited to experience four different colored IVE models (i.e., red, green, blue, and white), and their emotions, heart rate change, and proofreading performances during the immersion were measured. Participants were also asked about their sense of presence after the experience. The findings support the following three hypotheses: (1) IVE interior color schemes affect subject emotion, (2) IVE interior color schemes affect subject task performance as measured through a proofreading exercise, and (3) IVE interior color schemes affect subject heart rate. Specifically, red was perceived as significantly heavier, warmer, more exciting, tenser, and unpleasant. Significantly fewer errors occurred during the white immersion versus the green color scheme when completing the task performance exercise. While heart rate was reduced for each color, significant decreases were detected in the blue, white, and green color scenarios. The majority of participants felt a sense of being there when experiencing the four colored IVE spaces. Based on these results, we conclude that IVE has potential for interior color research to overcome the limitations of traditional color research tools.","[{""name"": ""Seung Hyun Cha"", ""affiliation"": [""Hanyang University, Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Shaojie Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Tae Wan Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Incheon National University, Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1109/IEMBS.2005.1616646"", ""10.2466/pms.1993.76.1.235"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.06.001"", ""10.1002/col.21949"", ""10.1080/1463922X.2013.815287"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.04.007"", ""10.1068/p140019"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-10-12"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106285"", ""10.1002/col.20435"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.03.025"", ""10.1186/s40166-015-0005-z"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.10.048"", ""10.1037/0096-3445.136.1.154"", ""10.3758/BF03334701"", ""10.1080/19401493.2016.1267801"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.03.020"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2011.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2017.05.006"", ""10.1002/col.5080060210"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-1140-7_7"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.09.006"", ""10.1002/col.20476"", ""10.1177/2158244014525423"", ""10.1016/0003-6870(90)90197-6"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6378(199612)21:6<448::AID-COL7>3.0.CO;2-W"", ""10.1002/col.20298"", ""10.2466/pms.101.2.473-486"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6378(199704)22:2<121::AID-COL7>3.0.CO;2-V"", ""10.52842/conf.ecaade.1994.147"", ""10.3758/BF03200735"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2016.06.022"", ""10.1002/col.20294"", ""10.1109/VR.2017.7892225"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2016.03.010"", ""10.3127/ajis.v20i0.1168"", ""10.1002/col.20010"", ""10.1002/col.20697"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.016"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6378(199602)21:1<35::AID-COL4>3.0.CO;2-6"", ""10.21834/e-bpj.v2i6.978"", ""10.1002/col.1016"", ""10.1162/105474601300343603"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6378(200002)25:1<20::AID-COL4>3.0.CO;2-5"", ""10.1006/jevp.2000.0193"", ""10.1016/S1007-0214(08)70158-5"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.04.015"", ""10.1002/col.22168"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.03.358"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.02.010"", ""10.1037/h0062181"", ""10.1002/cne.920180503"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.07.037"", ""10.2466/24.27.PMS.112.2.509-524""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sensory Systems']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7388), ('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7302)]]"

This paper aims to examine the benefits of applying cloud computing for construction sustainability in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach The cloud computing benefits-related data were retrieved from previous studies and complemented with a questionnaire survey to obtain data from stakeholders involved in the execution of construction projects in Lagos State, Nigeria, through a convenient sampling technique. In addition, the relative importance index (RII) technique was used to investigate the acquired data. At the same time, analysis was accomplished using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Findings indicated that numerous benefits could be derived by adopting cloud computing in the Nigerian construction industry. Findings The findings from RII analysis showed the significant benefits of data storage ubiquity (i.e. location independence), high situational awareness, team collaboration, compatibility with advanced production facilities and improved project planning. Furthermore, the analysis of these benefits was conducted using EFA for the four construction maxims: construction productivity, back-office activities, design management and billing. Originality/value This research illustrated the benefits of cloud computing in achieving a successful construction project. Besides, these findings are not only useful for achieving sustainable construction in Nigeria but also applicable to many developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Farouk Kineber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ibraheem Al-Bukhari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ibukun Famakin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chukwuma Kingsley"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2008.10.009"", ""10.3390/ijerph18020411"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00039-7"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.145"", ""10.3390/su11226261"", ""10.3390/su12219255"", ""10.1016/j.inffus.2016.09.005"", ""10.1080/014461997372971"", ""10.5381/jot.2009.8.1.c4"", ""10.3390/buildings10120239"", ""10.3390/su12197956"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.04.004"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(02)00039-0"", ""10.5121/ijmvsc.2015.6405"", ""10.3390/buildings11020036"", ""10.1016/0360-1323(87)90024-2"", ""10.3390/su12239930"", ""10.1109/MNET.2017.1700030"", ""10.1080/15623599.2014.967925"", ""10.48161/qaj.v1n2a36"", ""10.3390/su10020116"", ""10.3390/su10124394"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"", ""10.1080/17452007.2017.1384714"", ""10.3390/su12041514""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1111/jade.12350,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Mandatory Virtual Design Studio for All: Exploring the Transformations of Architectural Education amidst the Global Pandemic,"AbstractVirtual design studio (VDS) has been a part of the discourse of architectural pedagogy for the past two decades. VDS has been showcased as a potential educational tool in schools of architecture often in controlled, pre‐designed experiments. However, the global COVID‐19 pandemic has forced most schools to move their design studios into virtual space. This article aims to explore the potential advantages and shortcomings of VDS during the COVID‐19 quarantine from the perspective of students in a department of architecture. The study investigates three aspects of VDS namely, participating students’ evaluation of the virtual studio experience, the effectiveness of VDS in achieving the studio’s expected learning outcomes and the evaluation process for final design projects. Some 360 students from eight consecutive design studios participated in the study. The results indicate improvement in students’ ability to conduct independent research and in learning new computer‐aided design (CAD) software. Furthermore, the study finds VDS to be much more applicable for third‐ and fourth‐year students. The results also show a significant decline in background informal peer learning among students. Further studies are needed to address the implementation of a more immersive social experience in VDS.","[{""name"": ""Aminreza Iranmanesh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zeynep Onur"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/jade.12223"", ""10.1109/FIE.1997.635979"", ""10.52842/conf.ecaade.2005.303"", ""10.1080/10464883.1987.10758461"", ""10.1080/00038628.2011.582369"", ""10.1109/VR46266.2020.00056"", ""10.52842/conf.caadria.1997.163"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(00)00051-0"", ""10.11120/jebe.2013.00004"", ""10.1111/jade.12303"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2006.00472.x"", ""10.1080/00038628.2015.1034085"", ""10.1111/bjet.12535"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0868-6_18"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00282"", ""10.52842/conf.ecaade.2001.394"", ""10.11120/jebe.2011.06010044"", ""10.1162/104648802321019137"", ""10.11120/tran.2010.07010006"", ""10.3368/lj.24.2.198"", ""10.1162/10464880260472530"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01647.x"", ""10.1111/j.1531-314X.2007.00092.x"", ""10.11120/jebe.2008.03020063""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The purpose of this study is to explore strategies to reduce MHAS in PPP construction projects. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaires were used to elicit responses from respondents. Mean score ranking was used to rank these strategies while reliability analysis was conducted using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and level of agreement tested using Kendall’s concordance. Factor analysis grouped the strategies into eight components. Findings From the mean score ranking, monitoring; transfer of risks; screening; managing of construction risks; and increased incentives to control costs were the most significant strategies. The eight components were transparent process and contract, incentives and monitoring, screening and technical assistance, unbundling and benchmarking, funding and small liabilities, information clarification and signaling, risk and contract management and cooperation and finance factors. Practical implications The findings of this study have identified the most significant strategies to reduce MHAS on PPP construction projects to serve as a guide to PPP practitioners in reducing MHAS. Originality/value The output of this research contributes to the checklist of strategies that reduce PPP project failures arising from MHAS and contributes to the development of the agency theory.","[{""name"": ""De-Graft Owusu-Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Augustine Senanu Kukah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Boateng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""George Asumadu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/IJBPA-09-2017-0041"", ""10.1108/JFM-07-2016-0030"", ""10.1108/08858621311285723"", ""10.1111/1468-0297.00119"", ""10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X"", ""10.1177/2055563616634110"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.02.008"", ""10.1108/F-10-2015-0072"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1207865"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2017-0137"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2018-0001""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-04-2020-0119,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Critical analysis of mental health research among construction project professionals,"Purpose Mental ill-health among construction project professionals (CPPs) is a significant, persistent and unresolved problem that sparked the proliferation of literature worldwide. Despite the diverse research publications, a systematic review to reveal forms of mental ill-health, cause of mental ill-health and coping is lacking. Design/methodology/approach This paper aims to systematically reviews the existing body of knowledge on mental health in the construction project by analyzing 60 papers published between 1989 and 2020 (years inclusive) using the preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Academic journals between 1989 and 2020 were selected for this study because the first published paper on the mental health of construction managers commenced in 1989 and current studies are published in 2020. Findings The findings show that stress, job burnout, depression, anxiety and substance use disorder (SUD) are prominent forms of mental ill-health among CPPs, with an absence of project-related measuring scales for evaluating the mental ill-health symptoms. Moreover, generic stressors including long working hours, time pressure and work overload were used to establish the root causes of mental ill-health by ignoring construction project related stressors for mental ill-health. Problem-focused coping is more efficient than emotional focused coping in mitigating work stress, job burnout, depression, anxiety, but little is known on the influence of coping strategies on SUD. Knowledge gaps and future research directions were identified. This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the implications of mental health management on construction projects. Originality/value The findings of this study contribute toward understanding the need to investigate individual mental ill-health as against the existing practices of considering all forms of mental ill-health as one umbrella.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0101,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Systematic analysis of driverless technologies,"Purpose The advent of Industry 4.0 has engendered opportunities for a coalescence of digital technologies that collectively enable driverless vehicles to operate during the construction and use of a highway. Yet, hitherto scant research has been conducted to review these collective developments and/or sample construction practitioner opinion on them. This study aims to present a systematic review of extant literature on the application of driverless technologies in civil engineering and in particular, the highways infrastructure sector and offers insight into the limitations of associated barriers to full adoption, namely, current technological development processes, legal deficiencies and societal concerns. In so doing, this work presents a vignette of contemporary developments augmented by a critical analysis from practitioners’ perceptions. Design/methodology/approach A mixed philosophical methodological approach is adopted for this inductive research study. Interpretivism is used to critically analyse the literature and post-positivism to perform content analysis of the literature and synthesis of the discourse with practitioners. A total of 44 related papers published between 1998 and 2019 have been included in this study. Emergent themes identified from literature are then discussed in some further detail, namely, 1) automation and robotics; 2) case studies and simulations; and 3) safety and ergonomics). A focus group is then held with leading industrialists to discuss their experiences of advanced driverless technology applications in practice. Based upon a culmination of emergent evidence, a conceptual model of prevailing barriers is then developed to further elucidate upon the challenges facing the highways infrastructure sector. Findings Research into driverless technologies within the highways infrastructure sector has received relatively scant academic attention. Hitherto, most advancements made have stemmed from multidisciplinary teams consisting of engineering, information technology and social scientist researchers. There is insufficient supporting evidence of civil engineering and construction academics input into developments made – suggesting that prototype products often fail to adequately consider practical applications in the highways infrastructure sector at the design and use case stage. This view is substantiated by feedback from leading industry experts who participated in unstructured telephone interviews. Their feedback suggests that practical applications of products have been beset with problems, thus creating a perception that advanced technologies are largely “unusable” within the highways infrastructure sector and so are unsuitable for large-scale (and particularly bespoke) industrial applications. Originality/value This research critically synthesises the prevailing scientific discourse within extant literature on driverless technologies implemented but also garners practitioner feedback from leading UK industrialists on their applications in practice. Hitherto, this combined analysis approach has been rarely used in spite of it having significant advantages of tacit knowledge reflection on technologies used, where such can be used as a basis for further informed discourse and/or development. Moreover, this work culminates in a conceptual model that acts as a catalyst for future research investigations.","[{""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jahangir Akhtar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iain Rillie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicholas Chileshe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joseph H.K.

10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0192,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Developing a new deep learning CNN model to detect and classify highway cracks,"Purpose This paper aims to Test the capabilities/accuracies of four deep learning pre trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models to detect and classify types of highway cracks, as well as developing a new CNN model to maximize the accuracy at different learning rates. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 4,663 images of highway cracks were collected and classified into three categories of cracks, namely, “vertical cracks,” “horizontal and vertical cracks” and “diagonal cracks,” subsequently, using “Matlab” to classify the sample to training (70%) and testing (30%) to apply the four deep learning CNN models and compute their accuracies. After that, developing a new deep learning CNN model to maximize the accuracy of detecting and classifying highway cracks and testing the accuracy using three optimization algorithms at different learning rates. Findings The accuracies result of the four deep learning pre-trained models are above the averages between top-1 and top-5 and the accuracy of classifying and detecting the samples exceeded the top-5 accuracy for the pre-trained AlexNet model around 3% and by 0.2% for the GoogleNet model. The accurate model here is the GoogleNet model as the accuracy is 89.08% and it is higher than AlexNet by 1.26%. While the computed accuracy for the new created deep learning CNN model exceeded all pre-trained models by achieving 97.62% at a learning rate of 0.001 using Adam’s optimization algorithm. Practical implications The created deep learning CNN model will enable users (e.g. highway agencies) to scan a long highway and detect types of cracks accurately in a very short time compared to traditional approaches. Originality/value A new deep learning CNN-based highway cracks detection was developed based on testing four pre-trained CNN models and analyze the capabilities of each model to maximize the accuracy of the proposed CNN.","[{""name"": ""Faris Elghaish"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saeed Talebi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Essam Abdellatef"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sandra T.

10.1111/jade.12331,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Together but Apart: Creating and Supporting Online Learning Communities in an Era of Distributed Studio Education,"AbstractIt would seem that technological campuses of tomorrow have manifested in 2020 as an essential spontaneous response to a world event. This article examines the current crisis in physical art and design studio learning in higher education as a consequence of the COVID‐19 outbreak and the sector’s response to the fast‐track conversion of blended learning to a distributed model. Universities are focusing on virtual community building where group work, ‘crits’ and presentations are being carried out online. Moving assessment and engagement to online formats has consequences for practice‐based art and design courses: distributed learning changes how we teach and learn. This article discusses the implications of art and design studio education in a time of distributed learning. It considers the loss of control over a physically based, practical curriculum and the repercussions for students unable to perform to the depth and rigour required for creative art and design practice. Studio education is considered a signature pedagogy, and has a distinct set of guiding principles such as facilitating critical play, thinking and making, and a pedagogy of ambiguity. This article examines the successes and challenges of moving these pedagogical principles into distributed spaces to support student engagement, using Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a research framework. The article also examines pedagogical strategies that support students to engage in physical forms of creative practice that enable them to connect their lived experience in a time of crisis.","[{""name"": ""Lorraine Marshalsey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Madeleine Sclater"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9781315697420"", ""10.4324/9781315697420"", ""10.1080/13562517.2017.1414785"", ""10.5204/jld.v6i3.155"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511809989.020"", ""10.21125/iceri.2018.2530"", ""10.1007/s11423-017-9550-1"", ""10.1386/vi.2.2.127_1"", ""10.14742/ajet.4498"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2464.003.0008"", ""10.1111/jade.12058"", ""10.1017/S0958344020000099"", ""10.1080/00038628.2015.1034085"", ""10.3390/su12093729"", ""10.1111/bjet.12535"", ""10.1207/s15327884mca1101_1"", ""10.1177/1745499918771185"", ""10.1177/1745499918768111"", ""10.1080/03054985.2014.933005"", ""10.25304/rlt.v25.1998""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0270,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,An appraisal of the adoption internet of things (IoT) elements for sustainable construction,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the adoption of internet of things (IoT) element with the view of increasing usage so that benefits of convenience, increased performance and timely completion of work can be improved. This research was conducted so that there can be increase in the usage of IoT elements for construction performance and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted survey design and various construction professionals were used to assessing the level of adoption of IoT elements.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0099,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Lean production systems, social sustainability performance and green competitiveness: the mediating roles of green technology adoption and green product innovation","Purpose This study aims to investigate the interrelationships between lean production, green technology adoption, green product innovation, social sustainability performance and green competitiveness. The study further investigates the mediation roles of green technology adoption and green product innovation between lean production systems, social sustainability performance and green competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach The quantitative research approach is used for the study. Data for the study is garnered from 197 managers of manufacturing firms in Ghana via a self-administered questionnaire. Structural equation modeling, specifically partial least square is applied as the methodological tool to test all hypotheses. Findings Results of the study suggest that lean production systems have a significant positive impact on green technology adoption, green product innovation and green competitiveness. However, lean production systems are found to have an insignificant impact on social performance. The results further confirm the mediation roles of both green technology adoption and green product innovation between lean production systems, social sustainability performance and green competitiveness; thus indicating that lean production systems create an efficient condition for firms to adopt green technologies and produce innovative green-based products to leverage superior social sustainability performance and green competitiveness. Originality/value This study proposes and develops a comprehensive research model that is supported by the natural resource-based view theory to investigate the link between lean production systems, green technology adoption, green product innovation, social sustainability performance and green competitiveness from an emergent country perspective.","[{""name"": ""Ebenezer Afum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhuo Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yaw Agyabeng-Mensah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Charles Baah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/MEQ-01-2020-0019"", ""10.1108/JMTM-12-2019-0443"", ""10.1007/s11135-015-0244-7"", ""10.2307/258317"", ""10.1080/09537287.2018.1490971"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.03.062"", ""10.1179/oeh.2007.13.3.249"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2015.12.006"", ""10.1007/s11135-011-9535-9"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.208"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2019.09.019"", ""10.1108/IJLSS-11-2015-0043"", ""10.1108/BFJ-07-2018-0472"", ""10.1080/09537287.2019.1681535"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2015.2369"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.12.016"", ""10.1108/IJLSS-10-2017-0118"", ""10.1504/IJTM.2012.043953"", ""10.1080/10429247.2016.1238727"", ""10.2307/258963"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.116"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2007.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.141"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.04.005"", ""10.1287/mnsc.48.2.289.258"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.06.261"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2018.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123105"", ""10.1186/s40887-016-0009-y"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2014.05.022"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.123"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2019.04.012"", ""10.1080/00207543.2013.765072"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.09.042"", ""10.1007/s12599-015-0401-5"", ""10.1108/IJLSS-04-2018-0043"", ""10.1504/IJTM.2012.043955"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-09-2019-0642"", ""10.22215/timreview/879"", ""10.1108/IJLM-02-2019-0052"", ""10.1177/2319510X18810034"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2016.10.015"", ""10.1108/IJQSS-03-2020-0047"", ""10.1108/JMTM-12-2016-0188"", ""10.1016/j.jmsy.2017.10.005"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9310.2011.00672.x"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.481"", ""10.1108/JKM-11-2019-0624"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119762"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.07.042"", ""10.1080/10686967.2019.1689799"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-13515-7_6"", ""10.1080/00207543.2017.1391420"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104714"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.01.010"", ""10.1108/MD-01-2020-0065"", ""10.1086/651257"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2018.08.035"", ""10.1108/JMTM-05-2016-0071"", ""10.1108/IJLSS-01-2017-0004""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Information Systems', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0268,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Sensitivity analysis of using solar cells in regional electricity power supply of off-grid power systems in Iran,"PurposeRural areas are one of the effective regions in economy and self-sufficiency field especially in agricultural and livestock section. Planning in the rural section and the effort in solving the problems of farmers lead to increase their interest in farming and manufacturing in the villages and decrease their migration to the cities and metropolitans. Therefore, the present study aimed at feasibility of electricity to a rural household in Iran using off-grid solar-based hybrid system.Design/methodology/approachIn renewable energy projects, a successful evaluation requires suitable criteria so that one can properly analyze the operational behavior of all feasible scenarios. In the present paper, HOMER software has been used for this purpose for a village with no access to electricity grid (Bar Aftab-e Jalaleh, Iran). Due to drastic fluctuation of fossil fuel prices and varied solar radiations in various years because of climate change, sensitivity analysis has been performed using HOMER.FindingsIn the optimum status economically, 70% of needed energy is provided by solar cells at the price 0.792 $/kWh. The comparison between the optimum condition economically and the condition that only use fossil fuels revealed that the return on investment will occur after less than 2 years and have remained profitable over 23 years.Social implicationsThe authors hope that the results of this study can be used in planning of the authorities to realize the interests of people in this village.Originality/valueAccording to the surveys, despite Iran being the first country in terms of providing solar power to the villages, so far no socio-economic-environmental assessment has been done for a solar cell-based micro-grid in an off-grid mode for a remote village that is deprived of electricity from a national electricity grid. In addition, for the first time in Iran, the effect of the fuel price and solar radiation parameters variability on the performance of system have been investigated.","[{""name"": ""Mehdi Jahangiri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Haghani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shahram Heidarian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Mostafaeipour"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Heidar Ali Raiesi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Akbar Alidadi Shamsabadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2016.07.042"", ""10.14710/ijred.8.2.149-160"", ""10.1108/IJESM-03-2019-0003"", ""10.3390/su11164282"", ""10.1016/S0301-4215(01)00057-X"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.087"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.070"", ""10.1787/weo-2015-en"", ""10.1007/s12541-017-0174-5"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.07.069"", ""10.1063/1.4918592"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.037"", ""10.3390/en10122041"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.125"", ""10.3390/su11184959"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.01.033"", ""10.1108/IJESM-02-2018-0010"", ""10.1016/j.esd.2015.01.003""]","['Environmental Science', 'Energy', 'Engineering']","['Pollution', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-04-2020-0123,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A novel integrated approach for ranking solar energy location planning: a case study,"Purpose Every day, the sun provides by far more energy than the amount necessary to meet the whole world’s energy demand. Solar energy, unlike fossil fuels, does not suffer from depleting resource and also releases no greenhouse gas emissions when being used. Hence, using solar irradiance to produce electricity via photovoltaic (PV) systems has significant benefits which can lead to a sustainable and clean future. In this regard, the purpose of this study is first to assess the technical and economic viability of solar power generation sites in the capitals of the states of Canada. Then, a novel integrated technique is developed to prioritize all the alternatives. Design/methodology/approach In this study, ten provinces in Canada are evaluated for the construction of solar power plants. The new hybrid approach composed of data envelopment analysis (DEA), balanced scorecard (BSC) and game theory (GT) is implemented to rank the nominated locations from techno-economic-environmental efficiency aspects. The input data are obtained using HOMER software. Findings Applying the proposed hybrid approach, the order of high to low efficiency locations was found as Winnipeg, Victoria, Edmonton, Quebec, Halifax, St John’s, Ottawa, Regina, Charlottetown and Toronto. Construction of ten solar plants in the ten studied locations was assessed and it was ascertained that usage of solar energy in Winnipeg, Victoria and Edmonton would be economically and environmentally justified. Originality/value As to novelty, it should be clarified that the authors propose an effective hybrid method combining DEA, BSC and GT for prioritizing all available scenarios concerned with the construction of a solar power plant.","[{""name"": ""Ali Mostafaeipour"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mojtaba Qolipour"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mostafa Rezaei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mehdi Jahangiri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alireza Goli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Sedaghat"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.renene.2008.02.029"", ""10.1063/1.5034382"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2017.03.017"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.03.244"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.spacepol.2015.02.002"", ""10.12989/eri.2016.4.2.147"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.03.101"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.01.105"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2018.03.007"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2019-0132"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2007.03.010"", ""10.1063/1.5027824"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.03.038"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.007"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0154"", ""10.1007/s11708-019-0635-x"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.10.147"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.079"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.10.184"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.02.072"", ""10.1063/1.5041448"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2016.05.052"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.028"", ""10.1063/1.4995035"", ""10.1063/1.5004069"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.06.051"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.05.192"", ""10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.11.028""]","['Environmental Science', 'Computer Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Pollution', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0292,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A principal component analysis of barriers to the implementation of blockchain technology in the South African built environment,"Purpose Blockchain technology is one of the emerging innovative technologies making waves globally, and it has been adjudged to have the capability to transform businesses. With the different capabilities of the technology, such as immutability of information and decentralisation of authority attributes, the built environment is slow in its adoption. This study aims to explore the barriers to the implementation of blockchain technology in the construction using a principal component analysis (PCA) approach. Design/methodology/approach This research took a post-positivist philosophical stance, which informed a quantitative research approach through a questionnaire survey. From the South African built environment and information technology sector, 79 respondents were drawn through a snowballing sampling technique. The built environment professionals include architect, construction project manager, construction manager, quantity surveyor and engineer. Retrieved data were screened and analysed by adopting the descriptive analysis and PCA while Cronbach alpha evaluated the reliability. Also, Kruskal–Wallis H non-parametric test was used to determine the differences in the opinion of the respondent groups. Findings The analysis revealed that all the identified barriers ranked above the average mean with lack of clarity, scalability risks and lack of skills or knowledge ranking top three. PCA clustered the identified barriers into three components: organisational barriers, social barriers and technological barriers. Research limitations/implications This study was carried out in the Gauteng province of South Africa, leaving out other provinces due to accessibility, cost and time constraints. Practical implications Built environment organisations need to be kept abreast of the capabilities of blockchain technology as the major barrier observed was the lack of clarity of blockchain technology. Also, the technological barriers identified from this study need to be addressed by information technology experts to give consumers the desired value for money in implementing blockchain technology for the built environment. Originality/value The blockchain technology capabilities are incomparable to any other invention thus far. Therefore, it is very important that the numerous stakeholders in the built environment be made aware of the blockchain technology capabilities while formulating a solution to the identified barriers.

10.1108/JEDT-11-2021-0639,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Sustainable construction in the Nigerian construction industry: unsustainable practices, barriers and strategies","Purpose Sustainable construction practices are strongly correlated with a profitable and competitive construction industry, improved client satisfaction and efficient use of resources. However, due consideration is not being given to sustainable construction practices in Nigeria. Therefore, this study aims to identify the unsustainable construction practices on construction sites, the barriers to sustainable construction and possible strategies to improve sustainable construction in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey of 50 construction sites was conducted with construction professionals on the sites as the specific target, out of which only 43 construction sites have at least a construction professional present at the site. Forty-three filled questionnaires from the respondents were used for descriptive (mean score, standard deviation and charts) and inferential analysis (t-test and Kruskal–Wallis) in this study. Findings The study shows that a large percentage (75%) of construction professionals in Nigeria are aware of sustainable construction. The descriptive and inferential analysis showed a disparity in the ranking of the 12 unsustainable practices, 14 barriers and 11 strategies among the respondents. Five unsustainable practices (“negative externalities”, “excess energy”, “unsustainable technologies”, “non-management of health and safety of workers” and “material waste”), six barriers to sustainable construction (“absence of historical data and exemplary projects on which construction professionals can build and learn from”, “lack of professional to handle the task”, “poverty and low urban investment”, “lack of urban and construction policy”, “lack of awareness” and “lack of technical know-how”) and three strategies to improve sustainable construction practices in Nigeria (“cooperation, partnership and participation”, “protection of biodiversity and conservation of natural resources” and “sustainability assessment system”) were found to be significant. Practical implications The study offers significant insights into the construction industry unsustainable practices, barriers to sustainable construction, as well as strategies for improving sustainable construction practices. These insights can be applied to other developing countries with an emphasis on geographical differences. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the recent studies in Nigeria that explored the context of sustainable construction in the construction industry by providing insights into the unsustainable construction practices, barriers and strategies to improve sustainable construction in Nigeria.","[{""name"": ""Emmanuel Dele Omopariola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oludolapo Ibrahim Olanrewaju"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Idowu Albert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sunday Bankayode Ibiyemi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.habitatint.2009.11.011"", ""10.1108/09699980510584502"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108487"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0099"", ""10.1108/SASBE-11-2020-0161"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-79450-7_9"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111755"", ""10.3390/buildings2020126"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2008.07.015"", ""10.1016/j.eiar.2015.07.006"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103627"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2021-0375"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.06.041"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.235"", ""10.1080/096132198370065"", ""10.1080/09613210110064286"", ""10.3390/en13225860"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.12.007"", ""10.1016/S1066-7938(00)80007-X"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2010.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2006.12.025"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.07.007"", ""10.1080/01446190600601313"", ""10.1080/15623599.2017.1326301"", ""10.3390/su9010068"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0049"", ""10.1016/j.ijsbe.2012.03.001"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0328"", ""10.1080/15623599.2022.2029679"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-5100-6_2"", ""10.1080/09613218.2011.561948"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2014-0077"", ""10.1146/annurev.energy.29.062403.102215"", ""10.11648/j.ijrse.20211001.13"", ""10.1080/09613210500219113"", ""10.1080/09613210110063818"", ""10.1108/CG-03-2014-0037"", ""10.1108/LODJ-06-2018-0203"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000054"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.07.020"", ""10.1108/CI-08-2012-0045"", ""10.1108/JFM-09-2021-0095"", ""10.22452/jscp.vol9no1.2"", ""10.5755/j01.sace.27.2.25142"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2020-0042"", ""10.1016/j.cscm.2020.e00439"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2020.102147"", ""10.9790/0837-191180510"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.03.019"", ""10.1108/14714170910950830"", ""10.1007/s11356-021-16376-y"", ""10.1080/01446193.2022.2037145"", ""10.3390/su10020392"", ""10.3846/20294913.2013.798597"", ""10.1002/sd.373"", ""10.1108/ECAM-07-2021-0581"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2011.05.022"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2013.01.003"", ""10.1108/CI-04-2015-0021"", ""10.1002/sd.442"", ""10.1016/0197-3975(94)00071-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-77163-8_4"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2010.09.008"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/1036/1/012023"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1033815"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0315"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.03.019"", ""10.1002/sd.308"", ""10.3390/su6096088"", ""10.1108/SASBE-01-2014-0002"", ""10.3390/buildings2030283"", ""10.1177/1420326X10397780""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0263,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Development of geopolymer cement concrete for highway infrastructure applications,"Purpose The purpose of this work is to study the in-situ performance of ternary geopolymer concrete in road repair work. Geopolymer cement concrete is an attractive alternative to Portland cement concrete owing to environmental, economic and performance benefits. Industrial wastes, such as fly ash (FA) and ground granular blast furnace slag (GGBS), have been extensively used to manufacture unitary and binary geopolymer concrete with heat activation (at different temperature); however, it has indicated a limitation for its application in precast industry only. Design/methodology/approach In the present study, efforts have been made to produce a ternary geopolymer concrete mix, using GGBS, FA and Silica fumes (SF) in varied proportion mixed with 8 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as alkali activator and cured at ambient temperature. Total ten geopolymer concrete mixes have been prepared and tested for strength and durability properties and compared with control mix of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Based on the mechanical properties of various mixes, an optimum geopolymer concrete mix has been identified. The control mix and optimum geopolymer have been studied for microstructural properties through scanning electron microscopy. Findings The in situ performance of the optimum mix has been assessed when used as a road repair material on a stretch of road. The ternary geopolymer concrete mixes (a) 65% GGBS + 25% FA + 10% SF, (b) 70% GGBS + 20% FA + 10% SF, and (c) 75% GGBS + 15% FA + 10% SF have resulted in good strength at ambient temperature and the mix 75% GGBS + 15% FA + 10% SF have shown good in situ performance when tested for road repair work. Originality/value Geopolymer concrete is gaining interest in many fields as an alternative to conventional concrete, as it not only reduces carbon footprint due to huge cement production but also provides a sustainable disposal method for many industrial wastes. This paper focuses on finding some alternative of OPC concrete to reduce dependency on the OPC.","[{""name"": ""Niragi Dave"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vaishali Sahu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anil Kumar Misra"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.08.089"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2005.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2014.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.116722"", ""10.1617/s11527-012-9906-2"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2013.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.07.106"", ""10.1007/s10853-009-3934-5"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.05.107"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.651.168"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2012.10.004"", ""10.18280/acsm.430603"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(02)01000-1"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.11.052"", ""10.1016/S0958-9465(00)00024-X"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.01.055"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.12.448"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(00)00298-2""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

The purpose of this study is to mainstream the SDGs in Ghana’s energy sector within the framework of public–private partnerships (PPP): challenges, opportunities and strategies. Design/methodology/approach Literature review was carried out to explore concepts, theories and frameworks for initiating PPP. Best local and international practices in the implementation of PPP projects; challenges and opportunities in the implementation of PPP projects, strategies for mainstreaming the SDGs in Ghana’s energy sector and assess business action in the implementation of the SDGs in Ghana’s energy sector. The study is situated within the social constructionist philosophical tradition. The qualitative research strategy was adopted as the main methodological choice. Interview guides were used to collect data from respondents in the Accra metropolis. Findings Lack of a PPP policy law in Ghana, conflict of interest in PPP projects, excessive government control over projects, cumbersome licensing and legal regime and economic stability were the most significant challenges identified to PPPs. Technology transfer, efficiency gains and mobilization of additional resources for development on the government side where the opportunities for the private sector. Awareness creation, modeling inclusive business with corporate social responsibility (CSR) and SDGs, exploring business opportunities in SDGs such as carbon trading, aligning national policies with SDGs, establishing sustainability units and partnerships with relevant bodies were proposed for mainstreaming the SDGs in Ghana’s energy sector. Research limitations/implications It was established from this study that indeed PPPs have a major role to play in unleashing all available forces and prospects toward achieving the SDGs. This paper is constrained to the energy industry in Ghana. It provides a theory-based direction on how companies in the energy sector can contribute to social and economic interventions through a framework of PPP framework within the SGDs. Future research may explore how companies in other sectors may contribute to the sustainability discourse. Practical implications This will ultimately lead to additional funding to support government efforts in the implementation of SDGs, honing of sustainable (inclusive) business models, creating an enabling environment for PPPs toward inclusive growth and national development leaving no one behind. It recommended that there should be a national policy and law on PPPs and the private sector should be incentivized to engage government in PPPs implementation for the SDGs. Theoretically, this study contributes to the policy analysis discourse and scaling-up literature on the SDGs. Originality/value This study explores the challenges associated with mainstreaming the SGDs in the energy sector from a public–private business perspective. It also offers a new policy, economic and legal regulatory framework that contributes to emerging trends. The outcome of the analyzes advocates for clear business strategies for implementation of the SDG apart from CSR.","[{""name"": ""De-Graft Owusu-Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Kankam Adjei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Mensah Sackey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Reza M.

This paper aims to provide an efficient framework to handle mismatches between these two models with the least negative impact on the whole project. Design/methodology/approach First, 11 most frequent mismatches were identified through questionnaires. Also, the respondents were asked to determine the mismatches’ roots and solutions and the impact of applying solutions on the whole project. Afterward, the process to present the optimum solution to one of these mismatches was modeled. After running the application programming interface developed in Navisworks software, decision-makers access a form, showing mismatches, their causes and solutions, as well as the solutions’ effect. To finalize the optimal solution, a platform was provided on whether to accept the system solution or to propose an alternative. Findings To empirically validate the reliability of the proposed framework, two projects were investigated. Two different approaches to dealing with the same mismatch occurred in these projects were compared in terms of time, cost and material required. The results showed that addressing the mismatches through the proposed framework can efficiently enhance time, cost and material consumption, in comparison with the traditional approach. Originality/value There is currently no building information modeling-based holistic framework for managing mismatches between as-designed and as-built drawings. The results of this research can help contractors to make the best decision, saving project resources, when setting about a mismatch during construction.","[{""name"": ""Kobra Gharouni Jafari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nozhat Sadat Ghazi Sharyatpanahi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Esmatullah Noorzai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000431"", ""10.3390/buildings7030075"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.05.009"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.777754"", ""10.1007/s13369-015-2006-1"", ""10.13033/isahp.y2014.140"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001736"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000810"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:3(187)"", ""10.1109/3DV.2014.105"", ""10.1061/9780784479247.054"", ""10.5592/otmcj.2015.1.4"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.10.020"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000136"", ""10.1108/09699980410547612"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000377"", ""10.1080/01446193.2014.966733"", ""10.14288/1.0076419"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2013.12.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000528"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0227"", ""10.1080/09613210802128269"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.09.010"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.1061/9780784413616.191"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.09.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000492"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000347"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.013"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2011.07.005""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0151,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Assessment of health and safety culture maturity in the construction industry in developing economies: A case of Ghanaian construction industry,"Purpose The degree to which accidents happen or are prevented in any organisation is the function of both the health and safety culture and the safety culture maturity level of the organisation. Therefore, this paper aims to determine the state of health and safety culture in the construction industry in developing economies and to assess their category on the safety maturity ladder using the Ghanaian construction industry as an example. This is to help construction companies in developing countries become conscious of the state of health and safety in the industry so they can be motivated to improve along the ladder. Design/methodology/approach In total, 250 contractors made up of 155 building contractor,s and 95 road contractors took part in the survey. The sample size was determined by Yamane’s (1967) formula with stratified simple random sampling technique adopted in selecting the companies in the survey. This paper also uses (Guttman Scale) Scalogram analysis to measure the state of health and safety culture in the Ghanaian construction industry. Findings The results show that health and safety culture of the Ghanaian construction industry is at the first level, the pathological stage. Even though Ghanaian contractors have health and safety policies and codes of conduct in place, safety is not seen as a key business risk. Consequently, management and most frontline staff do not emphasise the importance of integration of safety measures in the various activities on the site. Thus, safety is not seen as unavoidable and a part of the construction activity. Practical implications The findings of this study inform state authorities, consultants and contractors of areas that they need to focus more on improving health and safety culture in developing countries. This would go a long way in protecting construction workers in the industry. Originality/value This study, to the best of the authors’ current knowledge, is the first of its kind in the Ghanaian construction industry. The study brings to the fore the actual state of health and safety in the construction industry in developing countries such as Ghana. The value of the findings lies in the fact that it will provide the motivation for construction companies in developing countries to develop a commitment to safety, and to provide appropriate and effective safety improvement techniques to progress to the subsequent stages of the safety culture maturity ladder.","[{""name"": ""Justice Williams"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Fugar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Adinyira"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2000)126:1(52)"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.09.049"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v13i3.3301"", ""10.1177/002204269102100305"", ""10.1080/01446190701411208"", ""10.1016/j.shaw.2014.12.002"", ""10.1177/0149206317745596"", ""10.1016/0001-4575(86)90019-9"", ""10.1016/0022-4375(95)00020-Q"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.04.005"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1996)122:1(61)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001503"", ""10.1016/S0925-7535(00)00041-2"", ""10.18502/kls.v4i5.2566"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2019.05.001"", ""10.1061/JCCEAZ.0000624"", ""10.1016/sooo1-4575(03)00016-2"", ""10.1061/(ASCE) CO.1943-7862.0001134"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2010.06.006"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.65.1.96"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000093"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2000)126:5(399)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2002)128:5(375)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE) EI.1943-5541.0000295""]","['Health Professions', 'Decision Sciences']","['Medical Laboratory Technology', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7464), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7279)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)]]"

This study aims to predict the compressive strength of normal concrete and high-performance concrete using four datasets. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, five established individual Machine Learning (ML) regression models have been compared: Decision Regression Tree, Random Forest Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression and Multiple-Linear regression. Four datasets were studied, two of which are previous research datasets, and two datasets are from the sophisticated lab using five established individual ML regression models. Findings The five statistical indicators like coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error, root mean squared error, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and mean absolute percentage error have been used to compare the performance of the models. The models are further compared using statistical indicators with previous studies. Lastly, to understand the variable effect of the predictor, the sensitivity and parametric analysis were carried out to find the performance of the variable. Originality/value The findings of this paper will allow readers to understand the factors involved in identifying the machine learning models and concrete datasets. In so doing, we hope that this research advances the toolset needed to predict compressive strength.","[{""name"": ""Muralidhar Vaman Kamath"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shrilaxmi Prashanth"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mithesh Kumar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adithya Tantri"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.03.011"", ""10.1007/s41062-021-00711-w"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.02.165"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.168"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.117048"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.047"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.031"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2019.03.001"", ""10.1108/02630809510089810"", ""10.1108/02630800210445681"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.065"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.03.061"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(02)00787-1"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.08.078"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.02.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000088"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.09.054"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.04.169"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijsbe.2014.12.002"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0220"", ""10.1108/00035590710762375"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.097"", ""10.1108/17260531011086144"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.10.114"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.02.011"", ""10.1108/IJSI-10-2017-0057"", ""10.1016/S0019-9958(64)90259-1"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.05.111"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.07.003"", ""10.1007/s11709-016-0363-9"", ""10.1016/j.ijsbe.2016.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.01.059"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2012-0042"", ""10.1177/0954405414528310"", ""10.1108/ACMM-11-2014-1461"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2004.01.011"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2011.09.014"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.09.012"", ""10.33889/IJMEMS.2020.5.6.104"", ""10.1520/ACEM20210011"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.01.014"", ""10.1108/WJE-08-2019-0236"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.05.084"", ""10.1007/s00500-021-05571-1"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.096"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.08.045"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.234"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2017.09.004"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(98)00165-3"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.219"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.189""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0211,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Extraction of underlying factors causing construction projects delay in Nigeria,"Purpose This paper aims to establish the most underlying factors causing construction projects delay from the most applicable. Design/methodology/approach The paper conducted survey of experts using systematic review of vast body of literature which revealed 23 common factors affecting construction delay. Consequently, this study carried out reliability analysis, ranking using the significance index measurement of delay parameters (SIDP), correlation analysis and factor analysis. From the result of factor analysis, this study grouped a specific underlying factor into three of the six applicable factors that correlated strongly with construction project delay. Findings The paper finds all factors from the reliability test to be consistent. It suggests project quality control, project schedule/program of work, contractors’ financial difficulties, political influence, site conditions and price fluctuation to be the six most applicable factors for construction project delay, which are in the top 25% according to the SIDP score and at the same time are strongly associated with construction project delay. Research limitations/implications This paper is recommending that prospective research should use a qualitative and inductive approach to investigate whether any new, not previously identified, underlying factors that impact construction projects delay can be discovered as it followed an inductive research approach. Practical implications The paper includes implications for the policymakers in the construction industry in Nigeria to focus on measuring the key suppliers’ delivery performance as late delivery of materials by supplier can result in rescheduling of work activities and extra time or waiting time for construction workers as well as for the management team at site. Also, construction stakeholders in Nigeria are encouraged to leverage the amount of data produced from backlog of project schedules, as-built drawings and models, computer-aided designs (CAD), costs, invoices and employee details, among many others through the aid of state-of-the-art data driven technologies such as artificial intelligence or machine learning to make key business decisions that will help drive further profitability. Furthermore, this study suggests that these stakeholders use climatological data that can be obtained from weather observations to minimize impact of bad weather during construction. Originality/value This paper establishes the three underlying factors (late delivery of materials by supplier, poor decision-making and Inclement or bad weather) causing construction projects delay from the most applicable.","[{""name"": ""Christian Nnaemeka Egwim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hafiz Alaka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luqman Olalekan Toriola-Coker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Habeeb Balogun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saheed Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raphael Oseghale"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/rlp.2009.11"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2016-0085"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00028-5"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.03.105"", ""10.1108/09699980710731308"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1166546"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(1995)11:2(45)"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2016.03.006"", ""10.1061/JCCEAZ.0000305"", ""10.12691/education-2-8-18"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00039-7"", ""10.1080/15623599.2017.1354514"", ""10.1080/01446193.2012.717705"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2015-0075"", ""10.1080/01446190600827033"", ""10.1002/pmj.21409"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2014.07.022"", ""10.4018/ij3dim.2013010105"", ""10.1109/PROC.1975.9792"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.10.075"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001736"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(03)00031-0"", ""10.1007/BF02291575"", ""10.3846/13923730.2012.698913"", ""10.1080/014461998372556"", ""10.1007/s12205-008-0367-7"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-07-2015-0028"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000096"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1230959"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2015-0072"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(00)00037-5"", ""10.5901/mjss.2017.v8n3p233"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.07.111"", ""10.15623/ijret.2013.0211013"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-04-2018-0020"", ""10.21315/jcdc2016.21.1.4"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2007.08.002"", ""10.3126/jacem.v2i0.16097"", ""10.1108/09699981211277577"", ""10.1108/eb054752"", ""10.1080/01446190801905406"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1766189"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-05-2017-0052"", ""10.1108/13664380910977592""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Findings The causal nexus of change during the construction phase is assessed and delineated; the key affecting factors are thematically grouped under headings: extent and severity; time in relation to implementing; instigating party; individual(s) responsible for managing the change; reason for the change; available resource; recoverable or non-recoverable; contract/project type; and type of client. Following this, the effects of change on key elements of the project are encapsulated and recommendations for adaptations which may provide improved experiences are offered. Originality/value The study tackles the common issue of managing the deleterious effects of change on commercial construction projects, defining management techniques to minimise stakeholder tribulation.","[{""name"": ""Jessica Smith"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Igor Martek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicholas Chileshe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susan Hayhow"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris J.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the critical success factors (CSFs) for D-B implementation in Malaysian public construction projects. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the research objectives, 111 questionnaire survey responses from construction-related professionals were collected and analysed using multivariate analysis, including t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and factor analysis. Findings The results indicate that while the client’s briefing effectiveness remained the top CSF among many nations, the other top CSFs in Malaysia D-B construction projects vastly differed compared to those countries. Moreover, the underlying components for successful D-B projects in Malaysia include the project management team, leader competency and “stakeholder” management. Originality/value This is one of the first studies that identify the CSFs for D-B implementation in the Malaysian construction industry. The outcomes provide a valuable reference and resource for academic scholars and construction practitioners to increase D-B implementation in the Malaysian private sector.","[{""name"": ""Zheng Ping Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rahimi A.

Information accrued is then used to develop a novel template value management workshop that provides a platform for educating future quantity surveying and other construction professionals. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a mixed philosophical epistemological design that uses interpretivism with elements of postpositivism. Specifically, a cross-sectional study of extant literature informs the development of a structured questionnaire that is posed to focus group participants (consisting of experienced industrial practitioners) to secure qualitative feedback and validate the template. Findings Research findings reveal that the roles and responsibilities of the quantity surveyor in the value management workshop process have hitherto received scant academic attention. Additionally, literature has revealed that available information on workshop content is limited, leading to ineffective studies. There has also been a miscommunication among construction practitioners in relation to the quantity surveyor’s role in the workshop process. Following extensive research, a novel template has been created which identifies the content of each workshop session alongside the roles and responsibilities of the quantity surveyor (and other construction professionals) which can be used for educational purposes. Originality/value The literature revealed that scant academic and professional governing body(ies) attention has been paid to the education and training of future generations of quantity surveyors involved in value management. Specifically, there is limited applied case study evidence to investigate this phenomenon and, hence, the workshop curricular presents advance knowledge in this respect and provides a practical template solution.","[{""name"": ""Jack Spellacy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris J.

10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0068,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Effect of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (MSWI-BA) on the structural performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to concern with using municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (MSWI-BA) in concrete application. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams containing MSWI-BA was investigated. Four concrete mixes were used in this study. The control mix had a proportion of 1 (cement): 2 (fine aggregates): 4 (coarse aggregates) by weight. In the other three mixes, the fine aggregates were partially replaced with 20%, 40% and 60% MSWI-BA (by weight). The water to cement ratio was kept constant at 0.5 in all mixes. Concrete cubes and cylinders were prepared to determine some physical and mechanical properties of concrete, whereas RC beams were used for determining the structural performance. Findings There was an increase in compressive strength, tensile strength and the modulus of elasticity when 20% of fine aggregates were replaced with MSWI-BA. However, beyond 20% these properties were reduced. The load bearing capacity and deflection were the highest for the control beam and the beam with 20% MSWI-BA. Research limitations/implications The research conducted in this investigation used a specific type of MSWI-BA. The composition of the waste can vary from one plant to another and this presents one of the limitations. Practical implications The findings of this research indicate that MSWI-BA can partially substitute fine aggregate, thus reducing the impact of construction on the environment. Originality/value The MSWI-BA used in this research differs from other types as the waste papers and cartons are removed from the waste and used to produce other products. Therefore, this study is considered original as it examines MSWI-BA with different properties for use in construction.","[{""name"": ""Jamal Khatib"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Jahami"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adel El Kordi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Sonebi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zeinab Malek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rayan Elchamaa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sarah Dakkour"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105356"", ""10.1520/C0496_C0496M-17"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2020.03.155"", ""10.1520/C0138_C0138M-17A"", ""10.3390/buildings11020067"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2019.01.025"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121752"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3560342"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.07.011"", ""10.18720/MCE.91.7"", ""10.54729/2959-331X.1017"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101491"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.11.063"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2013.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2020.07.527"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02783"", ""10.14419/ijet.v7i4.20.25860"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2020.103814"", ""10.1016/s0008-8846(03)00212-6"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.04.014"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120890""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0174,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Economic analysis of rehabilitation approaches for water distribution networks: comparative study between Egypt and Malaysia,"Purpose Sustainable water management has been a trending goal in the past decade. Non-revenue water (NRW) is one form of water loss that should be addressed to reach water sustainability. While rehabilitating water distribution networks (WDNs) is one way to decrease NRW, the process is often delayed owing to cost. Therefore, it is essential to provide decision-makers with cost-effective approaches to optimize WDN rehabilitation. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of approaches for rehabilitating WDN from developing countries’ perspectives. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was first conducted to identify different WDN rehabilitation methods and techniques to develop the questionnaire survey. This is followed by collecting questionnaire survey data in Malaysia and Egypt on the cost and effectiveness of the WDN rehabilitation methods and techniques. A total of 176 respondents were collected, 109 from Malaysia and 67 from Egypt. Then, the data were analyzed using mean score ranking with normalization technique and agreement analysis. Findings The results from the data analysis show that the cost-effective approaches are “programming,” “simulation,” “digital twin” and “supervisory control and data acquisition.” Additionally, the data from Malaysia suggest two additional cost-effective approaches: “zoning network” and “genetic algorithm.” Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper presents one of the first studies that laterally compares the cost-effectiveness of existing and potential WDN rehabilitation approaches between different countries. There is yet a study that compared these WDN rehabilitation approaches. This comparison which is developed depending on the systematic review could be a reference for future studies or surveys which could be done on different countries in the future. The main findings of this paper can be a useful reference for decision-makers, especially those from middle-income countries, when looking into approaches for WDN rehabilitation. A better WDN rehabilitation supports NRW reduction, moving towards sustainable water management.","[{""name"": ""Abdelrahman M. Farouk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rahimi A.

10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0432,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Critical review of emotional intelligence research studies in the construction industry,"Purpose Even though emotional intelligence (EI) is reported to have many benefits, yet it remains mainly unexplored in the construction industry. This paper aims to present a critical review of EI research in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach Search of literature was conducted by using Scopus engine. Relevant keywords were used to discover 146 publications. The titles, abstracts, keywords and full texts of the publications were examined to finally select 48 publications that were relevant. Scientometric analysis was undertaken with the aid of VOSViewer. Content analysis systematically reviewed the key themes. Findings The five topmost countries conducting research into EI in the construction industry are UK, Australia and the USA. The most influential authors in construction EI research are Goleman, D., Salovey, P. and Mayer, J.D. The significant impact of EI on leadership in the construction industry were that EI boosted transformational leadership style and EI influenced use of management-by-exception active style by construction leaders.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2020-0037,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Analysing the causes of corruption in the Malaysian construction industry,"PurposeCorruption continues to be a pervasive stain on the construction industry in developing countries worldwide, jeopardising project performance and with wide-ranging negative implications for all facets of society. As such, this study aims to identify and analyse the causes of corruption in the construction sector of an emerging economy such as Malaysia, as it is crucial to uncover the specific facilitating factors involved to devise effective counter strategies.Design/methodology/approachFollowing a detailed literature review, 18 causes of corruption are identified. The results of an opinion survey within the Malaysian construction industry are further reported to rank and analyse the causes. The factor analysis technique is then applied to uncover the principal factors involved.FindingsThe results indicate that all the considered causes are perceived to be significant, with the most critical causes being avarice, relationships between parties, lack of ethical standards, an intense competitive nature and the involvement of a large amount of money. A factor analysis reveals four major causal dimensions of these causes, comprising the unique nature of the construction industry and the extensive competition involved; unscrupulous leadership, culture and corruption perception; a flawed legal system and lack of accountability; and ineffective enforcement and an inefficient official bureaucracy.Research limitations/implicationsThe study presents the Malaysian construction industry’s view of the causes of corruption. Therefore, the arguments made in the study are influenced by the social, economic and cultural settings of Malaysia, which may limit generalisation of the findings.Practical implicationsThis paper helps stakeholders understand the root causes and underlying dimensions of corruption in the construction industry, especially in Malaysia. Recommendations for changing cultures that may be conducive to corrupt practices, and anti-corruption measures, are suggested based on the findings of the research.Originality/valueThese findings can guide practitioners and researchers in addressing the impediments that give rise to the vulnerability of the construction industry to corrupt practices and understanding the “red flags” in project delivery.","[{""name"": ""Jeffrey Boon Hui Yap"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kai Yee Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Skitmore"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/13590790910993753"", ""10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.341"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2007)133:2(84)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000555"", ""10.1080/13602381.2019.1629187"", ""10.1080/01446190701225707"", ""10.1080/01446193.2012.711909"", ""10.1504/IJPOM.2015.068003"", ""10.1093/pubmed/fdi031"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2015-0034"", ""10.1007/s10551-008-9872-3"", ""10.1177/8756972818770587"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1532-6748(2009)9:3(105)"", ""10.1108/ECAM-02-2017-0042"", ""10.1080/01446190903394541"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0005"", ""10.1007/s11948-012-9356-9"", ""10.1108/IJoEM-06-2015-0118"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1532-6748(2009)9:3(131)"", ""10.1080/09613211003665125"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000263"", ""10.1080/01441640802075760"", ""10.1680/cien.11.00007"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1532-6748(2009)9:3(112)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000300"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000886"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.09.010"", ""10.1093/ijpor/edp058"", ""10.1080/15623599.2013.10773211"", ""10.1023/A:1022624222048"", ""10.2307/1957086"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-10-2013-0042"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000745"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.040"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1033816"", ""10.1108/17538371011036563"", ""10.1007/s11948-017-0002-4"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2017-0137"", ""10.1080/014461999371646"", ""10.1016/S0378-4266(02)00197-8"", ""10.1002/pad.1648"", ""10.1108/14691930910922978"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1998)124:2(155)"", ""10.1680/jfoen.17.00013"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:9(729)"", ""10.1080/01446193.2010.549138"", ""10.1080/01446193.2011.654128"", ""10.2307/3867585"", ""10.1080/0144619032000122177"", ""10.1108/09699980310466596"", ""10.1353/jod.2018.0001"", ""10.1080/13602381.2019.1589769"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2017-0067"", ""10.1108/IJHMA-08-2017-0069"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001456"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000709"", ""10.1080/09537287.2018.1448127"", ""10.1080/014461900370997"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000479""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0264,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A confirmatory factor analysis of the challenges of effective management of construction workforce in South Africa,"Purpose The South African construction industry (SACI) is a huge employer of labour as the industry depends mostly on human resources to carry out its activities. However, the industry has also been noted for its poor workforce management and lack of attention to human resource management (HRM) issues. Therefore, this study aims to assess the challenges facing the effective management of the construction workforce in South Africa with a view to improving HRM activities in the industry and improve overall service delivery through an effectively managed workforce. Design/methodology/approach A pragmatic philosophical view using a mixed-method research design was adopted. The study’s qualitative strand was achieved through a Delphi, whilst the quantitative strand was achieved through a questionnaire survey. In addition, descriptive and inferential statistics such as mean item score, Kruskal-Wallis H-test, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were adopted for data analysis. Findings With high reliability, construct validity and model fit indices, the study found that for effective HRM to be attained within construction organisations, careful attention must be given to issues surrounding the nature of the industry, unhealthy working environment, employee-related issues, diversity and working condition in the industry. Originality/value Whilst several studies have been conducted on HRM, there is a lack of studies on the major challenges facing effective HRM in the SACI. The findings also offer future research studies a good theoretical platform to build upon.","[{""name"": ""Lerato Millicent Aghimien"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chimay J.

10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0227,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Selecting a proper construction system in small and medium mass housing projects, considering success criteria and construction volume and height","Purpose As the population grows, one of the major global crises is the management of human settlement. A proper solution to deal with this issue is mass housing. Given the variable needs in these projects, two constraints of height and volume of construction play an essential role in fulfilling success criteria. Hence, this paper aims to choose the most appropriate building method to satisfy time, cost, quality and safety factors considering the volume and height of construction. Design/methodology/approach In this research, the proper construction methods in mass housing projects in two volumes of up to 1000 (small) and 1000-3000 (medium) residential units in three ranges of the height of 5, 5-10, and higher than ten floors were determined with a focus on the success criteria based on real experiences through questionnaires and interviews. Findings The results show that steel bolt and nut and tunnel framework systems in higher than five-floor building projects act better than other methods, while in up to five-floor building projects, LSF saves time and cost and steel bolt and nut provides higher quality and safety. Originality/value Given the extent of work, the results of this research can be considered as a benchmark in the mass housing industry.","[{""name"": ""Esmatullah Noorzai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mahmood Golabchi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.10.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000555"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000254"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2017.03.005"", ""10.1007/s42107-018-0009-4"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000091"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.094"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.235"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2018.04.015"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.10.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000110"", ""10.1080/14616718.2016.1248606"", ""10.1080/14616718.2016.1248608"", ""10.1080/17452007.2013.802979"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.171"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.030"", ""10.1080/01446190802259043"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2008.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.108"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000824"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0001972"", ""10.1080/19491247.2017.1298366"", ""10.1002/tal.1415"", ""10.1016/j.cad.2014.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.11.1980"", ""10.1109/ICCRD.2010.132."", ""10.3846/jeelm.2010.14"", ""10.5772/intechopen.81673."", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.06.017"", ""10.1080/19491247.2017.1417767"", ""10.1002/tal.311"", ""10.1080/14616718.2016.1219648"", ""10.1080/09613210601058139"", ""10.18178/ijscer.5.1.74-79"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000236"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.10.033"", ""10.1080/19491247.2016.1265268"", ""10.1016/j.jcsr.2014.02.006"", ""10.3390/buildings2030245"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.12.012"", ""10.1016/j.tws.2018.04.019"", ""10.3846/13923730.2007.9636447"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.11.072"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2003)129:5(475)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2005)131:6(723)"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2004.03.013"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.09.028"", ""10.22260/ISARC2004/0003."", ""10.1111/1467-8462.12174"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.07.200"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.190""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-07-2021-0384,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Modelling construction 4.0 as a vaccine for ensuring construction supply chain resilience amid COVID-19 pandemic,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic came with a lot of stress, uncertainty and disruption for managing the construction supply chain (CSC). The disruption in return caused weak resilience of CSC activities. Unfortunately, the existing models for managing CSC focus on preparedness and recovery while neglecting the visibility perspective of resilience CSC. Towards creating a resilience CSC, this study modelled construction 4.0 as the vaccine for supply chain resilience in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A survey questionnaire was used to collect data randomly from construction stakeholders. The questionnaire was analysed with a structural equation model analysis using SmartPLS while conducting tests such as path coefficient analysis, discriminant analysis and importance-performance analysis. Findings This study discovered that construction 4.0 is a significant tool and vaccine for ensuring visibility, recovery and adaptation within the supply chain. Construction 4.0 will function as a vaccine for ensuring resilience because of its capacity to optimise CSC management by introducing an evidence-based management approach and less dependent on implicit knowledge. Towards reaping the full potential of construction 4.0, it should be adopted as a moderating variable. Research limitations/implications The research is limited by the use of a single methodology (quantitative) without including a qualitative method to understand better and explore the impact of construction 4.0 on CSC resilience. The qualitative part can be carried out by conducting interviews targeted at construction stakeholders. Practical implications In spite of the limitations, the findings of this study contributed to building a more responsive and resilient CSC during the pandemic period.

10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0159,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Evaluation of multi-level intervention strategies for a psychologically healthy construction workplace in Nigeria,"PurposeThe need to improve the mental health of construction personnel has increased owing to high rates of mental health problems. Hence, a proper evaluation of a mix of implementable intervention strategies in the workplace will assist in achieving good mental health. Although there are recommendations in occupational health literature on strategies that can be adopted, it is unknown how they fit appropriately into the construction industry. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the mix of strategies for the construction industry and their criticality.Design/methodology/approachDrawing from the context of developing countries with Nigeria as a case study, data was collected using the quantitative technique. A questionnaire survey consisting of 31 intervention strategies was administered to a purposive sample of 45 experts in the Nigerian construction industry. The data collected was analyzed using mean score analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation.FindingsThe study revealed that strategies focused on boosting employee morale and engagement and interpersonal relationship offer higher chances of improving mental health among construction personnel. The study showed that implementing job crafting and sculpting may benefit the industry. The analysis showed that the overall criticality of the intervention strategies to the Nigerian construction workplace is high, suggesting that if implemented, the mental health of construction personnel can be improved.Originality/valueThe study provides an initial understanding of the most critical multi-level intervention strategies to enhance good mental health among construction personnel in Nigeria and the global construction industry. These findings serve as a guide to policymakers and advocate the implementation of strategies to adopt for a psychologically healthy construction workplace in developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Janet Mayowa Nwaogu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert P.C.

10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0540,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Government pandemic response strategies for AEC enterprises: lessons from COVID-19,"Purpose Policymakers are developing government-level pandemic response strategies (GPRS) to assist architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) enterprises. However, the effectiveness of the GPRS has not been assessed. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the interrelationships between GPRS and AEC enterprises. To achieve that aim, the study objectives are to compare GPRS effectiveness between small-medium and large AEC enterprises, develop groupings to categorize interrelated GPRS and evaluate the effectiveness of the GPRS and interrelated constructs. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews with 40 AEC industry professionals were carried out, generating 22 GPRS. Then, questionnaire survey data was collected among AEC professionals. In total, 114 valid survey answers were received and analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis H test, normalized mean analysis, factor analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation. Findings Small-medium enterprises have four distinct critical GPRS: “form a special task force to provide support in maneuvering COVID-19,” “provide infrastructure investment budgets to local governments,” “develop employee assistance programs that fit all types of working groups” and “diversify existing supply chain.” Large enterprises have two distinct critical GPRS: “provide help in digitalizing existing construction projects” and “mandate COVID-19 as force majeure.” Eighteen GPRS can be categorized into the following five constructs: “market stability and financial aid,” “enterprise capability management,” “supply chain improvement,” “law and policy resources” and “information and workforce management.” The former two constructs are more effective than other GPRS constructs. Originality/value This is the first paper that evaluates the effectiveness of GPRS for AEC enterprises, providing new evidence to policymakers for well-informed decision-making in developing pandemic response strategies.","[{""name"": ""Salma Husna Zamani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rahimi A.

The second and third part of the study investigates the compaction behaviour and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of clayey soil on addition of optimum amount of various materials alone and in combination with each other. Finally, the micro-structural behaviour of addition of optimum percentages of lime, WFS and molasses using Scanning electron microscopic technique has been discussed.FindingsThe laboratory results revealed that the addition of optimum content of lime along with WFS and molasses reduced DFS and plasticity index and increased maximum dry density and UCS values. The microstructural behaviour showed that the presence of lime and molasses filled the voids present in the soil and the addition of WFS helped in providing compact structure, thus improving the strength characteristics.Practical implicationsThe study will be helpful in designing low-cost pavement designs for rural roads.Social implicationsThe adverse effect of waste materials on environment may be solved by using them in improving the strength characteristics of clayey soils, thereby providing healthy environment to living beings.Originality/valueThe study will help to provide low-cost methods to improve strength characteristics of clayey soil along with the use of waste materials; the disposal of whose is a challenging task.","[{""name"": ""Avinash Bhardwaj"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ravi Kumar Sharma"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.clay.2010.07.023"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2004)130:7(717)"", ""10.1002/clen.201200043"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01665-4_71"", ""10.1007/s12665-009-0256-5"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2003)129:7(590)"", ""10.1080/10298436.2012.746688"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0001923"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2005.06.007"", ""10.1007/s10706-011-9415-z"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2004)130:2(153)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1988)114:2(150)"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2004.02.019"", ""10.1007/s10064-011-0410-7"", ""10.1016/j.cscm.2017.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.trgeo.2019.100255"", ""10.1016/0360-1323(86)90008-9"", ""10.1007/s12665-015-4796-6"", ""10.1007/s41062-019-0216-1"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2008)20:8(509)"", ""10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.11.008"", ""10.1071/EA00113"", ""10.2136/sssaj2000.641268x"", ""10.51983/ajeat-2018.7.1.857"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2002)14:6(447)""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2020-0279,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A hub location model in the sustainable supply chain considering customer segmentation,"Purpose This paper aims to study the hub transportation system in supply chain networks which would contribute to reducing costs and environmental pollution, as well as to economic development and social responsibility. As not all customers tend to buy green products, several customer groups should be considered in terms of need type. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, a multi-objective hub location problem is developed for designing a sustainable supply chain network based on customer segmentation. It deals with the aspects of economic (cost reduction), environment (minimizing greenhouse gas emissions by the transport sector) and social responsibility (creating employment and community development). The epsilon-constraint method and augmented epsilon-constraint (AEC) method are used to solve the small-sized instances of this multi-objective problem. Due to the non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness of this problem, two non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO) metaheuristic algorithms are also applied to tackle the large-sized instances of this problem. Findings As expected, the AEC method is able to provide better Pareto solutions according to the goals of the decision-makers. The Taguchi method was used for setting the parameters of the two metaheuristic algorithms. Considering the meaningful difference, the MOGWO algorithm outperforms the NSGA-II algorithm according to the rate of achievement to two objectives simultaneously and the spread of non-dominance solutions indexes. Regarding the other indexes, there was no meaningful difference between the performance of the two algorithms. Practical implications The model of this research provides a comprehensive solution for supply chain companies that want to achieve a rational balance between the three aspects of sustainability. Originality/value The importance of considering customer diversity on the one hand and saving on hub transportation costs, on the other hand, triggered us to propose a hub location model for designing a sustainable supply chain network based on customer segmentation.","[{""name"": ""Ali Heidari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Din Mohammad Imani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammad Khalilzadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.asoc.2011.02.022"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.164"", ""10.1016/j.apm.2012.09.039"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2015.12.010"", ""10.1021/ie101921y"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.02.063"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2013.12.032"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.12.004"", ""10.1109/TEM.2012.2211105"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2012.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2015.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2013.01.012"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2015.07.038"", ""10.3934/jimo.2007.3.51"", ""10.1007/s00500-018-03718-1"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2017.01.017"", ""10.1016/j.amc.2009.03.037"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2013.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2017.07.039"", ""10.1007/s11067-011-9169-4"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.10.028"", ""10.1016/j.fss.2012.04.010"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2014.04.001"", ""10.5267/j.ijiec.2014.10.001."", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.245"", ""10.1080/21681015.2017.1422039"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.053"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2017.04.038"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2007.00202.x"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2003.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2013.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.138"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2017.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.08.037""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Design/methodology/approach The preliminary experiments were conducted using nickel-based powder as interface material using a domestic microwave oven at a frequency of 2.45 GHz and 900 W power for 720 s. The processed joint was metallurgically characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Field emission scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical characterization was done by means of tensile and Vickers’ microhardness testing to check the hardness and strength of the joint. Findings The metallurgical study revealed that the microstructure and formation of numerous phases of Fe2Si3 accompanied by chromium and nickel carbides. The average hardness of 359 Hv at the center of the joint and 637 Hv around the boundaries of the joint was observed. The tensile strength of the joint was observed to 471 MPa with an elongation of 9.02%. The worn surface of the joint signifies the presence of plastic deformation and it was limited due to the presence of harder phases such as Ni3Si and Ni3C. Research limitations/implications The concept of microwave joining of metals is a very challenging task as the temperature can not be controlled in the inert atmosphere of the microwave. It has been also observed that at certain elevated temperatures, the material starts absorbing the microwaves; which is unknown. So, a more intensive study is required to overcome these kinds of limitations. Practical implications MHH technique can be used to process different materials such as ceramics, composites and polymers. SS-430 joined by microwave heating is highly corrosion resistive and has wide applications in refrigerators cabinet panels, dishwasher linings, chimney liners, lashing wires, etc. Originality/value As of the author’s best knowledge, no work has been reported on the joining of SS-430 which has huge potential in the industries. Also, no work has been reported on the characterization of microwave joined SS-430.","[{""name"": ""Nalin Somani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Navjot Singh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nitin Kumar Gupta"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jmapro.2015.02.002"", ""10.1051/matecconf/20165703001"", ""10.1016/j.matchar.2014.02.005"", ""10.1146/annurev.ms.26.080196.001503"", ""10.1016/S0921-5093(00)00768-1"", ""10.1016/j.jmapro.2017.04.028"", ""10.1080/1023697X.2001.10667855"", ""10.1109/TMTT.2002.989981"", ""10.1038/21390"", ""10.2298/SOS0302049S"", ""10.1177/2041297510393451"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2011.01.023"", ""10.1016/j.jmapro.2011.03.001"", ""10.1016/S1359-835X(99)00020-2""]","['Engineering', 'Chemistry']","['Organic Chemistry', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0703 化学', 0.7525), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7384)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The objectives are to reveal those hindrances to the wider usage of ART so that the obstacles can be tackled and overcome. Design/methodology/approach A survey of construction professionals involved in the built environment was sent well-structured questionnaires in the study area. The professionals involved are quantity surveyors, architects, engineers, project managers and builders. Convenience sampling techniques were used in selecting those professionals. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in analyzing the retrieved data. Findings The most ranked obstacles in adopting augmented realities are lack of technological awareness, difficulty in ease of ART system set up, the unwillingness of government and private bodies to invest in augmented reality research, lack of repository database, lack of portability for ART equipment system. The findings also revealed the difference in the opinions of professionals among the variables. The results showed that there is a significant difference in the opinions of respondents regarding 6 of the identified 15 variables. Originality/value The study gives deep insight into possible hindrances in the use of emerging technologies such as ART in construction.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0070,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Barriers to integrating lean construction and integrated project delivery (IPD) on construction megaprojects towards the global integrated delivery (GID) in multinational organisations: lean IPD&GID transformative initiatives,"PurposeThe architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry encounter substantial risks and challenges in its evolution towards sustainable development. International businesses, multinational AEC organisations, technical professionals, project and portfolio management organisations face global connectivity challenges between business units, especially during the outbreak of novel coronavirus pandemic, to manage construction megaprojects (CMPs). That raises the need to manage global connectivity as a main strategic goal of global organisations. This paper aims to investigate barriers to integrating lean construction (LC) practices and integrated project delivery (IPD) on CMPs towards the global integrated delivery (GID) transformative initiatives and develop future of work (FOW) global initiatives in contemporary multinational AEC organisations.Design/methodology/approachA two-stage quantitative and qualitative research approach is adopted. The qualitative research methodology consists of a literature review to appraise barriers to integrating LeanIPD&amp;GID on CMPs. Barriers are arranged into six-factor clusters (FCs), with a conceptualisation of LeanIPD&amp;GID, GID strategy placements and FOW global initiatives with multiple validations. This analysis also involved semi-structured interviews and focus group techniques. Stage two consisted of an empirical questionnaire survey that shaped the foundation of analysis and findings of 230 respondents from 23 countries with extensive cosmopolitan experience in the construction of megaprojects. The survey examined a set of 28 barriers to integrating LeanIPD&amp;GID on CMPs resulting from a detailed analysis of extant literature after validation. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were exploited for data analysis, percentage scoring analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and eigenvalues were used to elaborate on clustered factors.FindingsThe research conceptualised LeanIPD&amp;GID principles and proposed GID strategy placements for LeanIPD&amp;GID transformative initiatives and FOW global initiatives. It concluded that the most significant barriers to integration of LeanIPD&amp;GID on CMPs are “lack of mandatory building information modelling (BIM) and LC industry standards and regulations by governments”, “lack of involvement and support of governments”, “high costs of BIM software licenses”, “resistance of industry to change from traditional working practices” and “high initial investment in staff training costs of BIM”. PCA revealed the most significant FCs are “education and knowledge-related barriers”, “project objectives-related barriers” and “attitude-related barriers”. Awareness of BIM in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is higher than LC and LC awareness is higher than IPD knowledge. Whilst BIM adoption in the MENA region is higher than LC; the second is still taking its first steps, whilst IPD has little implementation. LeanBIM is slightly integrated, whilst LeanIPD integration is almost not present.Originality/valueThe research findings, conclusion and recommendation and proposed GID strategy placements for LeanIPD&amp;GID transformative initiatives to integrating LeanIPD&amp;GID on CMPs. This will allow project key stakeholders to place emphasis on tackling LeanIPD&amp;GID barriers identified in this research and commence GID strategies. The study has provided effective practical strategies for enhancing the integration of LeanIPD&amp;GID transformative initiatives on CMPs.","[{""name"": ""Martin Evans"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Farrell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emad Elbeltagi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Helen Dion"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2015.08.009"", ""10.1080/17452007.2016.1183474"", ""10.1080/17452007.2018.1467828"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000390"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000193"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.08.019"", ""10.1108/10878571011042096"", ""10.1177/1094428105275376"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.11.649"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.10.014"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100764"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.03.006"", ""10.1007/BF02310555"", ""10.1080/09537287.2019.1675914"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2015-0053"", ""10.1080/00207543.2014.933909"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00115-1"", ""10.1002/pmj.21409"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.083"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000378"", ""10.1108/17538370910930545"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.002"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-05-2018-0084"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.09.005"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001169"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2000.t01-1-01567.x"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.171"", ""10.1680/feng.14.00005"", ""10.1108/14635771011036357"", ""10.1108/14635771011036320"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001408"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001597"", ""10.1177/1094428106296642"", ""10.1108/10878570910986452"", ""10.1108/14720700810899112"", ""10.1080/00207543.2019.1566659"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001394"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2018.03.033"", ""10.1002/sd.1925"", ""10.1108/BIJ-05-2018-0138"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2019.09.001"", ""10.3846/13923730.2017.1374301"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.06.017"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000505"", ""10.2307/20031973"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2014-0067"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.763999"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000102"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000203"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.030"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103086"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119213"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.141"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-102220-7.00006-6"", ""10.1080/09537287.2017.1412522"", ""10.1108/BIJ-07-2014-0071"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2016-0027"", ""10.1080/09537287.2019.1578905"", ""10.1080/15623599.2017.1382083"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000176"", ""10.1080/09537287.2017.1407005""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0192,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Government policy as a key moderator to contractors' risk attitudes among Malaysian construction companies,"PurposeThe main parties in construction projects are the engineers, clients, architects, contractors, material suppliers, and consultants such as the project managers. They play the most important roles in implementing construction projects, and their activities have a significant impact on their risk attitudes during the execution of projects. Because each participant has their particular interests, by proprietary information, each participant is driven to achieve maximum benefit, which can result in improper behaviour concerning each other. The risk in this situation is that there would be a moral hazard and adverse selection based on information asymmetry among principal construction participants especially contractors; this outcome is called risk attitudes. Behaviour is affected by various risk factors and the successful implementation of construction projects depends on effective management of the key risk factors part of which is a personal factor. The purpose of this paper is to identify the critical factors affecting contractors’ risk attitudes among Malaysian construction companies with the moderating role of government policy. Organizational control theory and expected utility theory were used to develop the theoretical framework. The study investigated G7 contractors in the Malaysian construction industry. Data were collected through the use of a questionnaire.Design/methodology/approachThe research analysis was based on structural equation modelling (SEM), and the research model was ascertained through the Smart PLS 3.0 software (Ringleet al., 2012). Partial least square-SEM is an appropriate analysis that was used to assess the results in the current research because its algorithm permits the unrestricted computation of cause-effect relationship models that use both reflective and formative measurement models. This study uses the quantitative method to identify the individual factors influencing contractors’ risk attitude and the moderating role of government policy among construction companies in Malaysia. This study also focussed on the G7 contractors operating in the Malaysia construction industry that specializes in building, bridge and road construction projects. The duration of the data collection was between two and three weeks. The questionnaire was prepared both in Malay and English languages to allow the respondents to respond most conveniently. Before the copies of the questionnaire were distributed, the selected contractors’ committees were duly informed about the details of the survey procedures. The adopted Likert scale was originally a five-point scale that ranges from “very low” to “very high” with “low or high” in between.FindingsThe result of this study moderately supports the hypothesized relationships proposed in the theoretical model. In particular, the results recommended that personal factors that affect risk attitudes (working experience, emotional intelligence, professional competence and physical health) have a significant relation with contractors’ risk attitudes in the construction companies in Malaysia. Also, it has been found that government policy (rules and regulations) are important determinants of risk attitudes.Research limitations/implicationsThe study focussed on individual factors affecting contractors’ risk attitudes in the construction company’s in Malaysia. Therefore, the dimensions of factors affecting risk attitudes can be used in another aspect of construction projects such as management factors, economic factors and technical factors. Therefore, further research might investigate other grades of Malaysian construction companies apart from Grade 7 contractors to know if there is a similarity in the results; other grades of the contractors might have potential positive contributions to the construction industry as well.Practical implicationsWith consider to the practical, the current research findings have several contributions for the contractors and project managers. The research results demonstrate that government policy plays an important role in the construction industry and organizational support will also help contractors to control their attitudes in working place. Individual factor has a direct relationship with contractor risk attitudes (CRA), project managers must ensure that the government policy has an impact in all their workers and offered is competitive, fair and by their employees’ contribution. Apart from that managers should also focus on organizational goals especially in managing professional and skilled contractors in the companies. Employees who perceived their employers as uncaring or not supporting their needs and well-being may not be happy working with the organization and the tendency for them to change their attitudes towards risk will be high.Social implicationsThis study also contributes knowledge by lending empirical support to the organizational control theory and expected utility theory system’s effect on CRA and confirming that changing one individual attitude will change the whole equilibrium. This is useful to aid in further synthesis of organizational control theory and expected utility theory in construction companies.Originality/valueThis study is the first attempt at evaluating the direct and moderating effect relationships among individual factor affecting risk attitudes, government policy and CRA in Malaysian construction companies. These findings also prop up the applicability of the organizational control theory and expected utility theory within the context of construction companies in Malaysia. Also, this study contributed to the literature on psychology by subjective (psychological) measures of individuals’ behaviour and decisions. In the CRA literature, there has been much discussion on personal characteristics to understand behaviours such as attitudes of a contractor towards risk and morals.","[{""name"": ""Moshood D.

While BIM is trending globally, its implementation in post-conflict low-income economies is still limited. The purpose of this paper is to identify the critical factors for implementing BIM in a post-conflict low-income economy, using Afghanistan as a case study. Design/methodology/approach This study identifies potential affecting factors for BIM implementation through reviewing existing literature and interviewing AEC professionals in Afghanistan. Then, the factors are inserted into a questionnaire survey and disseminated with Afghanistan’s AEC practitioners. The collected data was analyzed to determine the critical factors. Also, the underlying relationships between the critical factors were established through factor analysis. Findings A total of 11 critical factors are affecting BIM implementation in Afghanistan. From those, nine factors can be grouped into the following three components: technological, environmental and organizational. Two factors, “cost-benefit of implementing BIM” and “market demand for BIM,” are recurring in low- and middle-income economies. Conversely, the “presence of appropriate projects to implement BIM” is the unique critical factor for Afghanistan that might affect other post-conflict low-income economies.

10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0054,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic: an exploration of the strategies adopted by construction firms,"Purpose The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has tested the resilience of the construction industry, putting the safety of workers and overall businesses at risk. This study aims to explore the different strategies adopted by construction companies to protect the health and well-being of employees, security of the construction sites and projects, and keep the overall business operational amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach A preliminary study that involves field study and survey research was used to collect data for the study. The results from the preliminary analysis served as inputs for constructing the questionnaire, which was analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis. Findings The results reveal that the key underlying measures put in place by construction businesses include restricted site access, support bubbling of office and site staff, enhanced hygiene and social distancing protocol, contract risk identification and mitigation, self-isolation measures and heightened construction site safety. Along with a further discussion of the underlying measures, the top-rated strategies that were adopted by construction firms are also discussed in the paper. Originality/value As many construction companies remained opened handling essential projects amid the pandemic, the study presents the effective and efficient strategies that were used in plowing through the trying times. This study provides the opportunity for construction companies that escaped the early impacts of Covid-19 due to site closure and policymakers to learn from the strategies adopted by construction companies that were operational amid the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Babatunde A.

10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0257,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Attributable indicators for measuring the level of greenness of cities in developing countries: lessons from Ghana,"Purpose The advances in green city growth are widely discussed in extant literature. The benefits of green cities to urban development in recent discussions of sustainability and sustainable development are well documented and cannot be overemphasised. Although a growing study on green building development in developing countries has been advanced in literature, there is a paucity of studies that explore green cities in developing countries. Moreover, evidence of studies that have focussed on green cities development in Ghana is lacking. Because of this identified knowledge gap, the purpose of this study is to establish the indicators/attributes for measuring the level of greenness of cities in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify the indicators/attributes for measuring the level of greenness of cities in developing countries. This study has adopted the pragmatism as its undergirding research philosophy and the deductive research approach. In terms of methodological choice, quantitative research strategy was used to collect data from experts in sustainable urban development. The primary data retrieved from this study was analysed using descriptive statistics, relative importance index and one-sample t-test. The reliability and validity of this study were measured with the Cronbach’s alpha test. Findings This study established eight indicators for measuring green city development: air quality, water, sanitation, land use, health and safety, transportation, energy and building and construction. It was discovered that the development of green cities should enhance air quality, improve water production and supply, improve management in sanitation, promote mixed and integrative land use, maintain the health and safety of city dwellers, reduce the demand for transportation and formalise public transport, adopt renewable and efficient energy technologies and promote sustainable construction and green buildings. These indicators are key to policymaking and implementation of green cities development. Research limitations/implications This study focusses primarily on Ghana; however, the findings of this study do not limit the generalisability, as it can be used as an example for other developing countries. Practical implications Theoretically, this study adopted quantitative indicators that are reproducible in another geographical context. This study contributively adds to the discourse on sustainability, especially in Ghana, and can be a source of reference to motivate others to conduct further research in related areas. The outcomes of this study will help the local government, policymakers, city stakeholders and industry expertise to gain insights of the overall indicators that underpin green city development. Originality/value This paper attempts to posit in literature the foremost appraisal of green city indicators adaptive in Ghana, which could motivate other developing countries to develop their own green cities.","[{""name"": ""De-Graft Owusu-Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caleb Debrah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eric Oduro-Ofori"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Prince Antwi-Afari"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/SASBE-02-2019-0017"", ""10.1136/bmj.331.7521.903"", ""10.21625/resourceedings.v2i1.452"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.019"", ""10.1370/afm.111"", ""10.3390/su10062031"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.07.005"", ""10.1146/annurev-environ-072809-101747"", ""10.1108/09600031111101420"", ""10.1108/S0733-558X(2011)0000032005"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2004.09.043"", ""10.1596/29364"", ""10.1111/j.1756-8765.2011.01150.x"", ""10.1177/0956247810392270"", ""10.1108/JOPP-11-2019-0075"", ""10.5772/intechopen.84520"", ""10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.010"", ""10.5539/jms.v5n4p104"", ""10.1080/13645570701401305"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-26528-1_2"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2018-0001"", ""10.1016/j.ijsbe.2017.03.006"", ""10.3303/CET1863026"", ""10.1007/978-94-6351-086-8_2"", ""10.2148/benv.29.2.94.54467"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd""]","['Engineering', 'Health Professions', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Speech and Hearing', 'Building and Construction', 'Marketing']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0453,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,An appraisal of generic skills for Nigerian built environment professionals in workplace: the unexplored approach,"Purpose Research shows that employers are demanding generic skills from employees to complement disciplinary expertise. Evidence shows that majority of the higher institutions are struggling to meet this demand, especially in developing nations. Hence, these skills may be acquired while in the workplace through training and retraining. Studies concerning the Nigerian built environment professionals (BEP) generic skills in the workplace are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate Nigeria’s BEP generic skills in the workplace via an unexplored mechanism and proffer feasible policy solutions that can improve BEP generic skills development. Design/methodology/approach The views of BEP were collated via a phenomenology type of qualitative research design across two major Nigerian cities where construction activities are soaring. Virtual interviews were conducted for 20 selected BEP. Data saturation was accomplished and the emerged three themes were analysed through a thematic analysis. Findings Findings show that generic skills enhance value for money in construction project delivery. But many of these professionals do not possess these skills in their daily operations. This has raised concerns about the present curriculum for preparing the built environment graduates in today’s profession. Findings categorised the hindrances into employers related-hindrances and employees related-hindrances in Nigeria’s BEP context. Research limitations/implications This study is confined to the relevance and hindrances of the generic skills for Nigerian BEP, and proffer feasible policies to promote generic skills in the workplace via a qualitative approach. Future study is needed to investigate the role of the various professional Institutes within Nigeria’s built environment in promoting generic skills. Practical implications The paper advanced key stakeholders including BEP Institutes and regulatory bodies to redirect their continuing professional development towards developing professional values and identities as a trajectory to promote the growth of BEP generic skills in the workplace. Originality/value The proposed framework can be used to promote the implementation of generic skills for BEP across all levels. This would assist and stir up policymakers and other stakeholders in connection with the implementation of generic skills within the BEP.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Ebekozien"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wellington Didibhuku Didibhuku Thwala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marvelous Isibor Aigbedion"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iliye Faith Ogbaini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/ARA-02-2019-0044"", ""10.1007/s11125-011-9216-4"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0162"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2017-0081"", ""10.1109/TE.2020.3034958"", ""10.1108/00400911211210323"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2012-0020"", ""10.1080/09639280601011040"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.776"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1196351"", ""10.1080/02589001.2020.1758304"", ""10.1080/13563475.2020.1779671"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2021.102803"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2015-0075"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2012-0077"", ""10.1080/03075079.2010.527935"", ""10.1111/j.1467-629X.2007.00245.x"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0108"", ""10.1037/a0025741"", ""10.1108/17260530710746597"", ""10.1108/IJPPM-11-2018-0417"", ""10.12928/joves.v3i1.1754"", ""10.1111/j.1813-6982.2008.00152.x"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-04-2017-0026"", ""10.1108/02637471211273392"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2007)133:9(661)"", ""10.1080/17452759.2017.1326724""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

The purpose of this paper is to investigate critical success factors (CSFs) encountered by key construction stakeholders to enhance SM practices on mega construction projects (MCPs). Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey is carried out among the most important construction companies in Qatar. Three steps are used to finalize and evaluate the questionnaire before proceeding with the full survey, validity, pretesting and pilot study. Quantitative data analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Science software. Findings This paper identifies the key factors contributing to improving SM performance in MCPs; none of these is uncommon, but here they come together in a more integrative way. Research limitations/implications The limitations related to this research are briefly outlined as follows: the research was carried out in the State of Qatar. So, the findings are limited to the Qatari construction industry. The construction industry in Qatar is different from other countries where public projects have the priority to develop the infrastructure of the country prior to the world cup competition. The scope of this research is limited to MCPs. The impact of low awareness and knowledge of SM is not considered. However, the study is still reasonable and fortunately suitable to evaluate SM in MCPs. Practical implications Identifying these factors is expected to assist project participants in MCPs in improving projects’ performance and completing construction within the predefined time and cost. Originality/value This study makes a significant contribution through identifying the CSFs that lead to develop efficient SM in MCPs. Moreover, the research findings are important for project stakeholders, organizations, contractors, engineers and local authorities who implement SM in MCPs. Moreover, it will enhance the application of SM practices in construction megaprojects and allow project key stakeholders to place emphasis on tackling the crucial challenges identified in this research.","[{""name"": ""Ayman Mashali"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emad Elbeltagi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ibrahim Motawa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Elshikh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.09.007"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(02)00554-4"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000406"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.09.016"", ""10.1177/030630701003500305"", ""10.1080/08874417.2004.11647585"", ""10.1108/14637150110406768"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.07.009"", ""10.1080/15578771.2016.1276109"", ""10.54216/IJBES.030101"", ""10.1002/pmj.21409"", ""10.4324/9780429056765"", ""10.1080/17452007.2007.9684625"", ""10.1108/02635570010286131"", ""10.2307/259184"", ""10.1108/eb021230"", ""10.1080/14783360600750444"", ""10.4018/irmj.2003100104"", ""10.1080/10429247.2002.11415180"", ""10.1023/A:1016054904008"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.10.012"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001292"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(02)00549-0"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.08.007"", ""10.1016/S0925-5273(01)00183-9"", ""10.1108/14637150110392782"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.02.002"", ""10.1080/01446190701821810"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.09.010"", ""10.1080/21534764.2012.736204"", ""10.1177/026839620001500405"", ""10.1002/kpm.138"", ""10.1145/332051.332070"", ""10.1016/S0378-7206(03)00023-5"", ""10.1108/02689230210434871"", ""10.1108/17260530510815321"", ""10.1108/BIJ-04-2020-0169"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2015-0075"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2014-0012"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2018-0091""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

From time immemorial, Orthodox churches were erected in the most picturesque places – on high hills, steep banks, near rivers and lakes – so that the temple was reflected in the water surface. A typical example is the historical silhouette of the steep right bank of Kyiv, formed by many churches, cathedrals and monasteries located along the edge of the hilly shore. If temples in the urban environment were constrained by the conditions of dense quarterly development (the principal cathedrals and monasteries were an exception), then the peculiarity of the remote suburban monasteries – the hermitages – was precisely the creation of nature and architecture picturesque combination. At the monasteries, parks, gardens and flower beds were created, artificial lakes were arranged. During the domination of the atheistic ideology, temple construction was in decline, most of the cathedrals, churches and monasteries were destroyed or redesigned under the socialist functions of clubs, museums of atheism, schools and storages. The contemporary course in the creation of new Orthodox churches is aimed at restoring the lost sequence in the church building. In this case, particular attention is paid to the natural environment: churches are built in park areas, in forest parks, on the banks of lakes, surrounded by flower beds. The relevance of the study is explained by the presence in Ukraine of a large number of Orthodox churches – both architectural monuments and newly built, which are traditionally surrounded by gardens, parks and flower gardens as symbols of their non-earthly purpose, the image of the Garden of Eden. Therefore, during the restoration and new construction of such objects, it is necessary to understand the features of the сhurch landscape design, which has been formed and improved over the centuries.","[{""name"": ""Denys Chernyshev"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture""]}, {""name"": ""Yulia Ivashko"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture""]}, {""name"": ""Dominika Kuśnierz-Krupa"", ""affiliation"": [""Cracow University of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Andrii Dmytrenko"", ""affiliation"": [""National University “Yuri Kondratyuk Poltava Polytechnic”""]}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

Recycled aggregate (RA) is obtained from demolished concrete structures, laboratory crushed concrete, concrete waste at a ready mix concrete plant and the concrete made from RA is known as RA concrete. The purpose of this study is to apply multiple linear regressions (MLRs) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the mechanical properties, such as compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS) and split tensile strength (STS) of concrete at the age of 28 days curing made completely from the recycled coarse aggregate (RCA). Design/methodology/approach MLR and ANN are used to develop a prediction model. The model was developed in the training phase by using data from a previously published research study and a developed model was further tested by obtaining data from laboratory experiments. Findings ANN shows more accuracy than MLR with an R2-value of more than 0.8 in the training phase and 0.9 in a testing phase. The high R2-value indicates strong relation between the actual and predicted values of mechanical properties of RCA concrete. These models will help construction professionals to save their time and cost in predicting the mechanical properties of RCA concrete at 28 days of curing. Originality/value ANN with rectified linear unit transfer function and backpropagation algorithm for training is used to develop a prediction model. The outcome of this study is the prediction model for CS, FS and STS of concrete at 28 days of curing.","[{""name"": ""Suhas Vijay Patil"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K.

10.1108/JEDT-05-2019-0138,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Fuzzy probabilistic approach for risk assessment of BOT toll roads in Indian context,"Purpose The built-transfer and operate (BOT) toll model has been a common approach for highway construction in India. Due to large amount of investment, many stakeholders and long concession period, Indian BOT toll roads become susceptible to different risks. Risk assessment is one of the essential and difficult steps of risk management that enables professionals to quantify and analyze the risks that may hamper the BOT toll project performance in terms of cost, quality, safety and time. The purpose of this study is to identify and assess the risk factors by the fuzzy probabilistic model. Design/methodology/approach The comprehensive literature review has been carried out for identification of Indian BOT toll roads projects' risk factors. A structured questionnaire was prepared which was then filled by contractors, government officers, academicians, project managers and consultants. For risk assessment, a systematic quantitative-based fuzzy probabilistic model is proposed with the help of lab-view, as a risk assessment technique to simulate the impreciseness of human judgment and to improve the assessment accuracy. Findings The risk assessment is one of the difficult tasks because BOT toll roads have complex structure. In this study, total 71 risks have been identified and categorized under 14 risk factors on a basis of case studies of Indian toll roads and literature review. All risks have been assessed by the fuzzy probabilistic model by lab-view. The land acquisition is the most crucial risk of BOT toll roads project which is subsequently followed by construction time and cost over-run. Also, Indian BOT toll roads are facing the traffic shortfalls critically, which became a reason toward declination trend for investment in BOT toll projects by the private players. Other risks like political risks, contractual and social risk badly are affecting the project performance. Early risk identification and assessment can be beneficial for the project, which is required to prepare the risk response strategy before the project commencement. Originality/value This study throws light on comprehensive risk assessment and framework modeling of the risk assessment for the BOT toll roads project in India. This comprehensive risk assessor model can be used for BOT toll roads in Indian scenario for prioritization of the critical risk. It is important for the public and private sectors to establish an effective risk assessor model for public–private partnership (PPP) projects to achieve win-win condition for both.","[{""name"": ""Tirth Dineshkumar Patel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Theo C.

Given the infancy of such methodology in the WA construction industry, this research project aims to analyse factors influencing the implementation of OSM construction method in WA.Design/methodology/approachFollowing a thorough literature review, an existing research agenda in OSM was used to inform the direction of this research, i.e. focussing on external macro aspects of the decision making to implement OSM. Three projects in WA were studied, and the data collection was facilitated through archival study and semi-structured interviews with construction practitioners who were the stakeholders of the three projects. Data analysis was conducted through content analysis to draw the findings and conclusion of this research.FindingsThe analysis of the studied cases revealed relevant economic/financial, technological and regulatory factors, as well as social factors influencing the implementation of OSM, particularly in WA commercial projects. These findings were then used to develop an overall understanding of the external macro factors influencing decision making in implementing OSM that forms a formal research agenda aimed at enabling successful implementation of OSM in WA construction industry, particularly in its commercial sector.Originality/valueThe research findings presented in this paper identified factors that significantly influence the implementation of such alternative technology in a traditional sector. These factors were then structured to form the subsequent research agenda to continuously pursue the implementation of OSM in the sector. While the research agenda takes into account the unique characteristics of the WA construction industry, it contributes to the global and the Australian national research agenda, and the research methodology reported in this paper can be used to develop similar research agenda elsewhere.","[{""name"": ""Jordan Mark Correia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Monty Sutrisna"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Atiq U.

10.1108/JEDT-03-2023-0099,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Exploring stationary and major modular construction challenges in developing countries: a case study of Egypt,"Purpose This study aims to identify the most significant barriers and the stationary barrier to modular construction (MC) implementation and promote MC widespread use. By doing so, the construction industry can leverage the benefits of MC, such as faster construction times, improved quality control, reduced waste and increased sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a Gini’s mean analysis approach to identify the stationary barriers hindering the MC adoption in residential projects. The research focuses on the Egyptian context and uses a questionnaire survey to gather data from professionals in the construction industry. Findings According to the survey findings, the top five significant MC barriers are inability to modify the design; contractors asking for high bidding prices (higher initial cost); scepticism, conservation and resistance of clients to innovation and change; transportation restrictions; and lack of a one-size-fits-all tool for the design. In addition, Gini’s mean of dispersion demonstrated that the stationary barrier that faces MC adoption is the apprehension that architectural creativity will suffer because of MC. Practical implications The identified obstacles could be useful for decision makers in countries that have not yet adopted MC and may aid in the planning process to manage the risks associated with MC projects. The paper stresses the significance of devising techniques to overcome these barriers and proposes several methods to tackle these challenges. Originality/value This study fills the knowledge gap by identifying the stationary barrier and emphasising the potential risks associated with MC barriers. Furthermore, it suggests several strategies for overcoming and reducing these barriers in developing countries residential projects.","[{""name"": ""Ali Hassan Ali"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Farouk Kineber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Elyamany"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Hussein Ibrahim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Osama Daoud"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/su15129242"", ""10.5937/jomb0-24764"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124044"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-02-2018-0051"", ""10.3390/buildings12111805"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1970300"", ""10.3390/su13168886"", ""10.3390/app13042630"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-22434-8"", ""10.1080/15623599.2023.2185940"", ""10.1002/sd.2589"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106467"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2023.07.026"", ""10.3390/su15043461"", ""10.1080/01446190500184444"", ""10.1080/17452007.2005.9684590"", ""10.1080/10803548.2022.2038419"", ""10.1061/9780784481059.008"", ""10.1201/9781315229126-78"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1974682"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-11-2020-0174"", ""10.3390/en14248487"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1584836"", ""10.32738/jeppm.201401.0006"", ""10.3390/su15043445"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.01.061"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.299"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-03-2021-0051"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2020.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.08.035"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.05.029"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.136"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.06.016"", ""10.1080/01446193.2010.498481"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.147"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109479"", ""10.3390/su142113863"", ""10.3390/buildings13041052"", ""10.3390/app13063426"", ""10.1108/CI-01-2022-0018"", ""10.1061/9780784480847.042"", ""10.1080/15578771.2010.544155"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-02261-1_15"", ""10.1007/s12205-016-0194-1"", ""10.4103/2249-4863.161306"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2009.11.015"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2014-0048"", ""10.1061/(asce)me.1943-5479.0000246"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.08.015"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134035"", ""10.32738/ceppm.201411.0007"", ""10.1108/09699981111098702"", ""10.1136/eb-2015-102054"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0000842"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-01-2022-0009"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2022-0348"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0189"", ""10.1002/sd.2486"", ""10.3390/su13168887"", ""10.3390/math11041037"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2020.08.004"", ""10.1680/jmuen.18.00028"", ""10.1080/01446190600827058"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2023.102165"", ""10.3390/math11030497"", ""10.1061/(asce)me.1943-5479.0000173"", ""10.5923/j.ijcem.20150402.03"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.03.011"", ""10.3390/math11041003"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2016.02.008"", ""10.1680/jsmic.21.00004"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.110"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119347"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1613212"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2022.101821"", ""10.1080/17452007.2017.1384714"", ""10.1016/S0001-2092(07)69400-9"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.787491"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2013.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.190"", ""10.1016/0263-7863(85)90039-0""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/jade.12349,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Creating Spaces for Collaboration in Community Co-design,"AbstractUrgent societal challenges have led to unease in our socio‐cultural interactions and the production systems that underpin our lives. To confront such challenges, collaboration stands out as an essential approach in accomplishing joint goals and producing new knowledge. It calls for interdisciplinary methodologies such as co‐design, an approach capable of bridging multiple expertise. The core activities of co‐design are based on the premise of collaboration and on developing creative social environments. Yet achieving collaboration through co‐design is challenging as people need to understand each other, and develop trust and rapport. We argue that ‘informal‐mutual learning’ is central to building mutual understanding. This article explores how we create spaces for collaboration through co‐design by examining the social environments supporting them. It examines the value of collaboration and its impact upon participants within an action research project conducted in Scotland. We identified Cultural‐Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a suitable theoretical framework. It offers support for holistic inquiry into participation and learning. Its strength was in the attention that it pays to multi‐dimensional human interactions within the social environment. This led to an understanding of the concepts of boundary‐crossing and boundary space examined through a CHAT lens. The findings shed light on four designerly conditions supporting informal‐mutual learning when engaged in collaboration during co‐design situations: choreography and orchestration, aesthetics, playfulness, and quality and quantity of participation. The findings enable us to elaborate on the theorisation of boundary space, a theoretical space for the assemblage of multiple levels of expertise to achieve collaboration.","[{""name"": ""Mirian Calvo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Madeleine Sclater"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3102/0034654311404435"", ""10.2307/j.ctt9qgnsd"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5249.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14606925.2018.1445799"", ""10.1093/sw/48.3.297"", ""10.1080/15710882.2010.533185"", ""10.1111/jade.12161"", ""10.1017/S0144686X16000696"", ""10.4324/9781315630830-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625510.004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511812774.003"", ""10.1016/0959-4752(95)00021-6"", ""10.1348/000709900158001"", ""10.4324/9780203996867"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1085.001.0001"", ""10.1080/1363908042000267414"", ""10.1598/RRQ.43.2.3"", ""10.17763/haer.65.3.r16146n25h4mh384"", ""10.1145/2702123.2702561"", ""10.1023/A:1011239126617"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36xw4n4.6"", ""10.1080/03069885.2013.773582"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1080/15710880701875613"", ""10.4324/9781315630830-16"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00195"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-13018-7_11"", ""10.1002/ace.295"", ""10.3102/0034654306298273"", ""10.1080/00405841.2012.662856"", ""10.4324/9781315630830-21"", ""10.4324/9780203402719"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-15278-3"", ""10.1080/15710882.2017.1310466"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803932"", ""10.1080/14606925.2019.1595439"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352958""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0154,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Wind and solar energy utilization for seawater desalination and hydrogen production in the coastal areas of southern Iran,"PurposeAcute shortage of potable water and energy supplies is expected to raise in developing countries in the near future. One solid way to address these issues is to exploit renewable energy resources efficiently. Hence, this study aims to investigate wind and solar energy use in the coastal areas of southern Iran for renewable-powered seawater desalination and hydrogen production systems.Design/methodology/approachTo accomplish the aforementioned purpose, five areas most prone to the problems in Iran, namely, Mahshahr, Jask and Chabahar ports and Kish and Hormoz islands were scrutinized. To ascertain the amount of wind and solar energy available in the areas, Weibull distribution function, Angstrom–Prescott equation and HOMER software were used.FindingsThe findings indicated that wind energy density in Kish was 2,014.86 (kWh/m2.yr) and solar energy density in Jask equaled to 2,255.7 (kWh/m2.yr) which possessed the best conditions among the areas under study. Moreover, three commercial wind turbines and three photovoltaic systems were examined for supplying energy needed by the water desalination and hydrogen production systems. The results showed that application of wind turbines with rated power of 660, 750 and 900 kWh in Kish could result in desalting 934,145, 1,263,339 and 2,000,450 (m3/yr) of seawater or producing 14,719, 20,896 and 31,521 (kg/yr) of hydrogen, respectively. Additionally, use of photovoltaic systems with efficiency of %14.4, %17.01 and %21.16 in Jask could desalinate 287, 444 and 464 (m3/yr) of seawater or generate 4.5, 7 and 7.3 (kg/yr) of hydrogen, respectively.Originality/valueCompared to the huge extent of water shortage and environmental pollution, there has not been conducted enough studies to obtain broader view regarding use of renewable energies to solve these issues in Iran. Therefore, this study tries to close this gap and to give other developing nations the idea of water desalination and hydrogen production via renewable energies.","[{""name"": ""Mostafa Rezaei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Mostafaeipour"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Niloofar Jafari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nafiseh Naghdi-Khozani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Moftakharzadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.06.068"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.03.028"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2004.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.10.157"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2015.07.829"", ""10.1016/j.orgel.2017.01.043"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.01.113"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.077"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2009.09.077"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.160"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.082"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.07.165"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.04.181"", ""10.1016/j.esr.2018.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.130"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.106"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2017.05.034"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.113"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2018.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.047"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.04.102"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.067"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.154"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.125"", ""10.1007/s40095-017-0254-4"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.079"", ""10.1177/0958305X17750052"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.10.147"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.10.184"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.02.072"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.10.101"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2014.07.034"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.10.136"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.135""]","['Environmental Science', 'Energy', 'Engineering']","['Pollution', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0595,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Synthesis of critical factors influencing indoor environmental quality and their impacts on building occupants health and productivity,"Purpose The present shift and change in the human lifestyle across the world are undeniable. Currently, individuals spend a substantial amount of time indoors due to the global COVID-19 pandemic that strikes the entire world. This change in human lifestyle has devastating effects on human health and productivity. As a result, the influence of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) on the health and productivity of building users becomes a critical field of research that requires immediate attention. As a result, the purpose of this study is to review the state-of-the-art literature by establishing a connection between the factors that influence health and productivity in any given indoor environment. Design/methodology/approach The methodology involves a thorough review of selected published journals from 1983 to 2021, and the result was analysed through content analysis. The search included journal articles, books and conference proceedings on the critical factors influencing IEQ and their impact on building occupants, which was sourced from different databases such as ScienceDirect, Taylor, GoogleScholar and Web of Science. Findings The findings from the 90 selected articles revealed four critical factors influencing the quality of the indoor environment and are categorised into; indoor air quality, indoor thermal comfort, visual comfort and acoustic comfort. The findings suggested that when developing a system for controlling the quality of the indoor environment, the indoor air quality, indoor thermal comfort, visual comfort and acoustic comfort should be taken into account. Originality/value The indoor environment deeply impacts the health of individuals in their living and work environments. Industry must have a moral responsibility to provide health facilities in which people and workers feel satisfies and give conditions for prosperity. Addressing these essential aspects will not only help the decision-making process of construction professionals but also encourages innovative construction techniques that will enhance the satisfaction, wellness and performance of building occupants.","[{""name"": ""Modupe Cecilia Mewomo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Olaonipekun Toyin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Comfort Olubukola Iyiola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olusola Raphael Aluko"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.21608/pserj.2018.32280"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2008.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijsbe.2016.03.006"", ""10.1108/F-06-2016-0062"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.019"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.07.024"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.06.026"", ""10.1080/09613218.2011.556345"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.05.020"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.058"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2008.11.023"", ""10.1108/JFM-02-2013-0011"", ""10.1111/ina.12046"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.07.040"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.06.093"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.10.021"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.10.012"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2011.00745.x"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2006.03.001"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2009.00608.x"", ""10.1108/JCRE-11-2016-0037"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.08.027"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2005.00391.x"", ""10.1111/ina.12810"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.04.029"", ""10.1080/09613210500161950"", ""10.1006/jevp.2001.0222"", ""10.1016/j.ijsbe.2014.03.002"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000300"", ""10.1080/00994480.2000.10748316"", ""10.1080/00140130903154579"", ""10.3390/ijerph16173224"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.07.003"", ""10.1177/1420326X14526909"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2013.06.007"", ""10.1080/00039896.1993.9936718"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107309"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.016"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2011.00714.x"", ""10.1016/0160-4120(95)00017-F"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106707"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108183"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.11.026"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.03.013"", ""10.1177/0143624411412253"", ""10.3390/ijerph18063276"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.03.017"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00320"", ""10.1108/JCRE-11-2015-0038"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2015.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.05.016"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2010.00700.x"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.07.277"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.09.021"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.09.017"", ""10.1080/17508975.2013.764839"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.621"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2010.00703.x"", ""10.1177/001391659402600204"", ""10.1080/10789669.2014.967164"", ""10.1191/1365782804li122oa"", ""10.1177/1420326X17735162"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.08.001"", ""10.1080/00140130600679142"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107647"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2009.03.001"", ""10.2150/jlve.24.2_15"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107331"", ""10.1111/ina.12284"", ""10.1034/j.1600-0668.2003.00153.x"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.09.022"", ""10.1034/j.1600-0668.2002.01145.x""]","['Engineering', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Speech and Hearing', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0159,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Modelling the relationship between value management's activities and critical success factors for sustainable buildings,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the influence of value management (VM) critical success factors (CSFs) on the implementation of VM activities in building projects with a view to promoting sustainability of construction industry in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach The VM CSFs and implementation activities were recognized from earlier studies; questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from relevant stakeholders, and the collected data was subjected to exploratory factor analysis. Consequently, the influence of VM CSFs on VM implementation was generated via partial least square structural equation modelling. In addition, through relative importance ranking analysis, the significance VM CSFs were examined. Findings The findings from the proposed model revealed a strong relationship between VM implementation activities and its CSFs; the relationship is at a moderate level with an effect of 22.0%. This indicates that, VM CSFs would be useful to implement VM in the Egyptian building industry. Research limitations/implications Although these studies have been confined to Egypt’s VM studies; they may apply to other developing countries that have not carried out these studies. It is therefore vital, in those countries where the exercise has been entirely undertaken, to analyze the various measures to promote the application of the method. Practical implications This research would be of benefit to stakeholders in building industries to be aware of VM phases and its CSFs that demand utmost consideration. Also, the identified CSFs are expected to enhance the success and value of building projects by adopting VM. Originality/value The novelty of this research work will be a benchmark or board for decision-makers to eliminate the unwanted cost and enhance quality by adopting VM in Egypt’s building projects to achieve their sustainable projects.","[{""name"": ""Ahmed Farouk Kineber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Idris Bin Othman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nicholas Chileshe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/09699980510584502"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.053"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2015.08.006"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1146110"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122056"", ""10.1080/01446190903280435"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.07.001"", ""10.1037/h0046016"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.01.029"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2001)127:2(93)"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00039-7"", ""10.1080/02533839.2010.9671620"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.145"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.10.013"", ""10.1007/s11747-010-0204-7"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.304"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2007)23:1(40)"", ""10.1177/002224378101800104"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.048"", ""10.2753/MTP1069-6679190202"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199902)20:2<195::AID-SMJ13>3.0.CO;2-7"", ""10.1002/sd.492"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.04.018"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2018.11.008"", ""10.21315/jcdc2016.21.2.4"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.126115"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002026"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2002)18:2(68)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000208"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121154"", ""10.1080/15623599.2018.1484556"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.04.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000288"", ""10.5121/ijmvsc.2015.6405"", ""10.1016/0360-1323(87)90024-2"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1996)122:4(324)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2003)129:5(485)"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-09-2017-0078"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.155"", ""10.1080/17452007.2017.1384714"", ""10.1080/17452007.2006.9684620""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/jade.12352,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Developing Museum Education Content: AR Blended Learning,"AbstractTraditional museums of culture and history are failing to develop or make effective use of augmented reality (AR) technology. To address this deficit, the present study sought to develop online and offline experiential AR learning tools that would enable children to more fully explore museum artefacts. The study approach was based on the Blended Learning Model, which utilises symbiotic online and offline conversions and arrangements to enhance learning effectiveness. First, the study investigated the characteristics and limitations of existing AR technology from the perspective of children’s education by focusing on cultural assets. Second, an educational app with cultural heritage content was designed on the basis of a survey of stakeholders’ perceptions and needs. A blended learning experiment was then conducted, involving five steps (1) making a 3D assembly model (offline); (2) viewing the 3D model through the AR app; (3) learning about the cultural relic from a textbook (offline); (4) exploring the 3D model through the AR Quiz Game (online); and ( 5) visiting the museum (offline). This programme was found to be appropriate for elementary school third and fourth graders, who responded with high levels of flow and interest. The findings suggest that this experiential AR blended learning tool provides a more meaningful experience that motivates children to appreciate the value of cultural/historical assets.","[{""name"": ""JiHye Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hyun‐Kyung Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dabin Jeong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JiEun Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""TaeRyun Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JiHyon Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10639-018-9806-3"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2010.04.001"", ""10.1037/0013305"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.55.10.1163"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x"", ""10.1016/j.afjem.2017.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2003.10.001"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.1037/10034-000"", ""10.1177/1354856519897251"", ""10.1037/11494-000"", ""10.1007/s10055-019-00391-z"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43078-2"", ""10.1145/985040.985060""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0284,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,BIM data model requirements for asset monitoring and the circular economy,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review and provide recommendations to extend the current open standard data models for describing monitoring systems and circular economy precepts for built assets. Open standard data models enable robust and efficient data exchange which underpins the successful implementation of a circular economy. One of the largest opportunities to reduce the total life cycle cost of a built asset is to use the building information modelling (BIM) approach during the operational phase because it represents the largest share of the entire cost. BIM models that represent the actual conditions and performance of the constructed assets can boost the benefits of the installed monitoring systems and reduce maintenance and operational costs. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a horizontal investigation of current BIM data models and their use for describing circular economy principles and performance monitoring of built assets. Based on the investigation, an extension to the industry foundation classes (IFC) specification, recommendations and guidelines are presented which enable to describe circular economy principles and asset monitoring using IFC. Findings Current open BIM data models are not sufficiently mature yet. This limits the interoperability of the BIM approach and the implementation of circular economy principles. An overarching approach to extend the current standards is necessary, which considers aspects related to not only modelling the monitoring system but also data management and analysis. Originality/value To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first study that identifies requirements for data model standards in the context current linear economic model of making, using and disposing is growing unsustainably far beyond the finite limits of planet of a circular economy. The results of this study set the basis for the extension of current standards required to apply the circular economy precepts.","[{""name"": ""Juan Manuel Davila Delgado"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lukumon O.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2020-0047,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A framework for implementing integrated project delivery in architecture design firms in Egypt,"Purpose This paper aims to develop a framework for implementing the integrated project delivery (IPD) approach during the design process in architecture design firms (ADFs) in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach A research methodology consists of literature review, case studies and survey questionnaire was designed to achieve the abovementioned aim. First, literature review was used to identify and categorise the challenges of implementing IPD during the design process. Second, four case studies were analysed to investigate the values delivered to the client or missed due to the use of IPD or traditional procurement approaches, respectively. Finally, a survey questionnaire was carried out with a representative sample of ADFs in Egypt to investigate their perception towards the challenges of IPD implementation in Egypt. Based on the results of the above, the research developed a framework to facilitate the implementation of IPD in ADFs in Egypt. Findings Through literature review, the research identified 30 challenges that hamper the implementation of IPD in ADFs. These challenges were categorised due to their nature into five groups, namely, integration, cooperation, commitment and trust challenges, knowledge, experience skills and decision-making challenges, cultural challenges, legal and contractual challenges and technical and financial challenges. Results of data analysis showed that “poor communication and spirit of collaboration between project stakeholders” was ranked the highest influential challenge as IPD is based on collaboration and trust between project participants. In addition, “lack of training and motivation in investing for using IPD” was ranked the lowest influential challenge due to the poor attention paid to training in the construction industry. Moreover, despite the benefits of IPD implementations in many countries worldwide, it is not implemented in the Egyptian context. This necessitated taking action towards developing a framework to facilitate IPD implementation in ADFs in Egypt. Research limitations/implications The research focussed on ADFs in Egypt. Practical implications Adopting the proposed framework developed through this research will help implementing IPD during the design process in ADFs. Originality/value The research identified, categorised and analysed the challenges that obstruct the implementation of IPD in ADFs. The research tackled a topic that received scant attention in construction literature in the Middle East generally and Egypt in particular. In addition, this paper presented a framework to facilitate the implementation of IPD during the design process, which represents a synthesis that is novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred.","[{""name"": ""Ayman Ahmed Ezzat Othman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lamis Yasser Wagih Youssef"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(1995)11:2(36)"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-06-2016-0023"", ""10.1080/01446193.2010.504214"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2014.07.019"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(99)00046-0"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)9742-597X(1990)6:4(431)"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.10.107"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-05-2018-0084"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(03)00031-0"", ""10.1108/14637150010325462"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(1997)13:2(77)"", ""10.1108/17538371111164056"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.04.002"", ""10.1080/17452007.2016.1169987"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2017-0087"", ""10.1108/09699980410547603"", ""10.1080/01446199300000004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2001)127:1(82)"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.11.004""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

The largest product that humans interact with is the built environment. We use the built environment constantly for various functions. Based on a thorough review of the literature from multiple disciplinary sources, we introduce a model of Spatial User Experience (SUE), in which we define six dimensions as the main influential factors of the User Experience. These dimensions are categorized into two groups: (1) Ergonomic–Instrumental, including Spatial Cognition, Physical Compatibility, and Environmental Compatibility; and (2) Affective, comprising Emotional Reaction, Spatial Appreciation, and Proxemics. Furthermore, the User Experience influences behavioral responses, which will depend on the context and the activity performed. The model aims to be flexible enough to be applied in different physical settings. Its purpose is to contribute to the theory building in User Experience and Interior Design and to provide a foundation for empirical research. Future studies will be able to further validate the relationships defined in the model in diverse physical settings, identifying the dimensions that have greater impact on the User Experience. Ultimately, it is our objective to orient practitioners in the design of places that foster positive experiences and well–being.","[{""name"": ""Begoña Juliá Nehme"", ""affiliation"": [""Sharon E.

Construction stakeholders may find the results useful in highlighting the areas that need improvement to protect workers’ H&amp;S during the pandemic. However, the small sample limits the generalisability of the results to construction sectors in other regions. Originality/value The study investigated factors affecting the delivery of optimum H&amp;S during the COVID-19 to inform interventions to enhance H&amp;S.","[{""name"": ""Benviolent Chigara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tirivavi Moyo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/014461900370799"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2019.08.010"", ""10.1101/2020.12.09.20246249"", ""10.1348/135910710X485826"", ""10.1177/103530460101200104"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.11.025"", ""10.37624/IJERT/13.5.2020.828-830"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2006)132:2(197)"", ""10.1177/0018720820932699"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.10.004"", ""10.3126/ijosh.v10i2.33287"", ""10.25046/aj0505119"", ""10.18488/journal.1/2015.5.7/1.7.407.418"", ""10.1136/oemed-2020-106645"", ""10.1108/14725961211265756"", ""10.1093/occmed/kqaa036"", ""10.1016/j.susoc.2020.06.001"", ""10.1002/sres.2706"", ""10.1016/j.aogh.2015.07.002"", ""10.1177/1525822x10379795"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.1097"", ""10.1177/1048291120929763"", ""10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p079"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2020.599769""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2021-0324,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Development of complexity management strategies for construction projects,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to ascertain and list the most effective management strategies in efficiently handling the project complexities to enhance the performance of the project. Design/methodology/approach To fulfill the aim of this study, a comprehensive literature review was conducted, and the qualitative Delphi technique in two rounds was applied. Participants of the Delphi technique consisted of 12 subject matter experts (SMEs) with cumulative experience of 250 years in working in construction projects. In the first round of the Delphi technique, SMEs were asked to provide complexity management strategies to address the complexities due to 37 complexity indicators (CIs) under 11 complexity categories. In the second round of the Delphi technique, SMEs identified the top three management strategies for each of the 37 CIs. Findings This study collected the outcome of the two-round Delphi technique and based on the output developed the list of strategies to manage complexities related to each indicator. For example, establishing a well-informed governance team, assigning a Project Manager (PM) when the number of projects is more than one in an organization, and assigning a PM efficient enough to communicate with higher authority effectively will help in managing complexity that arises due to faulty assessment of the influence of a project on the organization’s overall success. Originality/value This study will help practitioners in effectively managing the project complexities, and thus will reduce the monetary loss associated with project complexities.","[{""name"": ""Sharareh Kermanshachi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thahomina Jahan Nipa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bac Dao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3846/13923730.2014.945953"", ""10.1016/0263-7863(95)00093-3"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2018.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.12.191"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.026"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001275"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.024"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.01.010"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000137"", ""10.3846/jcem.2019.8633"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000338"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.050"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.048"", ""10.1080/15578771.2018.1499568"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.12.005"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001306"", ""10.1080/01446193.2018.1532592"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.02.007"", ""10.1061/9780784482889.070"", ""10.1080/17452007.2006.9684615"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001758"", ""10.1177/8756972818770589"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.08.001"", ""10.1080/09613210500288886"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000163"", ""10.1287/mnsc.48.8.1008.163"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.06.186"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.10.004""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2021-0306,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Decision making in highway construction: a systematic review and future directions,"Purpose Various approaches have emerged to assist practitioners in making more informed decisions in highway construction projects. However, industry practitioners are still using subjective ways to make decisions. Also, researchers have developed tools and techniques with similar objectives. Lack of information on what has been developed might lead to those issues. Therefore, this paper aims to review trends of evolution, pinpoint strengths and gaps in the literature and identifies potential future directions for decision-making research in highway construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review was conducted on published articles on decision-making in highway construction projects using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique. Findings The analysis of 101 articles revealed that existing decision-making research in highway construction projects targets improvements in four areas: feasibility, conceptual, detailed scope and detailed design. The four areas consist of sixteen subthemes that are detailed in this study. In addition, most research involved developing decision support tools and systems as well as decision-making models, techniques and frameworks. Lastly, several research areas have emerged, such as adding more decision criteria including those with uncertainties, expanding existing decision-making models into decision support systems, benchmarking decision criteria between different sample populations and exploring inter-and intra-relationships between decision criteria. Originality/value This paper provides an overview of existing research on decision-making in highway construction projects. Also, it reveals research gaps in the body of knowledge to point out directions for future research. Finally, industry practitioners can use the findings to develop strategies for effective decision-making processes.","[{""name"": ""Afiqah R. Radzi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rahimi A.

10.1108/JEDT-09-2020-0379,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Building information modelling (BIM) readiness of construction professionals: the context of the Seychelles construction industry,"Purpose Although building information modelling (BIM) adoption in developed countries has largely been incentivised by government, in developing countries, adoption is often driven by desires of industry professionals, which is dependent on awareness of BIM and availability of skills among the professionals. Thus, BIM awareness and competence among professionals have become useful baseline measures of BIM readiness. To ascertain BIM readiness within the Seychelles construction industry, this study aims to investigate the level of BIM awareness and level of BIM competence among construction professionals. Design/methodology/approach The study involved a questionnaire survey of construction professionals (n = 96) and data analysis using both descriptive statistics and association analysis. Findings The results indicate a moderate level of BIM awareness, but a low level of engagement in BIM education/training. Also, the professionals have very low BIM technical skills, notably the ability to use BIM-related tools and to perform BIM-related task. Furthermore, this study suggests that the experience of working on collaborative projects could be a useful premise for BIM implementation among construction professionals. Originality/value The implication is that construction professionals in the Seychelles need to start readying themselves for greater BIM adoption by taking steps to address the BIM technical skills deficiencies and the low engagement in BIM education/training.","[{""name"": ""Vincent Adam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patrick Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdul-Majeed Mahamadu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Krzysztof Dziekonski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ernest Kissi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fidelis Emuze"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.11.649"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.002"", ""10.1260/1478-0771.9.4.463"", ""10.1063/1.5011596"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.04.005"", ""10.5539/ijms.v7n6p162"", ""10.1108/CI-03-2018-0016"", ""10.1080/15623599.2018.1541704"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2018-0389"", ""10.1080/10803548.2018.1485992"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.08.015"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2013.04.097"", ""10.1063/1.5003515"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2014-0067"", ""10.14445/22315381/IJETT-V41P208"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2008.10.003"", ""10.4018/978-1-60566-928-1.ch004"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.05.016"", ""10.1016/S0306-4379(03)00072-3""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0044,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Barriers to lean construction implementation in Zimbabwe,"Purpose Increased waste during projects execution has led to time and cost overruns within the Zimbabwean construction projects industry. However, contextual barriers to lean construction implementation are yet to be established for derivation of effective remedies. The purpose of this paper is to report on a study that sought to determine barriers to lean construction implementation and assess the existence of statistically significant differences because of gender, designation and educational levels of respondents. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was administered on construction professionals for the collection of quantitative data. Factor analysis was used to reveal interrelated significant sets of barriers to lean construction implementation. Non-parametric statistical methods were also used to determine significant differences because of demographic variables. Findings Integration- and performance-related, human capital management–related, quality management–related barriers were determined as the highest-ranked of the nine significant components. Significant differences because of gender, designation and educational levels were non-existent for aggregated barriers, generally indicating consensus on the barriers. However, individual barriers showed inadequacies in management requirements for lean construction implementation from architects and those with diplomas and degrees. Research limitations/implications The determination of barriers establishes the knowledge for construction policy evaluation for enhanced performance of the construction industry. However, because of the exploratory nature of this study, the insights of clients were not considered. Originality/value Context-specific barriers to lean construction implementation were determined for consequent construction policy improvements in the construction industry.","[{""name"": ""Tirivavi Moyo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benviolent Chigara"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/SASBE-022019-0018"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-04-2019-0037"", ""10.1108/IJLSS-12-2018-0144"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2018-0031"", ""10.1177/001872679905200401"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-08-2018-0047"", ""10.5812/ijem.3505"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.103.2.265"", ""10.1108/14714170910950849"", ""10.1108/JM2-07-2015-0052"", ""10.1108/IJPPM-11-2018-0413"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.209"", ""10.1108/CI-022019-0015"", ""10.18820/24150487/as26i2.1"", ""10.1108/CI-08-2012-0045"", ""10.1080/15578771.2020.1869122"", ""10.1108/CI-04-2017-0033"", ""10.1108/JTMC-12-2013-0043"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2017-0095"", ""10.1108/CI-07-2014-0038"", ""10.1108/BIJ-09-2017-0245"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000926"", ""10.1007/BF02291575"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-07-2019-0057""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/jade.12310,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,3D Printing in the Wild: Adopting Digital Fabrication in Elementary School Education,"AbstractIn recent years, digital fabrication, and especially its associated activities of 3D design and printing, have taken root in school education as curriculum‐based and maker‐oriented learning activities. This article explores the adoption of 3D design and printing for learning by fourth, fifth and sixth grade children (n=64) in multidisciplinary learning modules in elementary school education. School‐coordinated 3D projects were not led by design experts, such as art and design teachers, designers, researchers or technical specialists, but run ‘in the wild’ by school teachers. The study was conducted by using an ethnographic research design, including field observations, non‐formal interviews and a reflective questionnaire. The results indicate that, in the adoption of 3D printing activities, learning is centred on the technical skills and the usage of 3D tools. Hence, the elementary ABCs of 3D printing do not achieve the full design and creativity potential of digital fabrication that earlier research has suggested. However, the results do have implications for the potential of 3D printing projects to increase children’s empowerment. In their current state, 3D design and printing are some of the learning tools, among others, and similar achievements can be achieved with other hands‐on learning technologies. In order to enhance the learning of creativity and design thinking skills, 3D activities in school should be planned accordingly.","[{""name"": ""Teemu Leinonen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marjo Virnes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iida Hietala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jaana Brinck"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/2930674.2930723"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.006"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839423820.203"", ""10.1145/2661334.2661365"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2011.07.005"", ""10.4337/9781781950241.00012"", ""10.1016/S0160-791X(03)00021-6"", ""10.1016/j.entcom.2016.09.001"", ""10.1162/INOV_a_00135"", ""10.1145/1017833.1017836"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2012.08.004"", ""10.17763/haer.84.4.34j1g68140382063"", ""10.1080/15391523.2018.1450690"", ""10.1145/3003397.3003401"", ""10.1145/3210586.3210600"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2016.01.001"", ""10.17763/haer.84.4.46m7372370214783"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2015.08.001"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1"", ""10.1016/j.tele.2014.05.001"", ""10.7771/2157-9288.1099"", ""10.1145/3078072.3079735"", ""10.1080/02671522.2016.1225802"", ""10.1016/j.entcom.2016.09.002"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839423820.93"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2015.10.002"", ""10.1145/2999541.2999542"", ""10.1080/07380569.2017.1384684""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Computer Science Applications', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Hence, effectively coping with stress to prevent mental ill-health becomes an essential point of reference. Thus, this study aims to examine the role of factors such as resilience and coping strategies in protecting tradesmen against mental ill-health. Design/methodology/approach Using a cross-sectional survey design, 110 tradesmen from 65 construction companies were surveyed using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Brief Resilience Scale and Ways of Coping Questionnaire. Findings The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. With a 74.5%, 36.4% and 14.6% prevalence rate of self-reported depression, anxiety and suicide ideation among the tradesmen, only positive reappraisal, accepting responsibility coping behaviors and resilience would mitigate the likelihood of developing mental ill-health symptoms. Originality/value This study has extended existing literature by providing information vital to building interventions to deal with stressors effectively. This information would benefit individuals, organizations and the economy and equip policymakers with a deeper knowledge base toward improving mental health.","[{""name"": ""Janet Mayowa Nwaogu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert P.C.

With the gradual uptake of sustainability concerns in the construction industry, this paper aims to identify the strategic need for clear-cut policies to improve sustainable construction practice. Previous studies have harped on the need for regulatory and industrial/organisational policies on improving sustainable construction practice within the Nigerian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was used to evaluate the perspectives of construction professionals on the policy barriers for sustainable construction practice in Nigeria, and 46 policy barriers were identified. A total of 249 questionnaires were returned and useable for analysis. Findings Factor analysis revealed four clusters in the policy barriers to sustainable construction practice in the following order of significance: implementation strategies for sustainable construction practice, owners/client inputs for sustainable construction practice, stakeholder’s policy barriers and governmental and regulatory policy barriers. Practical implications Mitigating the identified barriers through effective policies will require adequate inputs from all relevant policymaking stakeholders and ensure improved sustainable construction practice among stakeholders and policymakers in the industry. This will in turn set a high standard and promote the practice of sustainable construction. Originality/value This study goes a step further in identifying the policy issues needed to ensure a smooth implementation of sustainable construction practice. The research findings will serve as a guide for policymakers in developing countries that through mitigation of the identified barriers, sustainable construction practice will be promoted.","[{""name"": ""Ayotunde Babalola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nishani Harinarain"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/buildings2020126"", ""10.4236/ojs.2015.57075"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.538"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.181"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.988"", ""10.1108/14714170410815060"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2014.05.102"", ""10.3390/su10020392"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.037"", ""10.3390/su9020165"", ""10.1080/07488008808408783"", ""10.4018/ijec.2015100101"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.11.136"", ""10.1080/0961321042000322780"", ""10.1007/s12132-018-9344-5"", ""10.4314/ejesm.v8i1.6"", ""10.3390/su9122347"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2016-0152"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.10.021"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.174"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.12.077"", ""10.3390/su9060919""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/jade.12314,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Online Design Education: Meta-Connective Pedagogy,"AbstractRapid technological advancement has changed the landscape of design education to be integrated with educational technology, and the worldwide COVID‐19 pandemic has further accelerated its transition to online education. Pedagogical engagement with online education is unavoidable to ensure that the transition is successful when the situation ends. Yet, many prior studies on online design education remain focused on technical and administrative uses of digital technologies. In this article, meta‐connective pedagogy is introduced to enable educators and researchers critically to engage with pedagogical concerns emerging from the connective nature of the digitally networked world. Meta‐connective pedagogy is to focus on we are always‐being‐connected and argue that authentic learning and teaching are determined by diverse forms of pre‐existing connectivity. This article consists of four parts. First, it is argued that studio‐based learning has developed a ‘resistant’ stance towards online education, which justifies the omission of understanding connective features from its discourses. Second, four up‐to‐date studies on online design education are critically reviewed in a comparative manner, as their views are split into technical and pedagogical aspects. Third, meta‐connective pedagogy is introduced to address why and how connectivity becomes an emerging pedagogical concern for online education. Fourth and last, a schematic form of meta‐connective design education is articulated, and new roles and responsibilities of educators are addressed. Overall, it is argued that the whole concept of design education is subverted towards connectivity that is inclusive of social components of traditional design studios in a more efficient way.","[{""name"": ""Neal Dreamson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1511637"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.02.007"", ""10.4018/978-1-60566-729-4.ch001"", ""10.4324/9780429277528"", ""10.1080/07294360.2016.1263830"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2018.1490665"", ""10.1177/1474022218758231"", ""10.3368/lj.37.2.41"", ""10.1080/20511787.2016.1325579"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1605501""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Based on a literature review, 28 factors were extracted and their relationships (239 in total) obtained using the Delphi method. A social network model of the factors was constructed and factors were analyzed using social network analysis (SNA). Findings The top 10 key factors and their relationships were obtained using SNA. Among the top 10 critical factors, six were source factors. They were: training for the application of BIM, guidance from experts, proper management modes, efficient BIM teams, specifications and demonstrations and standards for building information communication. The other four factors included as follows: a willingness to accept BIM, knowledge of its value and benefits, the definition of its benefits and the availability of IT software and hardware. These were mediating factors that could further the influence of the source factors. Originality/value The results provide useful information for public agencies and professionals to understand the immediate and mediating influences of the factors on the application of BIM. Solutions and future efforts for different participants are presented to promote the application of BIM-based on the key factors and their relationships.","[{""name"": ""Shuangliang Tai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yao Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ting Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.017"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.03.010"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000127"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000903"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001607"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.002"", ""10.28991/cej-2019-03091255"", ""10.1108/09699981211277531"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000604"", ""10.1080/15623599.2017.1423165"", ""10.3390/su11071982"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000729"", ""10.1177/1523422307304106"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001773"", ""10.1177/0038038588022001007"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.10.012"", ""10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00201-4"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.12.014"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2013.04.097""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Hence, this study aims to identify and assess the drivers for implementing modular construction systems (MCS) in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a quantitative research approach to seek respondents’ opinions on the factors that can drive the implementation of MCS in developing countries. Accordingly, a structured questionnaire was used as an instrument of data collection based on five Likert scales. The data was analysed using the mean score, one sample t-test, Kruskal–Wallis, factor analysis (FA) and Pearson correlation analysis. Findings Results show that 15 of the 16 major identified drivers were statistically significant towards implementing MCS, which indicates that the drivers are crucial for implementing MCS in developing countries. However, the Kruskal–Wallis test reveals that the respondents have varying opinions on the identified drivers. FA categorised the drivers into four categories, namely, “management and sustainability”, “key performance”, “know-how and logistics” and “regulations and policies”. A strong relationship among the four categories of drivers was established using Pearson correlation, which indicated that all the drivers’ categories are essential for implementing MCS in developing countries. Originality/value This study identified and assessed the drivers towards implementing MCS in developing countries. The study concludes that the identified drivers are essential for implementing MCS in developing countries. Also, the study considers the government the most placed player in driving the implementation of MCS in developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Abdulkabir Opeyemi Bello"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Doris Omonogwu Eje"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdullahi Idris"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mudasiru Abiodun Semiu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayaz Ahmad Khan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.32350/jaabe.22"", ""10.1108/ARCH-04-2019-0081"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1970300"", ""10.1108/14714170910931552"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.05.191"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/1203/3/032002"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124716"", ""10.1108/CI-05-2021-0088"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000057"", ""10.1061/41109(373)114"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2017.09.014"", ""10.21834/aje-bs.v3i10.307"", ""10.21315/JCDC2018.23.2.1"", ""10.13140/RG.2.2.33191.65440"", ""10.1080/15578771.2020.1869122"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2020-0042"", ""10.22452/jscp.vol9no1.2"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2021-0639"", ""10.1080/01446193.2017.1353119"", ""10.3390/buildings12050654"", ""10.35940/ijitee.I8113.078919"", ""10.1108/ECAM-02-2018-0056"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2020.09.070"", ""10.3390/buildings9050117"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1613212"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118861"", ""10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2018.08.190""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/jade.12254,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Art Technology Integration: Digital Storytellying as a Transformative Pedagogy in Primary Education,"AbstractThe emergence of new media provides new tools for promoting critical thinking and creativity in an environment that encourages collaboration, co‐authoring and sharing ideas and artworks with audiences. Embedding new media in art lessons and integrating art with other disciplines not only promotes visual competence but also transversal competences necessary for the future lives of children. Despite the many benefits that this process entails, there is still no broad integration of new media in art lessons or art integration through technology in primary schools, as teachers are often oblivious of the new possibilities and means of engaging children. However, there is a need to embrace today’s dominant culture of communication if we really want to prepare children for the future. This article is about art technology integration in the primary classroom. It discusses ways of studying important real‐life issues with children and of bridging the gap between school life and daily life. It reports on two case studies with sixth grade classes (11–12 years old) that engaged in a stop motion animation project to communicate messages that were important to the children. Children shared powerful stories, anchored in real‐life contexts and developed critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity skills. The findings contribute to the discussions about arts integration that are grounded in empirical qualitative data. The implications of the study move beyond the art subject itself and highlight how generalist teachers can embrace interdisciplinarity and art integration, and view art as transformative pedagogy in the curriculum.","[{""name"": ""Victoria Pavlou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00043125.2010.11519061"", ""10.1080/00043125.2011.11519134"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-10643-9_5"", ""10.1163/9789460910623"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2013.01738.x"", ""10.1007/s11125-014-9323-0"", ""10.58680/la201221631"", ""10.1007/s11519-007-0004-2"", ""10.1080/00393541.2014.11518922"", ""10.1080/00043125.2007.11651644"", ""10.1386/eta.13.3.369_1"", ""10.17763/haer.66.1.17370n67v22j160u"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-3052-9_18""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Speech and Hearing']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0027,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A knowledge management based framework for enhancing the learning culture in architectural design firms in developing countries,"Purpose In spite of the active role of continuous learning on improving organisational performance, the construction industry generally and architectural design firms (ADFs) in particular are criticised for their inability to use organisational knowledge to foster learning culture towards enhancing their performance. This paper aims to develop a framework based on knowledge management (KM) to enhance the learning culture in ADFs in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the abovementioned aim, a research methodology consisted of data collection, data analysis and action required is designed to achieve four objectives. First, to examine the nature of the construction industry in developing countries, learning culture in ADFs, as well as knowledge and KM; second, to present three case studies to investigate the effectiveness of KM in enhancing the learning culture in ADFs; third, to investigate the perception and application of KM towards enhancing the learning culture in ADFs in Egypt, finally to develop a KM based framework to enhance the learning culture in ADFs in developing countries. Findings Through literature review, the research highlighted the fragmented nature of the architectural design process, which led to the loss of valuable information and made the process of capturing and sharing knowledge a hard task. In addition, it identified the barriers of implementing KM and the building blocks of learning culture in ADFs. Results of data analysis showed that “lack of organisational culture” and “low involvement of top management” were ranked the highest barriers for implementing KM in ADFs. Moreover, respondents mentioned that they do not share openly their information with other employees to maintain their uniqueness and that the strict working environment of their ADFs is not encouraging creativity or enhancing learning culture. Furthermore, “continuous learning and enhancement” and “experimentation, feedback and reflection” were ranked by respondents as the highest building blocks of a learning organisation. Research limitations/implications This research focussed on ADFs in developing countries. Practical implications Implementing KM strategies will facilitate the enhancement of learning culture within ADFs in developing countries. This will impact positively on improving the performance and increasing the competitiveness and market share of ADFS. Originality/value The research identified the barriers of KM implementation in ADFs and the building blocks of creating a learning organisations. It focusses on improving the performance of ADFs through using the capabilities of KM towards building learning culture in ADFs. The proposed framework which was designed to facilitate the implementation of KM for enhancing the learning culture in ADFs in developing countries represents a synthesis that is novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred.","[{""name"": ""Ayman Ahmed Ezzat Othman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mirna Mohamed ElKady"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9780470759554"", ""10.5465/amle.2002.8509400"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2013.04.008"", ""10.1080/07421222.2001.11045676"", ""10.1080/09613210500162032"", ""10.2307/41165945"", ""10.28945/3897"", ""10.1177/875697280403500105"", ""10.1108/09696470410538215"", ""10.1108/17260530810918289"", ""10.1287/orsc.10.4.381"", ""10.3828/twpr.10.1.63h4v2427v96132q"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2000)16:4(72)"", ""10.1108/00197859610105440"", ""10.1057/kmrp.2011.38"", ""10.3844/ajebasp.2012.13.22"", ""10.1108/13673270310492967"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(1997)13:2(77)"", ""10.1002/hrdq.1133"", ""10.1108/17538371111164056"", ""10.1108/02635570210414622"", ""10.1108/14714170410815033"", ""10.1108/13673270510582938"", ""10.1108/13673270010350002"", ""10.1287/orsc.5.1.14"", ""10.1108/MRR-09-2015-0214"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2017-0106"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2018-0202"", ""10.1108/ECAM-07-2017-0139"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2020-0047"", ""10.1007/s11365-018-00557-2"", ""10.1108/13563280310506430"", ""10.1108/13673270910971842"", ""10.1108/09699980510627135"", ""10.2307/41165944"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2010.11.010"", ""10.1080/01446199300000004"", ""10.1108/13673270010372279"", ""10.1080/0144619042000241417"", ""10.1108/eb029036"", ""10.4305/METU.JFA.2009.2.14"", ""10.1108/13673279710800682"", ""10.1108/13673270210450414"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2017-0067""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0260,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Sustainability assessment of urban water environment treatment public-private partnership projects using fuzzy logic,"PurposeIn recent years, with the increasingly serious urban water environmental pollution, the government has exerted considerable effort to promote the comprehensive improvement of the water environment and conducted numerous urban water environment treatment public–private partnership (PPP) projects (UWETP-PPP). The sustainability assessment of UWETP-PPP has important theoretical and practical significance for the public and private sectors to systematically evaluate the sustainability of projects and promote the sustainable development of projects. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to advance a method to evaluate the sustainability of UWETP-PPP.Design/methodology/approachThe paper adopted fuzzy logic method to evaluate the sustainability of UWETP-PPP. First, this paper constructed the sustainability assessment indicator system of UWETP-PPP. Second, this paper determined the appropriate linguistic scale for assessing the performance ratings and importance weights of UWETP-PPP sustainability indicators and collected experts’ evaluations of the project through questionnaires. Then, the linguistic variables were approximated as fuzzy numbers through the concept of fuzzy theory. Finally, the sustainability of the project was determined and the weak sustainability aspects of the project were identified by calculation.FindingsThe feasibility of this method was verified by a specific case. And, the results of the case study showed that the UWETP-PPP in Xuchang City, China, was sustainable, and the indicators of weak sustainability of the project were identified, namely, internal return ratio (IRR), sustainable cash flow, provision of employment opportunities, energy efficiency, comprehensive use of water resources, use of innovation materials, renewal of project facilities, adoption of advanced engineering technology, use of construction waste and waste recycling and reuse. This paper also proposed corresponding suggestions for further improving the sustainability of the UWETP-PPP in Xuchang City, China.Originality/valueThis paper makes two contributions: first, the fuzzy logic method is applied to provide new ideas for a sustainability assessment of UWETP-PPP, and the assessment results facilitate ways to monitor and estimate the degree of sustainability.

10.1108/JEDT-01-2020-0027,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Identifying the performance areas affecting the project performance for Indian construction projects,"Purpose The construction industry is facing challenges because of performance shortfalls. Construction projects are highly complex, distinctive, fragmented and do not have well-established performance assessment models to evaluate their project success. The purpose of this paper is to assess the direction through determination of performance areas that would affect project performance in Indian construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A survey instrument was developed to gather data on the perception of industry professionals on these identified areas. Purposive sampling method was used to select respondents for the survey. These performance areas are ranked using relative importance index to ascertain a level of importance among the group. Factor analysis (FA) was conducted to identify the significant performance areas project performance. Further to identify the most influence performance areas on Indian construction projects, multiple regression analysis was carried out. Findings Findings indicated 28 significant performance areas. This shows the low level of adoption of good construction management practices in Indian construction projects. FA resulted in the areas being grouped to nine broad significant performance areas with 59.49% of the total variance, namely, quality, schedule, environment and stakeholder satisfactions, cost, productivity, safety, communication management, customer relations and finance. Multiple regression analysis revealed two pivotal factors “customer relations” and “schedule” that significantly influence project performance in Indian construction industry. Originality/value The outcome of the study will guide project stakeholders, who desire to improve project performance on construction projects, to prioritize their efforts. It also highlights performance areas of project management which required more focussed research in the context of Indian construction projects. The findings can be extended to the developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Prachi Vinod Ingle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gangadhar Mahesh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deepak M.D."", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.10.014"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v17i2.5319"", ""10.1016/S0166-4972(00)00002-X"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)00069-6"", ""10.1177/875697289903000405"", ""10.1016/0263-7863(95)00064-X"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(97)00011-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.07.002"", ""10.1080/10429247.2009.11431844"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2002)18:3(120)"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2003.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2011.09.016"", ""10.4018/IJKM.2019100102"", ""10.1080/10429247.2017.1380579"", ""10.1108/09699980410570166"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.02.005"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000129"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000871"", ""10.1080/17457300.2011.648676"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2012.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.04.002"", ""10.1080/10429247.2004.11415233"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.05.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1998)124:6(435)"", ""10.1108/14635770710819290"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2575.2009.00333.x"", ""10.1108/02686900210419921"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.04.002"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2018-0175"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2018-0175"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.02.010"", ""10.1016/0263-7863(95)00057-7"", ""10.1016/j.im.2007.06.001"", ""10.1108/JFM-08-2013-0042"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1996)122:2(165)"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.02.008"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.03.039"", ""10.1007/s12205-017-1892-z"", ""10.1177/875697280503600206"", ""10.1080/01446190110089691"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.03.006"", ""10.7763/IJET.2012.V4.406"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000175"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00081-6"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2006)132:11(1131)""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0571,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Generic skills of future built environment practitioners in South Africa: unexplored mechanism via students' perception,"Purpose Researchers and policymakers have given attention to generic skills development in higher institutions. One of the intentions is to broaden graduate employability with generic skills. In South Africa, there is a paucity of research concerning future built environment practitioners’ (FBEP) generic skills development from the students’ perspective. Thus, this paper aims to investigate South Africa’s FBEP generic skills and suggest feasible solutions to improve FBEP generic skills from the students’ perception. Design/methodology/approach The researchers collated the views of FBEP via a phenomenology type of qualitative research design. It covered selected South African public universities and investigated the discourses that underpin “perceived hindrance” in developing generic skills for FBEP. Selected 30 FBEP were engaged in the virtual interviews across three public universities. Data saturation was achieved. Three themes emerged and were analysed through a thematic analysis. Findings Findings show that FBEP generic skills development will enhance integrated productivity and higher value for money in construction project delivery. But developing these skills demands a holistic approach. Findings have raised concern with the perceived hindrances facing FBEP in developing generic skills. Findings suggest the need to revisit and revamp the curricula to develop these skills and strengthen policies that will “nip” possible hindrances. Research limitations/implications This study was limited to South Africa’s FBEP generic skills from students’ perception. In line with the limited resources, three public universities were covered from the selected provinces in South Africa. Future research with a more diverse sample is needed to ensure a better representative and generalisation of findings. Practical implications Findings show that apart from academic knowledge system thinking skills, civic responsibility skills and critical thinking skills are germane for intending construction industry professionals. Others are integrated teamwork skills, good attitude and communication skills, entrepreneurship skills and resources management skills. Findings from this paper may stir up the education sector’s stakeholders to revamp the curricula in enhancing these skills among students from the basic to higher institutions. The outcome will improve productivity in the construction industry. Originality/value Although few scholars have discussed generic skills in the built environment, there are limited studies from the students’ context in developing countries, a South Africa case study, a gap this research aims to fill. Also, it proffers ways to mitigate perceived hindrances facing FBEP in developing generic skills.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Ebekozien"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Aliu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wellington Didibhuku Thwala"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/ARA-02-2019-0044"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0162"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1894633"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2017-0081"", ""10.1109/TE.2020.3034958"", ""10.1108/MEDAR-06-2013-0018"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2012-0020"", ""10.1080/13562517.2017.1301910"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-2324-5_2"", ""10.1080/09639280601011040"", ""10.1080/03043797.2018.1462766"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1294152"", ""10.1007/s10734-019-00405-4"", ""10.1108/IJCHM-09-2020-1038"", ""10.1080/02589001.2020.1758304"", ""10.1080/13563475.2020.1779671"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2021.102803"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0453"", ""10.1108/JEM-03-2021-0031"", ""10.1108/ET-07-2012-0077"", ""10.24085/jsaa.v6i1.3067"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0108"", ""10.1111/radm.12265"", ""10.7196/AJHPE.2016.v8i1.414"", ""10.1177/1478210319864824"", ""10.1108/IJPPM-11-2018-0417"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2021-0384"", ""10.12928/joves.v3i1.1754"", ""10.1111/j.1813-6982.2008.00152.x"", ""10.1108/JEM-01-2021-0008"", ""10.1080/07294360.2019.1664998"", ""10.1080/07294360.2013.863837"", ""10.1080/17452759.2017.1326724"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2017-0057"", ""10.1080/13562517.2018.1515195""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

The other purpose of this paper is to familiarize the researchers with the available developments in manufacturing sandwich structures. Design/methodology/approach The most recent research articles in the field of manufacturing various composite sandwich structures were reviewed. The review process started by categorizing the available sandwich manufacturing techniques into nine main categories according to the method of production and the equipment used. The review is followed by outlining some automatic production concepts toward composite sandwich automated manufacturing. A brief summary of the sandwich manufacturing techniques is given at the end of this article, with recommendations for future work. Findings It has been found that several composite sandwich manufacturing techniques were proposed in the literature.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the major attributes of effective teamwork and the challenges encountered by the team during construction with a view to improving performance of projects. Design/methodology/approach Data for the study were obtained through 420 structured questionnaires, which were administered to a sample of project participants including clients’, contractors’ and consultants’ organizations’ representatives in South-Southern region of Nigeria. Data collected were analyzed using percentage, mean item score and Kruskal–Wallis rank test. Findings The findings revealed leadership skills, top management support and interpersonal dynamics of the team among the critical attributes for effective teamwork. The prevailing challenges of effective teamwork were identified as essentially; poor leadership, poor rapport among team members and lack of effective communication. Practical implications The study ultimately provides implication for effective team building among clients’, consultants’ and contractors’ organizations towards efficient delivery of construction projects. Moreover, the stakeholders in the industry would find the results of this research useful in managing human and non-human components of construction projects through the understanding of the attributes and challenges of teamwork with ultimate aim of achieving effective project performance. Originality/value The findings reveal that all the key stakeholders’ organizations; clients, consultants and contractors’ organizations exhibit similar perceptions of the attributes and challenges confronting teamwork in construction project delivery. The empirical evidence provided on the attributes and challenges would therefore offer robust information in building effective project team by stakeholders during the planning and implementation stages, which is a right step towards enhancing construction project performance.","[{""name"": ""Emmanuel Tayo Adu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Akintayo Opawole"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/14714170210814676"", ""10.1080/10429247.2010.11431849"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.11.010"", ""10.19026/rjaset.7.911"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2012.11.004"", ""10.1177/00187267005311002"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.05.001"", ""10.1177/875697280403500407"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(99)00024-1"", ""10.1108/02656710010298445"", ""10.1108/09699980610712373"", ""10.1142/S1609945105000237"", ""10.1002/pfi.4930420305"", ""10.1177/014920639702300303"", ""10.1080/0144619042000202726"", ""10.1080/01446190210163543"", ""10.1108/13664380910977592"", ""10.1080/01446190600827033"", ""10.1108/02683949710174838"", ""10.1108/17538370910971036"", ""10.1177/1046496402239575"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2004.10.003"", ""10.1142/S1609945105000237"", ""10.1080/14783360600750444"", ""10.3846/1392-3730.2008.14.4"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2007)133:9(701)"", ""10.5465/amr.1999.1893935"", ""10.1177/1059601199243007"", ""10.1016/0263-7863(95)00057-7"", ""10.1108/09699980510600125"", ""10.1080/01446190210151041"", ""10.9790/487X-1810058083"", ""10.1080/17452007.2013.802980"", ""10.1504/IJLIC.2009.027915"", ""10.19026/rjaset.5.4706"", ""10.1080/014461900370681"", ""10.1108/13664380580001063"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.45.2.120""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/joid.12165,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,"Architectural Design Characteristics, Uses, and Perceptions of Community Spaces in Permanent Supportive Housing","People experiencing homelessness often face recoveries complicated by mental disability, substance abuse, and trauma. They can withdraw into self–imposed isolation and avoid important support services, making recovery more difficult. Affirmative relationships developed in part within the designed settings of transitional housing may play a significant role in countering these tendencies. The presence and effectiveness of communal gathering spaces in supportive housing must be better understood as a design problem, particularly given users’ diverse ages, ethnicities, and health needs, which effectively inclusive environments must accommodate. In recent decades, architecture as a discipline has pivoted toward more human–centered approaches, with the individual's dignity and well–being at center stage. This study applies social science–based research methods and spatial analytics to the end of understanding how specific interior spaces, key to the recovery process, might be improved. The authors posit that the success of resident gathering spaces intended to prompt and support resident relationships and decrease users’ feelings of marginalization may be influenced by a range of sociospatial design factors (i.e. visibility and ease of access, adjacencies, access to daylight and views, furniture types, and aesthetics) together with facility policies and events programming. The authors use a combination of space syntax, surveys, and qualitative methods to analyze two contrasting layouts in supportive housing locations in the UK and Florida, drawing conclusions intended to steer the development of typologies for similar facilities.","[{""name"": ""Yelena McLane"", ""affiliation"": [""Florida State University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jill Pable"", ""affiliation"": [""Florida State University, USA""]}]","[""10.1093/aje/kwy231"", ""10.1068/b060047"", ""10.1037/a0021865"", ""10.1177/0042098014542135"", ""10.1177/193758671200500409"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2013.301490"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511597237"", ""10.1177/1359105307080593"", ""10.1177/1745691614568352"", ""10.1080/10530789.2018.1445507"", ""10.1037/0735-7044.121.1.21"", ""10.1007/s11414-006-9029-z"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2007.tb00543.x"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2012.01080.x"", ""10.1186/1477-7525-10-93"", ""10.1177/1532708605274558"", ""10.1023/A:1011624008762"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2004.tb00397.x"", ""10.1007/s10597-011-9385-x"", ""10.4159/9780674045231"", ""10.1080/02763890903547062""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Health', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-09-2020-0354,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Potential of adopting a resilient safety culture toward improving the safety performance of construction organizations in Nigeria,"Purpose Despite the efforts of organizations to improve safety performance, shortfalls of the strategies have been reported in numerous studies around the globe. However, previous studies in countries with more organized construction sectors show that adopting a resilient safety culture by organizations has a tendency of improving safety performance. As safety culture is dynamic which differs with geographical context, the purpose of this paper is to achieve two objectives: testing the causal relationship between safety performance and resilience safety culture in the Nigerian construction environment; and determining the key components for ensuring the resilience of construction organizations with regards to safety. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative research approach was used. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The population of the study comprises small and medium construction organizations predominantly across the Northern region in the Nigerian built environment. A total of 180 questionnaires were distributed to construction managers and safety managers in respective organizations to serve as respondents to the study. Partial least square – structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the relationship between safety performance and resilience safety culture. While principal component analysis was used determining the key components for ensuring the resilience of construction organizations with regards to safety. Findings Findings of this study revealed that resilient safety culture has a significantly strong positive relationship with safety performance. Safety hazard recognition and effective safety response attitude were identified as the key components for guaranteeing a resilient safety culture. Practical implications With a view to achieve a consistently high safety performance, organizations have to acknowledge and anticipate unexpected hazardous events and provide the necessary safety resources to manage them. Furthermore, there is also the need to create awareness on recognized safety concerns on safety hazards, coupled with a dynamic risk response attitude to ensure consistent improvement in safety performance. Originality/value This study presents an alternative to the slow and reactive safety culture of the Nigerian built environment. This study builds on existing literature, and the findings explore the potential impact of adopting a resilient safety culture in construction organizations in Nigeria. This study provided further insights into key factors organizations need to focus on to ensure resilient nature.

10.1108/JEDT-01-2020-0025,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Optimal energy mix for a reverse osmosis desalination unit considering demand response,"Purpose Reverse osmosis (RO) has become an important method of desalination to meet the ever-growing water needs around the world. Its integration with renewable energy source (RES) reduces the environmental impact of gas emissions and cost of conventional fossil energy sources. The optimal sizing of energy sources to power RO desalination system is intended mainly to minimize the annualized cost of the system and by extension minimize freshwater cost while maximizing production. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a mathematical optimization approach is used to determine the optimal energy mix, which includes grid power, diesel generator and a photovoltaic (PV) module to supply an RO desalination unit. Three cases of optimal sizing approach were compared. Case 1 is a system with only grid power and diesel generator as energy sources; Case 2 has PV incorporated in the energy supply mix while Case 3 has the three energy sources and a Time of Use (TOU) demand response program on the demand side. Findings The results of implementing the optimization models show that Case 3 turnout the highest freshwater production (1,521 m3/day) at a unit cost of 1.36$/m3 when compared to Case 1 with daily freshwater production of 1,250 m3/day at a unit cost of 1.68$/m3 and Case 2 having a daily freshwater production of 1,501 m3/day at a unit cost of 1.33$/m3. Originality/value The integration of RES to power desalination system with application of TOU demand response is the significance of this study.","[{""name"": ""Ewaoche John Okampo"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Johannesburg Department of Electrical/Electronic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, , Johannesburg,""]}, {""name"": ""Nnamdi I.

10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0171,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Key driving factors of cost overrun in highway infrastructure projects in Nigeria: a context-based perspective,"Purpose Extensive research towards identifying the attributable cost overrun factors globally has been conducted predominantly from a survey-oriented perspective, which disregard the contextual basis on which these triggers manifest. This study aims to explore the driving factors of cost overrun in highway projects, specific to the Nigerian context. Design/methodology/approach The research used a context-based approach to seek project stakeholders’ perspectives on the key drivers of cost overrun in highway projects in Nigerian. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with client, contractor and consultant organisations involved in the provision of highway infrastructure projects in Nigeria. The collected data was analysed using a developed coding framework grounded on a case study approach, principles of inductive thematic analysis and saliency analysis to identify the key drivers. Findings Findings from the analysis identified triggers from macroeconomic, societal, leadership and project management perspectives with synergistic relationships with each other based on prevalence and significance. Among the key triggers is a delay in work progress, political instability, adverse weather, social issues, delay in progress payment to contractors and modification of project scope. In conclusion, the triggers of cost overrun in highway projects are contextually driven by the complex nature of the project management, societal, macroeconomic and leadership triggers specific to the Nigerian context. Research limitations/implications The research was limited to only highway infrastructure projects in Nigeria. Furthermore, the findings are based on a small sample size, and thus, caution must be taken before applying the outcome of this study in a generalised way to other contexts. Practical implications Practically, the stakeholders i.e. client, contractors and consultants should acknowledge the contextual circumstances in which each of the triggers takes place, which will aid in developing pragmatic measures and make the right decisions towards addressing these triggers during any highway construction project in Nigeria and enhance the chances of project success. Originality/value The context-based approach applied in this study is expected to provide a new insight in understanding the triggers of cost overruns, especially in highway projects in Nigeria and indeed other developing countries with similar governance characteristics","[{""name"": ""Abba Tahir Mahmud"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephen O.

10.1111/jade.12364,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,"Experiential Learning in Basic Design Studio: Body, Space and the Design Process","AbstractBasic Design is the beginning of design course series in architectural education which initiates architecture students to both architectural education and the profession. First‐year design curricula have generally common goals of students’ acquisitions about design knowledge, skill and competence; however, ways of teaching may vary. Here, we discuss our approach to teaching basic design during the second semester focusing on a particular phase of the curriculum. The aim of the article is to evaluate our teaching method, which is based on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory and targets at developing students’ comprehension and internalisation of body and space relations. Experiential Learning Theory underscores a four‐stage learning cycle: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation and active experimentation. Referring to this cycle, we prioritised real‐life experiences to encourage students to explore various ways, modes and stages of designing. The cycle begins with lived experiences of body movements and space through ‘contact improvisation’ which simultaneously involves discovering movements of one’s body in relation to other bodies and space using basics of sharing improvised touch and movement consciousness. While practising contact improvisation in groups, students reflect on their experiences through sketches, photographs and videos.

10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0232,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Evaluation of the critical success factors for sustainable housing delivery: analytic hierarchy process approach,"PurposeDespite the varied housing policies guiding the Nigerian housing provision, its delivery is yet to level up with the global acceptable sustainability requirements. Previous studies revealed that developing countries are yet to unravel and embrace the tenets of sustainable housing delivery. This study, therefore, adopted the analytic hierarchy process survey in evaluating the critical success factors (CSFs) that can enhance the delivery of sustainable housing and, in turn, meeting the nation’s sustainable housing needs.Design/methodology/approachData for the study was sourced from housing developers in Nigeria. A pilot survey was done to reduce the identified success factors into a manageable size. These factors were evaluated using the analytical hierarchy process to ascertain the significant factors for sustainable housing delivery in developing economies.FindingsFindings from the study revealed that government funding towards sustainable housing, access to low-interest housing loan, mandating affordable housing development, ensuring community participation during housing delivery, the involvement of housing stakeholders, ensuring the security of life and properties, use of sustainable materials, adaptable housing design and befitting land use are the significant CSFs required for enhancing sustainable housing delivery.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study seek to inform developers, practitioners and policymakers on the CSFs crucial for sustainability attainment in the built environment.Originality/valueThe CSFs are quite important and they would promote government sustainability programmes, meeting housing needs and if well implemented and adopted thereby solving environmental and socio-economic challenges of traditional housing development. This research has added to the existing literature on sustainable housing delivery by providing information on inclusive CSFs that would enhance the delivery of sustainable housing in the developing economy. Further research of this nature can also be carried out to compare and contrast with other developing economies.","[{""name"": ""Ifeoluwa Benjamin Oluleye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mukaila Bamidele Ogunleye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abiodun Kolawole Oyetunji"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.030"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2008.07.015"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.01.029"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2009.03.057"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.235"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:2(188)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2002)18:4(194)"", ""10.52372/kjps25203"", ""10.1108/09699981011024669"", ""10.1080/15623599.2018.1452098"", ""10.1016/0167-9236(92)90003-8"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6229.2009.00261.x"", ""10.3846/13923730.2014.914082"", ""10.1080/014461997372971"", ""10.1108/02656719810196351"", ""10.1080/01446190801965350"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000362"", ""10.3992/jgb.8.3.166"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.08.031"", ""10.1080/014461998372448"", ""10.1002/sd.1854"", ""10.1108/CI-08-2018-0065"", ""10.1016/j.ijsbe.2017.03.006"", ""10.1016/0166-4972(89)90040-0"", ""10.1108/17505930810931035"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2007.12.010"", ""10.1080/08882746.2010.11430582"", ""10.1002/sd.399"", ""10.28991/cej-030937"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2007)133:10(771)""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Urban Studies', 'Social Psychology', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2023-0191,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Critical application areas of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology for sustainable construction in developing countries: the case of Nigeria,"Purpose This study aims to explore the critical application areas of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology for sustainable buildings. Design/methodology/approach The quantitative research approach was adopted through a structured questionnaire administered to relevant stakeholders of construction projects. The data collected were analysed with the exploratory factor analysis, relative importance index (RII) and fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE). Findings The study’s results have categorised the crucial areas of application where construction industry stakeholders should focus their attention. These areas are divided into four categories: management technologies, production technologies, sensing technologies and monitoring technologies. The findings from the FSE indicate that monitoring technologies represent the most significant category, whereas management technologies rank as the least significant. Moreover, the RII analysis highlights that tools management stands out as the most important application of RFID, while dispute resolution emerges as the least significant RFID application. Practical implications The study establishes the core areas of RFID application and their benefits to sustainable buildings. Consequently, it helps stakeholders (consultants, clients and contractors) to examine the RFID application areas and make informed decision on sustainable construction. Furthermore, it provides systematic proof that can aid the implementation of RFID in developing countries. Originality/value The study provides an insight into the possible application areas and benefits of RFID technology in the construction industry of developing countries. It also developed a conceptual frame for the critical application areas of RFID technology in the construction industry of developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Ahmed Farouk Kineber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Hassan Ali"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oluwaseun Dosumu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kayode Fakunle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oludolapo Ibrahim Olanrewaju"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/su15129242"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-22434-8_8."", ""10.1080/15623599.2023.2185940"", ""10.1002/sd.2589"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106467"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2023-0099"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2023.07.026"", ""10.3390/su151310671"", ""10.3390/businesses2040030"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139924146"", ""10.3390/ijerph18168469"", ""10.1007/s12063-022-00324-1"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.09.002"", ""10.1002/pmj"", ""10.1080/15623599.2022.2073085"", ""10.3390/su11226477"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2006.09.001"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-08-2022-0123"", ""10.1201/9781351212205"", ""10.1061/(asce)0887-3801(2009)23:3(148)"", ""10.1080/15623599.2023.2271214"", ""10.1109/AFGR.2004.1301616"", ""10.3390/resources9090107"", ""10.3758/s13414-010-0016-3"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.future.2013.01.010"", ""10.1080/00207543.2013.858836"", ""10.1061/(asce)0887-3801(2009)23:4(221)"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2008.11.833"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2018-0118"", ""10.31387/oscm0460303"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0159"", ""10.3390/buildings13010178"", ""10.1080/15623599.2023.2267870"", ""10.1007/s00779-008-0213-4"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201817003032"", ""10.3390/SU12197956"", ""10.2991/978-2-494069-31-2"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2022.101631"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2021-0824"", ""10.1108/SASBE-11-2020-0167"", ""10.3390/su15010468"", ""10.1080/23322039.2020.1850400"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109885"", ""10.3390/math11041037"", ""10.1108/CI-08-2017-0067"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-26528-1"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2008.10.011"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0548"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2023.102165"", ""10.17577/ijertv9is040501"", ""10.1007/s11356-021-16376-y"", ""10.1007/s13762-022-04298-2"", ""10.1146/annurev.physchem.54.011002.103811"", ""10.1504/IJTIP.2020.109772"", ""10.12691/ajams-9-1-2"", ""10.3390/math11041003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2009.00592.x"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/781/4/042017"", ""10.3390/su10020116"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-07863-2_60"", ""10.3390/s150715988"", ""10.3390/su13116372"", ""10.1177/0095798418771807"", ""10.1109/CECNet.2013.6703305"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2019.100960"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2004.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.02.004"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2017-0049"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2012.2213268""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-05-2022-0238,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Comparison of machine learning algorithms for evaluating building energy efficiency using big data analytics,"Purpose This study aims to compare and evaluate the application of commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithms used to develop models for assessing energy efficiency of buildings. Design/methodology/approach This study foremostly combined building energy efficiency ratings from several data sources and used them to create predictive models using a variety of ML methods. Secondly, to test the hypothesis of ensemble techniques, this study designed a hybrid stacking ensemble approach based on the best performing bagging and boosting ensemble methods generated from its predictive analytics. Findings Based on performance evaluation metrics scores, the extra trees model was shown to be the best predictive model. More importantly, this study demonstrated that the cumulative result of ensemble ML algorithms is usually always better in terms of predicted accuracy than a single method. Finally, it was discovered that stacking is a superior ensemble approach for analysing building energy efficiency than bagging and boosting. Research limitations/implications While the proposed contemporary method of analysis is assumed to be applicable in assessing energy efficiency of buildings within the sector, the unique data transformation used in this study may not, as typical of any data driven model, be transferable to the data from other regions other than the UK. Practical implications This study aids in the initial selection of appropriate and high-performing ML algorithms for future analysis. This study also assists building managers, residents, government agencies and other stakeholders in better understanding contributing factors and making better decisions about building energy performance. Furthermore, this study will assist the general public in proactively identifying buildings with high energy demands, potentially lowering energy costs by promoting avoidance behaviour and assisting government agencies in making informed decisions about energy tariffs when this novel model is integrated into an energy monitoring system. Originality/value This study fills a gap in the lack of a reason for selecting appropriate ML algorithms for assessing building energy efficiency. More importantly, this study demonstrated that the cumulative result of ensemble ML algorithms is usually always better in terms of predicted accuracy than a single method.","[{""name"": ""Christian Nnaemeka Egwim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hafiz Alaka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oluwapelumi Oluwaseun Egunjobi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alvaro Gomes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iosif Mporas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100077"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2017.10.040"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2017.10.040"", ""10.1007/s11227-020-03540-3"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107936"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2021.110714"", ""10.1016/J.JESTCH.2021.09.010"", ""10.1109/LATW.2019.8704641"", ""10.1016/J.PROCS.2018.05.095"", ""10.1108/ACI-04-2021-0092"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-75729-8_8"", ""10.3390/en13133497"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.07.021"", ""10.1080/02513625.2014.979044"", ""10.1007/S10479-021-04373-W/TABLES/11"", ""10.3390/EN14196429"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2018-0148/FULL/PDF"", ""10.1007/3-540-45014-9_1"", ""10.1016/J.ENBUILD.2021.111208"", ""10.1016/J.ASOC.2021.107473"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-93733-1_41"", ""10.1016/j.mlwa.2021.100166"", ""10.1108/jedt-04-2021-0211"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2008.09.006"", ""10.3390/S22031184"", ""10.1109/ICRITO48877.2020.9197976"", ""10.1038/s41580-021-00407-0"", ""10.1016/J.ASOC.2020.106381"", ""10.1016/J.JESTCH.2021.04.014"", ""10.1016/J.NEDT.2020.104700"", ""10.1016/J.ASOC.2022.108459"", ""10.7150/IJBS.58855"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2019-0303/FULL/PDF"", ""10.36548/jaicn.2021.2.003"", ""10.1155/2021/6679512"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0054/FULL/PDF"", ""10.3390/EN15134715"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-6849-3"", ""10.1016/J.ENBUILD.2021.110740"", ""10.1016/J.JESTCH.2021.06.001"", ""10.1109/JAS.2020.1003021"", ""10.21275/ART20203995"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/2040/1/012022"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.130"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.120658"", ""10.36548/jaicn.2019.2.005"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.120999"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2018-0216/FULL/PDF"", ""10.3390/su13126576"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0193/FULL/PDF"", ""10.1016/J.JOBE.2021.103406"", ""10.1016/J.ESD.2021.11.002"", ""10.1613/jair.614"", ""10.1109/TEM.2018.2876321"", ""10.1016/J.BITEB.2022.101027"", ""10.1016/J.ASOC.2021.108299"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.033"", ""10.1016/J.KNOSYS.2022.108765"", ""10.1016/J.ASOC.2021.107510"", ""10.1061/(asce)sc.1943-5576.0000555"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.110980"", ""10.1016/J.JESTCH.2019.03.009"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1142/1/012012"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0554/FULL/PDF"", ""10.1016/J.ENBUILD.2020.110022"", ""10.1007/S11069-022-05423-7"", ""10.1016/J.ENBUILD.2012.03.003"", ""10.1016/J.EGYPRO.2015.11.630"", ""10.1016/J.NEUCOM.2017.01.026"", ""10.1016/J.ENBUILD.2021.111505""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0153,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Barriers to the implementation of COVID-19 safety regulations: insight from Ghanaian construction sites,"Purpose The new normal introduced by COVID-19 has ushered in new safety regulations that are required to be implemented by all organisations, including the construction industry. The implementation of the COVID-19 regulations, like any health and safety regulation, is not without hindrances. Consequently, this study aims to explore factors hindering the implementation of COVID-19 safety regulations at construction sites in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative research method using an open-ended questionnaire as a data collection instrument. The set of questionnaires were distributed by means of purposive and snowball sampling methods. The collected data were analysed by means of the thematic analysis technique. Findings It became evident that several factors militate against implementing COVID-19 safety regulations at construction sites. Cost of implementing COVID-19 safety measures, lack of compliance and ignorance were identified as the most hindering factors, whereas superstition, lack of personal protective equipment supply and theft of COVID-19 materials were reported by fewer respondents. Research limitations/implications The set of questionnaires were limited to small construction firms who were operating on site within the Central, Western and Greater Accra regions of Ghana during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the findings may be applicable to firms outside these regions because most of the small construction firms in the country share similar characteristics. Practical implications The recommendations proffered could help construction organisations devise strategies to overcome the barriers that hamper the implementation of COVID-19 safety regulations on site. Moreover, the findings could inform policymakers on what is required to enforce compliance on site. Originality/value COVID 19 is still new, and as a result, the body of knowledge is at the infancy stage. This article contributes to advancing the body of knowledge in the area of COVID-19 implementation challenges on construction sites.","[{""name"": ""Fredrick Simpeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Bamfo-Agyei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Amoah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0476"", ""10.1108/JFM-08-2020-0061"", ""10.4236/ojbm.2020.84089"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.07.007"", ""10.3233/PRM-200808"", ""10.37624/IJERT/13.5.2020.828-830"", ""10.1093/cid/ciaa229"", ""10.1080/00140139.2020.1772378"", ""10.36941/mjss-2020-0047"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2004.12.002"", ""10.1108/SASBE-05-2020-0068"", ""10.1093/occmed/kqaa036"", ""10.1002/ajim.23138"", ""10.1108/09670730610666355"", ""10.1177/1090198103259185"", ""10.1093/occmed/51.3.163"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)00042-8"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1874678"", ""10.4038/engineer.v48i3.6840"", ""10.1155/2020/6620539""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Decision Sciences']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2021-0348,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,BIM divide: an international comparative analysis of perceived barriers to implementation of BIM in the construction industry,"Purpose Building information modelling (BIM) research studies are highly contextual as the contexts provide lenses for interpreting the results. However, there has been a growing decontextualization in extant studies especially between the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large firms; and between developed and developing countries. Albeit these contexts are all in the same construction industry, they often react differently to the same conditions. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the perceptions of firms in varying contexts of size and location on the perceived barriers to the implementation of BIM in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. Design/methodology/approach The perceptions of 228 firms gleaned from 26 countries across the 6 continents were collated via an international empirical questionnaire survey. The data was analysed using the mean score, rank agreement analysis, Mann-Whitney U test and factor analysis. Findings The findings revealed the major factors impending BIM implementation in each of the contexts and a comparative analysis emphasized the difference in their perceptions. The findings underscore that there is a general digital divide as regard BIM implementation between the SMEs and large firms, and a deepening divide between the developed and developing countries. Originality/value The study has provided empirical evidence for the BIM divide in the AEC industry, which would influence the promulgation of BIM policy and transferability of best practices across varying contexts of both firm size and country level.","[{""name"": ""Abdullahi Babatunde Saka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel W.M.

10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0473,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Adapting to COVID-19 on construction sites: what are the lessons for long-term improvements in safety and worker effectiveness?,"PurposeSubstantial changes were made on many UK construction projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to explore the unanticipated positive consequences of these and the scope for longer-term learning and developments within the sector.Design/methodology/approachA qualitative approach was used, semi-structured interviews were conducted across six major project sites. Interviewees (n= 33) included site and senior managers, supply chain representatives and occupational safety and health (OSH) professionals. The interviews explored their experiences of working on site during the pandemic, the changes made to work practices and their perceived impacts of these changes.FindingsImproved planning and work sequencing were part of the revised process to make sites COVID-secure. This increased worker effectiveness and housekeeping/tidiness. The view on some sites was that this would improve OSH performance. The changes were perceived to be beneficial but may not be accepted by clients in the long term, as they could result in projects taking longer to complete. The ways in which COVID-19 risk has been communicated and perceived also provides longer-term lessons for the sector’s OSH management and training.Originality/valueConstruction has adapted rapidly and effectively to new ways of working during the pandemic. This research captured in real time some of the changes made and presents an argument for embedding and adopting the changes to improve working arrangements and OSH within the construction sector.","[{""name"": ""Wendy Jones"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alistair G.F.

10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0215,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,The common causes of rework in construction contracts: a diagnostic approach,"Purpose The high rate of rework that occurs in construction projects has a negative effect on the performance of the construction projects. Although several mechanisms have been implemented to control reworking, a comprehensive list of rework causes is yet to be provided to present the common causes that contribute to rework in construction contracts. This paper aims to investigate the most common rework causes that need to be addressed in construction contracts. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method using both the qualitative and quantitative approach is used in this paper. First of all, the study adopted a four-step literature review to introduce the rework research trends and provide statistical reports using descriptive analysis. Next, a comprehensive review has been completed using content analysis to identify the common causes of rework in construction projects. Finally, the common causes in construction contracts are further investigated through a quantitative questionnaire survey to validate the initial results. Findings The results of the review showed an increasing trend of publications on rework over the last three decades. Most of the studies were conducted in Australia, the UK, Nigeria and Hong Kong. Based on further investigation in the study area of sources of rework, 37 causes of rework causes were identified and classified in five groups. Then, the most significant causes of rework in construction contracts were compiled in the list of 22 items. Research limitations/implications The paper’s reported result, contributes to the contract management body of knowledge by proposing a list of common rework causes that can be used by practitioners during the contract negotiation to prevent contractual issues. The result of the review can also be used for further investigation of the relationship between rework and contract conditions. Originality/value The proposed list of common causes of rework in construction contracts allows project parties to improve the terms of the contract in addressing rework, this could result in fewer contractual claims and disputes. The findings of this study will also guide the investigations into the contract conditions, thus the approach used is constructive.","[{""name"": ""Ramin Asadi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suzanne Wilkinson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Olabode Bamidele Rotimi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001725"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000424"", ""10.6106/JCEPM.2016.6.1.011"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1734417"", ""10.1080/01446193.2018.1449955"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0328"", ""10.2478/otmcj-2018-0008"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001324"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000341"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000084"", ""10.1108/ECAM-10-2012-0101"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:3(187)"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.08.009"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001600"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.10.207"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000171"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001534"", ""10.1108/CI-04-2014-0025"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2002)18:2(76)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:10(1076)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000402"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000373"", ""10.1080/15623599.2018.1484856"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2003)19:4(147)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000054"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000136"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(01)00039-4"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000442"", ""10.14525/JJCE.10.1.3536"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1728607"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2013-0038"", ""10.1080/09613210802128269"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2010-0029"", ""10.1139/l04-068"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000669"", ""10.1016/j.csi.2016.08.011"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1033814"", ""10.2478/ace-2019-0034"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1735610"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2018.03.006"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000025"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2017-0002"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000347"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000194"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000552"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000878"", ""10.1016/S0969-7012(98)00017-3""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0178,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Strength and microstructure behaviour of high calcium fly ash based sustainable geo polymer concrete,"Purpose Concrete is a building material widely used for the infrastructural development. Cement is the binding material used for the development of concrete. It is the primary cause of CO2 emission globally. The purpose of this study is to develop sustainable concrete material to satisfy the present need of construction sector. Geopolymer concrete (GPC) is a sustainable concrete developed without the use of cement. Therefore, investigations are being conducted to replace the cement by 100% with high calcium fly ash (FA) as binding material. Design/methodology/approach High calcium FA is used as cementitious binder, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicates (Na2SiO3) are used as alkaline liquids for developing the GPC. Mix proportions with different NaOH molarities of 4, 6, 8 and 10 M are considered to attain the appropriate mix. The method of curing adopted is ambient and oven curing. Workability, compressive strength and microstructure characteristics of GPC are analysed and presented. Findings An increase of NaOH in the mix decreases the workability. Compressive strength of 29 MPa is obtained for Mix-I with 8 M under ambient curing. A polynomial relationship is obtained to predict the compressive strength of GPC. Scanning electron microscope analysis is used to confirm the geo-polymerisation process in the microstructure of concrete. Originality/value This research work focuses on finding some alternative cementitious material for concrete that can replace ordinary portland cement (OPC) to overcome the CO2 emission owing to the utilisation of cement in the construction industry. An attempt has been made to use the waste material (high calcium FA) from thermal power plant for the production of GPC. GPC concrete is the novel building material and alternative to conventional concrete. It is the ecofriendly product contributing towards the improvement of the circular economy in the construction industry. There are several factors that affect the property of GPC such as type of binder material, molarity of activator solution and curing condition. The novelty of this work lies in the approach of using locally available high calcium FA along with manufactured sand for the development of GPC. As this approach is rarely investigated, to prove the attainment of compressive strength of GPC with high calcium FA, an attempt has been made during the present investigation. Other influencing parameter which affects the strength gain has also been analysed in this paper.","[{""name"": ""Vijaya Prasad B."", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Arumairaj Paul Daniel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anand N."", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Siva Kumar Yadav"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.11.069"", ""10.1007/s10853-011-6107-2"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0263"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0156"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.337"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2009.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.07.110"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2010.03.020"", ""10.3390/ma6041485"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2008.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2014.08.008"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.11.152"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2007.02.006"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(98)00243-9"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002165"", ""10.1201/9781420007657.ch26"", ""10.35940/ijitee.L2599.1081219"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/288/1/012019"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.11.016""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

However, 124 valid responses are received giving a response rate of 37per cent. Data collected are analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical tools while the Kruskal Wallis chi-square (χ2) test is used to analyse hypotheses postulated for the study.FindingsFindings reveal that the General Administration (GA) building has high ratings in five technical performance criteria of ambient level of sound in offices, the integrity of materials used for walls, and correctness of stair risers, threads in the building quality of lighting and quantity of lighting. Findings on the functional performance of GA building show that cleaning, friendliness, parking space, landscaping and indoor climate are the top five rated. Findings also reveal that lack of awareness about POE is a top-rated barrier, followed by a lack of orientation of stakeholders and a lack of adequately trained staff.Originality/valueThe study contributes to the body of knowledge on POE, particularly in universities by conducting an empirical evaluation of both technical and functional performance of the University of Uyo buildings.

10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0069,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Investigating the principal factors impacting knowledge management implementation in construction organisations,"Purpose Knowledge management (KM) is crucial to ensure construction organisations effectively take advantage of existing expertise, engendering faster and more effective decision-making. Most importantly, it helps organisations to learn from past experiences. Despite its increasing academic attention, the implementation of KM is still relatively slow across the construction industry. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to gain a renewed understanding of the extent of KM practices in construction. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative approach using a questionnaire survey was used to prioritise the 15 critical factors and 9 enables of knowledge creation. Finally, an exploratory factor analysis is used to determine the principal elements of successful KM implementation in construction. Findings KM in a construction organisation is significantly influenced by knowledge sharing, collaboration, learning from mistakes, employee training and knowledge strategy. On the other hand, knowledge is created mostly through project mistakes, individual constant self-improvement, challenging barrier, review session and brainstorming discussion. With factor analysis technique, three underlying factors impacting KM practices are capacity and capability improvement, long-term commitment and innovation and synergetic working culture. Research limitations/implications Questionnaire survey was used as the single data collection instrument. The findings of the current study shed light on the salient issues affecting KM practices in construction but may not generalise to organisations operating in other industries. Practical implications These findings can support first-order KM implementation decision-making and enable the exploitation of existing knowledge assets towards achieving sustainable development and competitive advantage. Originality/value Effective KM practices are about finding the best ways to deliver the right knowledge to the right person at the right time, enabling informed decision-making and improving operational efficiencies. The contribution of this study is built upon the examination of the underlying factors of KM implementation; the findings provide insights into the core aspects of KM practices, facilitating managers in prioritising KM strategies that are really going to make a difference.","[{""name"": ""Jeffrey Boon Hui Yap"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hui Min Toh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01446190701744350"", ""10.1108/14637151211270126"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2016-0085"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000986"", ""10.1080/10429247.2010.11431849"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2015-0144"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000443"", ""10.25019/MDKE/5.4.01"", ""10.1177/875697289903000304"", ""10.1108/09699980510600107"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.10.005"", ""10.1108/JKM-08-2014-0353"", ""10.1016/j.im.2014.03.007"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000681"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.03.015"", ""10.1108/09699980710780728"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2010-0057"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2015-0075"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2006)132:9(928)"", ""10.1108/MD-11-2016-0778"", ""10.1108/13673270510590227"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2002)18:2(76)"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1033818"", ""10.4236/psych.2018.98126"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.08.042"", ""10.1007/s12205-008-0367-7"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2009.06.109"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000482"", ""10.1080/014461900370681"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001170"", ""10.1080/09537287.2018.1518551"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.05.010"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000545"", ""10.1108/17260531011034655"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2015-0072"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v5i1.2941"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57478-3_1"", ""10.1057/9781137552105_4"", ""10.1108/13673270710728277"", ""10.1108/14637151011049403"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-12-2015-0120"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.01.012"", ""10.1108/JKM-05-2016-0203"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1012138"", ""10.1108/13673270810852467"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.02.008"", ""10.1515/bsrj-2016-0001"", ""10.1080/01446190801905406"", ""10.3846/jcem.2018.1626"", ""10.1016/j.hrmr.2009.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.04.010"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001456"", ""10.1080/09537287.2018.1448127"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2017-0067"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2017-0002"", ""10.1080/17452007.2017.1384714"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.828843"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.05.009"", ""10.1287/orsc.13.3.339.2780""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction', 'Communication']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0108,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Ethical and unethical behaviour of built environment professionals in the Ghanaian construction industry,"PurposeThe construction industry is an enabler of economic growth in developing countries, but its performance is governed by the professional behaviour of construction professionals. Unethical behaviour (UB) breaches codes of practice and undermines economic performance hence, ubiquitous academic attention has been given to understanding this phenomenon. This paper aims to contribute to the ensuing discourse by reporting upon the most critical ethical behaviours (EBs and UBs) of professionals in the Ghanaian construction industry (GCI).Design/methodology/approachThe study compounded identified factors into a closed-ended questionnaire in a quantitative research strategy. Data analysis was conducted using the relative importance index and one samplet-test. To measure the reliability of the scale, Cronbach’s alpha was used, which indicated that all measured items were reliable for further analysis.FindingsThe study confirmed that professionals within the GCI are aware of the existence of UBs and revealed that the most prevalent ethical conducts exhibited, namely, level of accuracy, accountability, honesty, reliability, fairness and respect for colleagues. Common unethical conducts exhibited included: favouritism, bribery and corruption, professional negligence, falsification, fraud and overbilling.Research limitations/implicationsThe study reported on the dominant ethical conduct among built environment professionals. The claims put forward in the analysis are, thus, affected by Ghana’s social, economic and political environments, which could restrict the generalization of the findings.Practical implicationsIncipient findings presented from this research will guide stakeholders to develop and device strategies that will aid alleviate persistent ethical issues within the built environment.Social implicationsThe study highlights individuals’ perspectives on ethical issues persistent in the built environment. The findings suggest individuals adhere to ethical practices in a project environment by the evidence presented.Originality/valueThis pioneering study is a novel assessment on EBs and UBs of built environment professionals in the GCI. The study supplementary adds value to the literature on ethical and unethical practices. By identifying these practices, construction firms have a competitive edge in combating UB and promoting EB among built environment professionals in the GCI.","[{""name"": ""Ewald Kuoribo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""De-Graft Owusu-Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roland Yomoah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caleb Debrah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex Acheampong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.02.142"", ""10.1108/SASBE-06-2020-0092"", ""10.1061/(asce)me.1943-5479.0000555"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0386.2007.00378.x"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2015-0034"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001353"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0495-0"", ""10.1108/SASBE-06-2020-0089"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2019-0518"", ""10.3311/CCC2019-037"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.12.072"", ""10.9744/ced.22.1.37-46"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2016.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.02.142"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.02.142"", ""10.4324/9781315797564"", ""10.1108/09699981111165194"", ""10.1007/s11948-015-9682-9"", ""10.1108/JOPP-11-2019-0075"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000886"", ""10.1108/PR-11-2015-0293"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2002)128:5(446)"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-06-2016-0049"", ""10.1080/01446193.2015.1057193"", ""10.22495/rgc7i4c2art4"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.10.552"", ""10.1080/15623599.2013.10773211"", ""10.1111/1467-9299.00218"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3463293"", ""10.21315/jcdc2016.21.2.7"", ""10.1016/j.cscm.2020.e00439"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2016-0028"", ""10.1108/17538371011036563"", ""10.35188/UNU-WIDER/2018/561-9"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0257"", ""10.5539/jsd.v4n4p175"", ""10.1108/17561451011087346"", ""10.1007/s10551-005-3403-2"", ""10.3126/jacem.v3i0.18905"", ""10.14445/22315381/IJETT-V60P201"", ""10.3109/0142159X.2011.564682"", ""10.1037/a0036708"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000012"", ""10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143745"", ""10.1108/09699980310466596"", ""10.4103/0972-6748.77642"", ""10.4135/9781412985642"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.05.004"", ""10.1080/10572317.2011.10762881"", ""10.1108/00197850810886487"", ""10.1080/01446190110101218"", ""10.1007/s10551-006-9305-0"", ""10.1108/09699980510584485"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000316"", ""10.1108/17561450911001252"", ""10.1046/j.1365-232x.2001.00206.x"", ""10.62868/pbj.v1i1.25"", ""10.1080/02646811.2016.1179464US"", ""10.1111/puar.12164"", ""10.4324/9780080469478"", ""10.4324/9781315008196""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2020-0078,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Dry sliding wear performance on self-healing Al6061 composites,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the tribological performance of the developed self-healing Al6061 composite and to optimize the operating conditions for enhanced tribo-performance of the developed material. Design/methodology/approach A unique procedure has been adopted to convert the sand casted Al6061 into self-healing material by piercing a low melting point solder material with and without MoS2. Taguchi-based L9 orthogonal array has been used to optimize the number of experiments and analyze the influence of operating parameters such as speed, sliding distance and load on material wear. Findings The results reveal that the paper shows the self-healing and self-repair is possible in metal through piercing low melting point alloy. Then, the load has a significant influence over other input parameters in predicting the wear behavior of developed material. Moreover, addition of MoS2 does not affect the tribo-performance of the developed material. The study concludes that the developed self-healing Al6061 has huge potential to be used in mechanical industry. Research limitations/implications The concept of self-healing in metals are very challenging task due to very slow diffusion rate of atoms at room temperature. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to explore the other new techniques to create self-healing in metals. Practical implications The self-healing materials had shown huge potential to be used in mechanical industry. The current investigation established a structural fabrication and testing procedure to understand the effects of various parameters on wear. The conclusion from the experimentation and optimization helps researchers to developed and create self-healing in metals. Originality/value The previous research works were not focused on the study of tribological property of self-healing metal composite. With the best of author’s knowledge, no one has reported tribological study, as well as optimization of parameters such as speed, load and sliding distance on wear in self-healing metals composite.","[{""name"": ""Nitin Kumar Gupta"", ""affiliation"": [""DIT University Department of Mechanical Engineering, , Dehradun,""]}, {""name"": ""Gananath Doulat Thakre"", ""affiliation"": [""Indian Institute of Petroleum – CSIR Department of Tribology, , Dehradun,""]}, {""name"": ""Manoj Kumar"", ""affiliation"": [""DIT University Department of Mechanical Engineering, , Dehradun,""]}]","[""10.1016/j.apmt.2016.11.002"", ""10.14429/dsj.65.8676"", ""10.1361/105994906X150731"", ""10.1590/1980-5373-MR-2017-0009"", ""10.1007/s11837-014-0912-4"", ""10.1088/2053-1591/ab23b1"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-6412-9_53"", ""10.1007/s12633-017-9675-1"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2012.05.048"", ""10.1007/s11837-014-0948-5"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2014.12.376"", ""10.1007/s00170-015-7528-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24007-7_3"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2012.09.015"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.07.041"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2012.02.013"", ""10.15680/IJIRSET.2014.0311017"", ""10.1016/j.triboint.2009.12.056"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2008.06.031"", ""10.1063/1.5058255"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-803581-8.01946-9"", ""10.1016/S0924-0136(98)00079-X"", ""10.4236/jmmce.2015.31001""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0156,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Development of sustainable construction material from fly ash class C,"Purpose Environmental issues caused by the production of Portland cement have led to it being replaced by waste materials such as fly ash, which is more economical and safer for the environment. Also, fly ash is a material with sustainable properties. Therefore, this paper aims to focus on the development of sustainable construction materials using 100% high-calcium fly ash and potassium hydroxide (KOH)-based alkaline solution and study the engineering properties of the resulting fly ash-based geopolymer concrete. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the mechanical properties of the geopolymer concrete such as compressive strength, flexural strength, curing time and slump. In phase I of the study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were added to determine their effect on the strength of the geopolymer mortar. The results derived from the experiments indicate that mortar and concrete made with 100% fly ash C require an alkaline solution to produce similar (comparable) strength characteristics as Portland cement concrete. However, it was determined that increasing the amount of KOH generates a considerable amount of heat causing the concrete to cure too quickly; therefore, it is notable to forming a proper bond was unable to form a stronger bond. This study also determined that the addition of CNTs to the mix makes the geopolymer concrete tougher than the traditional concrete without CNT. Design/methodology/approach Tests were conducted to determine properties of the geopolymer concrete such as compressive strength, flexural strength, curing time and slump. In Phase I of the study, CNTs were studied to determine their effect on the strength of the geopolymer mortar. Findings The results derived from the experiments indicate that mortar and concrete made with 100% fly ash C require an alkaline solution to produce the same strength characteristics as Portland cement concrete. However, it was determined that increasing the amount of KOH generates too much heat causing the concrete to cure too quickly; therefore, it is notable to forming a proper bond.

10.1111/jade.12287,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,"Community-Based Art Education in China: Practices, Issues and Challenges","AbstractArt educators have been promoting Community‐Based Art Education (CBAE) in schools in order to enhance students’ sense of socio‐cultural identity and contextual learning about local art and culture. It cannot only bridge the gap between the students’ daily lives and the communities and art, but can also enhance their inquiry, discovery and meaning‐making abilities. In China, the community‐based approach plays a significant role in the National Standards for Visual Arts, and Chinese art educators have been applying CBAE in school art education for decades. However, Western art educators are still unfamiliar with the issues, practices and challenges related to CBAE in China owing to language constraints. In light of the above, this article aims to initiate a dialogue between Western and Chinese CBAE researchers through discourse and discussions on the main issues related to CBAE in Chinese art education. It outlines current practices of, and issues related to, CBAE from the perspective of Chinese art education. It also discusses the three major challenges to the implementation of CBAE in China, namely the conflict between indigenous knowledge and official knowledge in the school art curriculum, lack of motivation among teachers, and neglect of context in the practice of local art in schools. It is hoped that this article it will enrich our overall knowledge of CBAE and contribute to the understanding of CBAE from a global perspective.","[{""name"": ""Ning Luo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chung‐Yim Lau"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/0159630930140101"", ""10.1207/s15327892mcp0701_7"", ""10.1515/9781400823574.1"", ""10.1080/13613324.2015.1013460"", ""10.2307/3193848"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839418031"", ""10.1111/jade.12174"", ""10.2307/1320279"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-1727-6.ch001"", ""10.1080/00043125.2005.11651529"", ""10.1080/00393541.2016.1258530""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0012,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Categorising green building features in developing countries: The case of South Africa,"Purpose This study aims to explore the concept of green building by determining a suitable system for categorising green building features (GBFs) that are considered significant in enhancing the value of a building in a developing economy with particular reference to South Africa. The motivation for categorising the features is based on the perception that the upsurge in adopting green building and sustainability has ushered in a new and formidable set of challenges to practising professionals in terms of recognising the most significant value-adding GBFs. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was adopted, involving randomly selected construction professionals within the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical analysis tools. Findings Based on the mean ranking analysis, the top three most important features, amongst others, were kitchen and water-closet (WC) water efficient fittings, megawatt photovoltaic solar plant and water metering for monitoring and leak detection. Additionally, an exploratory factor analysis revealed that the underlying grouped features were “recycled materials and high-performance building energy design”, “water-saving and solar technologies”, “biometric system and acoustical feature”, “sensor control and natural daylight design”, “daylight harnessing feature”, “high-performance hydrologic strategy and noise control feature” and “special utility feature and water efficiency technologies”. Research limitations/implications This study was conducted and limited only to the Western Cape Province of South Africa. However, the findings have practical significance to the generality of green building projects and may serve as a useful guide for other developing countries. Originality/value This study broadens the viewpoint of construction professionals to recognise and prioritise the most important GBFs in South Africa that increase the value of a building. To create a system for assessing the sustainability of a building, the seven components and the features associated with them may be useful.","[{""name"": ""Faith Owoha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eric Kwame Simpeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julius Ayodeji Fapohunda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Divine Kwaku Ahadzie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry Mensah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.101"", ""10.1080/00038628.2012.667938"", ""10.1260/1351-010X.19.4.283"", ""10.1108/PM-11-2015-0056"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2012.02.006"", ""10.1080/09599910701599266"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2014.01.009"", ""10.1016/j.jns.2017.01.032"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.079"", ""10.2172/1013074"", ""10.1177/1420326X14536066"", ""10.1108/09699981111180890"", ""10.1108/14630010910963133"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2018-0004"", ""10.1080/10835547.2015.12091873"", ""10.1002/ajim.22166"", ""10.1108/PM-03-2017-0016"", ""10.1080/10835547.2010.12091795"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.02.013"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.047"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.12.025"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.04.005"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-06-2020-0108"", ""10.1080/10286608.2016.1247832"", ""10.3390/su6096088"", ""10.1080/10835547.2009.12091787""]","['Engineering', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Speech and Hearing', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0594,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,An investigation of barriers to the application of building information modelling in Nigeria,"Purpose The utilisation of building information modelling (BIM) technology is rapidly increasing among construction professionals across the world. Notwithstanding, recent studies revealed a low level of BIM implementation in the context of the Nigerian construction sector. Moreover, previous studies have established that BIM application comes with its share of various barriers. Therefore, this study aims to carry out an on-site survey on barriers to the application of BIM on construction sites in the Nigerian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach An extensive review of literature on BIM barriers was conducted, from where 33 factors were identified as significant BIM barriers peculiar to the developing countries. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to the targeted respondents, who are practicing professionals in the Nigerian construction industry, based on the identified barriers. The data collected were analysed by using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings The principal component analysis revealed that 27 barriers were peculiar to the Nigerian construction industry. The “lack of familiarity with BIM capacity, habitual resistance to change from the traditional style of design and build, and poor awareness of BIM benefit” were identified as the three most critical barriers hindering BIM application on construction sites in the Nigerian construction industry. Practical implications This study reveals key information on the peculiar barriers to BIM application in the Nigerian construction industry. The avoidance of these barriers will not only assist various construction stakeholders in the successful implementation of BIM application on a construction project but also promote information management systems and productivity within the construction industry to a great extent. These will further improve post-construction activities. Originality/value This study provides a substantial understanding of BIM state of the art in the context of barriers hindering BIM application on construction sites in the Nigerian construction industry.","[{""name"": ""James Olaonipekun Toyin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Modupe Cecilia Mewomo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/IJBPA-09-2017-0043"", ""10.32732/jcec.2018.7.2.107"", ""10.1108/ECAM-02-2021-0165"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2020.02.002"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/737/1/012007"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2020-0084"", ""10.3389/fbuil.2021.520154"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000127"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-05-2019-0047"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2009)23:2(64)"", ""10.1080/10835547.2012.12091834"", ""10.1080/23311916.2021.1886476"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2018-0204"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100764"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.235"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100777"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.03.060"", ""10.3390/su12083190"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2021-0432"", ""10.4018/IJ3DIM.2015100102"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(1989)3:1(18)"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.32738/JEPPM.201201.0004"", ""10.5772/58447"", ""10.1108/17561451011087337"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2013.04.097"", ""10.1166/jctn.2019.8542"", ""10.30880/ijscet.2021.12.01.027"", ""10.13140/RG.2.2.18474.06088"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2020-0042"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1988196"", ""10.1108/SS-12-2015-0053"", ""10.1016/j.cad.2009.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2006.01.010"", ""10.1108/CI-09-2019-0087"", ""10.1108/ECAM-02-2018-0056"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2008.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.04.018"", ""10.21315/jcdc2020.25.2.8"", ""10.3846/jcem.2021.14105"", ""10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p079"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2018-0158"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2020.02.002"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v15i3.4608"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-03-2019-0125"", ""10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p079""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1111/jade.12307,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,'Females Don't Need to be Reluctant': Employing Design Thinking to Harness Creative Confidence and Interest in STEAM,"AbstractThere is great gender gap in mathematics and science among countries around the world, but the gender gap is one of the largest in Japan. In order to address this issue, we evaluated an educational intervention to empower the next generation of female youths by employing design thinking to ignite their interests in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) fields. In this article, we explain the rationale for the intervention, describe the unique three‐day curriculum employing design thinking, and share the results from the intervention. There are four key findings of our study. After participating in the workshop, the middle school female students showed greater interest in STEAM fields, demonstrated increased levels of creative confidence, cultivated a greater sense of empathy for others, and exhibited greater appreciation for collaboration.

However, people who are color–blind often have difficulties understanding that information because most systems are designed for people who can distinguish colors. The purpose of this study is to propose color combinations for wayfinding signage in public areas that are discriminable and esthetically pleasing for people with and without color blindness. By using a simulation method, this study examined how people with color blindness perceive eight hues of red, green, blue, yellow, orange, purple, cyan, and chartreuse on the natural color system color chart. It also investigated how the current wayfinding signage in Seoul is friendly to the color blind and presented examples of color–blind–friendly color combinations by applying color functions and color harmony theories. This study helps people with color blindness, by offering design professionals insight into more inclusive wayfinding signage that will be of use to people with and without color blindness.","[{""name"": ""Heejin Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Michigan State University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Eunsil Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Michigan State University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Gyoung–sil Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""Ewha Woman's University, South Korea""]}]","[""10.1109/iUSEr.2011.6150551"", ""10.1364/JOSAA.14.002647"", ""10.1002/9781119174615"", ""10.1364/JOSAA.21.000176"", ""10.1016/j.is.2013.12.002"", ""10.1111/j.1444-0938.2006.00031.x"", ""10.3844/jcssp.2013.794.810"", ""10.1145/1240624.1240855"", ""10.14714/CP58.270"", ""10.1017/S1431927615000173"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.1997.tb00246.x"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2009.113"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27851-8_232-7"", ""10.1111/0004-5608.00043"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.1993.tb00068.x"", ""10.1097/00006324-198905000-00006"", ""10.1038/nmeth.1618""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0338,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,The need for and benefits of buildability analysis: Nigeria as a case study,"Purpose Buildability analysis has a potential of improving the outcomes of construction projects. However, the usage of buildability analysis is not well pronounced within the construction sector. This study aims to provide understanding of the concept of buildability analysis with the view to predicting the future stance for buildability analysis. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a survey research method. Questionnaires were administered to purposively selected group of construction professionals working in Nigeria. A total of 82 questionnaires were administered among the sampled respondents, out of which a total of 51 (62.2%) were adequately filled and returned. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings The results revealed inability of the designers and constructors to have a common upstanding of the entire construction process, fragmented nature of the construction industry and poor correlation between design and construction as the most essential needs for buildability analysis. On the benefits of buildability analysis, the results showed increase in efficiency, save wasteful efforts and quality improvement as the most significant ones. In addition, the results from the study revealed that there is a statistically significant difference in some of the needs for and benefits of buildability analysis among the survey participants. Originality/value The study identified three future stances for buildability analysis to include building unity, efficient and effective construction and high competition. Framework for buildability analysis was developed aimed at providing guidance to professionals in achieving enhanced project production information. The findings provide in-depth insight of the needs for and benefits of buildability analysis that can inform professionals in the construction industry to adopt buildability analysis programme as a lasting solution to most design challenges and buildability problems confronting the sector.","[{""name"": ""Innocent Chigozie Osuizugbo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.9734/BJAST/2015/12617"", ""10.21315/jcdc2016.21.2.5"", ""10.25103/jestr.031.24"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.07.259"", ""10.1080/01446190802570498"", ""10.2478/jeppm-2020-0007"", ""10.2478/emj-2020-0011"", ""10.3390/buildings5020521"", ""10.1139/L06-022"", ""10.1108/02656710710757781""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

After a general exploration of the concept of beauty, this article builds an alternative idea of beauty, namely, beauty as spontaneity. In particular, it argues that beauty in the urban realm greatly depends on forms and orders that can hardly be comprehensively designed but rather emerge as the result of the freedom granted to multiple urban agents to express themselves in space. In this article the works of Jacobs and Romano are analysed and explored. Starting from some of their main ideas, the paper suggests certain planning and design tactics to nurture this kind of beauty and provides some essential ethical principles.","[{""name"": ""Stefano Cozzolino"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/9789004660601"", ""10.1177/1473095207077587"", ""10.1080/713683970"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-5246-7"", ""10.1057/palgrave.udi.9000080"", ""10.3390/urbansci3030066"", ""10.1177/2399808319857451"", ""10.1080/13574809.2019.1705776"", ""10.1057/udi.2015.28"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226321158.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9140-3"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-4386-9_4"", ""10.1057/palgrave.udi.9000184"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac2.7.0040"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2019.01.039"", ""10.4337/9781786439185.00014"", ""10.1177/2399808319857721"", ""10.1057/udi.2013.32"", ""10.1057/s41289-018-0065-0"", ""10.1080/13574800802670929"", ""10.1057/s41289-017-0048-6""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Urban Studies', 'Building and Construction', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0138,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Facilitating compliance with BIM ISO 19650 naming convention through automation,"Purpose To foster effective implementation of building information modelling (BIM), it is guided by standards and protocols that require files naming in a format, containing a string of letters and digits in a tightly defined manner, which is perceived to be time-consuming, error-prone and serves as a barrier to BIM adoption. This paper aims to present a BIM-based plug-in solution (Auto-BIMName) that facilitates automated naming in compliance with BIM standards. Design/methodology/approach The Auto-BIMName portal has an information management system (IMS) for generating a master information delivery plan (MIDP), which serves as pre-requisites to effective file naming. Once the naming schema is implemented through text input controls for a project name, volume, level and number, the Revit plugin communicates with its IMS to fetch the name string or concatenate the string in line with the ISO 19650 convention, where the IMS is unused. The system was validated through a simulated collaborative project. Findings System testing and evaluation confirmed that the Auto-BIMName will ease the process of file naming, thereby facilitating collaboration efficiency, naming consistency across project teams and lifecycle stages, ease of file naming, time-saving and inducement for BIM implementation, etc. By linking information from MIDP in the BIM execution plan, the platform enhanced information management processes and improved coordination across project teams and lifecycle stages. Originality/value Apart from demonstrating how the automated naming platform enhances project performance, information management and coordination, the paper provides a practical demonstration of how the construction industry will benefit from enhanced digitalisation and process automation.","[{""name"": ""Saheed O.

10.3233/JID200005,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,Environment: The First Thing to Look at in Conceptual Design,"This paper aims to addresses three questions related to conceptual design: 1) Why is environment important? 2) What is environment? and 3) How to analyze environment? Unlike product-, function (affordance)-, or user-centered methodologies, it is argued that the known environment of a product to be designed must be the first thing to be looked at in a conceptual design. The environment can be categorized into three types: the natural, the built and the human. A complete set of environment for a design is implied in the lifecycle of a product to be designed, which can be further defined by lifecycle activities in terms of time. The analysis of environment consists of three activities: 1) determine decision directions by asking design questions based on a design problem statement; 2) clarify the design problem statement by answering questions following the decision direction; and 3) formulate an environment system from a design problem statement. The process is driven by asking the right questions by analyzing the ROM diagram of the design problem statement. The answers to the questions follow the lifecycle analysis of the product and its environment components. This paper completes a detailed procedure for Environment Analysis, which is the one of the three activities in Environment-Based Design (EBD).","[{""name"": ""Yong Zeng"", ""affiliation"": [""Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada""]}]",[],['Engineering'],['Mechanical Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The technologies employed here often make use of artificial intelligence (AI) and its common form, machine learning (ML) to augment or replace the work completed by human agents. The recent emergence of a variety of design automation platforms inspired the authors to undertake a review of the research literature on the impact of Automation, AI and ML on visual communication, and its subset practice of graphic design, with a view to understanding the implications for the education of practitioners entering that specific field. This review discovered that there was relatively little research published on the topic but what did exist noted that graphic design as we have known it has an uncertain future. Furthermore, the scant literature argued for a shift in educational and professional focus away from the aesthetic and technical skills required to design visual modes of communication and towards a deeper engagement with the softer, more human skills associated with negotiation, facilitation and judgement. The paucity of literature on this topic suggests to the authors that visual communication design education and the industry are poorly prepared for the impact of automation, AI and ML on them.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Matthews"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Barrie Shannon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Roxburgh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352868"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00261"", ""10.1386/adch.16.1.117_1"", ""10.1007/s00146-017-0736-1"", ""10.1111/jade.12231"", ""10.1162/07479360152681083"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352666"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352774"", ""10.1201/9780203301302.ch4"", ""10.1080/17547075.2019.1609279"", ""10.1111/dmj.12041"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352676"", ""10.1056/NEJMp1606181"", ""10.1080/14606925.2019.1594979"", ""10.1080/15710880701875068"", ""10.3998/dialectic.14932326.0002.103"", ""10.1162/DESI_A_0061"", ""10.1111/jade.12048"", ""10.1038/s41551-018-0305-z""]",['Computer Science'],"['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7662), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7556)]]"

The toolkit has a simple structure and uses basic geometric three‐dimensional forms made of various surface materials, such as rubber, wood, metal, acrylic and marble, which evoke distinct tactile sensations. The toolkit substitutes the items used in paper‐based prototyping, such as construction paper, glue, scissors, paper cups and permanent markers, in the prototyping stage of the design thinking workshop process. Students’ thoughts are expressed in three‐dimensional forms while they empathise with other students through conversation. The materials used are sophisticated, empathy‐oriented and provide easy access to rapid prototyping. Herein, we (1) explain the components of the developed toolkit, (2) provide a specific curriculum guide, (3) show the results of student experimentation with the toolkit in the prototyping stage of the design thinking workshop process and (4) demonstrate the toolkit’s effectiveness by observing the students’ creations and statements. Open coding and selective coding were used to analyse the themes that emerged from the interviews by students who participated in the workshop. We argue that the new prototyping toolkit can significantly promote students’ creativity and design sensibility.","[{""name"": ""Hyun‐Kyung Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joo Eun Park"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/caim.12153"", ""10.2307/258557"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01631.x"", ""10.1080/00393541.2005.11650075"", ""10.1111/jade.12220""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2020-0413,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Criticality of project knowledge and experience in the delivery of construction projects,"Purpose Poor project knowledge and inadequate experience are frequently linked to construction time-cost overruns. This paper aims to expound on the criticality of project knowledge and experience in the successful delivery of projects in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach Following a detailed literature review, a quantitative positivist approach with a questionnaire survey involving industry professionals is used to appraise the 30 prevalent causes of time-cost overruns according to frequency, effectiveness and importance indices. The data are then subjected to Spearman’s rank correlation tests and exploratory factor analysis. Findings Using the importance index, which assimilates both frequency and effectiveness indices, the criticality of knowledge and experience in the overall context is seen as fundamental for addressing the contractor’s faulty planning and scheduling, construction mistakes and defective work, site management and supervision, delayed/slow decision-making, incomplete drawings and design documents and change/variation orders. Spearman’s rank correlation tests indicate a good consensus of perceptions among the key parties involved. Next, an exploratory factor analysis uncovers six underlying knowledge-based factors affecting construction performance, relating to inaccurate resource estimates, design changes, resource shortages, lack of experience, incompetence and mistakes and defects. Originality/value The study draws out the repercussions of the hitherto limited research into the deficiencies in knowledge and experience in undertaking construction projects to enhance performance using knowledge management functions.","[{""name"": ""Jeffrey Boon Hui Yap"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ban Leong Lim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Skitmore"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jason Gray"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01446190701744350"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2016-0085"", ""10.1108/09699980710731308"", ""10.1080/01446190802541457"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000148"", ""10.1108/JFM-11-2016-0052"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.11.010"", ""10.19026/rjaset.5.4706"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000443"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.10.005"", ""10.1108/13673270210450450"", ""10.1080/01446190903394541"", ""10.1080/01446193.2012.717705"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.10.004"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2016-0003"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.07.004"", ""10.1080/01446190600827033"", ""10.1080/01441640309904"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.09.001"", ""10.1002/pmj.20239"", ""10.1108/ECAM-10-2012-0101"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.08.009"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2014-0006"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.07.003"", ""10.1080/014461997373132"", ""10.3846/1392-3730.2008.14.4"", ""10.1002/pmj.21266"", ""10.1007/s12205-008-0367-7"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2002)128:5(446)"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2014.07.002"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2002)128:1(18)"", ""10.1016/j.dibe.2019.100001"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2018.01.007"", ""10.1080/09537287.2018.1424961"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-10-2013-0042"", ""10.1108/09699980410570166"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(00)00037-5"", ""10.1080/01446191003674519"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.09.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.11.007"", ""10.1108/17538370810846405"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.04.004"", ""10.1108/14725961011019067"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.10.005"", ""10.1108/09699980610646494"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.08.003"", ""10.1080/01446190801905406"", ""10.6106/JCEPM.2017.3.30.001"", ""10.1108/ECAM-10-2016-0227"", ""10.1080/09537287.2019.1572247"", ""10.1080/09537287.2018.1448127"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000709"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1629864"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-02-2019-0034"", ""10.1177/8756972819829641"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.828843"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-05-2017-0052""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2022-0428,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Circular building adaptability in adaptive reuse: multiple case studies in the Netherlands,"Purpose The application of circular building adaptability (CBA) in adaptive reuse becomes an effective action for resource efficiency, long-lasting usability of the built environment and the sped-up transition to a circular economy (CE). This paper aims to explore to which extent CBA-related strategies are applied in adaptive reuse projects, considering enablers and obstacles. Design/methodology/approach A stepwise theory-practice-oriented approach was followed. Multiple-case studies of five circular adaptive reuse projects in The Netherlands were investigated, using archival research and in-depth interviews. A cross-case analysis of the findings was deductively conducted, to find and replicate common patterns. Findings The study revealed that configuration flexibility, product dismantlability and material reversibility were applied across the case studies, whereas functional convertibility and building maintainability were less applied. Low cost of material reuse, collaboration among team members and organisational motivation were frequently observed enabling factors. Lack of information, technical complexities, lack of circularity expertise and infeasibility of innovative circular solutions were frequently observed obstacles to applying CBA. Practical implications This paper provides practitioners with a set of CBA strategies that have been applied in the real world, facilitating the application of CBA in future adaptive reuse projects. Moreover, this set of strategies provides policymakers with tools for developing supportive regulations or amending existing regulations for facilitating CE through adaptive reuse.

10.1108/JEDT-09-2018-0148,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Assessing determinants of sustainable upgrade of existing buildings The case of sustainable technologies for energy efficiency,"Purpose Estimates show that close to 90% of the buildings we will need in 2050 are already built and occupied. The increase in the existing building stock has affected energy consumption thereby negatively impacting the environment. The purpose of this paper is to assess determinants of sustainable upgrade of existing buildings through the adoption and application of sustainable technologies. The study also ranks sustainable technologies adopted by the professionals who participated in the survey with an in-built case study. Design/methodology/approach As part of the overall methodology, a detailed literature review on the nature and characteristics of sustainable upgrade and the sustainable technologies adopted was undertaken. A survey questionnaire with an in-built case study was designed to examine all the sustainable technologies adopted to improve energy consumption in Australia. The survey was administered to sustainability consultants, architects, quantity surveyors, facility managers and engineers in Australia. Findings The results show a total of 24 technologies which are mostly adopted to improve energy consumption in existing buildings. A factor analysis shows the main components as: lighting and automation, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HAVC) systems and equipment, envelope, renewable energy and passive technologies. Originality/value The findings bridge the gap in the literature on the adoption and application of sustainable technologies to upgrade existing buildings. The technologies can be adopted to reduce the excessive energy consumption patterns in existing buildings.","[{""name"": ""John Dadzie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Goran Runeson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Grace Ding"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.12.403"", ""10.1108/00438020210415488"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2008.02.025"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.10.072"", ""10.1007/s12053-012-9168-4"", ""10.1016/0167-2681(94)90053-1"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.046"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.056"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.10.092"", ""10.3390/en5104110"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.08.027"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.11.081"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2009.10.030"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.273"", ""10.3390/buildings8040057"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.07.062"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2017.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.06.082"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.056"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.10.005"", ""10.1582/LEUKOS.2007.04.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.06.024"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.10.008"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.05.039"", ""10.1108/20466091211287128"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.09.031"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.10.057"", ""10.1007/s12053-009-9041-2"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.100"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.03.030"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2011.08.010"", ""10.1177/1558689806298224"", ""10.1080/09613210802645924"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.04.032"", ""10.3390/su10030766"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.10.224"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.02.006"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.10.002"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000316"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.067"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.08.018"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.09.093"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2013.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.09.012"", ""10.1108/14635780810908398"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.11.066"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2008.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2016.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.137"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-11-2016-0068"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.024"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.10.326"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2015.04.020"", ""10.1108/02630801211288189"", ""10.3390/su7011081"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2008.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.11.051"", ""10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p079"", ""10.3390/su9061007"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.139"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.046"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.05.030"", ""10.1177/0143624417728187"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2015.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2005.01.001"", ""10.1680/ensu.2005.158.2.89"", ""10.1108/02630800910956470"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.10.014"", ""10.3846/1648-715X.2008.12.53-68"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.10.023""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

However, how this development will affect industrial design education practice is not clear enough yet. The purpose of this study is to reveal and discuss the current status of using VR in industrial design education and potentials of it.Design/methodology/approachIn the first part of the study, the use of computer technology in industrial design education and how VR can be positioned in the existing system is discussed by the acceptance of “design” as “representation”. In the second part, the literature review carried out to unveil and analyse the efforts for using VR in industrial design practice and education is presented. The results of the review are interpreted together with the design process in industrial design education.FindingsVR has the potential for changing the operating ways of not only sketching, visualising, modelling, prototyping, presenting, demonstrating and evaluating design ideas, but also getting inspiration and collaborating in industrial design education. However, it is first necessary to solve the issue of how it will be integrated into industrial design education.Originality/valueThis paper presents the preliminary presumptions regarding the integration of VR into industrial design education that can contribute to future studies.","[{""name"": ""Ahmet Hamurcu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Şebnem Timur"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerem Rızvanoğlu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2752/175630611X13046972590923"", ""10.1002/j.2168-9830.1994.tb01114.x"", ""10.1162/07479360152681056"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(00)00020-X"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00021-0"", ""10.1162/074793603762667728"", ""10.1007/978-1-85233-863-3_9"", ""10.1017/S089006041000020X"", ""10.1080/13602360309588"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2008.01.001"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2016.1215525"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(00)00051-0"", ""10.1076/digc.12.1.15.10865"", ""10.2752/175630610X12877385838803"", ""10.1504/JDR.2015.067233"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2016.11.001"", ""10.1145/379537.379542"", ""10.1080/10464883.1988.10758496"", ""10.1007/BF01580516"", ""10.1145/3345120.3345150"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(99)00002-2"", ""10.1109/ISVRI.2011.5759592"", ""10.1007/s10055-010-0156-8""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2021-0374,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"An investigation on the influence of sintering temperature on microstructural, physical and mechanical properties of Cu-SiC composites","Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the sintering temperature on the microstructural, mechanical and physical properties of Cu-SiC composites. Design/methodology/approach The powder metallurgy route was used to fabricate the samples. Cold compaction of powders was conducted at 250 MPa which was followed by sintering at 850°C–950°C at the interval of 50 °C in the open atmospheric furnace. SiC was used as a reinforcement and the volumetric fraction of the SiC was varied as 10%, 15% and 20%. The processed samples were metallurgically characterized by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Mechanical characterization was done using tensile and Vickers’ micro-hardness testing to check the hardness and strength of the samples. Archimedes principle and Four-point collinear probe method were used to measure the density and electrical resistivity of the samples. Findings SEM micrograph reveals the uniform dispersion of the SiC particles in the Cu matrix element. The results revealed that the Hardness and tensile strength were improved due to the addition of SiC and were maximum for the samples sintered at 950 °C. The addition of SiC has also increased the electrical resistivity of the Cu-SiC composite and was lowest for Cu 100% while the relative density has shown the reverse trend. Further, it was found that the maximum hardness of 91.67 Hv and ultimate tensile strength of 312.93 MPa were found for Cu-20% SiC composite and the lowest electrical resistivity of 2.017 µ- Ω-cm was found for pure Cu sample sintered at 950 °C, and this temperature was concluded as the optimum sintering temperature. Research limitations/implications The powder metallurgy route for the fabrication of the composites is a challenging task as the trapping of oxygen cannot be controlled during the compaction process as well as during the sintering process. So, a more intensive study is required to overcome these kinds of limitations. Originality/value As of the author’s best knowledge, no work has been reported on the effect of sintering temperature on the properties of the Cu-SiC composites which has huge potential in the industries.","[{""name"": ""Nalin Somani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Y.

10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0402,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"A strategic framework managing challenges of integrating lean construction and integrated project delivery on construction megaprojects, towards global integrated delivery transformative initiatives in multinational organisations","PurposeBuilt environment encounters substantial risks and challenges in its evolution towards sustainable development. International businesses and multinational engineering organisations face global connectivity challenges between business units, especially during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which has profoundly disrupted the construction industry throughout the world. That raises the need to manage global connectivity as a main strategic goal of multinational architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) organisations. This study aims to develop a strategic framework managing challenges of integrating lean construction (LC) and integrated project delivery (IPD) on construction megaprojects (CMPs) towards global integrated delivery (GID) transformative initiatives in multinational AEC organisations.Design/methodology/approach“Mixed research methods” involving a two-stage quantitative and qualitative research approach is adopted. The qualitative research methodology consists of a literature review to assess challenges to integrate LeanIPD&amp;GID on CMPs. There is an assessment of conceptualisation of LeanIPD&amp;GID and GID strategy placements, development of LeanIPD&amp;GID integration framework and future of work (FOW) global initiatives with multiple validations. The analysis involved semi-structured interviews and focus group techniques. Stage 2 consisted of an empirical questionnaire survey that shaped the foundation of analysis and findings of 190 respondents from 23 countries with an extensive cosmopolitan experience of megaprojects in construction. The survey examined a set of 20 challenges to integrate LeanIPD&amp;GID on CMPs resulting from a detailed analysis of extant literature after validation. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were exploited for data analysis and percentage score analysis.FindingsThe research conceptualised LeanIPD&amp;GID principles, proposed GID strategy placements, a framework for managing challenges of LeanIPD&amp;GID transformative initiatives, FOW global initiatives and key performance indicators (KPIs). It concluded that the most significant challenges to integrate of LeanIPD&amp;GID on CMPs are “lack of governmental incentives, policies, regulations or legal frameworks”, “lack of client’s awareness and IPD experience amongst key stakeholders”, “lack of organisation’s senior-management and client’s commitment to IPD approaches”, “resistance of industry to change from traditional procurement to IPD” and “lack of integrated synergies between LC, IPD working towards LeanIPD&amp;GID”. Awareness of building information modelling (BIM) in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is higher than LC, and LC awareness is higher than IPD knowledge. While BIM adoption in the MENA region is higher than LC, LC is still taking its first steps, and IPD has little implementation.

Design/methodology/approach A case study analyses the supply chain of a sample EPC company. First, a literature review is conducted to explore the subject in academic literature. Second, information flows are mapped using responsible, accountable, consulted and informed analysis and cross-functional process mapping. Third, inefficiencies are identified. Fourth, the root causes of the inefficiencies are pinpointed using fishbone and five-times-why analysis. Fifth, a comparison is made between the linear and the blockchain information system via force-field analysis. Sixth, a specific blockchain system design is identified based on three external expert interviews. Finally, the new system is designed and a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. Findings Major cost and time inefficiencies in oil and gas infrastructure developments are caused by a poor information flow in the supply chain. The new blockchain system design is a feasible solution, reducing cost inefficiencies by 12.4% and operation lead-times by 36.5%. Research limitations/implications The confidentiality of the sample EPC company’s information represents a limitation. Originality/value The research introduces a new blockchain system design, reducing cost and time inefficiencies in the project-development supply chain, including implementation processes.","[{""name"": ""Rashid Amiri Ara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Klara Paardenkooper"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ron van Duin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.15623/ijret.2016.0509001"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2019.06.042"", ""10.4236/jsea.2016.910036"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.07.193"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.03.015"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2010.11.024"", ""10.1071/AJ18216"", ""10.1080/17517575.2013.879209"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-02-2015-0078"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-74304-2_15"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.12.005"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907695"", ""10.1109/MS.2017.4121227"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.03.014"", ""10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.012"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2875782"", ""10.18178/JOCET.2019.7.5.512"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.03.039"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.03.197""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science']","['Strategy and Management', 'Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"
10.1111/jade.12303,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,What Works in the Architecture Studio? Five Strategies for Optimising Student Learning,"AbstractGood teaching requires pedagogical dynamism: a willingness to vary one’s teaching approach relative to the context (and cohort) at hand, and to any new challenges that may arise from that context. This requires that teachers obtain a broad knowledge of teaching strategies and tactics. Given the demands of contemporary higher education, finding the time to obtain this knowledge can pose a challenge to full‐time academics. This is exacerbated in the case of part‐time and practitioner‐teachers who often work in varying degrees of isolation from the communities of learning to which they contribute. An analysis of the teaching practices of eight high‐performing practitioner‐teachers, alongside data obtained from 74 students, within a master’s‐level architectural course at a large Australian university, has been used to delineate five strategies for optimising student learning within the architecture studio. These include: setting up a challenge that clearly articulates the role of the student within it; early and frequent assessment tasks to assist students in rapid skill development and reflective practice; communicating clear expectations around performance; facilitating a strong peer culture; and enhancing motivation via high expectations. This article details the tactics by which these strategies can be achieved. This article delivers directly applicable advice for architectural educators, but it also provides practical insight into the specifics of architectural teaching that may assist educators working in other disciplines.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca McLaughlan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ishita Chatterjee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03075079112331383081"", ""10.1007/BF00138871"", ""10.1080/0260293990240405"", ""10.4159/9780674028999"", ""10.1207/S15327809JLS1101_4"", ""10.14742/ajet.1344"", ""10.1111/j.1470-6431.2005.00445.x"", ""10.4324/9780203100226"", ""10.1080/0937445940050103"", ""10.1080/23735082.2015.1002195"", ""10.1080/13562517.2018.1461621"", ""10.4324/9780203992340"", ""10.1080/03075070600572090"", ""10.1177/0170840611416748"", ""10.1162/104648800564608"", ""10.1080/02602930903512883"", ""10.4324/9780203507711"", ""10.1080/13264826.2017.1288147"", ""10.3763/asre.2009.0058"", ""10.1111/j.1531-314X.2007.00121.x"", ""10.1080/002202799183142"", ""10.1080/09500690902721699""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Purposive sampling technique was used to select licenced PMs in Ghana where data was collected with the use of structured questionnaires. Mean score analysis, Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance, Relative Importance Index and Cronbach’s alpha were used to analyze the data. Findings The study discovered that most PMs on construction firms in Ghana allocate between 1% and 5% of the total project cost to health and safety. According to the study, client satisfaction is the most important parameter to consider in construction project management. Structural frame, method of fixing and edge of materials were the key design activities that caused PMs to make frequent reference to health and safety. It was revealed that PMs refer to health and safety when confronted by all the procurement-related situations. Research limitations/implications The research is limited to the built environment professionals in Ghana. The findings cannot be generalized and extended to other developing countries; however, it could serve as a lesson to them. Practical implications The findings of the study are anticipated to provide information about the critical role of PMs in promoting health and safety throughout the project life cycle. Originality/value The novelty of the study sought to delve into the complex nature of construction to identify the role of PMs in relation to the health and safety practices in the construction industry.","[{""name"": ""Kofi Agyekum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Ato Ghansah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Portia Atswei Tetteh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Judith Amudjie"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/875697289903000405"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)00066-0"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2005.04.002"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00060-1"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00055-8"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000730"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000751"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.11.001"", ""10.1080/01446199400000032"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000218"", ""10.1186/2193-2409-1-6"", ""10.1061/ (ASCE)ME. 1943-5479.0000246"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.209"", ""10.1086/209405"", ""10.1002/pmj.21345"", ""10.1111/0004-5608.00246"", ""10.1016/S0024-6301(01)00097-8"", ""10.1061/40671(2003)133"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.02.008"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2005)131:10(1125)"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.03.081"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.10.018""]","['Health Professions', 'Psychology', 'Decision Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2022-0175,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Shaping circular economy in the built environment in Africa. A bibliometric analysis,"Purpose This paper aims to explore the intellectual structure shaping the circular economy (CE) discourse within the built environment in Africa. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a bibliometric analysis approach to explore the intellectual structure of CE in the built environment in Africa. The authors collected 31 papers published between 2005 and 2021 from the Scopus database and used VOSviewer for data analysis. Findings The findings show that there are six clusters shaping the intellectual structure: demolition, material recovery and reuse; waste as a resource; cellulose and agro-based materials; resilience and low-carbon footprint; recycling materials; and the fourth industrial revolution. The two most cited scholars had three publications each, while the top journal was Resources, Conservation and Recycling. The dominant concepts included CE, sustainability, alternative materials, waste management, lifecycle, demolition and climate change. The study concludes that there is low CE research output in Africa, which implies that the concept is either novel or facing resistance. Research limitations/implications The data were drawn from one database, Scopus; hence, adoption of alternative databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar and Dimensions could potentially have yielded a higher number of articles for analysis which potentially would result in different conclusions on the subject understudy. Originality/value This study made a significant contribution by articulating the CE intellectual structure in the built environment, identified prominent scholars and academic platforms responsible for promoting circularity in Africa.","[{""name"": ""Jacob Mhlanga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Theodore C.

10.1108/JEDT-11-2021-0631,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Reasons for entering into Ghanaian public-private partnership (PPP) power projects,"Purpose In comparison to other countries, power generation in Sub-Saharan Africa is poor. The demand for power has surged in recent times and continues to increase at a fast rate. The public–private partnership (PPP) model has been identified as an option to address the challenges in the power sector. The purpose of this research paper is to critically explore the reasons for entering into PPP power projects in Ghana by the public and private parties. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaires were used to elicit responses from respondents using a two-round Delphi survey. From 60 respondents contacted in round one, 48 responses were obtained, and these 48 respondents further took part in round two. Mean score ranking was used to rank the reasons for entering into PPP power projects, while analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run to test significant difference in perceptions among the respondents. Findings From round 2 of the Delphi survey, the significant reasons for public sector entering into PPP power projects were as follows: achieving improved value for money, access to additional capital, increased certainty of projects and greater efficiency of project delivery services. For private sector, most significant reasons were as follows: obtaining of investment support, improvement in private sector’s international image and synergy with public sector. From ANOVA analysis, there were significant different perceptions among some of factors on the respondent profile variables and the reasons for entering into PPP power projects, while other factors did not have significant different perception. Originality/value Significant reasons for both public and private sectors identified would be incorporated by the government when PPP policy guidelines and laws are reviewed. This will aid in the effective implementation of PPP for power projects.","[{""name"": ""Augustine Senanu Komla Kukah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""De-Graft Owusu-Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Edward Badu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1155/2018/9737683"", ""10.1080/20421338.2018.1547511"", ""10.4337/relp.2016.01.01"", ""10.1002/bsd2.56"", ""10.2307/3803199"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8292.2009.00395.x"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1763897"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-5686"", ""10.1108/02632771111178391"", ""10.1108/17574321311304503"", ""10.1016/j.jup.2004.11.001"", ""10.1002/wene.225"", ""10.1108/IJESM-12-2020-0010"", ""10.1080/23276665.2020.1821726"", ""10.3846/ijspm.2018.5224"", ""10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100689"", ""10.1108/F-10-2015-0072"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2017-0137"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2018-0001"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0195"", ""10.1080/17487870.2019.1657016"", ""10.3905/jsf.2002.320272"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.1997.tb01330.x"", ""10.1007/s11192-016-1918-1"", ""10.3846/ijspm.2018.6049"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:7(457)"", ""10.1080/03088830802469451"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000405"", ""10.1504/IJPM.2020.10034887""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0529,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Production pressures in the building sector of the construction industry: a systematic review of literature,"Purpose The building sector of the construction industry incorporates a precipitous and volatile nature with poor safety conditions being prevalent, owing to its inability to determine an appropriate trade-off between productivity and safety. This disproportionate trade-off produces production pressures, which contribute poorly to construction performance, by encouraging workers to prioritise their working productivity ahead of safety. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impacts of production pressures in the building sector and propose mitigation strategies accordingly. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of literature was conducted, and secondary data were extracted from peer-reviewed journal papers. The data was then analysed to achieve the objectives of this study. Findings The main causes of production pressures are tight construction schedules, ineffective management and construction rework. Furthermore, the negative effects of production pressures are increased levels of stress in employees, reduced craftsmanship, encouraging accident-prone environments and decreasing employee’s safety behaviour. Effective mitigation strategies in relation to scheduling, leadership, communication and motivation were proposed. Finally, a causal loop diagram of production pressures in the building sector was developed. Originality/value This research will assist in creating a safer working environment within the building sector, by providing useful information regarding the severity of production pressures and suggesting mitigation strategies that can be implemented in the construction projects.","[{""name"": ""Jack Neale"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Argaw Gurmu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104805"", ""10.1061/9780784482872.006"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001148"", ""10.3390/su12145771"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.06.027"", ""10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00824.x"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2020.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.jlp.2017.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2004.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2018.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2015.09.015"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2015.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2015.11.020"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1993)119:3(622)"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2013.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2004.12.002"", ""10.1111/j.1744-6570.1996.tb01802.x"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2010.06.005"", ""10.1108/eb021138"", ""10.1061/JCCEAZ.0001062"", ""10.1108/09699980410547612"", ""10.1002/ajim.22723"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2019.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.06.017"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2004.03.011"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2006)132:2(182)"", ""10.1108/ECAM-11-2018-0475"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001634"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.07.007"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000732"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001902"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000194"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2017.12.011""]","['Health Professions', 'Decision Sciences']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

Yet, its pedagogical features, such as self‐learning, collaborative learning, and learning‐by‐doing, are identical to those of online learning. In this study, we argue that metaverse‐based learning refers to a new reality learners create by assuming that the existence of reality is different in the metaverse. We extracted six educational values in epistemological and ontological senses, reviewing the four realities of the metaverse, including virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and extended reality, which is a way to avoid technological determinists'; approach to education. Based on the values – bottom‐up, collaboration, authorship, ownership, interconnectivity, and community, primary school children's (year 5 &amp; 6) groups (n = 20) redesigned 20 assigned school spaces such as classroom teacher office, science room, and music room on their chosen metaverse platforms. Throughout the thematic analysis of design artifacts, activity scenarios, and reflection &amp;amp; presentation, we discovered four themes: collaborative learning with co‐ownership and co‐authorship; being interconnected with all living and non‐living things; co‐participants with different roles; and transdisciplinary research‐driven learning, which is used to articulate a framework for metaverse‐based learning, which is different from online learning.","[{""name"": ""Neal Dreamson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gayoung Park"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ICRoM.2018.8657615"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104005"", ""10.3991/ijet.v15i15.13025"", ""10.1080/87567555.2015.1125842"", ""10.3390/technologies8040077"", ""10.4324/9780429277528"", ""10.1111/jade.12314"", ""10.3102/00346543074001059"", ""10.26555/jiteki.v7i1.20568"", ""10.14729/converging.k.2021.9.2.1"", ""10.1080/0158791990200205"", ""10.1007/s11159-017-9634-5"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.012"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog2502_2"", ""10.3390/app11052338"", ""10.1177/004005999302500405""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Information Systems', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

New systems are, thus, required on construction sites to mitigate the risk and challenges associated with the pandemic. This paper aims to determine construction organisations risk control systems and the challenges of implementing safety measures on construction sites. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative research method. A purposive sampling method was used to select study participants, who were administered open-ended questionnaires designed to gather qualitative data. The contents of the data were analysed, presented and reported based on the objectives of the study. Findings Some of the construction organisations conducted COVID-19 related risk assessments, whilst a few organisations did not conduct a risk assessment. Inspections to ensure COVID-19 compliance was done by government officials, health organisations and client’s health and safety officers. The construction organisations demonstrated considerable competence in record keeping and some organisations further evolved a follow-up plan for sick workers. The study found that some construction practitioners had misconceptions about the disease, used COVID-19 personal protective equipment incorrectly and lack adequate information about the virus. It is required that construction stakeholders evolve policies and strategies that would promote risk control and foster compliance to COVID-19 safety measures. Originality/value COVID-19 is still new, therefore, the body of knowledge is still at the infancy stage. This paper provided insight into the COVID-19 related risk and challenges that may increase the rate of virus infection amongst construction practitioners.","[{""name"": ""Patricia Omega Kukoyi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fredrick Simpeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oluseyi Julius Adebowale"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Justus Ngala Agumba"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.08.008"", ""10.3390/ijerph18041559"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2018-0098"", ""10.1108/JFM-08-2020-0061"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.06.015"", ""10.9707/2307-0919.10 14"", ""10.1071/HC15950"", ""10.15641/jcbm.1.1.64"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0233588"", ""10.26458/jedep.v7i1.571"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.26373"", ""10.1177/1090198103259185"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2017.04.019"", ""10.24321/2456.9925.201903"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1874678"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2019-0189"", ""10.1016/S2155-8256(18)30150-9"", ""10.15641/jcbm.3.2.668"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1842960"", ""10.1353/lib.2006.0053"", ""10.1080/09537287.2019.1695292"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2017.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101692"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000495"", ""10.1177/0894439307312485"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001379"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001794"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.11.003"", ""10.9790/487X-16350110""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

The question asked is if urban planning can in some way govern the image of a city. An investigation into which tools and strategies are necessary to defend the narrative of a city, its identity and its genius loci against the homologating forces that are transforming contemporary cities. The article explores the theoretical principles and methods being experimentally used to qualitatively manage the urban environment. Research investigates the innovative experimentation being carried out in Italy that has brought about the compiling of colour plans, and questions what their characteristics should be, so as to be effective in the management of the quality of an urban image. In order to focalise these crucial aspects, the case of the colour plan for the Egadi Islands is presented, illustrating the methods elaborated for the individualisation of the characteristics connoting its local urban landscape and the strategies adopted to cope with the risks to which they are exposed.","[{""name"": ""Angela Alessandra Badami"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13574809.2018.1472523"", ""10.1057/s41289-018-0070-3"", ""10.4324/9781315158457"", ""10.1057/udi.2015.28"", ""10.1080/01944368708976642"", ""10.1080/01944368708976642"", ""10.1086/217913"", ""10.5822/978-1-61091-776-6""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0186,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Investigating the suitability and cost-benefit of copper tailings as partial replacement of sand in concrete in Zambia: an exploratory study,"Purpose This study aimed to investigate the suitability and cost-benefit of using copper tailings as partial replacement of sand in concrete production. The study was motivated by the accumulation and non-use of copper tailings in dams among them tailing dam 25 also known as TD 25 in Kitwe city of the Copperbelt province in Zambia that take up approximately 111 hectares of unused land. Design/methodology/approach Laboratory experimental approach of concrete production based on water/cement ratios of 0.3 and 0.5 was used because this was an exploratory study designed to establish the primary performance of concrete. In total, 30 concrete cubes were cast based on the two water-cement ratios. In total, 0% to 30% partial sand replacement with copper tailings was used in both mixes with the 0% copper tailings replacement being the control mix and reference point. Other concrete tests included workability, density, compressive strength and element composition analysis. Findings Results revealed that copper tailings from TD 25 were suitable for partial replacement of sand in concrete. Thirty per cent of sand replacement with copper tailings was established as the maximum replacement amount to produce optimum compressive strength values from both mixes. The drier mix of 0.3 water-cement ratios produced higher compressive strength results of 23 MPa at 28 days of concrete curing with 2.34% as optimum concrete cost reduction. Practical implications The research results provide the cost-benefit analysis and savings that can be attained from using cheaper copper tailings based concrete. The study further provided the quantity of land available for development arising from absorption of copper tailings as a sustainable construction material. The local authority now has statistics and numerical values that it can use to absorb copper tailings as a concrete raw material. Originality/value The study provides guidance on optimum concrete grade produced and cost reduction details of copper tailing-based concrete to support for local authorities in suitable land wand waste management using real data.","[{""name"": ""Franco Muleya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bodwin Mulenga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sambo Lyson Zulu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sunday Nwaubani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chipozya Kosta Tembo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry Mushota"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0016-7185(99)00046-9"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.11.025"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.04.079"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0003145"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.10.013"", ""10.1515/secm-2019-0029"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0001813"", ""10.1186/s40814-018-0290-8"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.08.034"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2012.06.434"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.1068"", ""10.1016/S0272-8842(98)00075-3"", ""10.1016/S0956-053X(00)00102-1"", ""10.1007/s41024-016-0010-9"", ""10.1007/s10706-007-9132-9"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.05.095"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.12.066"", ""10.12989/acc.2015.3.1.055"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.07.075"", ""10.1007/s10163-019-00831-7""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0480,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on indigenous contractors in a developing economy,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on indigenous contractors in a developing economy with a view to enhancing their performance. Design/methodology/approach The study used a purposive sampling technique to select 37 indigenous contractors with ongoing construction contracts in Osun State, Nigeria who provided data for the study. A structured interview protocol was used to elicit the required information from the interviewees and frequency, percentage and content analysis were used for data analysis. Findings The results showed that the critical impact of COVID-19 on indigenous contractors in a developing economy is: time overrun, loss of profit and creation of dispute. Further results showed that other impacts are a disruption in supply of labour, locally sourced materials are with additional cost, the additional cost of implementing COVID-19 protocols, difficulty in sourcing imported materials and absence of new jobs with the corresponding retrenchment of workers. Practical implications The study recommended special palliatives for the indigenous contractors from the government so as to cushion the impact of the pandemic on them, thereby enhance their survival and performance. A special arbitration panel is set up in each state of the federation to look at disputes arising from the aftermath of the pandemic, this is with a view to adequately compensate indigenous contractors with genuine and properly compiled claims. inferring from the findings of the study, it suffices to say that the severity of the impact of the pandemic is very high on indigenous contractors in developing economies, as such a better preparedness strategy could lessen the impact of such pandemic in the future. Originality/value The study is an attempt to unearth the impact of COVID-19 on indigenous contractors with ongoing construction contracts in a developing economy. The study will be of value to construction stakeholders in providing the information needed to devise strategies to minimise the impact of a pandemic on indigenous contractors in future projects thereby enhance their performance.","[{""name"": ""Nathaniel Ayinde Olatunde"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Imoleayo Abraham Awodele"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bosede Olajumoke Adebayo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.02.001"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00028-5"", ""10.1057/rlp.2009.20"", ""10.1002/jmv.25706"", ""10.3386/w27673"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3557504"", ""10.36941/mjss-2020-0047"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2020.101922"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2051009"", ""10.3390/pathogens5040066""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2021-0739,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Identification of critical factors for big data analytics implementation in sustainable supply chain in emerging economies,"Purpose The advancements in internet technologies and the use of sophisticated digital devices in supply chain operations incessantly generate enormous amounts of data, which is termed as big data (BD). The BD technologies have brought about a paradigm shift in the supply chain decision-making towards profitability and sustainability. The aim of this work is to address the issue of implementation of the big data analytics (BDA) in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) by identifying the relevant factors and developing a structural model for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach Through a comprehensive literature review and experts’ opinion, the crucial factors are found using the PESTEL framework, which covers political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors. The structural model is developed based on the results of the total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) procedure and MICMAC analysis. Findings The policy support regarding IT, culture of data-based decision-making, inappropriate selection of BDA technologies and the laws related to data security and privacy are found to affect most of the other factors. Also, the company’s vision towards environmental performance and willingness for material and energy optimization are found to be crucial for the environmental and social sustainability of the supply chain. Research limitations/implications The study is focused on the manufacturing supply chain in emerging economies. It may be extended to other industry sectors and geographical areas. Also, additional factors may be included to make the model more robust. Practical implications The proposed model imparts an understanding of the relative importance and interrelationship of factors. This may be useful to managers to assess their strengths and weaknesses and ascertain their priorities in the context of their organization for developing a suitable investment plan. Social implications The study establishes the importance of BDA for conservation and management of energy and material. This is crucial to develop strategies for enhancing eco-efficiency of the supply chain, which in turn enhances the economic returns for the society. Originality/value This study addresses the implementation of BDA in SSCM in the context of emerging economies. It uses the PESTEL framework for identifying the factors, which is a comprehensive framework for strategic planning and decision-making. This study makes use of the TISM methodology for model development and deliberates on the social and environmental implications too, apart from theoretical and managerial implications.","[{""name"": ""Prashant Jain"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dhanraj P.

Design/methodology/approach To resolve the challenge of uncertainty and ambiguous related to the parameters, frequency, non-detection and severity considered in the traditional approach failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) for risk evaluation, the authors used fuzzy logic where these parameters are shown as members of a fuzzy set, which fuzzified by using appropriate membership functions. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system process is suggested as a dynamic, intelligently chosen model to ameliorate and validate the results obtained by the fuzzy inference system and effectively predict the criticality evaluation of failure modes. A new hybrid model is proposed that combines the grey relational approach and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to improve the exploitation of the FMECA conventional method. Findings This research project aims to reflect the real case study of the gas turbine system. Using this analysis allows evaluating the criticality effectively and provides an alternate prioritizing to that obtained by the conventional method. The obtained results show that the integration of two multi-criteria decision methods and incorporating their results enable to instill confidence in decision-makers regarding the criticality prioritizations of failure modes and the shortcoming concerning the lack of established rules of inference system which necessitate a lot of experience and shows the weightage or importance to the three parameters severity, detection and frequency, which are considered to have equal importance in the traditional method. Originality/value This paper is providing encouraging results regarding the risk evaluation and prioritizing failures mode and decision-makers guidance to refine the relevance of decision-making to reduce the probability of occurrence and the severity of the undesirable scenarios with handling different forms of ambiguity, uncertainty and divergent judgments of experts.","[{""name"": ""Ammar Chakhrit"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Chennoufi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/hfm.20729"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2017.04.018"", ""10.1007/s10845-009-0266-x"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0241"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.10.018"", ""10.1504/IJPQM.2014.064807"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2019.04.009"", ""10.1016/j.ijcip.2020.100337"", ""10.3233/JIFS-172097"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2013.08.022"", ""10.1109/TR.2013.2241251"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2012.08.010"", ""10.1007/s00500-014-1321-x"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2014.07.018"", ""10.1007/s42524-019-0022-7"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2020.106529"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2018.10.033"", ""10.1016/j.jlp.2020.104238"", ""10.1016/j.jlp.2014.11.016"", ""10.1002/atr.5670290109"", ""10.3390/mca22040043"", ""10.1504/IJPQM.2017.087864"", ""10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2019.101762"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2007.11.028"", ""10.1109/TR.2008.928208"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2015.11.013""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)]]"

Visual environment is one of the most important indoor environmental quality (IEQ) parameters, and it directly impacts occupant productivity in offices. The literature outlines the significance of the impact. Still, there is a lack of investigation, statistical analysis and inter-relationships between the independent variables (IEQ factors), especially in the hot and arid climate. Design/methodology/approach This study presents a research study investigating the effects and shows statistical relationships between IEQ on occupant comfort and productivity. The study was conducted in the Middle East, and data was collected for 12 months. It used the response surface analysis to perform analysis. Findings This study outlined seven unique relationships highlighting the recommended range, inter-dependencies. Results include that illumination has maximum effect on visual comfort and temperature, daylight having direct influence and relative humidity, wall type next to the seat and kind of workspace also impact visual comfort and productivity.

Hence, improving performance of construction industry needs assessing state of the practices in the industry and devising improvement intervention. The purpose of this paper is to measure improvement requirement level of different construction management practice areas and to identify the underlying improvement dimensions in Ethiopian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaire survey was developed for data collection based on a thorough literature review which yielded 28 construction management practice areas. Purposive sampling method was used to select respondents for the survey. Mean score was used to identify the required improvement level, and one sample T-test was carried out to identify significance of improvement requirement. Factor analysis was conducted to identify the underlying dimensions of the construction management practice areas. Findings Findings indicate 27 areas need significant improvement. This shows the low level of adoption of good construction management practices in Ethiopian construction industry. Factor analysis resulted in the areas being grouped to four broad improvement dimensions, namely, project management, organization management, knowledge and risk management and project development and contract management. Originality/value The findings provide information for appropriate action by the stakeholders to raise standards of adopted construction management practices. It also show areas of construction management which require more focused research in the context of Ethiopian construction industry. Considering the similarity of nature of construction industry problems in developing countries, the findings can be extended to similar countries.","[{""name"": ""Desalegn Girma Mengistu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gangadhar Mahesh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2006)132:2(125)"", ""10.1080/09537287.2015.1045953"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000606"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:1(153)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2006)132:8(805)"", ""10.21315/jcdc2016.21.2.5"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2003)129:6(599)"", ""10.1016/S0951-8320(02)00158-8"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2003)19:1(33)"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v18i1.5663"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v17i4.5596"", ""10.1037/1082-989X.4.3.272"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2009)135:2(60)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000106"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2010.12.110"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2009)25:4(185)"", ""10.1108/eb021077"", ""10.1080/014461998372556"", ""10.1016/S0360-1323(00)00011-1"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1033818"", ""10.1007/s12205-008-0367-7"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2006)132:6(636)"", ""10.1016/0263-7863(94)90050-7"", ""10.21315/jcdc2016.21.1.4"", ""10.1080/014461900446894"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1277056"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1988)114:2(233)"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1033816"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2004)20:1(8)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2004)20:3(110)"", ""10.1080/08839510290030273"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.11.007"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2016-0062"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1277058"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0680(2000)5:3(93)"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v18i1.5770"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000160"", ""10.21315/jcdc2017.22.supp1.5"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000403"", ""10.11648/j.ijber.20160504.16""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0245,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Developing a fuzzy goal programming model for health, safety and environment risks based on hybrid fuzzy FMEA-VIKOR method","Purpose The activities of the oil industry from discovery to distribution of oil products have adverse effects on human and environment. Thus, the companies that are active in this industry should identify and manage their risks. The purpose of this paper is to prioritize the identified risks based on different measures such as cost, occurrence, etc. Then, selecting the most important corrective actions using goal-programming approach is another objective of this study. Design/methodology/approach To identify the health, safety and environment (HSE) risks, the Fuzzy Delphi method was used. The failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and fuzzy Vlse Kriterijumsk Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) methods covering the deficits of FMEA were used to rank the HSE risks. Unlike similar researches, in the proposed FMEA–VIKOR method, the risk priority number was not calculated. In addition to severity, occurrence and detection, the parameters such as time, cost and quality, being considered for ranking the risks, were weighted by the Eigenvector method. Then, a fuzzy goal-programming model was developed for determining the best solutions of risk response. Findings The research findings indicated that the most important risks include fire and blast because of tank and pipeline, leakage of connections and pipelines and industrial waste. Also, the most important risk responses include using and strengthening the alarm and fire extinguishing systems, using fiberglass tanks to prevent pipeline corrosion, using modern technology to have more efficient oil refining. Originality/value The main contribution of this paper is using hybrid approach of FMEA–VIKOR for risk ranking by considering different measures such as time, cost and quality besides severity, occurrence and detection. Providing a fuzzy goal-programming framework for determining the main risk responses is another value for this research.","[{""name"": ""Masoumeh Nabizadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammad Khalilzadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sadoullah Ebrahimnejad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammad Javad Ershadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ssci.2013.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2016.01.007"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(01)00280-6"", ""10.1002/tqem.21531"", ""10.1504/IJPQM.2018.091797"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.10.018"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2012.10.027"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.10.025"", ""10.1080/10807039.2014.957114"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.06.044"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2012.05.031"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(03)00020-1"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2014.01.027"", ""10.1080/10807039.2016.1218272"", ""10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2011.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.05.006""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0456,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Constraints and limitations of concrete 3D printing in architecture,"Purpose Additive manufacturing of concrete (AMoC) is an emerging technology for constructing buildings. However, due to the nature of the concrete property and constructing buildings in layers, constraints and limitations are encountered while applying AMoC in architecture. This paper aims to analyze the constraints and limitations that may be encountered while using AMoC in architecture. Design/methodology/approach A descriptive research approach is used to conduct this study. First, basic notions of AMoC are introduced. Then, challenges of AMoC, including hardware, material property, control and design, are addressed. Finally, strategies that may be used to overcome the challenges are discussed. Findings Factors influencing the success of AMoC include hardware, material, control methods, manufacturing process and design. Considering these issues in the early design phase is crucial to achieving a successful computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) integration to bring CAD and CAM benefits into the architecture industry. Originality/value In three-dimensional (3D) printing, objects are constructed layer by layer. Printing results are thus affected by the additive method (such as toolpath) and material properties (such as tensile strength and slump). Although previous studies attempt to improve AMoC, most of them focus on the manufacturing process. However, a successful application of AMoC in architecture needs to consider the possible constraints and limitations of concrete 3D printing. So far, research on the potential challenges of applying AMoC in architecture from a building lifecycle perspective is still limited. The study results of this study could be used to improve design and construction while applying AMoC in architecture.","[{""name"": ""Chien-Ho Ko"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0262-1762(20)30224-8"", ""10.1080/17452759.2016.1209867"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.actaastro.2013.07.034"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.03.011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.08.018"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2016.03.097"", ""10.1007/s11465-013-0248-8"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2019.105828"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2003.08.012"", ""10.1504/IJISE.2006.009791"", ""10.2478/jeppm-2019-0005"", ""10.1617/s11527-012-9828-z"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.12.051"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-815481-6.00016-6"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2017.07.123"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2017.08.051"", ""10.1002/9781119610755.ch1"", ""10.1617/s11527-015-0571-0"", ""10.1080/17452759.2018.1476064"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:1(72)"", ""10.1080/17452759.2017.1326724"", ""10.1016/j.cirp.2016.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.031""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0282,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Comparative analysis on rheological characteristics of different modified asphalt based on DSR and BBR evaluation,"Purpose In order to evaluate the rheological properties of asphalt more comprehensively and effectively, and to explore and discuss the practicability of relevant models in the evaluation of the rheological properties of asphalt. Design/methodology/approach Based on the rheological and viscoelastic theories, temperature scanning, frequency scanning and multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) tests of different modified asphalt were carried out by dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) to obtain relevant viscoelastic parameters and evaluate the high temperature properties of different modified asphalt. Based on the time-temperature equivalence principle, the main curve was constructed to study the viscoelastic properties of asphalt in a wider frequency domain. The main curve was fitted with the CAM model, and the rheological properties of different modified asphalt were evaluated through the analysis of model parameters. The creep stiffness and creep velocity of different modified asphalt were obtained through the rheological test of bending beam (BBR), and the low-temperature performance of different modified asphalt was analyzed by using Burgers model to fit the creep compliance. Findings The results show that the high temperature rheological properties of several modified asphalt studied in the test are ranked from best to worst as follows: PE modified asphalt &gt; SBS modified asphalt &gt; SBR modified asphalt. Short-term aging can improve the high temperature performance of asphalt, and different types of modifiers can promote or inhibit this improvement effect. Based on BBR test and Burgers model fitting analysis, SBR modified asphalt has the best low temperature performance, followed by SBS modified asphalt, while PE modified asphalt has poor low temperature performance, so it is not suitable to be used as road material in low temperature area. Originality/value Combined with effective evaluation methods, the rheological properties of asphalt at different temperatures and angles were systematically evaluated, and the evolution of rheological properties of asphalt characterized by model parameters was further analyzed by advanced model simulation.","[{""name"": ""Guangyuan Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haitao Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Junfeng Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tengjiang Yu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.06.041"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2017-0093"", ""10.12677/HJCE.2018.76096"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.587-589.1281"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.07.131"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.04.082"", ""10.1007/s10973-013-3449-9"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119771""]","['Engineering', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598), ('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.754)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0223,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Clusters of key barriers to life cycle assessment adoption in the South African construction industry: perspectives of stakeholders,"Purpose The South African Construction Industry (SACI) in recent times has been characterized by a strong emphasis towards achieving sustainable building practices in infrastructural delivery. However, the lack of progress encountered in making gains in achieving sustainable practices has raised concerns over the effectiveness and understanding of the extent to which life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques may aid in meeting requirements of sustainable construction. Most efforts at LCA have been blighted with numerous barriers that have not been rigorously pursued and aggregated. Ironically, there is a lack of knowledge and understanding of the limitations and barriers to these methodologies, especially in the South African context. The purpose of this study is to delineate the cluster of barriers to the adoption of LCA methodologies in the SACI. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was carried out from a deductive research design elicit primary data based on the experience of purposively sampled stakeholders in LCA in the SACI on the extent they perceived the presence of well-established barriers in LCA adoption culled from the extensive literature review. Findings Through the use of factor analysis, three aggregated clusters of key barriers to LCA adoption in the SACI were identified, which were knowledge and enabling conditions constraints, cost and time constraints and technical constraints. The results confirm that indeed human and technical barriers have been notable in limiting gains in LCA adoption and achieving sustainable practices. Originality/value These findings are, thus, useful in overcoming challenges to LCA methodologies in achieving sustainable building practices in building and infrastructural delivery in SACI.","[{""name"": ""Titus Ebenezer Kwofie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wellington Didibhuku Thwala"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-35548-6_54"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.04.018"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2009.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2003.10.008"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.12.088"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.08.017"", ""10.1007/s11367-012-0461-4"", ""10.3390/su1030674"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.03.006"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2019-0141"", ""10.1108/ECAM-08-2014-0108"", ""10.1155/2016/8513293"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.517"", ""10.1108/SASBE-11-2018-0057"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.11.012"", ""10.1016/j.aaspro.2016.02.026"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2012.09.024""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Accounting', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

We investigated how participant perceptions of a single interior environment varied among a real–world space (R) and two surrogate VR spaces (one made with 360° spherical photography and one made with 360° spherical digital rendering). A total of 42 undergraduate, interior design students were randomly assigned to one of two experiments, resulting in two groups of 21 students. Each participant completed a visual acuity task and evaluated perceived brightness, glare, and spaciousness within the real–world space and one of the two surrogate VR environments. Participants reported acceptable baseline levels of perceived realism in both VR environments. There was no significant difference between the rendered–VR simulation and real–world space for brightness, glare, and spaciousness, while the photographed–VR simulation was seen as significantly brighter and glaring. Performance on the visual acuity task was significantly lower in both VR simulations than in the real–world–approximating the difference between 20/20 and 20/60 vision.

10.1111/jade.12347,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,The Impact of Multimedia Effect on Art Learning: Eye Movement Evidence from Traditional Chinese Pattern Learning,"AbstractAt the beginning of 2020, the COVID‐19 epidemic continued to spread and became a global pandemic. Affected by the epidemic, online teaching has become the new normal. As the main form of online education, multimedia learning has attracted more and more attention. The study of traditional patterns has always been a particularly important element of art study in China due to cultural heritage and precious resources. Chinese traditional patterns are an important object of learning because of the heritage. This study examines students’ understanding of the composition and evolution of traditional Chinese patterns in bronze mirrors by using different multimedia learning materials. A two by two factorial design is employed. The dependent variables includes (1) subjects’ post‐test scores and (2) the data of subjects’ eye‐movement behaviour. Data shows that students who use the animation with narration allocate a greater amount of visual attention than students who use animation with on‐screen text. The students who use simulation with on‐screen text demonstrated a greater amount of visual attention than students who use received simulation with narration. Furthermore, this empirical study confirmed a direct, positive correlation between the length of the subjects’ eye fixation behaviour and the depth of learning. This result also provides evidence to prove that the use of multimedia learning materials is helpful in art education, especially in the study of the various elements of traditional Chinese art.","[{""name"": ""Li Ye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hanjun Su"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jing Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yongxin Hang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compedu.2018.06.023"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.84.1.76"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.02.013"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.87.4.329"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-0720(199908)13:4<351::AID-ACP589>3.0.CO;2-6"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(72)90021-7"", ""10.1037/0096-1523.4.4.565"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.81.2.240"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139164603"", ""10.1002/tl.47"", ""10.1023/A:1013184611077"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.87.2.319"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.03.002"", ""10.3390/s20072101"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.124.3.372"", ""10.2307/1422228"", ""10.1186/s40561-020-00122-x"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.06.012"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00274"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2009.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.07.012"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103683"", ""10.1177/0735633120963828""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

They constitute and shape historic urban landscapes that are an integral part of sustainable urban development and sustainable development in a broader sense of humanity in general. However, the sustainable links between the heritage building and historic urban landscape are not well analyzed yet. Meanwhile, the idea that heritage should be a driver of sustainable urban development is more and more explicitly expressed and the concept of historic urban landscape is considered favorable in this regard. The aim of this research was to formulate the theoretical model demonstrating the links between the heritage building, historic urban landscape and sustainable development that would be applied in policy making and planning for heritage driven sustainable urban development. The methods of research included literature review, analysis and synthesis. In order to reach this aim, the analysis of literature on sustainability of cultural heritage, especially heritage buildings was carried out, the concept of historic urban landscape and its implications for sustainability were analyzed and the Halstar approach [29]. based on the systems model adding the dimensions of time and scale to sustainability model developed by the English engineering firm Halcrow was elaborated in the context of heritage buildings and historic urban landscape. The result of the research is the model of the links between heritage building, historic urban landscape and sustainable development, which could be applied in urban development policy design and planning.","[{""name"": ""Indre Grazuleviciute-Vileniske"", ""affiliation"": [""Kaunas University of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Lina Seduikyte"", ""affiliation"": [""Kaunas University of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Aurelija Daugelaite"", ""affiliation"": [""Kaunas University of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Kastytis Rudokas"", ""affiliation"": [""Kaunas University of Technology""]}]","[""10.1016/j.culher.2018.08.010"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2018.01.008"", ""10.1016/s1296-2074(03)00007-4"", ""10.1080/096132199369354"", ""10.1016/j.ccs.2016.10.001"", ""10.1080/17567505.2018.1517192"", ""10.1080/13527258.2018.1552615"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2018.10.002"", ""10.5210/bsi.v19i0.2789"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2004.05.001"", ""10.1080/13527258.2014.955812"", ""10.1016/s1296-2074(03)00008-6"", ""10.1016/j.ccs.2018.12.001"", ""10.4324/9781315765747"", ""10.1080/17567505.2018.1424615"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2008.02.008"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2018.09.029"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2012.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2016.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.05.003"", ""10.19097/kaser.2016.26.4.40"", ""10.3390/su9101882"", ""10.1680/ensu.9.00064"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2014.01.004"", ""10.22616/j.landarchart.2018.13.04"", ""10.2478/aup-2018-0009"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198826248.003.0005"", ""10.5334/bak"", ""10.1108/jchmsd-12-2016-0064"", ""10.1002/9780470759547"", ""10.5755/j01.erem.75.2.22823"", ""10.3390/su10082603"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.05.008"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2019.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2018.06.009"", ""10.1080/13527258.2013.828649"", ""10.5334/bak.n"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2019.102489"", ""10.1016/j.hbrcj.2017.06.001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Geology', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

There is a lack of data available from the building’s history, the difficulty in assessing the condition of a building and the variety of stakeholders’ needs that have to be satisfied. The purpose of this paper is to answer the question: how would end-of-life (EOL) DMP change when buildings will have been digitally built? The answer will be illustrated through a conceptual framework. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative analysis of the existing literature has been performed to identify the elements within building information modelling (BIM) and advanced digital technologies that could be of support to the DMP. The findings have been collected and summarised in a conceptual framework that has been validated and enhanced through online interviews with industry experts. Findings The enhanced framework has identified that BIM technology would bring the benefit of providing the initial digital data source, from which machine learning and data analytics would then extract the relevant data needed to measure accurately the criteria during the analysis of the EOL options put on the table. Originality/value The findings of this research could contribute to developing the software modules making the bridge between BIM and machine learning technologies, to implement them in the EOL DMP.","[{""name"": ""Aurora Abruzzini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sepehr Abrishami"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/F-06-2016-0064"", ""10.1080/09537287.2019.1695006"", ""10.1155/2014/158252"", ""10.1680/jfoen.16.00026"", ""10.1007/s12544-012-0074-9"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2016.07.001"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1108/20441241111143768"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.001"", ""10.1201/b12516-88"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.11.016"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.019"", ""10.2307/3211488"", ""10.3390/buildings7030065"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2019.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.02.007"", ""10.3390/rs12152358"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-11-2016-0075"", ""10.1108/SS-02-2015-0008"", ""10.31235/osf.io/42nkm"", ""10.3846/13923730.2011.582380"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.09.008"", ""10.5812/sdme.67670"", ""10.5121/ijmnct.2013.3303"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2010.12.014"", ""10.1080/14780887.2013.801543"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(98)00097-1"", ""10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.10.014"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000941"", ""10.3846/jcem.2010.30"", ""10.1016/0926-5805(92)90014-B"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.10.023"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.12.008""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geology', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0536,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Free vibration analysis of a laminated honeycomb sandwich panel: a suggested analytical solution and a numerical validation,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the free vibration response of a laminated honeycomb sandwich panels (LHSP) for aerospace applications. Higher order shear deformation theory (HSDT) was simplified for the dynamic analysis of LHSP. Furthermore, the effects of honeycomb parameters on the value of natural frequency (NF) of vibration were explored. Design/methodology/approach This paper applies HSDT to the analysis of composite LHSP to derive four vibration differential equations of motion and solve it to find the NF of vibration. Two analytical models (Nayak and Meunier models) were selected from literature for comparison of the NF of vibration. In addition, a numerical model was built by using ABAQUS and the results were compared. Furthermore, parametric studies were conducted to explore the effect of honeycomb parameters on the value of the NF of vibration. Findings The present model is successful in simplifying HSDT for the analysis of LHSP. The first five natural frequencies of vibration were calculated analytically and numerically. In the parametric study, increasing core height or young’s modulus or changing laminate layup will increase the value of NF of vibration. Furthermore, increasing plate constraint (using clamped edge boundary condition) will increase the value of NF of vibrations. Research limitations/implications The current analysis is suitable for all-composite symmetric LHSP. However, for isotropic or non-symmetric materials, minor modifications might be adopted. Originality/value The application of simplified HSDT to the analysis of LHSP is one of the important values of this research. The other is the successful and complete dynamic analysis of all-composite LHSP.","[{""name"": ""Mustafa S. Al-Khazraji"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M. J.

10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0569,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Exploring the impact of social capitals and knowledge creation on construction firms performance in the COVID-19 era,"Purpose Creativity and productivity are important factors for corporate and government institutions in the COVID-19 era. As a result, there is an urgent need to ensure that construction projects can recover adequately to survive potential surges or even potential epidemics. Therefore, this study aims to explore social capital by examining the effect/impact of knowledge creation on construction performance in the COVID-19 era. Design/methodology/approach A simple random sampling approach focused on Ghanaian construction firms was used. Completed responses were obtained and analyzed from employees who had tasks on sites. SmartPLS 3.3.3 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences v. 26 was used. Findings One key finding from this research was that construction firms with solid social capital built by their management staff are more connected and have better adaptive systems than firms with low capital. A company’s development programs must concentrate not only on the development of targeted or selective know-how and professional abilities but also on capacity creating, collaboration and knowledge creation and sharing among its employees. Originality/value Using this study’s findings, construction professionals can develop successful solutions to the COVID-19 epidemic and future emergencies.

Design/methodology/approach This study was conducted in a laboratory by testing the characteristics of fresh and hardened properties of self-compacting concrete. Findings Rheological and mechanical properties of SCC were evaluated in detail and according to the results, a concrete sample containing lower NMAS with BG demonstrated improvement in modulus of elasticity and compressive strength, while improving the rheological properties as well. Meanwhile, SCC demonstrated poor performance in split tensile and flexural strengths with lower NMAS gradations and a direct correlation was evident as the increase in NMAS caused an increase in the strength and vice-versa. Originality/value Upon comparison of BG with ISG, it was revealed that BG mixes succeeded to demonstrate superior performance. From the material optimization, rheological and mechanical performance study, it is recommended that BG with NMAS 16 mm can be used for conventional SCC.","[{""name"": ""Adithya Tantri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gopinatha Nayak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adithya Shenoy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kiran K.

Consequently, several guidelines have been developed and instituted by various countries to prevent the spread of the disease among the citizenry. This paper aims to explore the COVID-19 guidelines incorporated in the health and safety management policies of construction firms in South Africa.Design/methodology/approachA qualitative approach was adopted for the study. Data was collected from construction companies by means of an open-ended questionnaire. The open-ended questionnaire was distributed by using the purposive sampling technique. The collected data was analysed with thematic content analysis.FindingsThe findings show that most construction companies have incorporated aspects of COVID-19 guidelines into the site health and safety policies, whereas the majority of the companies had incorporated guidelines such as site access, handling of COVID-19 cases, induction, screening and social distancing; only a few had incorporated guidelines such as compliance, sanitisation, sick leave, wearing of personal protective equipment, audit and risk assessment, lunchtime rules and grouping of workers into the health and safety policies on site.Research limitations/implicationsData was collected from higher grade firms; therefore, the research findings may not be applied to smaller construction firms. A study that focuses on lower grades is recommended.Practical implicationsConstruction companies could use the recommendations provided to improve upon the policies developed/adopted to curb the spread of CVID-19 on-site.Originality/valueResearch on COVID-19 construction site health and safety measures are still being developed. Thus, this study contributes to advancing the body of knowledge in this evolving field.","[{""name"": ""Fredrick Simpeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Amoah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17452007.2012.683242"", ""10.3233/PRM-200808"", ""10.37624/IJERT/13.5.2020.828-830"", ""10.3846/13923730.2013.812578"", ""10.36941/mjss-2020-0047"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2004.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.06.015"", ""10.1108/SASBE-05-2020-0068"", ""10.1093/occmed/kqaa036"", ""10.1680/mpal900074"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.11.007"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1602580"", ""10.1515/cclm-2020-0764"", ""10.11113/intrest.v14nS2.71"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2011.01.003"", ""10.1093/occmed/kqaa053"", ""10.1177/1090198103259185"", ""10.1016/S2155-8256(18)30150-9"", ""10.1002/hfm.20882"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1707853"", ""10.1155/2020/6620539"", ""10.46945/bpj.10.1.03.01""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Decision Sciences']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-04-2020-0154,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A multi-criteria decision-making model for selecting curtain wall systems in office buildings,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a model that facilitates the evaluation and selection processes of curtain wall systems used in office buildings. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review and interviews with local experts were conducted to identify common types of curtain wall systems used in office buildings and their selection criteria. A questionnaire was designed and completed using multi-criteria decision-making techniques through face-to-face meetings with consultants in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The proposed model was implemented in prototype software as a proof of concept. Findings The results revealed that fire resistance scored the highest weighting of all the criteria. Furthermore, precast concrete cladding panels were found to be the best system for use in office buildings located in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The model validation reveals that the score for any curtain wall system varies depending on the nature of the project and that the prioritisation of criteria can vary from one practitioner to another. Originality/value The model captures the knowledge of professionals who are experts in the prioritisation of criteria for selecting curtain wall systems. The research design presented expands the boundaries of knowledge of the relevant literature, through demonstrating a conceptual framework incorporating different techniques into a computerised model. It has practical implications through presenting a systematic procedure for developing and adopting a computerised decision-making tool, which aligns experts’ professional practice and requirements, for use in selecting fragmented options.","[{""name"": ""Hamza Hamida"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adel Alshibani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/09699981011038079"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.10.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0431(1996)2:3(115)"", ""10.1108/SS-10-2013-0035"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2019.101974"", ""10.1061/9780784412329.162"", ""10.1061/9780784412701.ch06"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.10.004"", ""10.1080/01446190310001631019"", ""10.1108/02630800410563750"", ""10.1061/9780784412701.ch07"", ""10.1080/01446190802244789"", ""10.1287/mnsc.38.5.645"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.02.111"", ""10.3233/FDE-150037"", ""10.3846/13923730.2013.801906"", ""10.1061/9780784412701.ch04"", ""10.1061/9780784412701.ch03"", ""10.1108/14714170610710631"", ""10.1061/9780784412701.ch02"", ""10.1061/9780784412701.ch05"", ""10.1061/9780784412701.ch01"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.05.016"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0203"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0064"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2009.11.026"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.11.003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:4(307)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000198"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.07.201"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2003.08.014"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.019"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.01.057"", ""10.1108/IJESM-03-2014-0005""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

10.1111/jade.12255,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,A Decline in Drawing Ability?,"AbstractThis research surveys changing attitudes to drawing pedagogy, in the context of digitisation, moves toward student‐centred learning in art &amp; design higher education, and anecdotal reports of declining competence. Based on student, teacher and examiner’s experiences, it has been possible to gain insights into how drawing instruction has changed over the past generation. This article examines the attitudes, values and concerns of students and educators regarding drawing instruction. The study reveals that, in the UK, drawing skills are considered to be gradually declining, while traditional notions of skill are called into question. Drawing as a means of visual recording, representation and communication remains valued, although no longer essential as it once was; drawing to augment thought process is increasingly recognised as an integral skill which enables innovation. The latter is rarely ‘taught’ but relies on core competencies that many lecturers fear are being eroded. Increasing value is placed on drawing ‘as process’, as provision is moving towards individualised instruction requiring students to work independently. While new technologies are a factor, this article re‐frames the issue as an imbalance between creative outcomes and creative process, with a disparity between school and university levels. This article calls for a renewed emphasis on ‘drawing as process’ as preparation for university, and for further consideration of the core competencies underpinning the use of drawing as a tool of thought, and how these might be standardised.","[{""name"": ""Michelle Fava"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/10464880260472512"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(01)00038-2"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2005.03.001"", ""10.1093/intqhc/mzg031"", ""10.1007/s10798-006-9020-2"", ""10.1111/jade.12265"", ""10.1108/10748120110424816"", ""10.1386/adch.4.3.189/1"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00261"", ""10.4324/9780203818848""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

We start by discussing several theories to understand technology-induced value mediation: mediation approach, technology assessment methods, and types of value change. We continue by connecting these theories to design practice by proposing a new design for values methodology: Values that Matter. This methodology provides the means to evaluate moral mediation of technology during the design process and to responsibly design for it.

This pandemic had negative effects on the public in general and on students’ performance. This study aimed to evaluate the perceived performance of design students participating in online distance learning due to the COVID‐19 pandemic lockdown in the UAE. The evaluation of the students’ negative emotions and their impact on creativity and design performance was conducted in two design courses. The case study included 193 design students, 140 first year and 53 fourth year students who are enrolled from the College of Fine Arts and Design. An online survey was used as a post‐evaluation tool for the students. Two focus group interviews were conducted for instructors who were involved in the sudden remote teaching. The findings showed the instructors’ deep understanding of the students’ emotions and how such emotions are reflected on performance during the pandemic. First year students had higher anxiety levels than fourth students, which negatively affected their design practice and learning performance for the lack of design experience. However, first years produced creative projects. Fourth years also had high anxiety levels, but they showed a higher level of satisfaction in their performance than first years. This study explored the impact, changes and challenges brought about by the pandemic experience and how instructors could benefit from it in future. Online classes changed the way design was taught and delivered. Blended learning is considered as a motivational and creative learning process.","[{""name"": ""Dana Khalid Amro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.19173/irrodl.v5i2.188"", ""10.1002/cc.402"", ""10.19173/irrodl.v19i3.3585"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0107-0"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934"", ""10.1016/j.joms.2020.04.033"", ""10.1007/s10798-014-9265-0"", ""10.1007/s10798-015-9322-3"", ""10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30073-0"", ""10.1080/1475939X.2017.1380695"", ""10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102147"", ""10.1177/0020764020925108"", ""10.1177/2096531120923664"", ""10.1080/00220670109598764"", ""10.1080/17452007.2017.1300129"", ""10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028"", ""10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102074"", ""10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101564"", ""10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2795"", ""10.5644/ama2006-124.269"", ""10.1017/S003329172000121X"", ""10.1056/NEJMc2003717"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2017.02.043"", ""10.1109/TE.2019.2925320"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.10.001"", ""10.1007/s12564-018-9560-7"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2010.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.nedt.2016.05.016"", ""10.28945/243"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009"", ""10.1177/0020764020915212"", ""10.1016/j.dib.2020.105682"", ""10.1001/jama.2020.1585"", ""10.1007/s10798-020-09565-2"", ""10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112998"", ""10.1056/NEJMoa2001017"", ""10.1148/radiol.2020200490""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

To investigate the role of AR technologies in interior design experiences, we highlight the interdisciplinary design of a mobile AR-application to assess and enhance the effectiveness of building design strategies for a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-Gold academic incubator. Drawing on user feedback data, observations, and in-depth interviews of 15 building occupants, we identified the affordances of mobile-AR for interior design. Our findings suggest approaches for contextualizing post-occupancy user feedback and interior design across the digital-physical spatial continuum and illustrate how AR has the potential to expand the goals of post-occupancy evaluations, beyond improved evaluation to enhancement , by allowing the building to teach occupants about resources while nudging them to utilize spatial features designed to enhance wellness. As hybrid interior environments are becoming more dependent on a convergence of the digital and physical, we found a series of strategies and practices for enhancing user experiences. A key contribution of our research is a framework, grounded in affordance theory, useful for designing and examining hybrid spaces at the intersection of AR and interior design.","[{""name"": ""Leah Scolere"", ""affiliation"": [""Colorado State University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Laura Malinin"", ""affiliation"": [""Colorado State University, USA""]}]","[""10.1145/3173574.3173618"", ""10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355"", ""10.1080/09523987.2014.889400"", ""10.3102/0013189X018001032"", ""10.4135/9781452218403.n25"", ""10.1080/13504622.2017.1398817"", ""10.1177/1206331206289022"", ""10.1007/s10956-008-9119-1"", ""10.1177/0163443717698871"", ""10.1177/2050157916677861"", ""10.1145/108844.108856"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2014.987152"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00539.x"", ""10.1097/ACM.0b013e31820df8e2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39215-3_10"", ""10.1177/2050157914530700"", ""10.3200/JRLP.142.6.561-580"", ""10.1002/sej.1242"", ""10.3200/JRLP.139.6.495-512"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.02.024"", ""10.1080/1369118X.2014.989252"", ""10.1177/2050157918792438"", ""10.1177/1461444814527734"", ""10.1177/2050157919899696"", ""10.1145/3325480.3326576"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.14"", ""10.1177/2056305115603385"", ""10.1145/1409040.1409044"", ""10.1007/s10055-018-0363-2"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2021.078"", ""10.12948/issn14531305/22.3.2018.01"", ""10.1016/j.rai.2016.01.004"", ""10.1080/07421222.2019.1628877"", ""10.1080/00405840709336547"", ""10.1007/s11528-013-0720-7""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0419,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Structural modeling of lean supply chain enablers: a hybrid AHP and ISM-MICMAC based approach,"Purpose Today the role of industry 4.0 plays a very important role in enhancing any supply chain network, as the industry 4.0 supply chain uses Big Data and advanced analytics to inform the complete visibility. Latest data are available to bring clarity and support real-time decision-making in the entire supply chain that’s why adopting optimization techniques such as lean manufacturing and lean supply chain concept for enhancing the supply chain network of the organizations is a good idea and would benefit them in increasing their cost efficiency and productivity. The purpose of this work is to develop a technique, which may be useful for future researchers and managers to identify and classification of the significant lean supply chain enablers. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors considered hybrid analytical hierarchy process to find the ranking of the identified lean supply chain enablers by calculating their weightage. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) is applied to develop the structural interrelationship among various lean supply chain management enablers. Considering the results obtained from ISM the Matrices d'Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliqué a un Classement (MICMAC) analysis is done to identify the driving and dependence power of Lean Supply Chain Management Enablers (LSCMEs). Findings Further, the best results applying these methodologies could be used to analyze their inter-relationships for successful Lean supply chain management implementation in an organization. The authors developed an integrated model after the identification of 20 key LSCMEs, which is very helpful to identify and classify the important enablers by ISM methodology and explore the direct and indirect effects of each enabler by MICMAC analysis on the LSCM implementation. This will help organizations optimize their supply chain by selective control of lean enablers. Practical implications For lean manufacturing practitioners, the result of the study can be beneficial where the manufacturer is required to increase efficiency and reduce cost and wastage of resources in the lean manufacturing process, as well as in enhancing the supply chain.

10.1111/jade.12329,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Predicting Academic Success: A Longitudinal Study of University Design Students,"AbstractThis article presents a longitudinal study, over eleven years, of the academic progress of a cohort of design students (n = 475) at a major Australian university. The students were from four different spatial design disciplines: architecture, industrial design, interior design, and landscape architecture. The article identifies cognitive variables that may predict future academic success. This research uses regression analysis to identify correlations across a range of variables, in particular exploring the relationship between university entrance scores, subjects studied at school (art and graphics) and academic success as defined by university grade point average and time to completion. This study shows that prior knowledge in art and graphics is not a useful predictor of future academic success, while university entrance scores and first year performance are related to ongoing academic success. These results suggest that for the design disciplines explored here, discipline‐specific prior knowledge is not an important requirement for university entrance.","[{""name"": ""Philip Crowther"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sarah Briant"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1353/rhe.2017.0000"", ""10.1080/10668926.2016.1179606"", ""10.1177/1521025119854688"", ""10.1080/08832323.1996.10116824"", ""10.12930/NACADA-17-044"", ""10.1080/0142159X.2018.1426840"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog1302_1"", ""10.5688/ajpe6499"", ""10.1002/sce.20164"", ""10.1016/S0022-5371(72)80001-X"", ""10.5204/jld.v6i3.155"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8454.2004.00222.x"", ""10.1093/heapro/daz069"", ""10.1002/2211-5463.12707"", ""10.1080/02602938.2018.1525602"", ""10.1177/1521025119866689"", ""10.5688/aj7205113"", ""10.1177/1521025115611130"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2012.08.015"", ""10.1007/s10212-011-0099-9"", ""10.2307/1320012"", ""10.1080/10668926.2016.1168328"", ""10.15694/mep.2017.000042"", ""10.1080/07924360120043621"", ""10.1007/s10459-008-9103-9"", ""10.1037/cou0000319"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2009.01595.x"", ""10.1353/csd.2006.0013"", ""10.1162/0011526054622015"", ""10.1080/01425692.2014.987728"", ""10.1002/berj.3158"", ""10.1111/1467-985X.00209"", ""10.1145/2623330.2623355"", ""10.1080/13600800500120142"", ""10.1080/10627197.2015.997614"", ""10.3102/00028312042003439""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0201,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Performance management within the Dutch steel processing industry,"Purpose A comprehensive literature review of performance management within the Dutch steel processing industry is presented. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the motives for companies to become excellent performers in their field of expertise. These internal and external motives (refined by quantitative analysis of bibliographic data) sought to reveal the common factors that impact company performance. Design/methodology/approach Inductive reasoning was adopted using an interpretivist philosophical stance to generate new theoretical insight. A mixed-methods analysis of pertinent extant literature afforded greater synthesis of the research problem domain and generated more valid and reliable findings. The software visualisation of similarities viewer was used to conduct a qualitative bibliographic analysis of extant literature to yield greater clarification on the phenomena under investigation. Findings Four thematic groups of past research endeavours emerged from the analysis and were assigned appropriate nomenclature, namely: industry internal motives; industry external motives; excellent performer and incremental working method. To further expand upon the continuous improvement process (CIP – embodied within performance management), the paper describes the virtuous cycle of improvement, which consists of the consecutive steps of “planning”, “doing”, “checking” and ultimately of “acting” accordingly to the previous steps. It can be concluded that a high-performing company acts according to its mission, plans in line with the vision do as defined in the strategy and checks by reflection. Originality/value This unique study provides invaluable insight into the performance management of Dutch steel processing companies. Although the research context was narrowly defined, the findings presented are equally applicable to clients, contractors and sub-contractors active in other sectors of the construction industry. The research concludes by prescribing factors of mitigation strategies to support chief executive officers to focus on the optimum distribution of their scarce resources.","[{""name"": ""Ralf Jan Benjamin Van der Meij"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chris Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hatem El-Gohary"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Posillico"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:3(433)"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1819584"", ""10.1142/S0218843000000107"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00121"", ""10.1108/14691930310487815"", ""10.1108/14635770410520320"", ""10.1108/01443579910291032"", ""10.1108/00251740510597761"", ""10.1108/00438020210441867"", ""10.1108/01443579910294291"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2004.04.007"", ""10.1002/asi.20317"", ""10.1002/asi.21525"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103081"", ""10.1177/002224299405800404"", ""10.1016/0148-2963(94)90032-9"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.08.012"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2018-0125"", ""10.1108/14714171011018292"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-09-2020-0079"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2018.03.024"", ""10.2307/41166210"", ""10.1080/714023845"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1992)118:3(422)"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(92)90067-J"", ""10.3102/0013189X033007014"", ""10.1080/0954412997127"", ""10.3390/su12031125"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2010.06.005"", ""10.1006/mare.2000.0130"", ""10.1016/j.porgcoat.2019.105315"", ""10.2307/41165264"", ""10.1108/00251740210430461"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0193"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2020-0016"", ""10.1006/mare.1999.0115"", ""10.1177/095001702762217443"", ""10.1177/1354066118757854"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2007.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.jcsr.2017.07.010"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0507"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2020-0289"", ""10.1177/0957926595006002005"", ""10.1108/13683040210431419"", ""10.1016/j.mar.2020.100677"", ""10.1038/nmat5021"", ""10.1108/00438029910272427""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

Although previous studies had examined both organizational leadership (OL) and employee well-being (EWB) in the CI, a bibliometric and systematic analysis of published articles is hitherto lacking. Therefore, this paper aims to conduct a bibliometric and scientometric review of published articles related to OL and EWB in the CI between 2008 and 2022. Design/methodology/approach A three-step method consisting of a bibliometric analysis, a scientometric analysis and an in-depth discussion were used. A total of 1,114 articles met the inclusion criteria. All articles were retrieved from the Scopus database. Findings The results present an in-depth discussion of the research publication trends, keywords co-occurrence analysis, document analysis and countries/regions analysis. This review paper identified three main research gaps in OL and EWB in the CI, namely, project management, technology innovation and people orientation. It also proposes “OL-EWB in the CI”' mechanisms and a theoretical framework to guide future research directions. Originality/value This review paper theoretically fills the gap in the lack of research summarizing OL and EWB in the CI and provides research gaps and trends for achieving a win-win situation for both companies and employees.","[{""name"": ""Jiaqi Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maxwell Fordjour Antwi-Afari"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.02.016"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-04-2014-0035"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2023.01.011"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.126870"", ""10.1016/j.ergon.2021.103113"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.016"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163621"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.01.008"", ""10.5539/ass.v9n5p18"", ""10.1061/jmenea.meeng-5491"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000063"", ""10.4102/sajip.v43i0.1478"", ""10.1108/ecam-04-2015-0053"", ""10.1108/SD-08-2014-0097"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.04.070"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.05.007"", ""10.1177/1059601111401017"", ""10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.3838005"", ""10.1108/bepam-10-2017-0080"", ""10.1016/j.leaqua.2017.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.156"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000747"", ""10.3390/buildings13010178"", ""10.3390/su15032458"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0001076"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000252"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.10.010"", ""10.1080/01446190210156073"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0002205"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102947"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.04.042"", ""10.21315/aamj2019.24.2.4"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2012-0032"", ""10.1108/jedt-05-2019-0121"", ""10.1080/01446190701821810"", ""10.3390/buildings12122068"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-12-2013-0074"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.joi.2016.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.04.011"", ""10.1108/jfmpc-01-2017-0004"", ""10.1108/MD-11-2014-0651"", ""10.3390/buildings12071013"", ""10.3390/asi5060109"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0000203"", ""10.1108/EJIM-12-2018-0269"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.03.011"", ""10.1109/isgtasia49270.2021.9715694"", ""10.1108/jedt-08-2019-0192"", ""10.1108/09699980810886856"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000027"", ""10.1007/s11192-009-0146-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10377-8_13"", ""10.1108/MD-02-2023-0284"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.12.021"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.02.013"", ""10.3846/jcem.2022.16928"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.07.012"", ""10.1007/s10551-015-2943-3"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000115"", ""10.1002/job.1884""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.3233/JID-220013,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,Natural language processing (NLP) aided qualitative method in health research,"Qualitative data analysis is produced frequently in healthcare settings, which is a time-consuming and skilled analytic task. The use of qualitative research findings in clinical settings takes years, which is sometimes obsolete knowledge as the health context is dynamic. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based qualitative data analysis might present with rapid analysis of text-based data in real-time, thereby empowering qualitative researchers to expedite their analysis and facilitate timely use of the research findings. We tested an AI-based method to complement the manual analysis of text-based data from the verbatim transcripts of seven mall managers’ interviews. First, we prepared text data into a machine-calculable format and employed BERT model to extract sentence-level features in our case. Second, we implement TF-IDF-based keywords mining techniques to extract the main candidate themes from the interview transcripts to support text-based analysis, including: 1) primary cluster detection algorithm, and 2) keyword extraction algorithm. The extracted core themes provide qualitative researchers with a more comprehensive overview of the qualitative data. Most of the sentences clustered in meaningful short topics or sentences carrying independent and clear information. The extracted topics and clustered sentences reduced qualitative researchers’ workload by condensing and identifying meaningful concepts and naming them. This method combining contextualized word embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and keyword extraction techniques can significantly reduce the overall workload and time consumed in qualitative research using conventional methods.","[{""name"": ""Cheligeer Cheligeer"", ""affiliation"": [""Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"", ""Centre for Health Informatics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Lin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada"", ""Department of Cancer, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"", ""Department of Community Health Science, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Tannistha Nandi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Information Technologies, Research Computing Services, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Chelsea Doktorchik"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Health Informatics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"", ""Department of Community Health Science, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Hude Quan"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Health Informatics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"", ""Department of Community Health Science, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Yong Zeng"", ""affiliation"": [""Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Shaminder Singh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Community Health Science, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"", ""School of Nursing and Midwifery, Faculty of Health, Community and Education, Mount Royal University, Calgary, AB, Canada""]}]","[""10.1098/rsta.2018.0080"", ""10.4997/jrcpe.2015.305"", ""10.1145/3185515"", ""10.1177/2050312118822927"", ""10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.02.008"", ""10.1145/3458754"", ""10.1007/s11121-015-0561-z"", ""10.4137/BII.S11661"", ""10.1016/j.jbi.2013.09.003"", ""10.1145/331499.331504"", ""10.1038/sdata.2016.35"", ""10.1162/089120100750105975"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btz682"", ""10.1177/1609406919887021"", ""10.1177/0049124117729703"", ""10.1007/s11431-020-1647-3"", ""10.1162/tacl_a_00313"", ""10.25139/jsk.v4i1.2180"", ""10.1177/1754073919898526"", ""10.1177/2333393618799571"", ""10.34068/joe.56.02.04"", ""10.1177/1049732307307031""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['General Social Sciences', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7378), ('0303 社会学', 0.7345)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0471,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on local construction firms' viability,"Purpose This paper aims to assess COVID-19 (C-19) pandemic influence in the 37 factors identified from extant literature as factors influencing the viability of local construction firms (LCFs). Design/methodology/approach A sample size of 65 staff of 31 LCFs that were awarded construction projects contracts in institutions in Nigeria was purposefully selected and accessed based on relevant predetermined criteria. Respondents’ views on factors determining the viability of LCFs were obtained. Factors known to be influenced by C-19 are 25 of the 37 factors rated on a five-point Likert scale of importance by the respondents. Mean scores were used to rank the factors and principal component analysis was used to obtain key component factors (CFs) influenced by the C-19 pandemic. Findings Six of the first ten “extremely important” and “very important” factors are known to be influenced by C-19 pandemic. A total of 8 CFs having 20 variables with factor loadings of more than 0.5 each were known to be influenced by C-19. The C-19 pandemic influenced LCFs’ cash flow and management of construction labour, plant and equipment amidst variables that had above 0.8 factor loading. Research limitations/implications A limitation of this study is the inability to conduct close contact interview during this period to obtain personal views on the influence of C-19 on LCFs. However, this does not reduce the quality of findings of this study, as there are valid literature basis hinging this study findings. Practical implications The paper recommends that all stakeholders pay prompt attention to the factors adversely affected by the C-19 pandemic to improve or at the least sustain the viability of LCFs. Originality/value This paper fulfils a present pertinent need of assessing the influence of the C-19 pandemic on various factors influencing the viability of construction firms.","[{""name"": ""Olubimbola Oladimeji"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01446199500000023"", ""10.1080/014461997373141"", ""10.6092/issn.1561-8048/10930"", ""10.1108/13664380910977619"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.12.010"", ""10.3846/13923730.2007.9636434"", ""10.3390/ijerph18041559"", ""10.1057/palgrave.mel.9100179"", ""10.1057/mel.2012.19"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)00001-5"", ""10.3386/w27426"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102182"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2021.102803"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2007)23:1(10)"", ""10.25046/aj0505119"", ""10.1080/0144619032000111241"", ""10.3386/w27462"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:3(424)"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-10-2017-0040"", ""10.22146/jcef.54997"", ""10.1016/j.jksues.2012.03.002"", ""10.3389/fbuil.2021.688495"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2000)126:6(414)"", ""10.1177/0013164405282485"", ""10.5755/j01.ee.26.4.9843"", ""10.1080/01446190902960474"", ""10.3846/jcem.2010.06"", ""10.1080/01446190110101218"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000501"", ""10.1080/014461999371411"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1988)114:2(172)"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.12.498"", ""10.1080/01446190600799729"", ""10.1093/Occmed/Kqaa036"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:6(799)"", ""10.1016/j. exis.2020.04.003"", ""10.1080/01446190010002570"", ""10.1057/s41291-020-00119-x"", ""10.1016/j.ajsl.2018.06.006"", ""10.3389/fpubh.2020"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04018"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2007.05.005"", ""10.18820/24150487/as26i2.5"", ""10.2478/jeppm-2020-0021"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-01-2017-0003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2004)20:3(110)"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102173"", ""10.1186/s41937-020-00057-7"", ""10.1080/1540496X.2020.1785863"", ""10.36941/mjss-2020-0063"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1874678"", ""10.2478/joim-2020-0029"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"", ""10.2478/jeppm-2019-0014"", ""10.1061/41109(373)97."", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2007)23:3(131)"", ""10.21203/rs.3.rs-34541/v1""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Decision Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'General Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0905 畜牧学', 0.7446), ('0909 草学', 0.741)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2020-0007,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Implementing 5D BIM on construction projects: contractor perspectives from the UK construction sector,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to report on primary research findings that sought to investigate and analyse salient issues on the implementation of 5D building information modelling (BIM) from the UK contractors’ perspective. Previous research and efforts have predominantly focussed on the use of technologies for cost estimation and quantity takeoff within a more traditional-led procurement, with a paucity of research focussing on how 5D BIM could facilitate costing within contractor-led procurement. This study fills this current knowledge gap and enhances the understanding of the specific costing challenges faced by contractors in contractor-led projects, leading to the development of 5D framework for use in future projects.Design/methodology/approachTo develop a fully detailed understanding of the challenges and issues being faced in this regard, a phenomenological, qualitative-based study was undertaken through interviews involving 21 participants from UK-wide construction organisations. A thematic data analytical process was applied to the data to derive key issues, and this was then used to inform the development of a 5D-BIM costing framework.FindingsMulti-disciplinary findings reveal a range of issues faced by contractors when implementing 5D BIM. These exist at strategic, operational and technological levels which require addressing successful implementation of 5D BIM on contractor-led projects adhering to Level 2 BIM standards. These findings cut across the range of stakeholders on contractor-led projects. Ultimately, the findings suggest strong commitment and leadership from organisational management are required to facilitate cost savings and generate accurate cost information.Practical implicationsThis study highlights key issues for any party seeking to effectively deploy 5D BIM on a contractor-led construction project. A considerable cultural shift towards automating and digitising cost functions virtually, stronger collaborative working relationship relative to costing in design development, construction practice, maintenance and operation is required.Originality/valueBy analysing findings from primary research data, the work concludes with the development of a 5D BIM costing framework to support contractor-led projects which can be implemented to ensure that 5D BIM is successfully implemented.","[{""name"": ""Tochukwu Moses"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Heesom"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Oloke"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/1525822X06287602"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.05.008"", ""10.1080/01446190600892995"", ""10.14424/ijcscm501015-01-15"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.10.020"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2014.10.561"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2018-0080"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.05.005"", ""10.1108/13664381111116089"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.03.053"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.06.179"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v14i1.3786"", ""10.1136/ebn.3.3.68""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

The identification of barriers to implementation is critical for achieving implementation success. This paper introduces and discusses a deductive theory-based framework, TASKS, to guide the identification of implementation barriers. The TASKS framework deals with the relationships between a Task and the task implementer’s Affect, Skills, and Knowledge, based on the inversed U-shaped mental Stress-mental effort relation. The TASKS framework classifies implementation barriers into four categories: 1) emotion barriers, 2) logic barriers, 3) knowledge barriers, and 4) resources barriers. The TASKS framework detects barriers to implementation following three steps, 1) identifying the ideal TASKS components, 2) modelling the implementer's mental capability, and 3) detecting barriers to implementation. The TASKS framework can be applied to a wide range of disciplines for effective and efficient task implementation.","[{""name"": ""Jiami Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1M8"", ""Department of Community Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 4Z6""]}, {""name"": ""Lin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Cancer Care Alberta, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2S 3C3; Departments of Oncology and Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 4N2""]}, {""name"": ""Hude Quan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Community Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 4Z6""]}, {""name"": ""Yong Zeng"", ""affiliation"": [""Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1M8"", ""Department of Community Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 4Z6""]}]",[],['Decision Sciences'],['Management Science and Operations Research'],"[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using an online survey completed by 138 respondents who work in design consultancy firms in Jordan, including project managers, architects and quantity surveyors (QSs). Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Confirmatory interviews and case study comparisons were used to confirm the statistical analysis results. Findings The results of this study indicated that each design stage’s cost estimate was affected by several factors. Two significant factors were common across four of the five design stages: client experience and project team experience. In addition, a high level of agreement was observed among the project managers, architects and QSs regarding the factors affecting cost estimate accuracy. Originality/value Accurately estimating building construction costs during the design process has posed a challenge for designers and their clients in Jordan. Despite the care and effort involved in preparing cost estimates in each of the five design stages, deviations are commonly observed. Because the accuracy of building construction cost estimates directly affect the success or failure of a project, the results of this study can be used to reduce uncertainties in building construction cost estimation and subsequently increase the likelihood of project success","[{""name"": ""Tala Hassan Dandan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ghaleb Sweis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lilana Salem Sukkari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rateb J.

10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0161,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Developing a model for investigating the impact of cloud-based systems on green supply chain management,"Purpose Cloud computing is one of the technologies that improves performance and reduces costs in companies through flexible and easy access to computational resources. Supply chain management is one of the widespread and unlimited computing resources. Applying cloud computing to the green supply chain will eliminate constraints and speed up the implementation of various chain processes. Therefore, this paper aims to present a model and framework for assessing the impact of cloud computing on green supply chain management, which improves the performance of the resulting system in comparison with previous systems. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a self-made questionnaire containing 38 questions was used to collect data. The questions were compiled based on the variables identified in previous studies. Besides, the answers to the questions were based on the five-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, no opinion, agree and strongly agree). By reviewing the subject literature, the factors that affect the green supply chain management have been identified, which include cost of services, user-friendly software, energy consumption, subscription and collaboration capabilities and self-service ability. Findings The findings confirmed the fitness of the proposed model and showed the impact of cloud computing on green supply chain management. In addition, results showed that considered variables (service cost, user-friendly applications, energy consumption, sharing and collaboration and self-service) significantly affect the success management of green supply chain. Practical implications The results of this research show that, to help effective management of the complexity of the supply chain, many companies have adopted an advanced IT strategy to increase the flow of information and, in turn, to increase their competitive advantage. Originality/value The development of a cloud computing-based green supply chain management system can lead to improved system performance compared to traditional systems, which can revolutionize a wide range of industries and businesses by clarification of businesses and making the processes smart. It can also reduce costs and improve performance of micro- and macro-business firms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a model for investigating the impact of cloud-based IT systems on green supply chain management.","[{""name"": ""Sahra Shirzad Talatappeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Lakzi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3923/jas.2008.3214.3220"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.171803"", ""10.1016/j.future.2011.04.017"", ""10.1108/JMTM-10-2012-0102"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1590982"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.3.436.12069"", ""10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2011.11.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-8349-9320-5_22"", ""10.1108/09574099310804957"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btn514"", ""10.1109/ISCC.2011.5984005"", ""10.1007/BF02310555"", ""10.1016/S0969-7012(99)00030-1"", ""10.1002/bse.557"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.2000.tb00938.x"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2010.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2017.05.009"", ""10.1108/JEIM-08-2014-0085"", ""10.1108/APJIE-04-2018-0024"", ""10.1145/1851476.1851542"", ""10.1109/JSYST.2010.2100197"", ""10.1088/0957-4484/19/34/345606"", ""10.1108/IMDS-12-2017-0589"", ""10.1093/nar/gks540"", ""10.1016/j.ifset.2006.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2010.12.006"", ""10.1509/jmkg.64.3.50.18024"", ""10.1080/17517570903030833"", ""10.1108/CR-10-2016-0067"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2019.01.056"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2006.12.064"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.05.017"", ""10.1108/IJLM-09-2012-0100"", ""10.1093/nar/gkp320"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2013.07.013"", ""10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.02.006"", ""10.1108/IMDS-01-2018-0049"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2370.2007.00202.x"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-3914-0.ch012"", ""10.1108/BIJ-11-2017-0293"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/10.5.569"", ""10.1145/1496091.1496100"", ""10.2307/20650284"", ""10.1111/j.1745-493x.2012.03287.x"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.042"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2010.09.091"", ""10.1108/K-06-2018-0280"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.009""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the applicability of radio frequency identification (RFID) and identify the barriers that impede its successful adoption in construction projects to achieve sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This paper opted for a quantitative approach by using a structured questionnaire survey. A total of 107 responses were collected from Nigerian construction practitioners involved in private and public construction businesses. Findings The results showed the high cost of RFID implementation, with a mean score of 4.42 as the top-ranked barrier, followed by lack of security, maintenance, power availability and inadequate training. This study further deployed Ginni’s mean difference measure of dispersion and revealed that the stationary barrier to adopting RFID technology is the lack of demand. Practical implications The findings of this research can assist decision-makers in improving the sustainability of all building projects by implementing RFID. Originality/value The findings of this study will serve as the basis for comprehension and critically evaluate the numerous barriers preventing the widespread adoption of RFID technology.","[{""name"": ""Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Farouk Kineber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oluwaseun Akindele"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Damilola Ekundayo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123113"", ""10.1080/10803548.2018.1445069"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120852"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00039-7"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2008)22:2(74)"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2006.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.304"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2009)23:3(148)"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1584836"", ""10.1007/s12130-007-9011-y"", ""10.1109/MSP.2005.78"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.06.004"", ""10.1080/014461997372971"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.05.024"", ""10.3390/su8050430"", ""10.3390/su9081436"", ""10.1007/s10623-005-6343-z"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.126115"", ""10.3390/buildings10120239"", ""10.3390/su12219143"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002026"", ""10.3390/su15032458"", ""10.1109/MP.2005.1549751"", ""10.3390/su12197956"", ""10.1080/01446193.2016.1242762"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.04.004"", ""10.5121/ijmvsc.2015.6405"", ""10.3390/buildings11020036"", ""10.3390/su15010468"", ""10.1016/0360-1323(87)90024-2"", ""10.1016/j.dib.2019.104290"", ""10.3390/math11030497"", ""10.1080/01449290512331321910"", ""10.1109/JRPROC.1948.226245"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000889"", ""10.3390/su10020116"", ""10.3390/su10124394"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2009)23:1(3)"", ""10.1108/09574090610663400"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2007.08.005"", ""10.1109/MPRV.2006.2"", ""10.1080/17452007.2017.1384714"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2017-0049""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.3233/JID-220008,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,Designing next-generation cyber-physical systems: Why is it an issue?,"Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are seen as one of the tangible results of the convergence of advanced information technology, nanotechnology, biotechnology, cognitive science, and social science in addition to conventional systems science, engineering, and technologies. Designing next-generation cyber-physical systems (NG-CPSs) is a challenging matter for abundant reasons. It is not possible to consider all reasons and to address their interplays simultaneously in one paper. Therefore, this position paper elaborates only on a selected number of topical issues and influential factors. The author claims that the shift of the paradigm of CPSs and the uncertainty related to the paradigmatic systems features of NG-CPSs are among the primary reasons. Since the future of CPSs will be influenced strongly by their intellectualization, adaptation/evolution, and automation, these aspects are also addressed. It is argued that interaction and cooperation with NG-CPSs should be seen from a multi-dimensional perspective and that socialization of NG-CPSs needs more attention in research. The need for aggregation, management, and exploitation of the growing amount of synthetic systems knowledge produced by smart CPSs is seen by the author as an important emerging concern.","[{""name"": ""Imre Horváth"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sustainable Design Engineering, Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1007/978-1-4899-0718-9_23"", ""10.1016/j.future.2015.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.cirpj.2018.06.002"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953499"", ""10.1016/j.intcom.2010.07.003"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0870-9_63"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0034075"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103179"", ""10.1016/S0921-8890(02)00373-1"", ""10.1016/j.jii.2020.100192"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02161-9_3"", ""10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0307"", ""10.1109/TNSE.2018.2830307"", ""10.1002/sys.10054"", ""10.1007/s10339-006-0154-7"", ""10.1002/sys.21509"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-0718-9_17"", ""10.1142/S2424862217500129"", ""10.1007/3-540-45997-9_7"", ""10.1016/j.compchemeng.2015.04.011"", ""10.1109/MIE.2017.2648857"", ""10.1023/A:1013734730842"", ""10.1016/j.future.2019.06.031"", ""10.1007/s12599-019-00595-2"", ""10.29173/irie137"", ""10.24846/v26i3y201708"", ""10.1016/j.infsof.2008.01.006"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44857-1_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-25141-7_4"", ""10.1016/S0921-8890(02)00372-X"", ""10.1016/j.cirp.2019.04.024"", ""10.1080/09537320500357319"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2007.08.009"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2018.10.051"", ""10.1109/MCS.2008.931718"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02704-8"", ""10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60418-0"", ""10.3389/frobt.2017.00060"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.267"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-89897-9_11"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-6338-1_5"", ""10.1007/BF01414441"", ""10.1109/3516.491406"", ""10.1016/j.cirpj.2020.02.002"", ""10.1109/21.391285"", ""10.1109/TII.2012.2183878"", ""10.1109/MC.2003.1160055"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-47590-5_3"", ""10.1109/MC.2018.2876181"", ""10.1093/hcr/31.4.538"", ""10.1007/s10845-019-01512-w"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2498288"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-60910-8_1"", ""10.1109/MC.2004.48"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-23778-7_18"", ""10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.05.013"", ""10.1109/MC.2017.4451221"", ""10.1109/TSE.2012.53"", ""10.1016/j.rcim.2018.10.003"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2010.2050377"", ""10.1080/09544828.2016.1141183"", ""10.5937/fmet1904663P"", ""10.1049/ip-cta:20045250"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2019.09.016"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2020.103224"", ""10.1109/C-M.1975.218952"", ""10.1080/00207543.2018.1533261"", ""10.1145/1516533.1516538"", ""10.1145/508448.508472"", ""10.1145/3328730"", ""10.1016/j.cirp.2019.04.024"", ""10.1007/BFb0045689"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-7336-7"", ""10.1145/1366283.1366309"", ""10.1016/j.eng.2019.01.014"", ""10.1109/TSMC.2018.2814539"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2019.04.257"", ""10.3390/designs2040040"", ""10.3390/s21030745"", ""10.1631/FITEE.2000279"", ""10.1080/03081070802601509"", ""10.3233/JIFS-179108"", ""10.3837/tiis.2011.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.jmsy.2016.05.002"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00262-6_11"", ""10.3233/JID-210010"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-67731-2_4"", ""10.1109/MC.2009.81"", ""10.1109/TSG.2014.2387381"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2884906"", ""10.1080/01691864.2017.1394912"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2016.2519381"", ""10.3390/s19051033"", ""10.3390/s17112580"", ""10.1016/j.artint.2010.09.009""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0207,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Complexities in mega rail transportation projects ""Sydney metro"" and ""Melbourne metro rail"" insight","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to initially evaluate the most current and important complications of sustainable mega rail transportation projects. This purpose is assisted by thoroughly reviewing the foremost uncertainties and challenging issues of STI. Once these factors are established, they will be the base of STI indicators. Finally, to consolidate such alignment, the Sydney Metro and Melbourne Metro are then compared and analyzed. The analysis would then create a platform to measure sustainability and relevant complexities in mega rail transportation projects. Design/methodology/approach To further consolidate such hypothesis, this research investigated two mega rail transportation projects in Australia. Both Sydney Metro and Melbourne Metro Rail were selected as the basis of case study, as both possess similar sustainability aspects. Findings As an outcome this research found that, complexities in both of these projects were based on future challenges and opportunities including imperfect equalization or not balancing all the four sustainability indicators; and where and how to emphasize the overlapping of these four indicators. In summary, these findings can assist the relevant planners, to better prepare and manage mega railway infrastructure and their operations. Originality/value While the sustainability for transportation infrastructure has been covered extensively by other authors, this paper strengthens the four specific and separate STI indicators – especially for mega rail infrastructure. Although, there are some crossover areas within these indicators, however, this research separately validates each as an independent entity. Commonly, there are three dimensions within the sustainability domain – environmental, economical and social. Nevertheless, for this research, a fourth dimension engineering which includes all the technical focus, has been separately developed. This is particularly important to effectively deal with all the complexities, particularly for mega projects, such as rail transportation infrastructure. Accordingly, separating the engineering dimension would thus reshape the triple bottom line factors to include a separate technical focus. To further evaluate this separation of the four specific areas, two mega Australian rail transportation projects are then reviewed as experiments.","[{""name"": ""Koorosh Gharehbaghi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerry McManus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Neville Hurst"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kathryn Robson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matt Myers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.cities.2019.01.031"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2016.09.009"", ""10.1080/03081060500322599"", ""10.1016/j.jrtpm.2016.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.051"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2018-0117"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2018-0223"", ""10.1007/s40864-016-0036-y"", ""10.1080/03081060008717650"", ""10.1016/j.jrtpm.2015.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2017.04.010"", ""10.1016/j.cstp.2014.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.jrtpm.2015.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.jrtpm.2015.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.jrtpm.2014.10.002"", ""10.1177/0739456X15595866"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.030""]","['Engineering', 'Energy', 'Social Sciences']","['Nuclear Energy and Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7415), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7281)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0194,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A framework to activate the health and safety regulations in the Egyptian construction industry,"Purpose The construction industry is considered one of the most dangerous industries especially in developing countries such as Egypt. Although safety in Egypt is regulated by mainly four pivotal legislations, namely, Law No. 12 (2003) and Ministerial Decrees No. 211, 126 and 134, construction accident records in Egypt are high. Accordingly, this paper aims to develop a framework to activate the health and safety regulations in the Egyptian construction industry. Design/methodology/approach To achieve this aim, a research methodology consisting of a literature review and a survey questionnaire was developed to accomplish three objectives. First, a literature review was used to identify the causes of site accidents and strategies adopted in different countries to improve and enforce safety, safety roles of stakeholders. Second, a survey questionnaire was conducted with a representative sample of large- and medium-sized construction firms in Egypt to examine their perception of the causes of site accidents. Finally, a framework was developed to activate the health and safety regulations in the Egyptian construction industry. Findings The research identified 16 causes of construction site accidents. These causes were classified into three categories based on the party responsible for the occurrence of site accidents, namely, workers, organization management and government. Results of data analysis showed that “lack of housekeeping” and “lack of governmental inspection for safety” were ranked the highest causes of site accidents in the Egyptian construction industry, whereas “inefficiency of old safety equipment or no safety equipment at all” and “reluctance to input resources for safety” were ranked the least causes. Originality/value This research provides valuable information about the nature of the construction industry with a particular focus on site accidents, causes and impacts of construction site accidents. The study highlighted the safety roles of the Egyptian Governmental bodies in Egypt to improve and enforce safety. The research tackled a topic that received scant attention in construction literature especially in the Egypt context. The framework presented in this paper represents a synthesis that is important and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred in the Egyptian construction industry.","[{""name"": ""Mostafa Adel Elsebaei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Omar Elnawawy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayman Ahmed Ezzat Othman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Badawy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2000)126:1(52)"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.06.006."", ""10.1080/01446190801918722"", ""10.1080/1028660031000081536"", ""10.1080/10803548.2016.1245507"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2011.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2010.07.001"", ""10.1108/14714170410815114"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2010.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2011.04.015"", ""10.1080/15623599.2008.10773110"", ""10.12691/ajcea-3-5-5"", ""10.3763/aedm.2008.S807"", ""10.1061/40475(278)71"", ""10.1051/matecconf/20164704004"", ""10.1016/j.ergon.2018.01.007"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479"", ""10.1093/infdis/jiu095"", ""10.1080/17457300.2011.648676"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2004.12.002"", ""10.1061/(asce)0733-9364(2008)134:6(451)."", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0680(2002)7:2(81)."", ""10.1061/(asce)0733-9364(2006)132:2(164)"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2011.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.envpol.2016.06.04"", ""10.1080/10803548.2017.1366129"", ""10.9790/1684-11516672"", ""10.1155/2015/590810"", ""10.1016/S0001-4575(98)00033-5"", ""10.1080/01446190802459916"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.11.002"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-06-2012-0036"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2008.02.019"", ""10.21859/cej-03097"", ""10.1155/2017/8496258"", ""10.1080/17452007.2012.683242"", ""10.1108/09699980310466523"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)00042-8"", ""10.1080/01446199300000004"", ""10.1177/0049124112452527"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2003.09.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2002)128:3(203)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000107"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0001067"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2015.02.006"", ""10.1080/10807030902761312"", ""10.1108/17260530910974952"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0001098"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.07.016"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2013.07.016""]","['Health Professions', 'Decision Sciences']","['Medical Laboratory Technology', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7464), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7279)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)]]"

The trustworthiness and sustainability of these systems will be vital for our society. However, engineering modern computing systems is complex as they have to: i) operate in uncertain and continuously changing environments, ii) deal with huge amounts of data, and iii) require seamless interaction with human operators. To that end, we argue that both systems and the way we engineer them must become smarter. With smarter we mean that systems and engineering processes adapt and evolve themselves through a perpetual process that continuously improves their capabilities and utility to deal with the uncertainties and amounts of data they face. We highlight key engineering areas: cyber-physical systems, self-adaptation, data-driven technologies, and visual analytics, and outline key challenges in each of them. From this, we propose a research agenda for the years to come.","[{""name"": ""Danny Weyns"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"", ""Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Faculty of Technology, Linnaeus University, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Jesper Andersson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Faculty of Technology, Linnaeus University, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Mauro Caporuscio"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Faculty of Technology, Linnaeus University, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Francesco Flammini"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Faculty of Technology, Linnaeus University, Sweden"", ""School of Innovation, Design and Engineering, Division of Product Realisation, Mälardalen University, Eskilstuna, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Andreas Kerren"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Faculty of Technology, Linnaeus University, Sweden"", ""Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Welf Löwe"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Media Technology, Faculty of Technology, Linnaeus University, Sweden"", ""Softwerk AB, Sweden""]}]",[],['Computer Science'],['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2023-0315,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,The role of psychological contract in enhancing safety climate and safety behavior in the construction industry,"Purpose This study aims to explore the “psychological contract of safety” (PCS), a key factor in the safety climate (SC), which relies on the behavioral safety actions of workers at construction sites. While numerous factors have been identified in various sectors across different countries, there is a consensus among researchers that there is a dearth of common assessment factors specifically for the Indian construction industry (ICI). Therefore, this study undertakes a systematic review of existing literature to identify the factors that determine PCS in construction and to ascertain the relative importance index (RII) of these variables and their interrelationships using structural equation modelling (SEM). Design/methodology/approach A structured survey was conducted among 420 professionals in the ICI to collect data. This data was then analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods to derive results. Findings The findings of the study indicate that PCS factors have a significant impact on the construction industry (CI). The inferential analysis ranks “Safety System” as the top factor with the highest RII value. The chi-square results highlight two key SC factors that enhance and regulate an organization’s safety performance. The SEM results reveal that SC factors contribute to the improvement of PCS and influence worker safety behavior. Originality/value The outcomes of this study will be beneficial for stakeholders aiming to improve safety at construction sites and enhance safety performance by fulfilling the mutual safety obligations of employers and employees and by improving safety norms, procedures and policy-making.

10.1111/jade.12317,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,The Shock of the New,"AbstractSince 2017 I have examined the impact of shifting professional practices demonstrated by students of an Artist Teacher MA programme at an English university. Students repeatedly discuss the transformative nature of the course, and through an impact case study I have interrogated the conditions which enable profound changes to occur. Emerging findings indicate that pedagogies of uncertainty enacted within an inclusive community foster students' experiences of visibility, being heard and valued professionally. This resulting pedagogic context encourages students to take risks in a safe environment and supports them to build sustainable practices applicable to educational and artistic communities alike. In this article I argue that pedagogic conditions which enable these ways of being are just as crucial now, as we live through an extraordinary global crisis. I engaged in an autoethnographic analysis of how findings from the artist teacher impact case study can inform my current working conditions during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Through reflexive journaling and art practice I documented my experiences of transferring face‐to‐face content to remote learning platforms. In the process I consider what can be learnt from established artist teacher practices, communities and the values that underpin them whilst I support an online teaching and learning community. Crucially I am concerned with how the opportunities and challenges afforded through remote learning shape my professional practices, and the extent to which pedagogies of uncertainty evident in the artist teacher impact case study are borne out through remote working.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Payne"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17508487.2013.740678"", ""10.4135/9781452230627.n3"", ""10.1080/0031910410001693218"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01636.x"", ""10.1163/9789460911477"", ""10.1080/02619768.2011.565324"", ""10.1111/jade.12212"", ""10.1111/jade.12142"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2009.01604.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226147864.001.0001""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Education', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This shift in pedagogy and practice fundamentally challenged a number of disciplines and disciplinary norms, none more so than studio‐based art and design institutions. As a result, academic staff and those in professional service roles were required to rapidly engage with digital technologies with which they were unfamiliar, adjusting their pedagogic approach and innovating within the online environment. This article presents a small‐scale study investigating the impact of this rapid change on a small specialist studio‐based higher education institution which prioritises physical making and in person teaching within its educational provision. The study focused on how the shift influenced the perceptions and practices of teaching and professional support staff in their use of learning technologies and what newly adopted approaches to technology enhanced art and design education may likely continue post COVID 19.","[{""name"": ""Mark Charters"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Correy Murphy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1080/14606925.2019.1594953"", ""10.5204/jld.v6i3.155"", ""10.1111/jade.12079"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-55700-3_12"", ""10.30935/cedtech/6114"", ""10.1177/1474022220906393"", ""10.1093/intqhc/mzg031"", ""10.1080/17439884.2013.770404"", ""10.1177/1745499918761706"", ""10.1111/jade.12331"", ""10.1080/14702029.2014.941569"", ""10.1177/1468794116679873"", ""10.4324/9781315415130"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2011.01689.x"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.226"", ""10.3402/rlt.v24.30231"", ""10.1007/s42438-020-00155-y"", ""10.4324/9780429053405-6"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2009.01602.x"", ""10.1162/0011526054622015"", ""10.21125/iceri.2020.0274"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1605501""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0458,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Success criteria-based impacts of risk factors on education building projects in southwestern Nigeria,"Purpose Despite the huge capital outlay in tertiary education building projects (TEBP), these projects undoubtedly failed in meeting the set objectives of cost, time and quality, among others. Therefore, rather than the impacts of risks on the overall project performance, which is common in the construction management literature, the purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of risk factors on the criteria for measuring the success of public TEBP. Design/methodology/approach The paper adopted a quantitative research method where the data collection was via a questionnaire survey. The researcher administered 452 questionnaires to the client representatives, consultants and contractors involved in building projects across five public tertiary education institutions in Ondo State, Nigeria. Of 452 questionnaires, 279 were retrieved and suitable for the analysis, translating to a 61.73% response rate. The reliability analysis of the research instrument showed 0.965 and 0.807, via Cronbach’s alpha test, indicating high reliability of the instrument used for data collection. Findings The study found different risk factors affecting the criteria for measuring the success of TEBP. For instance, the environmental risk factor significantly impacted completion to cost, while financial and political risk factors significantly impacted completion to time. In addition, while environmental, legal and management risks significantly impacted end-user satisfaction, safety performance was significantly impacted by logistic, legal, design, construction, political and management risks. Besides, the logistic, legal, design, construction, financial, political and management risk factors impacted profit. However, despite profit being one of the criteria for measuring the success of building projects, it recorded the highest risk impacts amounting to 41% variance. Research limitations/implications The findings are limited to the public tertiary education building projects procured via competitive tendering; therefore, the results might differ when considering other procurement methods. Practical implications The practical implication is that rather than focusing on all risk factors, the project stakeholders could give adequate attention to the significant risk factors impacting each of the parameters for measuring the success of education building projects. Originality/value The study revealed specific risk factors impacting the criteria for measuring the success of TEBP, which extend beyond the use of the overall project performance approach.","[{""name"": ""Olufisayo Adewumi Adedokun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Temitope Egbelakin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deborah Oluwafunke Adedokun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Johnson Adafin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5130/AJCEB.v%25vi%25i.4979"", ""10.1108/jedt-03-2019-0056"", ""10.1108/jedt-08-2019-0214"", ""10.1108/14725961311301484"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-01-2021-0002"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1797986"", ""10.6106/jcepm.2012.2.4.025"", ""10.1108/ecam-08-2018-0351"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.09.009"", ""10.5772/51460"", ""10.1108/ecam-05-2020-0299"", ""10.1108/ecam-01-2013-0001"", ""10.1108/13664380780001092"", ""10.1108/jedt-09-2014-0060"", ""10.1108/ecam-02-2017-0042"", ""10.1080/15623599.2010.10773137"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2018.10.018"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.03.050"", ""10.1108/13664380810898104"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.710"", ""10.1108/jedt-01-2020-0027"", ""10.3390/su11041215"", ""10.1080/01446193.2010.540019"", ""10.1061/(Asce)Co.1943-7862.0000293"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001299"", ""10.15680/IJIRSET.2016.0502005"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/357/1/012030"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.06.017"", ""10.4324/9781315241999"", ""10.18820/24150487/as23i2.1"", ""10.5923/j.ijcem.20130205.02"", ""10.7492/ijaec.2013.010"", ""10.1108/jedt-10-2019-0255"", ""10.4314/gjer.v13i2.2"", ""10.1108/jfm-01-2015-0001"", ""10.12691/ajcea-2-2-4"", ""10.1007/978-4-431-54804-1_16"", ""10.5923/c.jce.201401.07"", ""10.6007/IJARBSS/v8-i9/4680"", ""10.1108/jfmpc-04-2013-0009"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.04.004"", ""10.22452/jscp.vol3no1.2"", ""10.18045/zbefri.2018.1.335"", ""10.1108/ecam-11-2017-0250"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.11.036"", ""10.5539/ass.v4n7p74"", ""10.1007/s11135-017-0469-8"", ""10.1186/s41239-018-0094-1"", ""10.1016/j.proenv.2011.09.431""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Design/methodology/approach A modified TEP model is formulated with inclusions of linearized approximation of power losses for a large-scale power system with renewable energy sources. The multi-objectives function determines the effect of transmission line losses on the optimal power generation dispatch in the power system with and without inclusion of renewable energy sources with emphasis on minimizing the investment and operation costs, emission and the power losses. Findings This study investigates the impact of renewable energy sources on system operating characteristics such as transmission power losses and voltage profile. Sensitivity analysis of the performance for the developed deterministic quadratic programming models was analyzed based on optimal generated power and losses on the system. Research limitations/implications In the future, a comparison of the alternating current OPF and direct current (DC) OPF models based on the proposed mathematical formulations can be carried out to determine the efficiency and reduction of computation process of the two models. Practical implications This paper proposed an accurate way of computing transmission losses in DC OPF for a TEP context with a view of achieving a minimal computation time.

10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0223,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Investigating conflicts of expert contractors using the last planner system in building information modeling process,"PurposeThis paper aims to increase the integrity of the planning process with the executive process by simulating the Last Planner System (LPS) technique using building information modeling.Design/methodology/approachA five-dimensional model was prepared, and after specifying the number of physical conflicts on the plans, all the scenarios of the starting points in the expert contractors’ plans were analyzed. Accordingly, the best scenario was determined by LPS technique. To assess the performance of the study, it was implemented on several tasks of a construction project.FindingsThe results of this research indicate that if this method is used in the planning process, the time conflicts between the expert contractors who are in the critical path are reduced, and the total delay of the scheduled time reaches zero. In addition, the conflicts between contractors whose suspension will cause no incentive and increase the daily cost overruns will reduce to the lowest point.Originality/valueBy simulating LPS in the planning process, time-physical conflicts are considered at the lowest point. Using this approach, conflicts are detected before the execution process, resulting in a significant reduction in the delays and cost overruns in construction projects.","[{""name"": ""Adib Amany"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katayoon Taghizade"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Esmatullah Noorzai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000285"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2013.04.008"", ""10.1080/09585192.2015.1111251"", ""10.3846/13923730.2015.1068846"", ""10.1007/978-981-287-014-8"", ""10.1061/9780784480502.069"", ""10.1080/09537280802059023"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000243"", ""10.1080/09613210500285106"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2006.04.001"", ""10.1061/9780784479827.173"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:5(371)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000528"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0227"", ""10.18178/ijscer.5.1.74-79"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2012-0032"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000289"", ""10.1080/09537287.2017.1412522"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000926""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

In this context, teaching through online studios has become a necessity. This study aimed to identify students’ practical experiences in fully online interior design studios and determine whether these experiences differ according to students’ educational levels to help improve and ensure the quality of online design education. The participants were 69 female interior design students. A questionnaire was applied using five axes, namely virtual learning environment, curriculum and illustration tools, students’ experiences, interaction with the teacher, and overall satisfaction and hopes. The results showed that the newer students had a positive experience with the online design studio, while there were statistically significant differences between the answers of students at different levels. It was noticeable that the students’ experience on all axes was different, and the level of satisfaction among the new students in Studio 2 was higher than among the students nearing graduation in Studio 6.

10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0566,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Early supplier involvement framework for reducing construction waste during the design process,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework to facilitate early supplier involvement (ESI) as an approach for reducing construction waste (CW) generated during the design process. Design/methodology/approach A research methodology consists of literature review, case studies and survey questionnaire was designed to achieve the abovementioned aim. First, the literature review was used to investigate CW, CW generated during the design process, the design process and ESI. Second, two construction projects were analysed to investigate the role of ESI towards reducing CW generated during the design waste. Third, a survey questionnaire was carried out with a representative sample of architectural design firms (ADFs) in Egypt to examine their perception and application of ESI towards reducing CW generated during the design process. Based on the results of the above, the research developed a framework to facilitate ESI during the design process to reduce CW. Findings Through literature review, the research highlighted the causes of CW generated during the design process and identified the benefits and challenges that encounter ESI in ADFs. Results of data analysis showed that “last-minute changes due to client requirements” was ranked the highest challenges of ESI in ADFs in Egypt followed by “lack of design experience”. Moreover, “providing technical information about materials and equipment and their capabilities” was ranked by respondents as the highest contributions of suppliers during the design process which leads to waste reduction followed by “better estimation of materials and costs”. Finally, respondents stated that “resistance of ADFs to include suppliers in the design phase” was ranked the highest challenge of ESI in the design process followed by “no clear guidelines or policies that organise ESI”. Research limitations/implications Because of the conceptual nature of the proposed framework, it has to be tested and validated to ensure its capability to overcome the challenges of ESI as an approach for reducing CW generated during the design process. Practical implications This research presents a practical solution to the problem of CW generated during the design process through ESI. Originality/value The research discussed the causes of CW originated from the design process and the benefits and challenges of ESI in ADFs. It investigated the perception and application of ESI in ADFs in Egypt. The proposed framework which was designed to facilitate the integration of suppliers in the early stages of the project life cycle represents a synthesis that is novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred.","[{""name"": ""Ayman Ahmed Ezzat Othman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yomna Abdelghany El-Saeidy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4314/ejesm.v6i6.5S"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.084"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1996)122:1(55)"", ""10.9790/1684-0333751"", ""10.1080/17452007.2020.1802218"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2021.02.039"", ""10.1108/eb021073"", ""10.3828/twpr.10.1.63h4v2427v96132q"", ""10.1016/J.PURSUP.2009.03.008"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2008.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.03.050"", ""10.3390/su11133638"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2003.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.03.158"", ""10.1680/warm.2006.159.2.65"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2007.05.011"", ""10.2478/otmcj-2021-0008"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2020-0047"", ""10.1108/09699980410547603"", ""10.1108/09699980310466578"", ""10.1080/014461999371475""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/jade.12445,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Developing Empathy Through Design Thinking in Elementary Art Education,"AbstractPast research has suggested incorporating design thinking in upper elementary art education helps students develop what are known as the Four Cs: collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking. As an instructional strategy, design thinking focuses on empathy first and provides a structure for students to work through real‐world, complex problems in small groups. This exploratory qualitative case study examined the effects of teaching empathy through design thinking in upper elementary art education. Eight teachers participated, representing public, private, charter, and independent school settings. Data included student observations, interviews, and journal reflections. An analysis of findings resulted in three conclusions: (a) design thinking can foster the development of empathy in preadolescents, (b) art education curricula at the upper elementary level can include design thinking, and (c) design thinking is a valid strategy for teaching empathy. Including empathy within art education promotes a classroom culture that is respectful and understanding of others, with students becoming advocates of justice, equity, and inclusion. As society continues to struggle with bullying, physical violence, and social unrest, teaching empathy has the potential to change how students relate to each other in the classroom, and, ultimately, in the world at large.","[{""name"": ""Jane Montero"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.18546/IJDEGL.07.1.05"", ""10.1080/14733285.2019.1642447"", ""10.1080/00043125.2016.1224844"", ""10.1177/1609406917707899"", ""10.1111/jade.12111"", ""10.1080/00043125.2019.1559604"", ""10.18546/IJDEGL.11.2.03"", ""10.26209/ijea21n21"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352932"", ""10.1080/00043125.2020.1717820"", ""10.1080/00094056.2018.1492861"", ""10.1016/j.ijcci.2017.10.002"", ""10.1080/00043125.2016.1224869"", ""10.1515/dcse-2017-0014"", ""10.24191/ajue.v15i3.7817"", ""10.1080/00043125.2016.1106852"", ""10.1080/03057240.2016.1239573"", ""10.1073/pnas.1808678115"", ""10.1007/s10798-014-9279-7"", ""10.1080/00043125.2016.1176492"", ""10.1111/bjop.12236"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2018.02.004"", ""10.1515/edu-2019-0021"", ""10.1080/02188791.2015.1005049"", ""10.1177/2374373517699267"", ""10.1177/1076217518768361"", ""10.1002/jee.20112"", ""10.1080/00043125.2019.1534442"", ""10.2505/4/ss17_040_08_6"", ""10.1007/s10746-015-9363-3"", ""10.1007/s11245-019-09641-w"", ""10.1002/ab.21675"", ""10.1007/s10566-015-9343-9"", ""10.1080/14703297.2015.1108214"", ""10.1007/s12144‐018‐9885‐8""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Speech and Hearing']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)]]"
10.1111/joid.12213,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Design Meets Neuroscience: A Preliminary Review of Design Research Using Neuroscience Tools,"The past decade has witnessed a burgeoning interest in the intersection of neuroscience and design. Recent advancements in tools for measuring brain activity enable design researchers to investigate how brain function supports mental processes, complementing self–report and behavioral measures in exploring design cognition. With the aim of providing a preliminary understanding of how design researchers have approached neuroscience to date, we examined (1) previously explored neural research topics, (2) available tools and their contributions and limitations, and (3) the challenges of conducting design research using neuroscience tools. We start with a brief overview of major neuroscience tools measuring brain activation including electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), near–infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and positron emission tomography (PET). We then present a review of design research specifically on neural processes involved in design thinking and creativity. Consistencies of brain activity across studies are identified.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2020-0055,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Compressed earth block reinforced with coconut fibers and stabilized with aloe vera and lime,"Purpose In recent years, the use of earth as a material applied to construction has been adapted as an attractive alternative to modern concepts. The earth construction technique takes advantage of regional natural resources, among which are earth bricks. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of the addition of coconut fibers and aloe vera on the mechanical properties of compressed earth blocks (CEB). Design/methodology/approach CEBs were manufactured from silty and clay soil (Altamira, Tamaulipas, Mexico) with biodegradable stabilizers of aloe vera and short coconut mesocarp fibers, which were compared with the conventional mixture with lime as stabilizer. The samples were subjected to compression tests (Mexican Standard NMX-C-404-ONNCC3-205), flexion (NMX-C083-ONNCCE.), abrasion (NTC-5324 3.4.3), water absorption (NMX-C-37-ONNCE-205), surface morphology and thermal properties (ASTM D5334-14). Findings It was found that the addition of coconut fibers has a 12% difference in flexural strength. The addition of 0.5% of coconut fibers decreases swelling by 2% with water and reduces the thermal conductivity of the material by 12%. Likewise, this mixture increases the abrasion resistance of CEB by 30%. When there is a pressure greater than 1,700 psi in the CEB, the addition of coconut fibers does increase the compressive strength of the material, showing a 34% improvement over the CEB without adding coconut fibers. Originality/value The authors show a new sustainable CEB production with aloe vera and coconut fiber that is possible for self-production with better mechanical properties than others, commonly produced in Mexico.","[{""name"": ""Alan Adiel Velasco-Aquino"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jose Adan Espuna-Mujica"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Josue Francisco Perez-Sanchez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carlos Zuñiga-Leal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Arturo Palacio-Perez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Edgardo Jonathan Suarez-Dominguez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.17268/sciendo.2018.011"", ""10.1016/j.fbp.2016.11.006"", ""10.1093/ijlct/ctz045"", ""10.2174/1874836801711010433"", ""10.1177/0021998317693293"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-3631-1_30"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.06.053"", ""10.1007/s12205-017-1968-9"", ""10.35940/ijeat.A1455.109119"", ""10.3390/jfb8010006"", ""10.3989/ic.2002.v53.i478.627"", ""10.1038/nmeth.2089"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.112"", ""10.1016/j.surfin.2019.100407"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.077"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.007"", ""10.1080/15440478.2019.1652220"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.12.092""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-11-2019-0299,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Complexity drivers in engineering design Toward a decision support system based on an organizational perspective,"PurposeIn the era of industry 4.0, managing the design is a challenging mission. Within a dynamic environment, several disciplines have adopted the complex adaptive system (CAS) perspective. Therefore, this paper aims to explore how we may deepen our understanding of the design process as a CAS. In this respect, the key complexity drivers of the design process are discussed and an organizational decomposition for the simulation of the design process as CAS is conducted.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed methodology comprises three steps. First, the complexity drivers of the design process are presented and are matched with those of CAS. Second, an analysis of over 111 selected papers is presented to choose the appropriate model for the design process from the CAS theory. Third, the paper provides methodological guidelines to develop an organizational decision support system that supports the complexity of the design process.FindingsAn analysis of the key drivers of design process complexity shows the need to adopt the CAS theory. In addition to that, a comparative analysis between all the organizational methodologies developed in the literature leads the authors to conclude that agent-oriented Software Process for engineering complex System is the appropriate methodology for simulating the design process. In this respect, a system requirements phase of the decision support system is conducted.Originality/valueThe originality of this paper lies in the fact of analysing the complexity of the design process as a CAS. In doing so, all the richness of the CAS theory can be used to meet the challenges of those already existing in the theory of the design.","[{""name"": ""Abla Chaouni Benabdellah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Asmaa Benghabrit"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Imane Bouhaddou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-1-4612-1694-0_15"", ""10.1126/science.177.4047.393"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2007.11.004"", ""10.1109/TEM.2009.2036838"", ""10.1002/cplx.20156"", ""10.2307/1981182"", ""10.1016/j.cad.2012.08.006"", ""10.1016/S0272-6963(00)00068-1"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(90)90040-I"", ""10.1007/s10458-009-9099-4"", ""10.1137/S0036144504446436"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(01)00009-6"", ""10.1016/S0039-6109(05)70488-6"", ""10.1007/978-1-84628-061-0_1"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2012.07.110"", ""10.1016/j.cirp.2012.05.001"", ""10.1007/BF01020332"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0670-132"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2012.06.102"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2003.10.010"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2016.02.002"", ""10.1126/science.1150195"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2008.01.001"", ""10.1017/S0890060418000161"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2010.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.06.043"", ""10.1119/1.2049286"", ""10.1119/1.2060715"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.03.008"", ""10.1287/orsc.8.5.528"", ""10.1287/mnsc.43.4.437"", ""10.1080/17452759.2016.1139377"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(99)00025-4"", ""10.1504/JDR.2007.014880"", ""10.1007/s100219900037"", ""10.1016/S1097-2765(00)00136-2"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5885.2006.00215.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.47.1.133.10663"", ""10.1108/09600031111138844"", ""10.1002/smj.573"", ""10.1109/MCOM.2005.1470824"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2012.12.008"", ""10.1001/archpsyc.55.3.235"", ""10.2307/2333389"", ""10.1017/S0890060413000061"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-68402-9_13"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-07-2015-0441"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2006.11.001"", ""10.1007/s12159-016-0152-9"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2007.11.005"", ""10.1023/A:1014054010001"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.07.021"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(90)90040-I"", ""10.1108/00251741211266688"", ""10.1108/01443579510083640"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2003.10.010"", ""10.1038/nphys2162"", ""10.4018/978-1-59140-581-8.ch009"", ""10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Engineering']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Strategy and Management', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

This paper aims to establish causes–effects relationship of claims in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach This is correlation study type of study that attempts to establish causes–effects relationship of claims in construction projects. Significant causes and effects of construction claims were determined using one-sample t-test. To establish the relationship, the significant causes and effects of construction claims were correlated using bivariate correlation analysis. Findings Among the significant causes, variations, change of scope of the project and delay in completion of works have high level of significant positive relationship with five to six other causes and positive relationship with multiple effects ranging from five to six. Besides, among significant effects, delay in completion and delivering of construction projects, poor contractual relationship among parties and extension of time have significant positive relationship with multiple causes. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study are limited to causes-causes relationship and causes–effects relationship of claims in construction projects. This means effects–effects relationship was not covered that could be an important area to investigate as some of causes and effects are at times termed interchangeably. Practical implications With reference to previous studies which have focused on determining the causes and effects of construction claims, the findings of the current study have specific contribution on claims management as it divulges the causes of constructions claims that have multiplier effects to the project as a result of their linkage. Originality/value The paper unveils causes of claims with multiplier effects to construction projects for project participants to devise strategies to minimize and consequently eliminate them.","[{""name"": ""Geraldine John Kikwasi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-60450-3_"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-09-2018-0113"", ""10.1108/CI-02-2019-0020"", ""10.1108/09699980910927895"", ""10.1108/13664380780001093"", ""10.1108/09699980810867406"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:1(94)"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.05.002"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1230959"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-05-2013-0014"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-11-2016-0052"", ""10.1108/MRR-02-2013-0027"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2015-0145""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

The Challenges for Successful Implementation of Icons for Data Protection,"Design is a key player in the future of data privacy and data protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) established by the European Union aims to rebalance the information asymmetry between the organizations that process personal data and the individuals to which that data refers. Machine-readable, standardized icons that present a “meaningful overview of the intended processing” are suggested by the law as a tool to enhance the transparency of information addressed to data subjects. However, no specific guidelines have been provided, and studies on privacy iconography are very few. This article describes research conducted on the creation and evaluation of icons representing data protection concepts. First, we introduce the methodology used to design the Data Protection Icon Set (DaPIS): participatory design methods combined with legal ontologies and machine-readable representations. Second, we discuss some of the challenges that have been faced in the development and evaluation of DaPIS and similar icon sets. Third, we provide some tentative responses and indicate a way forward for evaluation of the effectiveness of privacy icons and their widespread adoption.","[{""name"": ""Arianna Rossi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Monica Palmirani"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Social Sciences']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Design/methodology/approach A quantitative survey was carried out using a questionnaire to gather relevant data in the study area. This paper was conducted on 363 registered construction professionals in the Nigerian construction industry. The collected data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Kruskal–Wallis H test analysis. Findings This paper indicated that the majority of Nigerian construction professionals are aware of SBCs. Furthermore, the Kruskal–Wallis H test shows no significant difference between the awareness level of the various construction professionals. This paper further revealed energy management systems, IT network connectivity, safety and security management systems and building automation systems as the most significant parameters in which SBCs can be measured. Practical implications This paper identified significant parameters influencing SBCs awareness in the Nigerian construction industry. These parameters can be integrated into the building during the design stage and can be incorporated into the policymaking process of construction firms to promote the awareness of SBCs and encourage practices related to construction sustainability. Originality/value This paper provides empirical evidence on the awareness of SBCs among construction professionals and significant parameters influencing awareness in the Nigerian construction industry.","[{""name"": ""Cyril Chinonso Ejidike"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Modupe Cecilia Mewomo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iruka Chijindu Anugwo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.dib.2018.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.foar.2020.03.007"", ""10.3390/en13092190"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.07.061"", ""10.1108/SASBE-01-2014-0003"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2018-0204"", ""10.1007/s10708-019-10009-1"", ""10.1109/CloudTech49835.2020.9365920"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0465"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.02.009"", ""10.7763/IJCTE.2017.V9.1176"", ""10.31295/pm.v1n1.42"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0479"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.01.023"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.058"", ""10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00599"", ""10.3390/recycling4010013"", ""10.1108/JPMD-08-2015-0029"", ""10.36263/nijest.2019.01.0098"", ""10.3763/inbi.2009.0032"", ""10.1037/a0028085""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0056,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,An evaluation of risk factors impacting project budget performance in New Zealand,"Purpose There has been a lack of research, particularly within the New Zealand (NZ) context, focusing on the identification and assessment of risk factors for construction projects, leading to a wide variation between design-phase elemental cost plans (ECPs) and the outturn tender sums (OTS). Still to be investigated is how risks interact to produce such variability. This study aims to determine the risk-influencing factors, identified through risk measurement, during design development. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted literature review and online questionnaire survey. The literature review was used to identify the factors affecting project budgetary performance, which was used to design the questionnaire survey culminating in data analysis. The questionnaire was administered to 64 practising project managers (PMs) in NZ. Their responses were analysed using descriptive statistics, mean ranking analysis, degree-of-risk measure and correlational analysis, to find the top-five risk factors impacting the variability observed, through ranking the mean and degree of risk values that produce such variability. Findings Significant risk factors were identified from the questionnaire survey analysis, such as changes in project owner/stakeholder requirements, experience of project team, site condition information, competency of consultants and information flow and quality. These provided some insights in explaining the variability between the design-phase ECPs and OTS based on risk impacts from PMs’ viewpoints. Research limitations/implications Findings revealed a drift of 23.86% in budgeted costs (inflated risks), which seems significant. Prioritising top risk factors may provide handy information for researchers on the variables that could be relied upon for the development of a forecasting model for application in NZ. Practical implications The study findings have implications for PMs seeking to provide information on mitigation strategies by using risk management approach, considering the influence of development risks on building project delivery and, consequently the project owner’s financial position. To guard against wide variation between design-phase ECPs and OTS, the main contribution of this study is to raise consultants’ awareness of the important risk factors for their planning at the outset, thus assisting PMs in pro-actively managing their clients' budgets. Originality/value This study creates value by synthesising literature on construction project budgeting and highlighting areas for further research. By giving adequate attention to key risks associated with budget overruns in commercial projects, variability between ECPs and OTS, a common phenomenon in NZ, can be controlled to achieve cost savings. Based on this, further study suggests the development of a model that could assist the stakeholders in NZ to more reliably predict OTS from the design-phase ECP and pro-actively avoid unfortunate budget/cost overruns, disputes and even project abandonment.","[{""name"": ""Johnson Adafin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James O.B.

10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0277,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A meta-analysis of factors affecting labour productivity of construction SMEs in developing countries,"Purpose The global construction industry is significant to economic development, whereas the sector, particularly its small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) have continued to suffer from low labour productivity for decades. This has given rise to the concern of relevant construction stakeholders on the need to address the challenges undermining labour productivity growth in construction. Hence, this study aims to conduct a meta-data analysis of factors that hamper productivity growth of construction SMEs in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of existing studies relative to factors affecting construction labour productivity (CLP) is presented. Thereafter, eight developing countries-based studies that are specific to SMEs were selected for meta-data analysis using relative importance index values from the studies. Findings The essential productivity influencing factors were identified and quantitative data of the selected studies were synthesised. The effect summaries derived from the meta-data analysis revealed that the most significant factors that negatively affect CLP amongst SMEs include: workers’ skills, inadequate training, rework, management style and incentive to labour. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to scientifically analysed secondary data relative to SME contractors in developing countries. Practical implications The findings of the study can be adopted by construction stakeholders to evolve productivity growth policies for construction SMEs in developing countries. Originality/value Synthesis of quantitative data of different studies has lent deeper insight into a more realistic and scientific precision of factors affecting labour productivity of construction SMEs.","[{""name"": ""Oluseyi Julius Adebowale"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Justus Ngala Agumba"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.35683/jcm20028.78"", ""10.3390/su11215975"", ""10.1007/s42107-019-00212-3"", ""10.1080/15623599.2017.1382091"", ""10.3846/13923730.2007.9636434"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.05.019"", ""10.17159/2309-8775/2016/v58n3a5"", ""10.1061/(ASCE) CO.1943-7862.0000928"", ""10.1108/00483480710752803"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000329"", ""10.1080/01446190701598681"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:3(217)"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2018.10.010"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v11i3.2120"", ""10.2753/EEE0012-8775480504"", ""10.3846/20294913.2012.661203"", ""10.1108/IJPPM-10-2013-0169"", ""10.1108/ECAM-02-2017-0035"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001006"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1142266"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.12.002"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000499"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1012143"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000501"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1094849"", ""10.1080/15623599.2012.10773192"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00019-1"", ""10.1080/00038628.2012.677587"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2013-0043"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.06.003"", ""10.1108/IJPPM-03-2015-0045"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.848995"", ""10.1186/1756-0500-5-52"", ""10.21315/jcdc2019.24.1.3"", ""10.1016/0360-1323(87)90024-2"", ""10.3846/tede.2019.10297"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000274"", ""10.3390/su12093710"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000375"", ""10.1080/23311975.2020.1863303"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000944"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000194"", ""10.1061/(ASCE) CO.1943-7862.0000800"", ""10.1504/IJPQM.2019.101927"", ""10.6106/JCEPM.2015.5.2.016"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0162"", ""10.15623/ijret.2016.0507065"", ""10.17687/JEB.0601.02"", ""10.1139/l94-066"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2020-0027"", ""10.1108/14714171111104655"", ""10.1080/01446193.2017.1294257"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.11.003"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v16i1.4600"", ""10.1080/15623599.2013.10773205"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.10.026"", ""10.3846/13923730.2017.1374301"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.162"", ""10.1007/s40999-018-0282-3"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000662"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1997)123:4(399)"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2016-0127"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.03.175"", ""10.1080/15623599.2013.10878231""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Design/methodology/approach This study uses the integrated model of user satisfaction and technology acceptance to evaluate users’ behavioral intention to use VAs on smartphones. The model represents a causal chain from the key characteristics of SQ and IQ to beliefs and attitudes that ultimately affect use. An online survey was conducted with 75 university students, and the data was analyzed using multivariate analysis: Simple linear regression analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings While SQ and IQ of VAs had stronger effects on perceived ease of use (PEU), information satisfaction and PEU showed significant influences on perceived usefulness (PU). The results supported the influence of PEU, PU, and attitude on BI to use but with lesser effect than what PU and attitude together had on BI. Research limitations/implications The sample was drawn from a population of students at a single and small university. Although this study received 160 responses, only 75 were appropriate for analysis. Originality/value There is no research, which adopts technology acceptance and user satisfaction approaches to VAs. To measure the causal effects, this study determined system and information characteristics that could explain SQ and IQ of the current VAs on smartphones.

10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0233,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,The impact of building morphology factors on the cost and aesthetical appearance of urban detached residential buildings in Sri Lanka,"Purpose The morphology of a building describes its outline and influences its architectural aesthetics and the cost directly. However, the literature on the impact of morphology on the aesthetics and cost of urban detached residential buildings is scarce. Thus, this study is significant because its aim was to identify the critical building morphology factors and the relationship that each of them maintains with the cost and aesthetics of urban detached residential buildings. Design/methodology/approach The multi-method qualitative approach was used to collect the required empirical data through interviews and case studies and to identify the effect of the morphology factors on the aesthetics and construction cost of urban residences in Sri Lanka, respectively. The collected data were analyzed using manual content analysis and descriptive statistics. Findings The study findings revealed that the morphology factors such as the roof and circulation spaces, open spaces and voids have a high impact on both the building cost and aesthetics. These findings will assist building designers in making effective design decisions on building costs and aesthetics so that a successful design outcome satisfying both the clients and design team could be obtained. Originality/value Although morphology has an impact on the cost and aesthetic of buildings, literature on the subject is scarce. Thus, this study is significant in that it aimed at identifying the significant building morphology factors in urban detached residential buildings and identifying their relationship with the cost and aesthetic of those buildings.","[{""name"": ""G.K.T.

Subsequently, an iterative embodiment design approach has been followed to identify the size of the components for the preferred concept, by using acknowledged mechanical design procedures and finite element analysis tools.FindingsAn innovative cycloidal gearbox has been developed, by merging the kinematics underpinning the classical cycloidal drives and the Wolfrom planetary gearbox. The resulting concept provides high reduction rates with a very high overload capacity.Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of the studies is the absence of in-depth evaluations usually performed in the detail design phase. However, this limitation is a direct consequence of the company specifications, which only asked to find a preferred concept and to perform preliminary evaluations. Accordingly, the subsequent design optimization are intended to be performed by the company’s staff.Originality/valueThe present paper shows an original design approach, opportunely tailored to the design of innovative gearboxes. It can be conveniently adapted and reused by designers involved in similar tasks. Moreover, the designed cycloidal gearbox paves the way for important innovations in the field of concrete mixers, allowing to design more robust and compact devices.","[{""name"": ""Lorenzo Fiorineschi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susanna Papini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luca Pugi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Rindi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Federico Rotini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compind.2010.10.007"", ""10.1007/BF03325762"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2014.06.146"", ""10.1017/dsj.2017.10"", ""10.1108/RPJ-02-2017-0021"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2012.12.001"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(01)00008-4"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2012.03.026"", ""10.1617/s11527-012-9864-8"", ""10.6028/jres.106.016"", ""10.1109/41.184827"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2018-0017"", ""10.1080/09544828.2016.1160275"", ""10.1080/09544828.2018.1473558"", ""10.1115/1.2978342"", ""10.1016/0142-694X(91)90003-F"", ""10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2271111"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511612923"", ""10.1016/0094-114X(83)90066-6"", ""10.1108/IJSI-11-2013-0043"", ""10.1007/978-1-84628-319-2"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(96)00023-3"", ""10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2005.08.001"", ""10.1007/s001639870001"", ""10.1016/j.cirp.2009.09.003"", ""10.1016/B978-0-7506-8985-4.00002-4"", ""10.1109/TIA.2013.2284302"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2015.11.001"", ""10.1109/70.105382"", ""10.1115/1.4000832""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

However, most traditional risk analysis techniques are based on theories that deal with each risk factor as an independent, which does not take into consideration the causal relationships between risk factors. Design/methodology/approach This study aspires to identify the overall risk of the administrative construction projects in Egypt and to recognize the most influencing risk factors through the project life cycle by using Bayesian belief networks (BBN). Through a review of the literature, 27 risk factors were identified and categorized as the most common risk factors in the construction industry. A structured questionnaire was performed to estimate the probability and severity of these risks. Through site visits and interviews with experts in the construction field, 200 valid questionnaires were collected. A risk analysis model was developed using BBNs, then the applicability of this model was verified using a case study in Egypt. Findings However, the outcome showed that critical risks that manipulate administrative construction projects in Egypt were corruption and bribery, contractor financial difficulties, force majeure, damage to the structure and defective material installation. Practical implications The proposed study presents the possibilities available to the project parties to obtain a better forecast of the project objectives, including the project duration, total project cost and the target quality by examining the causal relationships between project risks and project objectives.

However, the basis of every prequalification model primarily relates to the measurement and judgement of prospective contractors based on a set of decision criteria. This paper aims to address the gap by reviewing academic papers on contractor prequalification criteria. Design/methodology/approach A desktop search was conducted under the “T/A/K (title/abstract/keyword)” field of the Scopus search engine. A total of 49 papers were initially identified; however, only peer reviewed journals were selected for the study; therefore, a sample of 36 was subsequently used. Further filtering was done in which 26 papers were found valid for further analysis as it was realized that, not all the identified papers presented empirical arguments about the issue of contractor pre-qualification criteria. The selected 26 papers were subjected to content analysis to identify the key contractor pre-qualification criteria. Findings A total of 41 criteria were identified which were subsequently classified into six main categories, namely, technical considerations, management considerations, financial considerations, reputation considerations, general experience considerations and health, safety and environmental considerations. There was an indication that, the involvement of health, safety and environmental considerations in contractor prequalification proceedings is limited. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this research was the limited number of papers selected for further analysis based on the Scopus search engine. The identified criteria serve as a basis for further empirical studies on contractor prequalification criteria. Practical implications The outcome of this study broadens the understanding of practitioners and researchers on the various criteria for contractor prequalification. Originality/value By critically reviewing available literature on contractor prequalification, the study sets the tone for further empirical studies on contractor prequalification.","[{""name"": ""Victor Karikari Acheamfour"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ernest Kissi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Theophilus Adjei-Kumi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Adinyira"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.10.003"", ""10.1108/09699981211206098"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.825045"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2011.05.017"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2001)127:2(93)"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.12.007"", ""10.1080/01446190903394541"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.11.011"", ""10.1096/fj.07-9492LSF"", ""10.1504/IJPM.2016.079980"", ""10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090930"", ""10.3141/2151-06"", ""10.1080/014461997373088"", ""10.1016/0360-1323(95)00008-T"", ""10.1108/JFM-04-2013-0022"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000030"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:10(1076)"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2016-0013"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.019"", ""10.1080/01446190500041263"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2014.04.001"", ""10.1080/12460125.2015.1081048"", ""10.1016/S0360-1323(98)00050-X"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.02.008"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2011-0088"", ""10.3846/jcem.2010.05"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2011.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2015.02.043"", ""10.1146/annurev.pu.16.050195.001121"", ""10.3923/jas.2004.354.363"", ""10.1016/j.mla.2011.05.006"", ""10.1080/0950069042000243727"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.04.003"", ""10.1109/ICIEEM.2011.6035091"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.05.004"", ""10.1080/0144619042000287714""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Psychology', 'Health Professions']","['Social Psychology', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-11-2019-0308,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Research on dynamic data monitoring of steel structure building information using BIM,"Purpose This study aims to analyze the dynamic monitoring of deformation damage of steel structure buildings in long-term use. Although the steel structure building has the advantage of high structural strength, it will be deformed after being affected by factors such as corrosion and impact during long-term use, and which will affect building safety, especially the public building facilities. The dynamic monitoring of its security is an indispensable means. Design/methodology/approach This paper briefly introduced the principle of building information modeling (BIM)-based steel structure building information monitoring and the dynamic information monitoring system based on this principle. Then the monitoring system was used to analyze an operational steel structure suspension bridge in Xinxiang City, Henan Province, China, and compared it with the monitoring system based on back propagation (BP) neural network. Findings The results showed that the fitting degree of the dynamic deformation displacement data processed by BIM-based monitoring system was higher than that processed by BP-based monitoring system. Based on the comprehensive comparison of the dynamic data of all monitoring points, the BIM-based monitoring system had higher accuracy of deformation displacement monitoring and reliability of structural safety evaluation. Originality/value In summary, the BIM-based steel structure building monitoring system can effectively monitor the dynamic information of steel structure information.","[{""name"": ""Ying Xia"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.08.027"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.028"", ""10.1186/s40327-015-0029-z"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.02.007"", ""10.1007/s13349-014-0091-6"", ""10.1186/s40327-014-0015-x"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2016.04.001"", ""10.1007/s13319-018-0209-4""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geology', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2020-0278,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Prevention through design: conceptual models for the assessment of a principal designer's skills, knowledge and experience","PurposeThe prevention through design (PtD) initiative places a duty on designers to originate designs that are inherently safe for construction, maintenance, occupation and demolition. In the UK, legislation has been introduced creating a new statutory role called the principal designer (PD) to ensure that PtD occurs during the design process. To realize this objective, PDs under the regulations must have appropriate skills, knowledge and experience (SKE) of occupational safety and health risks as they relate to construction products. However, there is a paucity of knowledge, in the extant literature and in practice, regarding what specifically constitutes PDs’ SKE of PtD and how to measure the same.Design/methodology/approachThe study undertook a systematic review of meanings of SKE and carried out content analyses to provide robust conceptualizations of the constructs SKE. This underpinned the development of nomological networks to operationalize the constructs SKE in respect of PDs’ ability to ensure PtD.FindingsPDs’ SKE of PtD are presented as multidimensional constructs that can be operationalized at different levels of specificity in three theoretical models.Practical implicationsThe models indicated in this study can assist project clients to clarify the PtD SKE of prospective PDs in the procurement process. Correspondingly, PDs can look to these frameworks to identify their SKE gaps and take steps to address them.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the PtD literature by providing theoretical frameworks to clarify the PtD SKE of PDs. The study provides a basis for future research to empirically test the attributes of these as they relate to PDs’ competence to ensure PtD.","[{""name"": ""Ebenezer Adaku"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nii A.

The article reflects on issues of power and representation during design research in The Gambia by adapting reflexivity and positionality which are key concepts established in development studies. Reflections are based on research carried out in The Gambia since 2010 which is comprised of phases of immersion, mapping and co‐design. They provide in‐depth insights currently lacking in design literature that demonstrate the value of reflexivity and positionality to iterate roles and methods in community‐based design. Whilst not suggesting particular teaching methods, the article proposes the integration of these concepts into existing structures to better prepare students for increasingly common futures in the workplace. Broader themes that emerge and can be adapted to different design contexts include building trust, entanglement in power dynamics between different actors, personal vulnerability, as well as the need to challenge problems as starting points for design interventions.","[{""name"": ""Anne Schiffer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/0267257X.2017.1284433"", ""10.1080/02508281.2005.11081469"", ""10.1016/j.tmaid.2013.09.003"", ""10.1177/1468794112468475"", ""10.3362/9781780447247"", ""10.4135/9780857020048"", ""10.1111/j.0033-0124.1994.00080.x"", ""10.1111/1559-8918.2017.01153"", ""10.1080/0267257X.2013.798677"", ""10.1007/s11213-018-9449-8"", ""10.4324/9781315576633-10"", ""10.1145/3319376"", ""10.1080/09540253.2019.1583319"", ""10.1080/02255189.2005.9669031"", ""10.1080/02601370120490"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4762.2008.00815.x"", ""10.1080/13691050500245687"", ""10.1080/00330124.2015.1059401"", ""10.1145/2940299.2940302"", ""10.1108/EDI-07-2013-0056"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2016.04.011"", ""10.1080/07370008.2016.1169817"", ""10.1111/tsq.12004""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Business and International Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Inspired by this trend, the aim of this project is to increase awareness of traditional Chinese cultural aesthetics in modern product development as well as to highlight the role of cultural sensitivity in the product design process. This study focuses on industrial cultural products and examines the meanings and values of cultural products. Through the examination of the user experience of current cultural products with questionnaires and interviews with product designers, a design toolkit for Chinese cultural products was developed and applied in design practice. Design majors from various cultural backgrounds were recruited to participate in workshops to evaluate the usability of the toolkit and to validate whether the toolkit helped in their design processes. The findings of the research revealed that users’ experiences, particularly users’ emotional engagement with the products, could be enriched when the design toolkit was applied in the design process. This design toolkit is designed for use by international designers in the initial stage of the design process when idea generation, brainstorming and sketching occur. The toolkit could be applied not only in product design but also in visual communication design, interior design and digital content design.","[{""name"": ""Yu‐Han Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marco Ajovalasit"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4018/978-1-4666-5007-7.ch001"", ""10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.300"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00040"", ""10.1080/09654313.2011.618689"", ""10.1016/S2212-5671(12)00334-6"", ""10.2307/258594"", ""10.1086/208906"", ""10.1201/9780203302279.ch2"", ""10.1504/JDR.2012.051171"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73287-7_20"", ""10.1080/02699930802204677"", ""10.1108/09556220610668509"", ""10.1177/1476127012452824"", ""10.1016/B978-008045089-6.50016-2"", ""10.1177/0539018405058216"", ""10.1177/1078087403261256"", ""10.1080/09548960802361951"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511674501""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0436,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Integrated safety, health and environmental management in the construction industry: key organisational capability attributes","Purpose For construction organisations to be effective at implementing an integrated safety, health and environmental (SHE) management system, they require the right level of organisational capability. This capability includes the policies, systems and resources of the organisation. However, within the academic literature, it is unclear which organisational attributes of construction companies are important for implementing integrated SHE management. This study aims to explore the organisational attributes that determine integrated SHE management capability and their relative priorities. Design/methodology/approach The study used a literature review supported by expert verification and a subsequent three-round expert Delphi technique accompanied by applying the voting analytical hierarchy process. Findings The study identified 20 attributes grouped under five main thematic categories. These are strategy (the organisation’s vision and top management commitment); process (the organisation’s procedures and processes for SHE management); people (organisation’s human resources, their competence, roles, responsibilities and involvement in SHE management); resources (organisation’s physical and financial resources for SHE management) and information (SHE related documents, data, records and their communication across an organisation). While these thematic categories and the attributes within carry different weights of importance, the strategy-related attributes are the most important, followed by the people-related attributes. Originality/value The results of this study should enable construction companies and key industry stakeholders to understand construction companies’ capability to successfully implement an integrated SHE management system.

However, the use of BIM in project cost management is still limited. This study aims to review the current trends in the application of BIM in project cost management. Design/methodology/approach This study systematically reviews the literature on the application of BIM in project cost management. A total of 46 related articles were identified and analyzed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method. Findings Eighteen approaches to applying BIM in project cost management were identified. The approaches can be grouped into cost control and cost estimation. Also, BIM can be applied independently or integrated with other techniques. The integrated approaches for cost control include integration with genetic algorithms, Monte Carlo simulation, lean construction, integrated project delivery, neural network and value engineering. On the contrary, integrated approaches for cost estimation include integration with cost-plus pricing, discrepancy analysis, construction progress curves, estimation standards, algorithms, declarative mappings, life cycle sustainability assessment, ontology, Web-based frameworks and structured query language. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to systematically review prior literature on the application of BIM in project cost management. As a result, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the art and fills the literature gap. Researchers and industry professionals can use the study findings to increase the benefits of implementing BIM in construction projects.","[{""name"": ""Abdelrahman M.

Este planteamiento de “invertir” con respecto a la clase tradicional ha sido aplicado a las prácticas de laboratorio de la asignatura de Expresión Gráfica en el Grado en Ingeniería en Tecnologías Industriales en el curso 2018-19 de la Universitat Politècnica de València. La clase inversa se organizó en sesiones semanales con visionado de videos antes y después de clase y resolución de ejercicios durante y después de clase, detallando el procedimiento seguido en cada sesión presencial. Todo ello gestionado desde la aplicación Lessons.La metodología flipped-classroom nos ha permitido aumentar la motivación de los alumnos, dilucidar y contrastar la percepción de los alumnos en relación al método de aprendizaje tradicional, favorecer el autoprendizaje y el aprendizaje colaborativo en el aula entre alumnos, así como mejorar la comunicación entre alumno y profesor. Por lo que respecta a la evaluación se aprecia una mejora en las calificaciones, así como una valoración positiva a la implementación de la clase inversa.AbstractThe Flipped Classroom teaching method is presented as an active method in which the normal procedure is inverted. The students watch video sessions or polyformats in line with the concepts taught in the normal class. This inverted approach with respect to the traditional class was applied to lab practice sessions in the subject of Graphic Expression as part of the Industrial Technologies Engineering Degree course at the Universitat Politècnica de València in the year 2018-19. The flipped classroom took place in weekly sessions with video sessions before and after, while problems were set to be solved during and after the class. The procedure was followed up later in in-class sessions. Everything was controlled by the Lessons app.This method was seen to increase students’ motivation and clarify their perceptions to a greater degree than the traditional teaching method, while encouraging self-learning and collaborative learning among the class members and improving student-lecturer communications. Evaluation grades were found to increase, and the Flipped Classroom technique was given the general approval of both students and lecturers.","[{""name"": ""Sofia Escudero Fernández"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2021-0738,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Factors supporting the implementation of buildability assessment as a tool for buildability improvement,"Purpose Improving buildability of building designs with the aid of buildability assessment is essential because of the effect of designs on construction. Despite the plethora of research into buildability reported over the years, a review of the literature shown a dearth of research into the factors supporting the implementation of buildability assessment. Because buildability assessment has been confirmed to be highly beneficial to construction business, this study aims to investigate the factors supporting the implementation of buildability assessment as a tool for buildability improvement using Nigeria as a representative case. Design/methodology/approach Survey research method was adopted for the study. Questionnaires were administered to a purposively selected group of architects, engineers, builders and quantity surveyors involved in construction project delivery within client, consulting and contracting organisations in Nigeria. A total of 368 questionnaires were distributed among the sampled participants, out of which, a total of 219 representing 60% were sufficiently filled and returned. Data collected were analysed using inferential and descriptive statistics. Findings The results revealed owner’s commitment, clients’ awareness of the benefits of conducting buildability assessment on building design, unity amongst different professionals in the construction industry, designers consider buildability important, adequate coordination amongst different design disciplines, adequate channel for co-ordination and communication between designers and constructors at the design stage and adequate support from the government as the top most seven factors supporting buildability assessment implementation in construction sector of Nigeria. Secondly, the results from the research revealed that there is no statistically significant difference in factors supporting buildability assessment implementation in construction between clients and consulting and contracting construction organisations in Nigeria. Originality/value The findings provide in-depth insight of the factors supporting the implementation of buildability assessment in construction that can help principal stakeholders in construction to facilitate development of strategies required in supporting the adoption and implementation of buildability assessment tool for buildability improvement.","[{""name"": ""Innocent Chigozie Osuizugbo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kevin Chuks Okolie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olalekan Shamsideen Oshodi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.aej.2016.06.010"", ""10.3992/jgb.7.3.49"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000771"", ""10.1080/01430750.1987.9675529"", ""10.1108/eb021002"", ""10.1108/17260531011086162"", ""10.5130/ajceb.v10i1-2.1583"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000404"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000043"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000425"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001062"", ""10.25103/jestr.031.24"", ""10.1037/h0070692"", ""10.1108/17260530710833185"", ""10.3763/asre.2008.5121"", ""10.1108/14714171211215958"", ""10.1080/01446190802570498"", ""10.1108/14714171111149025"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2005.10.003"", ""10.1080/1023697X.2008.10668104"", ""10.1186/s40069-018-0269-0"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2011-0035"", ""10.1108/EUM0000000005627"", ""10.1016/S0360-1323(00)00004-4"", ""10.1080/00038628.2000.9696888"", ""10.1108/02632770810840327"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2004.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.06.674"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.446-449.3879"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2016-0028"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2012-0012"", ""10.2478/jeppm-2020-0007"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0338"", ""10.2478/emj-2020-0011"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v21i1.7359"", ""10.1002/tal.1570"", ""10.3390/buildings5020521"", ""10.1139/L06-022"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2015.12.002"", ""10.13140/RG.2.1.1758.2806"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.002""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Collaborative Futures is a live project premised on a futures‐focused design brief written with an external partner. In previous iterations of the project, partners have included Hitachi and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Each year this project brings together a team of students in their final year on the Masters European Design programme to collaborate with a group of early career design graduates. Between 2019 and 2020, the Collaborative Futures project worked with Glasgow City Council’s Centre for Civic Innovation to explore and prototype citizen‐centred scenarios surrounding data experiences set in the context of Glasgow 2030. Throughout the project the student‐graduate team engaged in multidisciplinary collaboration within and beyond the boundaries of the higher education studio context, working with civic, academic and design professionals, public and third sector organisations, and members of the public. The authors reflect on the design process; theoretically unpack the cross‐cultural, studio‐based collaboration that took place; and discuss the complex challenges that emerged and the meditating role design artefacts played. The insights presented in the article have value for design educators seeking new approaches to designing and delivering studio‐based design learning that fosters creative, multidisciplinary communities of practice and collaborative capacity‐building for design students in a professional setting.","[{""name"": ""Marianne McAra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kirsty Ross"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352827"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8262.001.0001"", ""10.1145/1900441.1900448"", ""10.2307/1511637"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2013.01734.x"", ""10.3384/svid.2000-964X.13248"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2014.09.004"", ""10.1108/SASBE-10-2017-0051"", ""10.4324/9781315526379-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37254-5_4"", ""10.1080/17547075.2015.1051829"", ""10.1017/dsi.2019.168"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1111/jade.12204"", ""10.1386/vi.2.2.127_1"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9873.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352704"", ""10.1007/BF01405730"", ""10.1386/adch_00013_1"", ""10.1145/1900441.1900476"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803932"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-37254-5_11""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2020-0274,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Ethical misconducts within the invitation to tender and tender evaluation and award stages of construction contracts in Ghana,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the views of construction practitioners on the prevalence of ethical misconduct within the invitation to tender and tender evaluation and award stages of construction contracts in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach Following a critical comparative review of literature resulting in the identification of 18 potential misconducts within the invitation to tender and 11 potential misconducts within the tender evaluation and award stages of construction contracts, a questionnaire survey was conducted among 65 construction professionals. Data obtained from the survey were analysed using both descriptive (i.e. frequencies, mean scores and standard deviations) and inferential statistics (paired t-test), followed by gap analysis. Findings The findings revealed that corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices, client divulging more information to the preferred bidder and inflating tender prices by tenderers in return for kickbacks are key unethical practices prevalent at the invitation to tender stage. Following these key unethical practices, the findings further suggested through gap analysis that submission of bids on non-working days and inadequate time for preparation and submission of tenders were the top two unethical practices that needed serious interventions at this stage. At the tender evaluation and award stage, the findings revealed that interference by influential people in political positions, fake tendering and bid shopping are prevalent. Again, from the gap analysis, interference by influential people in political positions and poor definition of selection criteria were identified to be the two key unethical practices that need urgent intervention at this stage of construction contracts. Practical implications This study holds a significant practical implication in the sense that key unethical practices at the invitation to tender and tender evaluation and award stages of construction contracts have been identified, and this provides a suitable basis for stakeholders that spearhead such activities to offer suitable interventions to control such practices. Originality/value This study contributes to the body of knowledge as it uncovers ethical misconducts within two important phases of construction contracts in a developing country setting. As there is a continuous effort by the international community towards finding lasting solutions to such misconducts, the findings from this study can be used as a starting point for appropriate policies to be put in place in Ghana to control such misconducts.","[{""name"": ""Kofi Agyekum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Adinyira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Judith Amudjie"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.18820/24150487/as25i2.2"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2019-0028"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2002)18:2(52)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2007)133:2(84)"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v15i3.4619"", ""10.4236/jbcpr.2018.64019"", ""10.1080/01446190701225707"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2015-0034"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1532-6748(2009)9:3(105)"", ""10.1080/15623599.2013.10878229"", ""10.1080/01446193.2016.1170865"", ""10.1080/01441640802075760"", ""10.1108/17561450911001252"", ""10.1080/01446190801965368"", ""10.1080/15623599.2013.10773211"", ""10.1080/01446190601114134"", ""10.1108/13664380680001078"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000488"", ""10.1080/014461999371646"", ""10.1108/MRR-02-2013-0027"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:9(729)"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.08.001"", ""10.1108/09699980310466596"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000479""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2020-0031,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Effect of wastes and admixtures on compressive strength of concrete,"Purpose This paper presents the effects of replacing fine aggregate (FA) with waste foundry sand (WFS) in natural aggregate and construction waste aggregate concrete specimens without and with superplasticizer (SP), silica fume (SF) and fiber (F) to solve the disposal problems of various wastes along with saving the environment. This study aims to investigate the effect of construction waste, WFS along with additives on the stress-strain behavior and development of compressive strength with age. Design/methodology/approach The various concrete specimen were prepared in mix proportion of 1: 2: 4 (cement (C): sand: coarse aggregate). The water-cement ratio of 0.5 (decreased by 10% for samples containing SP) to grading 1: 2: 4 under air-dry condition was adopted in the preparation of concrete specimens. The compressive strength of various concrete specimen were noticed for 3, 7 and 28 days by applying load through universal testing machine. Findings Upon adding construction and demolition waste aggregates, the compressive strength of concrete after 28 days was comparable to that of the control concrete specimen. An enhancement in the value of compressive strength is perceived when FA is replaced with WFS to the extent of 10%, 20% and 30%. If both construction and demolition waste aggregate and WFS replacing FA are used, the compressive strength increases. When FA is interchanged with WFS in natural aggregate or construction demolition waste aggregate concrete including usage of SF or F, the compressive strength improves significantly. Further, when construction and demolition waste aggregate and WFS replacing FA including SP are used, the compressive strength improves marginally compared to that of control specimen. The rate of strength development with age is observed to follow similar trend as in control concrete specimen. Therefore, construction and demolition waste and or WFS can be used effectively in concrete confirming an improvement in strength. Originality/value The utilization of these wastes in concrete will resolve the problem of their disposal and save the environment.","[{""name"": ""Rachit Sharma"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.12.051"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.11.003"", ""10.3844/ajassp.2017.1031.1038"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.03.215"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.11.054"", ""10.28991/cej-2019-03091307"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2004.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.06.037"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101361"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.05.084"", ""10.1016/j.acme.2019.08.004"", ""10.3390/ma9020098"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.02.031"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.09.137"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.054"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2018.10.044"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.02.034"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2006.12.004"", ""10.3844/ajessp.2007.135.142"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2011.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2007.01.008"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.04.005"", ""10.1016/S0958-9465(00)00031-7"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.07.034"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.06.017"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.04.017"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(97)00269-X"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.03.011"", ""10.2174/1876400201003010018"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(1994)6:2(254)"", ""10.1080/21650373.2016.1230900"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(01)00653-6"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.10.050"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.07.070"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.07.033"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(00)00476-2"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.058"", ""10.1016/0958-9465(92)90022-N"", ""10.1007/s42107-018-0095-3"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.03.011"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.11.065"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.04.117"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.064"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.08.087"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.06.041"", ""10.9790/1684-1406031822"", ""10.3311/PPci.8014"", ""10.1016/S0950-0618(99)00027-6"", ""10.1007/s12649-015-9385-0"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.09.020"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.11.032"", ""10.1016/0008-8846(90)90103-5"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.06.007""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Utilising the concept of technology affordances, we focus on the potential for domain‐specific learning experiences within design education. For the purpose of this project, we have articulated digital capabilities in design by adapting affordance categories in terms of three levels of complexity for scaffolded learning: functional, perceptual and adaptive. In order to further develop the relationship between technology affordances and design education, we analyse data from an industry roundtable in relation to our developed digital capability descriptor. The findings suggest that employers need designers with highly adaptive capabilities to work in increasingly complex interdisciplinary work environments. We also found that the role of designers has changed significantly in recent years that require higher educational institutions to involve industry when developing curricula.","[{""name"": ""Alexandra Crosby"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kane Pham"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J.

10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0049,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Demystifying cost misperception as a challenge to green building adoption in Nigeria,"Purpose The pertinent information about green buildings (GB) is laden with cost misperceptions (CM) that are paraded into adoption decisions without factual clarifications. The unsupported beliefs are fundamental to the disparaging low adoption of related technologies globally. The purpose of this paper is to explore the causes of CMs among construction stakeholders and why is it difficult to discredit this information? Design/methodology/approach The research adopted two-tier approaches involving a Delphi study and a questionnaire survey. Construction stakeholders and GB experts, totalling 415 were surveyed, while 12 professionals participated in the Delphi study. This study analysed data from 254 valid responses using Factor Analysis, Fussy Set Theory and Kruskal Wallis test to explain why CMs are prevalent. Findings The causes of CMs converge towards seven principal factors including low knowledge of GB practices, non-familiarity with performance metrics, inadequate evidence, poor-risk perceptions and reliance on the costs of exemplar projects. The results were explained using gaps in cost management, knowledge and sustainability accounting to show the critical improvements that can benefit GB adoption. Practical implications CMs are not abstract but develop from patterns that can be detected and understood within a specific context. Growing GB projects within a region would improve cost information, sustainability accounting, cost management and quality of evidence. GB cost information paraded into adoption decision processes are overestimated and overvalued beliefs of their financial implications. Tackling the important sources of CMs in the study is appropriate to improve rational decision-making aiding GB adoption. Originality/value This study untied causes of negative dispositions towards the cost of GB that distort stakeholders’ adoption decisions.","[{""name"": ""Samuel Ekung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isaac Odesola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alex Opoku"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119995"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94709-9_42"", ""10.1080/2093761X.2012.759887"", ""10.21315/jcdc2018.23.2.4"", ""10.1080/096132100418474"", ""10.1080/10835547.2012.12091834"", ""10.1287/orsc.2019.1285"", ""10.1016/j.jeem.2019.07.003"", ""10.1080/10835547.2009.12091785"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.03.060"", ""10.21276/ijirem.2016.3.6.12"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.11.021"", ""10.1108/13664381211211064"", ""10.1111/pops.12394"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.076"", ""10.1080/10835547.2010.12091800"", ""10.1080/09613218.2014.855873"", ""10.3390/su12083370"", ""10.1016/j.jet.2018.08.003"", ""10.1080/09613218.2011.561948"", ""10.1080/096132100418500"", ""10.1108/CI-06-2012-0035"", ""10.1108/sasbe-07-2016-0016"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-07-2012-0065"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v16i1.4651"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.210"", ""10.1007/s10433-013-0275-7"", ""10.1155/2015/570639"", ""10.1080/10835547.2011.12091824"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/640/1/012026"", ""10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.283"", ""10.1080/10286600802002973"", ""10.1007/s11146-013-9442-z"", ""10.1016/j.copsyc.2015.03.012"", ""10.1007/s11245-010-9084-1"", ""10.3969/j.issn.1002-6819.2010.09.001"", ""10.3992/jgb.1.1.46"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.11.016"", ""10.1080/15578771.2014.917132"", ""10.1257/aer.20141141"", ""10.3390/su11082195"", ""10.3992/1943-4618.14.1.53"", ""10.1155/2014/205310"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2016-0027"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2018.05.004"", ""10.1080/096132100418465"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2007)133:4(265)"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1135236"", ""10.1080/096132100418555"", ""10.1080/01446193.2015.1062903"", ""10.3992/1943-4618.14.1.31""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

It aims to identify the ways that pedagogical roles of the tutor and the student change due to the nature of their communication and the degree of their engagement in learning processes. The inquiry is based on the findings of a qualitative case study involving tutors, students and graduates from a bachelor of architecture degree programme. Data were gathered via focus group and in-depth interviews, studio observations and analysed through qualitative content analysis. The findings indicated that the pedagogic identity of a tutor could help scaffold the formation of a community of learners in the design studio. However, the lack of negotiation and trust between a tutor and students in the feedback processes weakens the students’ effective learning experiences.","[{""name"": ""Derya Yorgancıoğlu"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000403916022 Özyeğin University""]}, {""name"": ""Sevinç Tunalı"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121666619 Education Industry and Technology Institute (ESTEN)""]}]","[""10.1111/jade.12042"", ""10.1348/000709901158433"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2004.06.002"", ""10.1177/0001848191041003001"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.1976.tb02980.x"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2012.08.004"", ""10.18562/IJEE.2015.0009"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2014.09.001"", ""10.1111/j.1531-314X.2007.00092.x"", ""10.1386/adch_00011_1""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0057,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Artificial intelligence treating the problem of uncertainty in quantitative risk analysis (QRA),"Purpose Nowadays, artificial intelligence computational methods, such as knowledge-based systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic, have been increasingly applied to several industrial research studies, the purpose of this paper is to study the contribution of fuzzy and possibilistic techniques to quantitative risk analysis (QRA) in the presence of imperfect knowledge about the occurrence and consequences of accidental phenomena. Design/methodology/approach To solve the problem of uncertainties related to the elements of the accident scenario such as the frequency and severity of the consequences, the authors used fuzzy logic. Using this type of analysis, it is possible to visualize the contours of the dead or fuzzy injury by fireball thermal effect (first- and second-degree burn, death) and lesions caused by vapor cloud explosion overpressure (lung damage, eardrum rupture, head impact, whole-body displacement). The frequency and severity of fuzzy results are calculated by extended multiplication using the alpha-cuts method. Findings This research project aims to reflect the real situation in the in Amenas industrial area (SONATRACH company), specifically the liquefied petroleum gas storage tank On-Spec 05-V-411A, to deal with this type of risk. Using this analysis allows us to estimate the fuzzy individual risk using the approach of fuzzy logic to treating this uncertainty in the parameter information of accident scenarios. This index individuel risk (IR) was evaluated against the criterion of acceptability and then used for decision-making in the field of industrial risk analysis and evaluation. Originality/value The originality of the work is to identify the weak points of the classical QRA to solve the problem of the uncertainties related to the elements of the accident scenario such as the frequency and severity of the consequences to visualize the fuzzy risk contours. On the one hand and the development of software to calculate the probability of death by the overpressure effect and classify the most sensitive organs on the other hand. Given the importance of this study, it can be generalized for similar sites in the region.","[{""name"": ""Mohamed Seddik Hellas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rachid Chaib"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ion Verzea"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0304-3894(85)80022-4"", ""10.21236/AD0693105"", ""10.1111/j.1749-6632.1968.tb11972.x"", ""10.1016/j.jlp.2009.06.011"", ""10.1016/0950-4230(91)80012-J"", ""10.1016/0020-0255(75)90036-5""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0118,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Analyzing environmental sustainability enablers for an Indian steel manufacturing supply chain,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish the structural relationships between the environmental sustainability enablers (ESEs) for the steel supply chain in India and also to classify them on the basis of driving and dependence power with an objective of achieving enhanced environmental sustainability performance. Design/methodology/approach The ESEs were identified through extensive literature review and discussion held with experts from the Indian steel industry. The interpretative structural modeling (ISM) approach was applied to an Indian steel supply chain to arrange these 12 ESEs in different hierarchies of the structural framework on the basis of their driver dependence power and also diagraph was developed to classify them. Findings The water pollution control system, air pollution control system and soil pollution control system were found to be in the bottom hierarchy of the ISM framework and these enablers were also observed in the driving quadrant of the diagraph. These driving enablers should be given priority for its full-scale development, management and monitoring to sustain and enhance the environmental sustainability in the Indian steel supply chain, whereas top management commitment, environment compliance certification and government regulation and incentives are the antecedents for carrying out the sustainability program. Research limitations/implications The outcomes of the current study are limited to the Indian steel manufacturing company in specific but the results will not change significantly for the steel sectors in India. However, an empirical analysis can be used to explore and validate the structural framework for its acceptability. Practical implications The outcomes from the methodology provide the basis for an Indian steel manufacturing industry to develop the right strategy in their quest for environmental sustainability. Originality/value Although the study on ESEs of various industries was reported in the literature, the comprehensive study to identify the significant ESEs related to the Indian steel supply chain for environmental sustainability in specific have been hardly carried out.

10.1108/JEDT-06-2021-0341,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Adoption of online pharmacy applications during COVID-19 pandemic; empirical investigation in the Indian context from push-pull and mooring framework,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify antecedents of adoption and post-adoption switching of online pharmacy applications (OPA) in Indian society. A push-pull-mooring (PPM) model was formulated to evaluate the impact of various constructs upon “consumers’ switching intention” (CSI). Design/methodology/approach An online questionnaire was sent to 252 users of OPA in India. Hypotheses were generated to examine the push, pull and mooring effects of constructs developed. The relationships between dependent and independent variables were evaluated using structured equation modeling (SEM). Findings The study explicated the effect of PPM constructs on CSI in the context of OPA adoption. “Perceived usefulness,” “perceived ease of use” and “alternative attractiveness” had a significant “pull” effect on CSI. “Switching cost” had a “mooring” effect on CSI, whereas the degree of “customer involvement in decision-making” was found to have a “push” effect upon CSI. Research limitations/implications This study theoretically established that the constructs of “perceived usefulness,” “perceived ease of use” and “alternative attractiveness” had significant “pull” effect on “consumers’ switching intention.” The construct of “switching cost” had a “mooring” effect on CSI, whereas the degree of “customer involvement in decision-making” was found to have a “push” effect upon CSI. Practical implications The study provided valuable insights regarding consumer behavior regarding OPAs. These findings could be applied by managers in framing effective strategies to grow and retain the customer base of OPAs. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this was one of the first empirical investigative studies to assess precursors of adoption and post-adoption characteristics of consumer behavior through the PPM model, in the context of Indian OPAs.","[{""name"": ""Bishwajit Nayak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Som Sekhar Sekhar Bhattacharyya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Onkar Kulkarni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Syed Nawaz Mehdi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/h0076477"", ""10.1016/S2212-5671(14)00654-6"", ""10.1177/0047287512475217"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.3390/economies7010021"", ""10.1177/0092070304263332"", ""10.1177/0092070304267928"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.05.022"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2019.102324"", ""10.1016/j.elerap.2017.06.002"", ""10.1108/IJBM-04-2015-0062"", ""10.2307/249008"", ""10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8306.1983.tb01392.x"", ""10.1177/0047287513481274"", ""10.1108/02652329810228181"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.01.014"", ""10.1108/17506121011059740"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2010.11.006"", ""10.1108/JEIM-06-2019-0179"", ""10.1108/14684521111113614"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2011.04.013"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2012.05.010"", ""10.1108/IJBM-03-2018-0072"", ""10.2307/1912528"", ""10.4301/S1807-17752017000100002"", ""10.1007/s40299-021-00570-0"", ""10.1287/isre.2.3.173"", ""10.1177/030913259501900404"", ""10.1007/s40692-021-00193-w"", ""10.1108/JSIT-08-2018-0109"", ""10.13189/wjcat.2016.040101"", ""10.1504/IJBIS.2020.105870"", ""10.1108/NEJE-06-2019-0030"", ""10.1016/j.ijresmar.2009.08.001"", ""10.1108/K-09-2014-0184"", ""10.4301/S1807-17752017000200006"", ""10.1108/JSTPM-07-2020-0108"", ""10.17705/1CAIS.04214"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-64069-3_13"", ""10.1108/JEIM-08-2019-0227"", ""10.4018/IJTD.2015100104"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.2008.00192.x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926"", ""10.2307/41410412"", ""10.2307/30036540"", ""10.1016/j.im.2019.02.005"", ""10.1108/JEIM-09-2014-0088"", ""10.1177/0739456X17723971"", ""10.1086/208520""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

A growing body of literature advocates a more prominent role of nature in urban design and architecture, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining, enhancing, and restoring the beneficial experience of nature in the cities. Biophilia and nature-based solutions can improve the quality of built environment design and bring new opportunities to restore urban ecosystems and smart thinking for sustainable cities. The paper concludes that adopting biophilic principles in urban planning will lead to cities that can regenerate life and nurture end-users' health and well-being. Moreover, bring forward ways to transfer human nature ties' knowledge into restorative approaches to design the built environment.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Panagopoulos"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Algarve""]}, {""name"": ""Madalina Sbarcea"", ""affiliation"": [""Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urban Planning""]}, {""name"": ""Krzysztof Herman"", ""affiliation"": [""Warsaw University of Life Sciences""]}]","[""10.3390/ijerph7031036"", ""10.1021/es903183r"", ""10.1177/0094582x12468865"", ""10.5822/978-1-61091-621-9"", ""10.3390/su5083328"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2005.07.001"", ""10.3390/bs4040394"", ""10.1016/j.annepidem.2018.01.009"", ""10.1108/pm.2011.29.2.215.1"", ""10.3390/land7040141"", ""10.1177/1473095209104824"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2009.11.008"", ""10.3390/land7040147"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2016.09.002"", ""10.1080/09613218.2011.610608"", ""10.1289/ehp.118-a246"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.11.023"", ""10.1068/a35111"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.09.098"", ""10.3390/su12020640"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-06185-2_13"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.048"", ""10.3390/ijerph6092332"", ""10.1002/ad.2162"", ""10.1080/09654313.2016.1177492"", ""10.1016/j.actaastro.2020.07.001"", ""10.3390/su10061857"", ""10.2466/pr0.96.3c.1025-1028"", ""10.1006/jevp.2002.0235"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2011.12.004"", ""10.3197/096327111x12997574391724"", ""10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.100977"", ""10.1016/0272-4944(95)90001-2"", ""10.1093/pubmed/fdq068"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2008.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.207"", ""10.1177/0270467609349597"", ""10.1093/heapro/dai032"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-5828-9_303"", ""10.1080/09613218.2014.911565"", ""10.1002/ad.2151"", ""10.1017/s1466046609990494"", ""10.1177/1937586715578644"", ""10.1111/jiec.12987"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.109255"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.05.006"", ""10.3390/land8070112"", ""10.1016/j.envpol.2015.07.038"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.03.027"", ""10.1002/ad.2149"", ""10.1080/09613218.2012.619685"", ""10.1002/ad.2161"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2014.11.006"", ""10.1016/s0140-6736(96)07220-0"", ""10.26687/archnet-ijar.v8i2.436"", ""10.1098/rsta.2010.0350"", ""10.7721/chilyoutenvi.26.1.0111"", ""10.3390/su11010254"", ""10.1080/09613218.2012.629112"", ""10.1177/00139160121972864"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.01.010"", ""10.5751/es-04596-170205"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.02.001"", ""10.1126/science.6143402"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6229.2008.00213.x"", ""10.1177/0956797612464659"", ""10.4159/9780674045231"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.01.017"", ""10.22492/ijsee.3.1.05"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.10.001""]","['Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Speech and Hearing', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

By contextualizing different historical and contemporary humanitarian design examples in an analysis of current European border politics, the article questions the ways in which designing in the aftermath of the so-called “refugee crisis” has been mobilized without due consideration of what types of politics it produces and what types of politics it eventually ignores. It suggests that designers instead need to develop a more political understanding of the current border regime that produces and regulates refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented migrants worldwide and to think of practices that support the struggles of racialized people on the move in transgressing and questioning the borders.","[{""name"": ""Mahmoud Keshavarz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13562570801969457"", ""10.1080/14650045.2011.574653"", ""10.1177/0967010615606044"", ""10.1080/01436597.2016.1176856""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.1386/adch_00014_1,ART DESIGN & COMMUNICATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION,1305 Design,Using desirable difficulty concepts to enhance durable learning in design education,"Cognitive psychologists have identified that introducing manageable challenges into the learning environment, coined as ‘desirable difficulties’ by Robert Bjork, helps students retain knowledge more deeply over time. Handling small, workable obstacles in the learning process slows down the learner and can have positive effects on retention and application. The more effort learners must apply to retrieve knowledge for a concept or skill, the more this process of retrieval enriches learning. While there is established literature on desirable difficulty in the field of cognitive psychology, the theory has not been applied to design education. The characteristics of the signature pedagogy of design naturally contain many of the key markers of desirable difficulty that drive learning retention. This article summarizes the major scholarship around the concept of desirable difficulty and explores applications for the teaching and learning of design, specifically around the signature pedagogy elements of critique, the design process and project-based learning.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Rutherford"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121734730 Cleveland State University""]}]","[""10.1080/00140137808931764"", ""10.1007/BF00974070"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4561.003.0011"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1480.003.0023"", ""10.1386/adch.12.2.179_1"", ""10.1007/s10648-015-9311-9"", ""10.1080/03634520500213165"", ""10.1016/B978-012102570-0/50011-2"", ""10.1111/cdev.12955"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.1016/j.appdev.2008.06.003"", ""10.1177/003151257804600201"", ""10.1080/00222895.1984.10735321"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2012.01703.x"", ""10.1207/s1532690xci0402_2"", ""10.1177/1474022216652765"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.75.1.33"", ""10.1386/adch.2.3.143/0"", ""10.1007/BF01405730"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01693.x"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep2402_1"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3626-6_6"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00029.x"", ""10.1037/0278-7393.15.2.352"", ""10.1080/13562517.2011.590977"", ""10.1162/0011526054622015"", ""10.1386/adch.11.1.63_1"", ""10.3758/BF03197465"", ""10.1177/1745691615569000"", ""10.1007/s10798-013-9246-8"", ""10.1386/adch_00014_1""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Design/methodology/approach This study represents a new hybrid framework for turnaround project risk assessment. First, according to experts’ opinions, the project risks were identified using interviews and brainstorming. The most important risks selected by experts and a hybrid multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) method used to assess and prioritize them. The proposed MADM method uses fuzzy step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and fuzzy evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) methods based on trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Findings In this research, 28 usual risks of turnaround projects are identified and 10 risks are then selected as the most important ones. The findings show, that among the risks of upstream oil industry turnaround projects from the perspective of experts, the risk of timely financing by the employer, with an appraisal score of 0.83, has the highest rank among the risks and the risk of machine and equipment failure during operation, with an appraisal score of 0.04, has the lowest rank. Research limitations/implications The risk analysis based on inputs collected from the experts in the Iranian upstream oil industry, and so the generalization of the results is limited to the context of developing countries, especially oil producer ones. However, the proposed risk analysis methodology and key insights developed can be useful for researchers and practitioners in any other process industry everywhere. Originality/value A novel framework for risk assessment is introduced for turnaround projects in the oil industry using MADM methods. There is no literature on using MADM methods for turnaround project risk analysis in the oil and gas industries. Furthermore, this paper presents a hybrid fuzzy method based on SWARA and EDAS.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Reza Moniri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Akbar Alem Tabriz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ashkan Ayough"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mostafa Zandieh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-01-2018-0009"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.06.069"", ""10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e03097"", ""10.1109/ICITM.2018.8333985"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122008"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.06.006"", ""10.1504/IJPQM.2012.047196"", ""10.1109/ECBI.2009.14"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2005.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2019.103259"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2009.05.037"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.157"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2017.08.017"", ""10.1016/j.acme.2017.04.011"", ""10.15837/ijccc.2016.3.2557"", ""10.1016/j.fss.2004.02.015"", ""10.3846/jcem.2019.8280"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(95)00108-3"", ""10.5829/idosi.ije.2012.25.02b.04"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2017.06.001"", ""10.3846/16486897.2017.1281139"", ""10.3846/jbem.2010.12"", ""10.15388/Informatica.2015.57"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.10.017"", ""10.1007/s13369-018-3487-5"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.04.103"", ""10.1016/S0165-0114(98)00176-6"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2017.03.045"", ""10.1016/j.jlp.2011.03.004"", ""10.28991/cej-2019-03091330"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2017-0087"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118219"", ""10.1016/j.compchemeng.2017.04.017"", ""10.1057/palgrave.rm.8240227"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2019.01.012"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0215943"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000435"", ""10.3390/admsci8040080"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2017.12.014"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2019.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2019.101524"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001640"", ""10.1080/1331677X.2011.11517478"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.02.006""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

Urban megaprojects between global trends and local incentives,"AbstractThroughout its history, but also squeezed between the current challenges of globalisation and sovereignty, the Balkans has been confronted with a number of different political, economic, environmental, and cultural problems. Such a complex social framework inevitably implies spatial degradation, not only in terms of the urban forms as the final planning product, but also in terms of the nature of the planning process and urban governance. Notably, we assume that territorial capital in the Balkans is under serious threat due to the abuse of legal procedures, the neglect of the public interest and the politicisation of planning. To elucidate this, we focus on the megaprojects Belgrade Waterfront (Belgrade) and Hellinikon (Athens) as examples of urban development that require exceptional conditions such as special regulations, additional funding, long-term timeframes, and ad hoc actor networks. Against the conceptual background of multi-level governance and based on in-depth case studies, we examine the nature of vertical cooperation between authorities at different levels (from supranational to local), horizontal cooperation amongst different stakeholders, and the role of planning professionals who are seen as facilitators in this process. Finally, we point out to the most important conditions that enable a democratic social, political and professional framework for urban megaprojects.","[{""name"": ""Ana Peric"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank D’hondt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5937/SAJ1503343A"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199270057.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2427.2010.00912.x"", ""10.1177/0969776414535418"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.03.010"", ""10.1080/14649357.2012.677578"", ""10.4337/9781788973618"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grp024"", ""10.1002/pmj.21409"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198732242.001.0001"", ""10.1080/02513625.2011.10557142"", ""10.1177/0042098018757663"", ""10.1177/0969776411404873"", ""10.1080/09654313.2019.1579300"", ""10.5937/SAJ0902081L"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.00153"", ""10.2298/SPAT1431057M"", ""10.1080/02665430600892146"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2017.12.023"", ""10.1080/17535069.2019.1670469"", ""10.4324/9780429290091-10"", ""10.2298/SPAT1737049P"", ""10.30958/ajs.4-2-2"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-50972-7_4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb01747.x"", ""10.1111/1467-8330.00254"", ""10.2298/SPAT1023022V"", ""10.1007/3-7908-1727-9_14"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.03.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91068-0_13"", ""10.14361/9783839428429-009""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

This paper aims to describe a lighting simulation-based work conducted in Kolkata, India which modeled an indoor office to investigate the effects of variation in room surface reflectance combinations on user perception, mean room surface exitance (MRSE), average horizontal illuminance and overall uniformity of horizontal illuminance. Design/methodology/approach A fluorescent illumination system–based office space was modeled and retrofitted with tubular LED lamps in DIALux. Simulations were conducted for 16 different room surface reflectance combinations and a five-point Likert scale-type survey questionnaire was formulated to conduct a survey with 32 test subjects to assess the subjective preferability of each resultant light scene. Findings Simulation results demonstrate that the relationship between average horizontal illuminance and MRSE as well as between average horizontal illuminance and overall uniformity of horizontal illuminance, was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). In the conducted survey, the resultant light scene arising out of the reflectance combination of wall:ceiling:floor = 60%:90%:20% was the most well-received one with 187 convinced agreements (“agree” and “strongly agree” responses). Originality/value This work found strong linear correlation between average horizontal illuminance and MRSE and between average horizontal illuminance and overall uniformity. A five-point Likert scale-type survey questionnaire with seven questions was formulated and validated with 32 test subjects (Cronbach’s alpha &gt; 0.9295), which showed that the wall:ceiling:floor reflectance combination of 60%:90%:20% was the most favored choice.","[{""name"": ""Subarna Roy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sudipta Majumder"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sourin Bhattacharya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Imran Hossain Sardar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00994480.1997.10748194"", ""10.1177/147715356703200104"", ""10.21273/HORTSCI.42.3.581"", ""10.1109/TCE.2013.6490243"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.05.056"", ""10.1113/jphysiol.2011.226555"", ""10.1109/TIA.1984.4504580"", ""10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb11819.x"", ""10.1177/096032719102300201"", ""10.1177/1477153509104013"", ""10.1177/1477153517734401"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.06.025"", ""10.1177/1477153515593579"", ""10.1177/1477153515597733"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.04.002"", ""10.1177/154193128903300803"", ""10.1177/1420326X10392017"", ""10.1080/15502724.2015.1061945"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.05.016"", ""10.1016/0272-4944(95)90013-6"", ""10.1177/1420326X12446208"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.06.030"", ""10.1177/14771535960280040401"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.09.531"", ""10.1177/1420326X18793170"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2015-0040"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2013.12.028"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.028"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.692.45"", ""10.1016/0378-7788(84)90064-1"", ""10.1109/IAS.1988.25313"", ""10.1080/09613210802710298"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2010.09.005"", ""10.1080/00038628.2003.9696989"", ""10.1582/LEUKOS.2006.03.02.003"", ""10.1177/1477153514561071"", ""10.1191/1365782802lt057oa"", ""10.1080/00038628.2004.9697036"", ""10.1080/15502724.2013.855613"", ""10.1080/00038628.1998.9697420"", ""10.1088/1478-7814/12/1/304"", ""10.1364/OE.16.018692"", ""10.1006/jevp.1997.0059"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80007-6"", ""10.3763/asre.2008.5114"", ""10.1177/147715355401900401"", ""10.1177/1477153515612526"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.06.011""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Building and Construction', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

Each cause of change orders has a probability of occurrence and impact; therefore, there is a need to reassess the causes of change orders based on the probability and impact. The purpose of this paper is to determine the risk score for each factor and develop a model for estimating the overall change orders based on the measured and latent variables. Design/methodology/approach The research methodology consists of four parts. The first part identifies the causes of change orders in road projects from a literature review and develops the final list using the Delphi technique. The second part includes designing the final questionnaire to determine the probability and impact of each factor on the five-point Likert scale and 237 questionnaires received validity. The data were divided into training and testing sets and analyzed using AMOS software. Findings The proposed structural equation model presents an insight into the influence of measured and latent factors, which are not obvious in the traditional equations. The main cause for change orders was a change in design. Originality/value The results of this research are expected to improve the execution of road projects by identifying the main causes of the change orders and hence the project manager can develop a proper risk response plan.","[{""name"": ""Mohamed Badawy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000380"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000154"", ""10.4236/jbcpr.2018.64016"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000198"", ""10.1080/17452007.2005.9684592"", ""10.3763/asre.2006.4908"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2016.03.006"", ""10.36478/jeasci.2019.701.708"", ""10.3846/13923730.2014.893922"", ""10.3846/jcem.2010.60"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000353"", ""10.21315/jcdc2016.21.2.3"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000341"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000089"", ""10.1080/01446190600863178"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001888"", ""10.1016/j.jksues.2012.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.jksues.2014.03.002"", ""10.21315/jcdc2019.24.2.1"", ""10.12691/ajcea-6-3-3"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2000)126:4(268)"", ""10.1108/20441241211280873"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1211973"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000206"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.10.005"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2005)21:2(70)""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0463,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Resource levelling in projects considering different activity execution modes and splitting,"Purpose This study aims to develop a mathematical programming model for preemptive multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problems in construction with the objective of levelling resources considering renewable and non-renewable resources. Design/methodology/approach The proposed model was solved by the exact method and the genetic algorithm integrated with the solution modification procedure coded with MATLAB software. The Taguchi method was applied for setting the parameters of the genetic algorithm. Different numerical examples were used to show the validation of the proposed model and the capability of the genetic algorithm in solving large-sized problems. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of two parameters, including resource factor and order strength, was conducted to investigate their impact on computational time. Findings The results showed that preemptive activities obtained better results than non-preemptive activities. In addition, the validity of the genetic algorithm was evaluated by comparing its solutions to the ones of the exact methods. Although the exact method could not find the optimal solution for large-scale problems, the genetic algorithm obtained close to optimal solutions within a short computational time. Moreover, the findings demonstrated that the genetic algorithm was capable of achieving optimal solutions for small-sized problems. The proposed model assists construction project practitioners with developing a realistic project schedule to better estimate the project completion time and minimize fluctuations in resource usage during the entire project horizon. Originality/value There has been no study considering the interruption of multi-mode activities with fluctuations in resource usage over an entire project horizon. In this regard, fluctuations in resource consumption are an important issue that needs the attention of project planners.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Khalilzadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/15623599.2019.1623992"", ""10.1016/j.aci.2014.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.scient.2012.11.011"", ""10.1023/A:1010949931021"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2018.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2016.09.010"", ""10.1080/08839514.2019.1683977"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-13520-0_34"", ""10.1007/s10288-011-0168-6"", ""10.1007/s00291-016-0435-1"", ""10.1016/0166-218X(83)90012-4"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(98)00204-5"", ""10.1016/j.swevo.2019.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2018.04.025"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2019.106060"", ""10.3846/13923730.2014.982699"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2019.03.044"", ""10.1504/ijps.2016.080344"", ""10.3846/13923730.2013.801909"", ""10.3846/jcem.2020.12317"", ""10.1061/(asce)0733-9364(1989)115:2(302)"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0000097"", ""10.5267/j.ijiec.2015.11.001"", ""10.1007/s10696-015-9210-x"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2009.09.019"", ""10.1109/tcc.2016.2594172"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.03.020"", ""10.1111/mice.12356"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.11.014"", ""10.2298/YJOR171115025G"", ""10.5860/choice.27-0936"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000251"", ""10.1111/itor.12329"", ""10.1002/(sici)1520-6750(199810)45:7<733::aid-nav5>3.0.co;2-c"", ""10.1023/A:1010902015091"", ""10.1080/01605682.2018.1489340"", ""10.3846/jcem.2018.3043"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000368"", ""10.5755/j01.ee.26.4.9843"", ""10.1007/s10107-004-0551-6"", ""10.1007/s10951-013-0344-y"", ""10.1007/s10951-015-0423-3"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.019"", ""10.1080/00207543.2019.1636319"", ""10.1007/s10951-015-0457-6"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0001635"", ""10.1080/00207543.2017.1355120"", ""10.1155/2015/586087"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2008.11.002"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0210310"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-05170-3_1"", ""10.1177/0954405417711734"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2014.12.037"", ""10.1109/iceee2.2018.8391359"", ""10.4018/IJSIR.2019100101"", ""10.1007/PL00013357"", ""10.1023/B:ANOR.0000039521.26237.62"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2019.01.063"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2009.03.034"", ""10.3846/jcem.2019.11308"", ""10.1109/CEC.2019.8790210"", ""10.5267/j.dsl.2015.5.005"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2012.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.07.580"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2012.07.059"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(94)90353-0"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2019.02.039"", ""10.1155/2014/648938"", ""10.1007/s10951-007-0031-y"", ""10.2307/4132313"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2018.11.031"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2010.08.145"", ""10.1186/s40467-016-0054-z"", ""10.3846/1648715x.2013.787128"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-2870-5_3""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2023-0259,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Quantifying BIM investment value: a systematic review,"Purpose Perceived benefits of building information modelling (BIM) have been discussed for some time, but cost–benefit benchmarking has been inconsistent. The purpose of this paper is to investigate BIM feasibility and evaluate investment worth to elucidate and develop the current understanding of BIM merit. The aim of the study is to propose a research agenda towards a more holistic perspective of BIM use incorporating quantifying investment return. Design/methodology/approach An in-depth examination of research patterns has been conducted to identify challenges in the assessment of the investment value and return on investment (ROI) for BIM in the construction industry. A total of 75 research articles were considered for the final literature review. An evaluation of the literature is conducted using a combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic reviews. Findings This study, which analysed 75 articles, unveils key findings in quantifying BIM benefits, primarily through ROI calculation. Two major research gaps are identified: the absence of a standardized BIM ROI method and insufficient exploration of intangible benefits. Research focus varies across phases, emphasizing design and construction integration and exploring post-construction phases. The study categorizes quantifiable factors, including productivity, changes and rework reduction, requests for information reduction, schedule efficiency, safety, environmental sustainability and operations and facility management. These findings offer vital insights for researchers and practitioners, enhancing understanding of ’BIM’s financial benefits and signalling areas for further exploration in construction.

10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0246,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Optimising building performance through integrating risk management and building information modelling during the design process,"Purpose This paper aims to develop a framework for optimising building performance through the integration between risk management (RM) and building information modelling (BIM) during the design process. Design/methodology/approach To achieve this aim, a research strategy consisting of literature review, case studies and survey questionnaire is designed to accomplish four objectives. First, to examine the concepts of design process, building performance, RM and BIM; second, to present three case studies to explain the role of using RM and BIM capabilities towards optimising building performance; third, to investigate the perception and application of architectural design firms in Egypt towards the role of RM and BIM for enhancing building performance during the design process; and finally, to develop a framework integrating RM and BIM during the design process as an approach for optimising building performance. Findings Through literature review, the research identified 18 risks that hamper optimising building performance during the design process. In addition, 11 building performance values and 20 BIM technologies were defined. Results of data analysis showed that “Design budget overrun”, “Lack of considering life cycle cost” and “Inefficient use of the design time” were ranked the highest risks that affect the optimisation of building performance. Respondents ranked “Risk avoid” or “Risk transfer” as the most risk responses adopted in the Egyptian context. In addition, “BIM As Built” was ranked the highest BIM technology used for overcoming risks during the design process. These findings necessitated taking action towards developing a framework to optimising building performance. Originality/value The research identified the risks that affect optimising building performance during the design process. It focuses on improving the design process through using the capabilities of BIM technologies towards overcoming these risks during the design process. The proposed framework which integrates RM and BIM represents a synthesis that is novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred.","[{""name"": ""Ayman Ahmed Ezzat Othman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fatma Othman Alamoudy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000127"", ""10.3390/en11030638"", ""10.3390/ijerph14111286"", ""10.1108/09565690610713192"", ""10.18831/djcivil.org/2016021001"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.09.001"", ""10.2174/2352630001502010038"", ""10.1016/j.foar.2013.02.001"", ""10.32738/JEPPM.201201.0004"", ""10.5539/ass.v4n9p103"", ""10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.07.032"", ""10.1108/14714170410815033"", ""10.1108/14725960310807881"", ""10.3763/aber.2009.0307"", ""10.1179/oeh.2007.13.1.5"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2017-0087"", ""10.2478/otmcj-2018-0002"", ""10.1108/09699980410547603"", ""10.26687/archnet-ijar.v2i1.179"", ""10.1136/bmjqs-2014-003764"", ""10.4018/ij3dim.2013070104"", ""10.9790/3021-04640107"", ""10.1080/09613210801936472"", ""10.1108/eb021104"", ""10.1108/09685229610130503""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2020-0099,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Numerical analysis of reinforced concrete beams strengthened in shear using carbon fiber reinforced polymer materials,"Purpose This paper aims to analyze the performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in shear with carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets subjected to four-point bending. Design/methodology/approach ANSYS software is used to build six models. In addition, SOILD65, LINK180, SHELL181 and SOLID185 elements are used, respectively, to model concrete, steel reinforcement, polymer and steel plate support. A comparative study between the nonlinear finite element and analytical models, including the ACI 440.2 R-08 and FIB14 models as well as experimental data, is also carried out. Findings The comparative study of the nonlinear finite element results with analytical models shows that the difference between the predicted load capacity ranges from 4.44%–24.49% in the case of the ACI 440.2 R-08 model, while the difference for FIB14 code ranges from 2.69%–26.03%. It is clear that there is a good agreement between the nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) results and the different expected CFRP codes. Practical implications This model can be used to explore the behavior and predict the RC beams strengthened in shear with different CFRP properties. They could be used as a numerical platform in contrast to expensive and time-consuming experimental tests. Originality/value On the basis of the results, a good match is found between the model results and the experimental data at all stages of loading the tested samples. Load capacities as well as load deflection curves are also presented. It is concluded that the differences between the loads at failure ranged from 0.09%–6.16% and 0.56%–4.98%, comparing with experimental study. In addition, the increase in compressive strength produces an increase in the ultimate load capacity of the beam. The difference in the ultimate load capacity was less than 30% when compared with the American Concrete Institute and FIB14 codes.","[{""name"": ""Sabiha Barour"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdesselam Zergua"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0268(2004)8:3(258)"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2003.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.01.089"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.11.102"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2006.05.056"", ""10.1680/macr.2008.62.1.65"", ""10.1007/s13369-012-0333-z"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111337"", ""10.1007/s11223-010-9212-6"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2012.03.024"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.09.032"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.prostr.2019.08.029"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2006.06.023"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2009.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.01.076"", ""10.3844/ajeassp.2008.192.199"", ""10.1007/s40030-013-0028-9"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.02.018""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

10.1386/adch_00024_1,ART DESIGN & COMMUNICATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION,1305 Design,Investigation of the contribution of virtual reality to architectural education,"This study mainly examines the contribution of the virtual reality environment to architectural education. The primary aim of the study was to investigate the theoretical possibilities of VR technology in an interactive and participatory educational environment that would allow students to examine architectural components and inter-component relationships. A group of 160 volunteers participated in the study, with participants asked to design villas in both natural (non-VR) and virtual reality (VR) environments within a specific period. Designs made in both environments (VR and non-VR) were evaluated by a team of five experts (jurors). For the evaluation, jurors wore eye-tracking devices and were asked to comment on the designs in both environments. In the virtual reality environment designs, the following categories showed significant differences over the drawings in a natural environment: functionality, aesthetics, user perception of space and internal physical quality (light quality), indicating that the virtual reality designs were examined more closely by the jurors than were those in the natural environment. This study will contribute to design discipline if virtual reality systems are adopted in architecture education.","[{""name"": ""İlker Erkan"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000405273171 Süleyman Demirel University""]}]","[""10.1016/j.procs.2013.11.027"", ""10.1386/adch.4.3.205/1"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00246"", ""10.1080/01587910303047"", ""10.1007/978-0-85729-224-7_26"", ""10.1162/pres.16.3.318"", ""10.1177/1745691612456044"", ""10.1080/00038628.2018.1523129"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.040"", ""10.11120/jebe.2008.03010005"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.03.019"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2011.11.004"", ""10.28945/329"", ""10.1080/10494820.2012.745426"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2015.11.017"", ""10.18001/TRS.2.4.9"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2013.07.033"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2010.10.020"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2006.12.008"", ""10.1080/09544820600664580"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2010.10.003"", ""10.1080/17470210902816461"", ""10.1023/A:1012061809603"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00219"", ""10.1002/hfm.20503"", ""10.1177/0018720816684064"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2005.06.002"", ""10.1386/adch_00024_1""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-02-2022-0101,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Integrating Industry 4.0 and agile new product development practices to evaluate the penetration of sustainable development goals in manufacturing industries,"Purpose The United Nations member countries adopted a set of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. It encourages the use of sustainable practices during new product development (NPD). Competitiveness has put pressure on organizations to maintain their market share and look for new approaches related to NPD. The current study aims to focus on creating a framework that can help to achieve the SDGs by adopting agile new product development (ANPD) practices and Industry 4.0 technologies. Design/methodology/approach From the literature, various ANPD practices, Industry 4.0 technologies, performance metrics, their interconnection and their contribution toward achieving SDGs are extracted. The weights of selected Industry 4.0–ANPD practices are computed by robust best worst method (RBWM), and the Fuzzy-VIKOR method is used to rank the selected performance metrics. To test the robustness of the developed framework, sensitivity analysis is also performed. Findings The results show that among the various Industry 4.0–ANPD practices “Multi-skilled employees” have the highest weight followed by “Customer requirement analysis and prioritization.” Whereas for performance metrics, “The number of innovative products launched per year” is ranked first, with the “Average time between two launches” at second place. Practical implications This research contributes to the adoption of ANPD practices and Industry 4.0 technologies for the achievement of the business SDGs. The shortlisted Industry 4.0–ANPD practices will help in resolving the social and environmental issues. The set of performance metrics will help practitioners and managers to evaluate the performance of ANPD in the context of business SDGs.

10.1111/jade.12289,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Fostering Empathy through an Inclusive Pedagogy for Career Creatives,"AbstractWith the emergence of an entire generation of technologically infused learners comes a new challenge for educators to combat their desire for technologically enhanced isolation. The impact of social media on self‐absorption and the ramifications of excessive screen time are already evident in our current generation of tech‐native students. Meanwhile, the need for more empathetic employees who show compassion toward clients, exercise tolerance for co‐workers and demonstrate cultural awareness in all aspects of their work is already being prioritised over discipline‐specific skills and even STEM expertise by current business leaders. Similarly, the demand for more empathetic creatives is being catalysed by a design industry that now values human‐centredness. Empathy brings the human component to user‐experience and interface design and is now widely acknowledged as the first step in any design process. As a corollary, the development of empathy as a pedagogical deliverable will not only be necessary for the workplace of the future but for future generations to become fully‐functioning members of society. This research explores how an inclusive art and design pedagogy can foster collaborative learner‐centred approaches to develop empathy as a key component of emotional intelligence. Our methodology for triggering meaningful experiences and transformational growth harnesses collaborative play as a way to engage learners in stimulating, socially conscious teamwork. By becoming more intentional about designing the future of higher education in order to nurture more empathetic career creatives, we also lay the groundwork in preparation for educating the most technologically advanced, yet potentially socially isolated learners of any generation yet.","[{""name"": ""J.

10.1162/desi_a_00670,DESIGN ISSUES,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Flexible Environments for Hybrid Collaboration: Redesigning Virtual Work Through the Four Orders of Design,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic made visceral for many the fact that virtual forms of collaboration— simultaneously liberating and frustrating—are here to stay. Workers’ frustrations demonstrate that challenges remain for work and its design in increasingly “hybrid” collaboration— work in which some people, interacting face-to-face, are co-located while others with whom they work are remote. Using Buchanan's four orders of design, in conjunction with management and information systems scholarship, we present a framework for improving these virtual forms of collaboration. In this article, we review the latest knowledge from these disciplines on virtual collaboration through the lens of the four orders of design. In doing so, we demonstrate that conceiving of work in terms of flexible collaborative environments could increase the unity of purpose between work and workers by leveraging the capabilities of varying degrees of virtuality to engender experiences that benefit all those who interact with work systems.","[{""name"": ""John Meluso"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susan Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Bagrow"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/jade.12322,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Engaging Young Children and Families in Gallery Education at Tate Liverpool,"AbstractBeyond Words: Engaging Young Children and Families in Gallery Education at Tate Liverpool, is a three‐year ethnographic case study that explores what happens when preschool children, parents and nursery practitioners from a Sure Start Children’s Centre, visit Tate to participate in an extended series of gallery visits and workshops with artists. This article explores the potential value and tensions of those creative and cultural experiences, particularly for young children and families, by critically examining different perspectives, discourses and possible constructs of effective creative engagement. This research contributes to the debate on ways of engaging children and families from marginalised communities in cultural visits and creative practices by opening up existing discussions on poverty, matters of inclusion, negative stereotypes and dominant educational discourses. Insights from parents are included and their feelings are related to the ‘symbolic violence’ often felt by parents and children throughout their education from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This research explores how Tate Liverpool developed relationships with a diverse family audience, through developing relationships with children and adults over repeated visits, as an important way for offering continuity and a sense of belonging, particularly for families who may not traditionally visit art galleries. In doing so, it makes a case for galleries to be considered as democratic, inclusive and rhizomatic learning environments, where artist educators act as ‘dreamkeepers’. Dreamkeepers can offer the space for extra emotional, social and intellectual support needed for healing from educational injury and for restarting a learning journey.","[{""name"": ""Denise Wright"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4135/9781446279618"", ""10.1086/345321"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.29173/cjs6028"", ""10.1002/chi.823"", ""10.1177/0309132507076417"", ""10.5962/bhl.title.17966"", ""10.1080/09647775.2018.1442241"", ""10.1179/msi.2010.5.1.15"", ""10.4324/9780203383537"", ""10.1177/0038038505058368"", ""10.1080/00131911.2013.781576"", ""10.1177/1468798412453730"", ""10.1080/14733285.2018.1497141"", ""10.1016/j.ecresq.2014.04.004"", ""10.1080/09518398.2013.788755"", ""10.1080/14733285.2017.1409884"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1t8928t"", ""10.1080/1350293X.2017.1380888"", ""10.4324/9781315718002"", ""10.1111/cura.12113"", ""10.2307/j.ctt22p7k7m"", ""10.4324/9780203317730"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-2646-0_12"", ""10.53841/bpsecp.2009.26.2.77"", ""10.1007/978-0-230-21454-5_3"", ""10.4324/9781315667553"", ""10.1080/10286632.2016.1150268"", ""10.1080/1350293X.2015.1104049"", ""10.1080/14680770701824779"", ""10.4324/9780203854679""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Reduced productivity is one of the indirect consequences that lead to major delays in the completion of the project. The purpose of this study is to develop a model that could quantify the impact of change orders on labor productivity and result in the establishment of policies to lessen their effects. Design/methodology/approach A model was developed to analyze the effects of change orders on labor productivity, then policies for managing their impacts on productivity and project duration were established. A water treatment case study was selected to serve as the scenario in which to implement and evaluate the model and policies. Findings The results of this study indicated that pressure to adhere to a schedule initially leads to an increase in labor productivity, but it is often followed by a significant drop that is a result of employee frustration. It was concluded that the pressure can be positive if it is applied for a short period of time; however, it continues for a significant length of time, the duration of the project will increase appreciably. Originality/value The proposed model can be implemented to identify the factors that affect labor productivity in a construction project. Its utilization will also help project managers assess when change orders occur and determine, which policies will be most effective in optimizing labor productivity.","[{""name"": ""Sharareh Kermanshachi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Behzad Rouhanizadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul Govan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000154"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.11.010"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.09.002"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:5(397)"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.101"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.05.062"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2011.10.021"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2002)16:4(252)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:3(197)"", ""10.1080/014461999371060"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2015-0097"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:3(187)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1999)125:5(368)"", ""10.1108/CI-06-2015-0034"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2006)20:4(290)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000878"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(01)00039-4"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2005)131:3(354)"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2006.07.005"", ""10.1080/01446190802459924"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.11.003"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-07-2018-125"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2004.11.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000417"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2005)131:9(953)"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.11.007"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2008)134:1(128)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000206"", ""10.1002/sdr.330"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:6(421)"", ""10.1002/sdr.428"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000342"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000472"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2011.04.007"", ""10.1080/09537287.2017.1376257"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001417""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1111/joid.12164,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Creating and Testing a Sensory Well-Being Hub for Adolescents with Developmental Disabilities,"While multisensory environments (or sensory rooms) are gaining traction in the learning environments, few studies have assessed the comparative effectiveness of specific elements and the link to individuals’ unique sensory needs. This study describes the creation and evaluation of a sensory well–being hub for diverse learners with developmental disabilities and distinct sensory profiles in a Chicago public high school. The sensory well–being hub is a simple and adaptable freestanding structure with various sensory affordances, supporting a wide range of atypical sensory processing in neurodiverse individuals. Data were collected during one academic year using surveys, focus groups, field observations, sensor data, log–in sheets, and student records. Results show that the hub was used for both scheduled (preventive) visits and unscheduled (spontaneously needed) ones. The most visited elements in the hub were a beanbag with weighted blanket, sensory cocoon with tensile fabric and a media wall, and a fidget wall with various components. The sensory affordances most often sought by users were compression, quietness, tactility, and proprioception. Students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) differed from those without ASD in the ways they used sensory intervention even though the two groups were equivalent in sensory profiles (in thresholds for registration and active–to–passive response to stimuli). Based on the study findings, design suggestions were included to inform sensory hub design in other learning environments.","[{""name"": ""Giyoung Park"", ""affiliation"": [""HKS, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Upali Nanda"", ""affiliation"": [""HKS, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Lisa Adams"", ""affiliation"": [""HKS, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Essary"", ""affiliation"": [""HKS, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Melissa Hoelting"", ""affiliation"": [""HKS, USA""]}]","[""10.15585/mmwr.ss6706a1"", ""10.1177/1362361309103794"", ""10.1016/S0891-4222(01)00067-1"", ""10.1016/j.ridd.2014.12.034"", ""10.1016/j.dr.2011.01.001"", ""10.1093/cercor/bht213"", ""10.4324/9781315856872"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-2456-8_6"", ""10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182443"", ""10.1080/01449290310001592587"", ""10.1007/s10803-015-2693-1"", ""10.1111/j.1440-1630.2009.00835.x"", ""10.1007/s10803-006-0218-7"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61376-3"", ""10.1016/j.ridd.2006.04.001"", ""10.26687/archnet-ijar.v12i3.1589"", ""10.1111/joid.12098"", ""10.1145/301153.301168"", ""10.1080/13574809.2016.1194189"", ""10.1179/bjdd.1997.014"", ""10.1111/nhs.12048"", ""10.1177/2167696814534417"", ""10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003""]","['Environmental Science', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1111/jade.12380,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Challenges and Opportunities: Creative Approaches to Museum and Gallery Learning during the Pandemic,"AbstractDuring the pandemic many museums and galleries pivoted from onsite, in‐person delivery to develop a remote offer and to create digital learning resources and activity packs for children and young people. In this article, I draw upon my experience as practitioner researcher on the schools and teachers’ programme at the Fitzwilliam Museum to consider different approaches to supporting participatory creative pedagogies while the museum was closed. After discussing how the work built on and extended existing programming for this audience, I consider effective strategies for facilitating authentic and inclusive encounters with objects and artworks remotely. While some were empowered to take part and to engage, others were locked out through the ever widening social and digital divide. How can we overcome these challenges and make the most of the opportunities which this work has revealed? What are the implications of this work for our understanding of the role, function and future of museum and gallery learning?","[{""name"": ""Kate Noble"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.2151-6952.2008.tb00311.x"", ""10.1080/14733285.2018.1447088"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00133"", ""10.1002/9781118978061.ead030"", ""10.1080/00043249.2006.10791213"", ""10.1080/14733285.2017.1409884"", ""10.1111/jade.12330"", ""10.1111/jade.12359"", ""10.1177/1461444818822816"", ""10.1111/jade.12371"", ""10.1111/jade.12317"", ""10.1111/jade.12292"", ""10.1080/09647770100401903"", ""10.1111/cura.12113"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00298"", ""10.1080/09647779800401704""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0214,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Assessment of early warning signs predisposing building projects to failure in Nigeria,"PurposeThe continuous failure of construction projects notwithstanding appreciable increase in project management knowledge has necessitated a proactive approach of assessing early warning signs (EWS) of building projects failure. Building projects are expected to show warning signs before experiencing crises, comparable to a patient displaying symptoms of a disease. Thus, this study aims to examine the EWS that predisposed building projects to failure in Nigeria to provide empirical data for enhancing projects delivery.Design/methodology/approachPrimary data were used for the study. Structured questionnaire was administered to consultants and contractors’ personnel within Lagos State, Nigeria. A total of 180 copies of questionnaire were administered and 134 copies (combined response rate of 74.44 per cent) were retrieved. Frequency distribution, percentages, mean item score and Mann–Whitney test were used to analyse the data.FindingsMost construction professionals applied the EWS approach from project planning and early construction phase. The most significant EWS predisposing building projects to failure were “Management inability and incompetence to proactively detect and manage problems at early project stages”, “Actual expenditure is constantly shooting beyond cost estimates” and “Incurred costs already getting higher than the anticipated benefits”. Project/construction management-related symptoms are most significant to predisposing building projects to failure.Practical implicationsThe study provided implications for effective project management of building projects through proactive approach which is very paramount to improving the delivery of building projects in Nigeria.Originality/valueThe study provides implications for proactive management of building projects, thereby enhancing the delivery of building projects.","[{""name"": ""Emmanuel Oluwatobi Adebisi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oluwaseyi Olalekan Alao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stephen Okunlola Ojo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00028-5"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-07-2016-0016"", ""10.1016/0263-7863(95)00064-X"", ""10.1108/14635770410532624"", ""10.5130/ajceb.v10i1/2.1592"", ""10.1139/l05-032"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.03.011"", ""10.2979/esj.2006.5.1.43"", ""10.1080/14783360600750444"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2011.10.003"", ""10.1080/014461997373132"", ""10.1201/1078.10580530/46352.23.4.20060901/95110.4"", ""10.1080/0144619042000326710"", ""10.1080/01446190500521041"", ""10.1016/S0024-6301(01)00097-8"", ""10.5251/ajsir.2013.4.1.75.82"", ""10.11648/j.ajtas.20160501.12"", ""10.1111/1467-9906.00007"", ""10.5251/ajsms.2011.2.1.56.75"", ""10.2307/2333709""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-11-2021-0636,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Analysing the effect of multicultural workforce/teams on construction productivity,"Purpose Prodigious teamwork is the basis for augmenting the level of productivity on construction projects. Globalisation of the construction market has meant that many practitioners work outside of their geographical spectrum; however, the multicultural dissimilarities of construction workforces within the project management team (and how these may impact upon project productivity performance) have been given scant academic attention. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper aims to analyse the effects of a multicultural workforce on construction productivity. Design/methodology/approach The epistemological positioning of the research adopted mixed philosophies (consisting of both interpretivism and postpositivism) to undertake a deductive and cross-sectional survey to collate primary quantitative data collected via a closed-ended structured questionnaire. Census sampling and convenience sampling techniques were adopted to target Ghana’s construction workforce and their opinions of the phenomenon under investigation. Out of 96 questionnaires administered, 61 were retrieved. The data obtained were analysed by using mean score ranking, relative important index, one sample t-test and multiple regression. The reliability of the scale was checked by using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Findings From the t-test analysis, 11 variables sourced from extant literature, and the null hypothesis for the study was not rejected and all factors (except high cost of training and improper gender diversity management) were affirmed as negative effects of the multicultural workforce on construction productivity. Using multiple regression analysis, six of the independent variables were shown to impact upon productivity. The goodness of fit was verified by collinearity and residual analysis. The model’s validation revealed a relatively high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0. 589), implying that the results could be generalized. In culmination, these findings suggest that the predictors can be used to accurately predict the effects of multicultural workforce on construction productivity performance. Practical implications The findings indicate that multicultural workforce/teams have a substantial effect on overall construction productivity in the construction sector; consequently, stakeholders must address this issue to enhance productivity across the sector. Originality/value The current study significantly contributes to our understanding of how multicultural workers/teams affect construction productivity in the construction business perspective and how to respond to the negative menace.","[{""name"": ""Ewald Kuoribo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Amoah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ernest Kissi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jacob Anim Gyampo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wellington Didibhuku Thwala"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/buildings11040169"", ""10.1177/1080569912471186"", ""10.1111/ncmr.12136"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2000)126:2(97)"", ""10.1515/multi-2014-0007e"", ""10.1108/13664380910942626"", ""10.1177/001872679905200401"", ""10.1215/00382876-100-4-1005"", ""10.1016/j.bar.2008.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.06.026"", ""10.1177/1046496407301970"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-01-2013-0002"", ""10.1016/j.orgdyn.2003.11.008"", ""10.2478/otmcj-2020-0022"", ""10.1080/01446190802244789"", ""10.1080/21573727.2011.621419"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001452"", ""10.1108/13552519810369057"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.08.012"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0101"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000168"", ""10.3390/buildings11060260"", ""10.1108/F-06-2017-0062"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2013.11.003"", ""10.1061/9780784413616.175"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0465"", ""10.1177/0027950113803222"", ""10.1108/SASBE-01-2021-0015"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000501"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2419.2011.00395.x"", ""10.1177/0149206313493325"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0108"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1983104"", ""10.3390/buildings11070282"", ""10.1016/j.im.2018.07.002"", ""10.1080/01446190110090996"", ""10.1108/ECAM-08-2011-0074"", ""10.1108/LODJ-04-12-0058"", ""10.1080/15623599.2014.922726"", ""10.1108/14714171011060088"", ""10.4102/sajip.v43i0.1446"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0193"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2020-0016"", ""10.1108/ECAM-02-2015-0019"", ""10.1108/09699980911002557"", ""10.1108/09699981311324023"", ""10.19030/jdm.v7i1.6936"", ""10.5901/mjss.2015.v6n4s3p524"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0257"", ""10.2478/jesr-2019-0008"", ""10.1080/17452007.2021.1956422"", ""10.1007/978-94-6351-086-8_2"", ""10.1108/MRR-02-2013-0027"", ""10.1080/01446190902960482"", ""10.1002/hrdq.1216"", ""10.1080/17452007.2012.738041"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2004.05.009"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1837717"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0507"", ""10.1016/j.scamam.2010.09.009"", ""10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.11.004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2451.2010.01749.x"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2014.07.006"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2013.12.005"", ""10.1002/sd.2155"", ""10.35478/jime.2018.3.04"", ""10.1016/j.emj.2014.04.001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6494.1986.tb00391.x"", ""10.1177/0950017007076635"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000658"", ""10.1061/(asce)me.1943-5479.0000662"", ""10.1002/sd.1965"", ""10.1057/jbs.2013.64""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Design/methodology/approach The proposed environmental impact analysis method is based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. In this method, the system boundary of the cutting unit is first defined, and inventory data on energy and material consumptions are analyzed. Subsequently, through classification, five important environmental impact categories are proposed, namely, primary energy demand, global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential and photochemical ozone creation potential. Finally, the environmental impact results are obtained through characterization and normalization. Findings This method is applied on a case study involving a machine-tool turning unit. Results show that primary energy demand and global warming potential exert the serious environmental impact in the turning unit. Suggestions for improving the environmental performance of the machine-tool turning are proposed. Originality/value The environmental impact analysis method is applicable to different machine tools and cutting-unit processes. Moreover, it can guide and support the development of green manufacturing by machinery manufacturers.","[{""name"": ""Junli Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Junyu Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mingyang Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Huaizhi Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.procir.2016.08.020"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2017.11.070"", ""10.1177/0954405413508280"", ""10.1007/BF02978471"", ""10.1007/BF02978897"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2015.02.046"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2019.01.068"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.216"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2013.06.049"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.336"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.05.012""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Literature review was conducted to report on the smart building concept and POE. A total of 49 performance indicators, classified according to the technical, functional and behavioral elements, were investigated. A case study of a smart building in a university campus was selected to assess the users’ satisfaction through POE. A total of 90 users from the academic and administrative staff of the building were contacted through a Web-based questionnaire survey, while 35 usable responses were obtained. Findings The findings revealed that the occupants were satisfied with several aspects of the building performance indicators; however, issues related to ventilation, control of thermostats, amount of natural lighting through low-E windows and privacy were identified. Ultimately, the study reveals that, although the adoption of smart technologies has the potential to provide an excellent and comfortable work environment, the efficient selection and/or maintenance of the adopted technologies is crucial. Originality/value The concept of smart buildings is perceived to be the future of the industry. Despite this growing need for “smartization,” the performance of a building ultimately depends on how it satisfies the needs of those who use them. The value and implication of this study is inherent in its emphasis on the satisfaction of buildings users in futuristic designs of buildings. The study shows that POEs can be used to assess the satisfaction of users of smart buildings to understand what works, as well as what needs redesign or improvement.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad A.

10.1111/jade.12280,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Active Learning in Architectural Education: A Participatory Design Experience (PDE) in Colombia,"AbstractContemporary architecture teaching in Colombia still resembles the traditional master–apprentice model, which is also common in many parts of the world. The model of regular curricular focus on classroom‐based modules where theory and practice are predominantly disengaged, leaving the students to make their connections. Students that learnt with these models face greater difficulties to apply knowledge, compared with students taught with active learning formats. It is argued that participatory design processes could be catalytic for change in this area, by empowering participants in the co‐creation of their socio‐spatial context. This article aims to contribute by suggesting a methodology for a Participatory Design Experience (PDE), which could be applied to transform a conventional teaching module into a student‐centred learning environment. The methodology was tested and refined through a case study, demonstrating its effectiveness in architectural education. The article describes it in detail in order to be replicated by educators in comparable scenarios.","[{""name"": ""Camilo Salazar Ferro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isabel Artega Arredondo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carolina M.

This article explores students’ reports of feeling more relaxed and less stressed in the art room, data drawn from a three‐year study of thirty arts‐rich secondary schools. Drawing on recent scholarship on affect, we suggest that these feelings were in part the result of ‘atmosphere’ – mobile bodies in (1) a curated space, engaged with educational activities associated with (2) a signature text and pedagogy, enacted as an (3) isorhythmic practice. We suggest that these three elements of atmosphere not only help us to understand how to produce positive feelings about art, but they also have some potential for use in professional reflection on practice.","[{""name"": ""Pat Thomson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christine Hall"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2011.01729.x"", ""10.1215/9780822394716"", ""10.4324/9781315143880-2"", ""10.1177/072551369303600107"", ""10.1111/jade.12141"", ""10.1215/9780822384434"", ""10.1177/0263276408097794"", ""10.1515/9780748644124-006"", ""10.4324/9780203464229"", ""10.4324/9780203130445"", ""10.1215/9780822394037"", ""10.1111/jade.12086"", ""10.1215/9780822383574"", ""10.1080/10155490120106032"", ""10.4324/9781351039260-16"", ""10.1111/jade.12058"", ""10.1111/jade.12084"", ""10.4324/9781351039260-7"", ""10.1215/9780822384786"", ""10.1016/S0193-3973(99)00057-X"", ""10.1162/0011526054622015"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2007.00525.x"", ""10.1080/01425692.2018.1554474"", ""10.1080/17508487.2018.1525754"", ""10.1080/02680931003783346"", ""10.1080/17457820701547450""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The project involved 68 teachers from over 40 primary schools who were introduced to a Renaissance painting of Cupid and Psyche in a series of training sessions at the museum in early 2019. Schools were then invited to submit art work to an end‐of‐project exhibition which opened in December. Over the course of the year, more than 500 children aged between 4 and 11 visited the museum to look at the painting and more than 3,800 studied it at school using specially created digital learning resources. We draw on survey and email feedback, interviews, blog posts, photographs and artwork collected during the project to discuss how the project provided expert training about art objects, materials and processes and brought teachers together to transform practice and extend pupil outcomes. We also consider how a constructivist pedagogy might encourage more participatory, open ended and playful approaches to teaching art and design to stimulate careful looking, deep thinking, and experimentation with materials and techniques. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential of communities of practice to bring together artists, teachers and art museum professionals to support the development of visual literacy and creativity in children and young people.","[{""name"": ""Kate Noble"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09650792.2013.761920"", ""10.1111/j.2151-6952.2002.tb00057.x"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.1986.tb00193.x"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00133"", ""10.1002/9781118978061.ead030"", ""10.1080/14681360500487512"", ""10.1111/j.2151-6952.2004.tb00137.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1111/lit.12190"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00298"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2009.01604.x"", ""10.1111/jade.12282"", ""10.1080/13674589900200101"", ""10.5406/visuartsrese.41.1.0027"", ""10.1002/9781118978061.ead009""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0259,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Utilization of adaptive methodology to underpin rail transportation systems: Sydney metro's methodical formulation,"Purpose As a part of adaptive and complex system thinking, geographic information systems (GIS) are beneficial particularly for transportation projects, where uncertainty is frequent. Accordingly, this paper aims to examine the utilization of GIS in line with adaptive and complex system thinking, as the basis of the methodical formulation of perceived gaps within the integrated transportation planning (ITP) specifically for the mega transportation projects. Such a framework is undertaken, as the mega transportation projects although may seem straightforward, however, are problematic and require more consideration than the traditional triple bottom line factors. Using the Sydney Metro as the case study, the outcome demonstrates the significance of the fourth separate dimension of engineering into the aforementioned bottom-line factors. Design/methodology/approach The research examines the utilization of adaptive and complex system thinking, as the basis of the methodical formulation of perceived gaps within the ITP. The use of Sydney’s Metro project is a novel example of the proposed methodical formulation and its empirical assessment and provides a better understanding of the use of mapping and planning tools for mega transportation projects. Findings Aptly, using the developed conceptual framework, this research further validates the inclusion of a separate engineering dimension with the usual triple bottom line factors. Such inclusion is paramount in responding to the existing ITP gaps found within the current literature. Originality/value This research uses GIS and ITP process to support the aforementioned adaptive and complex system thinking. This, in turn, is used as the basis of a methodical formulation framework in dealing with mega rail transportation infrastructure. To support such a proposition, Sydney Metro is examined as the basis of a case study.","[{""name"": ""Koorosh Gharehbaghi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerry McManus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matt Myers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.cities.2020.102811"", ""10.1016/j.jth.2015.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2020.102365"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2020.102813"", ""10.18178/ijmlc.2018.8.3.702"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2018-0117"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2018-0223"", ""10.1504/WRITR.2020.106926"", ""10.1080/03081060.2018.1488933"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2020.102419"", ""10.1016/j.cstp.2015.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2020.10.008"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2020.102165"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2020.102328"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.102885"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2020.102800"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.140"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2020.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2020.102731"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2020.102846"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.014"", ""10.3141/2163-12"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.051"", ""10.1177/0739456X15595866""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Transportation', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

10.1111/jade.12318,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Teacher as Conceptual Artist,"AbstractTeachers in arts education frequently struggle with their professional identity. When asked, arts teachers often answer that they believe that their main responsibility is education at the expense of understanding themselves as artists. The Mexican‐American artist and teacher Jorge Lucero questions whether an occupation as teacher necessarily impedes a creative practice. The finding that both progressive pedagogy and conceptual art share certain characteristics forms the basis for his concept of ‘teacher as conceptual artist’. In short, Lucero proposes that a teacher’s practice, in and beyond the classroom, simultaneously can be his or her creative practice. This qualitative intervention study explored whether or not the concept of teacher as conceptual artist holds the possibility to narrow down the gap between teacher and artist identities. The intervention consisted of a three‐day project led by Lucero in which nine arts teacher students were familiarised with modes of operation as a conceptual artist. In the three following months, these students implemented lessons in primary and secondary education based on those modes. Prior to the project, ‘elicitation‐interviews’ were used to explore how students perceived their professional identity and at the end of project semi‐structured interviews were conducted. The findings suggest that through the modes of operation as a conceptual artist, students who mainly identified as an artist were able to integrate a teacher identity in their artist identity, but the modes of operation also gave students who withheld their artist identity from the classroom an opportunity to live their artist identity in the classroom.","[{""name"": ""Melissa Bremmer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Emiel Heijnen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sanne Kersten"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10714413.2013.819726"", ""10.1177/0255761407083573"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1080/00043125.2007.11651118"", ""10.1080/14613808.2012.712507"", ""10.1215/9780822395515"", ""10.1080/13528165.2016.1239912"", ""10.1080/15411796.2014.844625"", ""10.1080/00393541.2010.11518804"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01636.x"", ""10.1080/00043125.2006.11651594"", ""10.2307/3192553"", ""10.1207/s1541180xtaj0402_4"", ""10.1007/978-94-6300-633-0_21"", ""10.1080/00393541.2015.11518954"", ""10.1080/13562517.2014.901952"", ""10.1007/978-94-6300-633-0"", ""10.4135/9781446268278.n4"", ""10.1080/01411921003596903""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1111/jade.12354,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Tacit Knowledge in Painting: From Studio to Classroom,"AbstractThis article discusses research that employed practice‐led and action research methods to study the tacit knowledge of painting practice and its application to teaching. Polanyi’s theory of tacit knowledge is used to analyse the non‐verbal, experience‐based knowledge of painting to construct a discursive relationship between the dual practices of painting and teaching. The research was undertaken in the context of a twelve‐week class in landscape painting for adults in a non‐profit art school. Within the context of the class, a series of paintings was created and documented. By analysing the focal and subsidiary knowledge of the painting processes, several distinct patterns of action and thinking emerged. These patterns were synthesised into three modes of thinking that integrate the mind, body and materials. The outcome of the study is a preliminary model that describes painting as a dynamic multi‐modal thinking process, integrating visual perception, material actions and expressive ways of thinking. The discussion includes a detailed description of the research methods, the data analysis, the application in teaching, and the embodied nature of cognition in the painting process.","[{""name"": ""Branka Marinkovic"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.14361/transcript.9783839425169.intro"", ""10.1007/s10780-015-9252-8"", ""10.4324/9780429491948"", ""10.5040/9780755604876"", ""10.1177/1474022215592247"", ""10.1080/15411796.2017.1332943"", ""10.1162/LEON_a_01471"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195333213.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781410602183"", ""10.1023/A:1021303723047"", ""10.1177/0170840605053102"", ""10.1348/000709900158001"", ""10.1057/palgrave.kmrp.8500082"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01636.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-3052-9_19"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2013.01748.x"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226500393.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jmp/8.1.77"", ""10.1007/978-981-4560-67-2"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839425169.21"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9476.001.0001"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00143"", ""10.1386/adch.10.2.217_1"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198735410.013.1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57481-3_10"", ""10.1287/orsc.1080.0412"", ""10.1111/j.1467-954X.2007.00697.x"", ""10.1007/s00146-018-0801-4"", ""10.1080/00393541.2013.11518897"", ""10.1080/10508406.2017.1381963"", ""10.4324/9780203841327.ch6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63898-0_2"", ""10.1111/edth.12001"", ""10.1111/jade.12171"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352670""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0498,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Systematic review on the identification of safety risks in off-site manufacturing (OSM),"Purpose Off-site manufacturing (OSM) has emerged as a method of modern construction that provides several benefits including achieving lower costs, a quicker schedule and environmentally friendly solutions. Although numerous researches are available that advocate the adoption of OSM, the devotion towards OSM safety is somewhat limited. However, OSM invariably generates safety risks, including dynamics and uncertainty in safety management. There is a unique call to have an investigation on the identification of OSM safety risks. Design/methodology/approach To provide a full picture on the OSM safety, a systematic literature review was adopted based on interpretivist philosophical stance. The literature search was conducted in key electronic databases to identify OSM safety-focused publications. Bibliometric analysis was adopted to identify co-occurrences of keywords and collaboration among authors in OSM safety-related research publications. Content analysis was conducted to provide a taxonomy of OSM safety risks. The identified studies were critically analysed to determine the focus of OSM safety research and provide future research directions. Findings The results demonstrated frequently appeared OSM safety aspects while highlighting the limitedness of collaborative research outputs in common authorships. Content analysis subsequently unveiled safety risks in OSM under human, organisational and work environmental factors. A critical analysis of extant literature revealed seven research classifications of OSM safety. Directions were offered to enhance OSM safety by applying principles of targeted safety management concepts, technology-driven safety measures and bespoke training programs. Originality/value This study provides a comprehensive review on the identification of safety risks throughout OSM while presenting the avenues useful for the development of OSM safety management strategies.","[{""name"": ""Sadith Chinthaka Vithanage"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Sing"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Davis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Manikam Pillay"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.051"", ""10.1108/14714170910931552"", ""10.1080/01446190500184444"", ""10.1108/F-07-2018-0085"", ""10.1002/asi.21525"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0246"", ""10.1080/17457300.2015.1047865"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.01.061"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2009.10.007"", ""10.1080/01446190010020435"", ""10.1057/ejis.2011.54"", ""10.1080/01446190601071821"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.150"", ""10.1080/01446193.2019.1682174"", ""10.3846/jcem.2018.5181"", ""10.1080/01446193.2010.545994"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.12.002"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.05.029"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.136"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000330"", ""10.1108/SRJ-09-2018-0240"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.12.006"", ""10.21834/aje-bs.v3i10.324"", ""10.1080/00140139.2010.535024"", ""10.1016/j.ergon.2007.08.009"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000907"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.012"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2019-0136"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2014-0048"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2007.11.011"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.07.033"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.006"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000054"", ""10.3390/buildings9020038"", ""10.1108/ECAM-02-2017-0038"", ""10.1590/s1678-86212017000400183"", ""10.2174/1874836801711010286"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2018-0390"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2014.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2019.04.025"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.09.025""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Decision Sciences']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-12-2021-0719,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Stimulation strategies to promote green building uptake in developing countries: the case of Ghana,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the significant stimulating measures/enablers relating to the existing building regulations for promoting the adoption and overcoming the barriers to the uptake and implementation of the green building concept (GBC) in developing countries using Ghana as a case. Design/methodology/approach The quantitative research approach was used to attain the study’s goal. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were found to be suitable for collecting data from 292 relevant stakeholders in Ghana’s construction industry. The mean score ranking technique, in conjunction with the relative importance index, was used to establish the relative ranking of, among other things, the stimulus measures for increasing green building uptake in Ghana. An exploratory factor analysis was also used to classify the most significant stimulation strategies for improving green building uptake. Findings “Educational programmes relevant to GBTs for developers, contractors, and policymakers,” “sufficient information on the cost and benefits of GBTs” and “mandated green building codes and regulations” were the top three listed stimulating measures to promote increasing use of green building technologies (GBTs). The enablers were classified as follows: government regulations and policies; commitment and GB research; education and publicity; and incentives and support. Research limitations/implications The study was conducted in Ghana, a developing nation, and thus the findings and implications are peculiar to Ghana. However, the study’s findings have important practical implications for the adoption and marketing of GBCs and GBTs in other developing nations.

10.1111/joid.12217,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Sense of Classroom Community in Interior Design Studios: In-Person Learning Versus Online Learning Approaches,"Numerous studies have observed the importance of sense of community in online learning. However, developing sense of community in online interior design studios is yet to be explored. The primary purpose of this study was to assess students’ perceptions of the sense of classroom community (SCC) and learning experiences after switching their in–person to online design studios during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic. Additionally, we examined students’ characteristics that affect SCC in online learning and the impact of SCC on students’ academic motivation and comfort levels. An online survey was administered to 100 undergraduate students enrolled in design studios at an accredited interior design program at a large public U.S. institution. From this, 57 students responded to the survey. The SCC questionnaire was based on the four dimensions of Rovai's classroom community scale. Additional items included open–ended questions and students’ characteristics such as their overall grade point average (GPA), family home environment, students’ prior online learning experience, and adaptation time to the Zoom platform. The results showed that the SCC scores of four dimensions (trust, spirit, learning, interaction) were significantly less among students during their online than in–person studios. Students’ characteristics had a mixed impact on SCC dimensions. Additionally, SCC was a significant predictor of students’ academic motivation and comfort levels in online learning. The study results are important as they make a valuable contribution to the growing area of research on online learning by advancing the understanding of students’ SCC and learning in online design studios.","[{""name"": ""Linda Nubani"", ""affiliation"": [""Michigan State University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Eunsil Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Michigan State University, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/jade.12365"", ""10.1186/s41239-020-0177-7"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep3203_1"", ""10.9743/JEO.2005.2.5"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2003.tb00385.x"", ""10.46474/jds.930642"", ""10.1007/s11135-011-9549-3"", ""10.1007/s10798-008-9068-2"", ""10.1007/s10798-014-9265-0"", ""10.3390/designs4030026"", ""10.1080/10464883.1987.10758461"", ""10.1386/adch.5.3.197_1"", ""10.1002/jcop.20173"", ""10.3386/w16089"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-0719-2"", ""10.21432/cjlt27849"", ""10.1177/1474022218758231"", ""10.3368/lj.37.1.23"", ""10.4018/978-1-61350-180-1.ch009"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2007.tb00320.x"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6629(199610)24:4<431::AID-JCOP10>3.0.CO;2-T"", ""10.1007/s10798-020-09576-z"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(00)00051-0"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.342"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6629(199610)24:4<315::AID-JCOP2>3.0.CO;2-T"", ""10.1002/1520-6629(198601)14:1<6::AID-JCOP2290140103>3.0.CO;2-I"", ""10.1080/17445760.2017.1390103"", ""10.1080/0158791990200108"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.226"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00001"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00181.x"", ""10.1177/2042753015571828"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2009.11.005"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(02)00102-1"", ""10.1016/S1096-7516(02)00130-6"", ""10.1037/t86985-000"", ""10.1016/j.iheduc.2005.03.001"", ""10.1108/OHI-01-2009-B0012"", ""10.1023/A:1009609606692"", ""10.4324/9781315775173"", ""10.1097/ACM.0000000000000072"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103622"", ""10.1080/03075079.2019.1605501""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"

The tool includes rubrics for assessing production and reception activities in art education and consists of visual and text rubrics. The criteria in the rubrics are based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Visual Literacy which was developed by The European Network of Visual Literacy (ENViL). The way teachers and students use the rubrics, whether they consider them helpful and to what extent students’ self‐assessments are in line with teacher assessments was studied. It was concluded that teachers work with the rubrics intensively and both students and teachers appreciate its visual form. However, it was found that the agreement between teachers and students about the students’ scores was moderate and needed to improve. The results show that it is untrue that students, or boys in particular, overestimate their own performance in art education. The current study contributes to the development of feasible and valid assessment criteria and instruments in secondary art education.","[{""name"": ""Talita Groenendijk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Kárpáti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Folkert Haanstra"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/bmj.328.7441.702"", ""10.1007/BF00138746"", ""10.1080/02602938.2015.1018133"", ""10.1080/09695940123775"", ""10.1016/S0191-491X(98)00023-6"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2006.00468.x"", ""10.1080/03075070600572090"", ""10.1023/A:1022877405718"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2005.00441.x"", ""10.1007/BF00117714""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

The manipulation of these fabrics is an effective tool at the designer’s disposal, which can be used to create innovation in a design. This study examines the use of fabric manipulation for fostering creativity in the context of fashion design education. It explores a variety of approaches to this subject that can be employed to enthuse, stimulate, and enable beginner level fashion students to recognise the value of fabric manipulation in creating innovative fashion design outcomes. It aims to examine the potential of fabric manipulation techniques as a method to reinvent basic fabrics, reflect concept ideas on a garment, expand student skillsets and develop originality in fashion design education. A detailed analysis of the application of textile design practices in the final year of study over twelve academic semesters, in both couture and ready‐to‐wear collections, aims to determine the uptake of fabric manipulation as a major design component in the context of final year graduation fashion collections.","[{""name"": ""Angela Burns"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3642656"", ""10.5805/SFTI.2013.15.3.336"", ""10.1080/00405000008659537"", ""10.1080/17543266.2015.1026411""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

10.1386/ijia_00015_1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Records of Dispossession: Archival Thinking and UNESCO's Nubian Campaign in Egypt and Sudan,"Abstract This article discusses the creation of architectural and archaeological archives in newly independent Egypt and Sudan during the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, organized by UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). This initiative took place in the contiguous border regions of Egyptian and Sudanese Nubia from 1960 until 1980 in response to the building of the Aswan High Dam. Contingency in these archives demonstrates the necessity of acknowledging the (post-) colonial social and historical conditions in which they were produced. UNESCO's campaign sought to record ancient remains that would be submerged by the High Dam's floodwaters. During the campaign, UNESCO set up 'documentation centres' that helped codify what knowledge about Nubian architecture/archaeology might be archive-worthy, producing index cards dedicated to this purpose in Egypt (concentrating on monuments) and Sudan (centring on archaeological sites). This practice – echoed by other organizations involved in the work – was often purposefully forgetful of contemporary Nubia, whose material traces were also soon to be flooded. Nevertheless, such practices rendered visible other unauthorised histories of Nubia that subverted archival knowledge production: histories of local involvement with the campaign and now-submerged Nubian settlements. This article therefore argues that it is not only possible, but also ethically imperative, to repurpose the Nubian campaign's archives towards the acknowledgement of erased Nubian histories.","[{""name"": ""William Carruthers"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000110927967 University of East Anglia""]}]","[""10.1386/ijia_00015_1""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Space and Planetary Science']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7451), ('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.7369)]]"

While the resource constraints demand cost-efficient delivery of construction projects, many Afghan public projects experience delays and cost overruns. This study aims to evaluate various attributes and factors influencing cost performance in public construction projects in Afghanistan. Design/methodology/approach The literature review and Delphi method identified 30 cost performance attributes relevant to the context of Afghanistan. Next, a questionnaire survey was conducted with construction management professionals working in the public sector in the Afghan construction industry to evaluate these attributes. Findings This study found that the lack of resources, poor project management skills and corruption in procurement are the leading causes behind cost overruns in Afghan public projects. This study also identified five latent factors influencing cost performance in public projects in Afghanistan: competency of the project team, socioeconomic and political support, governance and public procurement, planning and risk management and project characteristics. Research limitations/implications The exploratory factor analysis did not reveal the relative significance of different cost performance success factors. Moreover, the ranking of cost performance attributes is based on the responses from the public sector construction professionals only. Practical implications The construction industry in Afghanistan significantly contributes to the country’s social and economic growth and employment. This study’s findings will help researchers, project sponsors, government departments and industry practitioners interested in improving the cost performance in Afghan public projects.

10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0280,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Perception on challenges impacting bid decision of indigenous building contractors in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania","PurposeThe acknowledged mode of securing work by contractors is through the bidding process. However, the bidding decisions undertaken by some indigenous contractors in developing countries are fraught with challenges that often engender bidding practices (such as collusion through price fixing and intentional lower bidding) and threaten business survival. Therefore, in the quest to better understand these challenges and viable advocate solutions for overcoming them, this paper aims to identify the key challenges impacting the bid decision process by small indigenous building contractors in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and establish the strength of their relationship between the pairs of key challenges.Design/methodology/approachA comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify nine challenges impacting the bid decision of indigenous building contractors in Tanzania, which were used to design a questionnaire survey. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, mean score, inferential statistics (One samplet-tests), Kendall’s concordance and correlation analysis.FindingsChallenges identified from a literature review were empirically tested using survey responses accrued from 33 participating small indigenous building contractors in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The findings illustrate that lack of liquidity, profit returns, lack of equipment, lack of experience of several works and procurement procedures are perceived as being the five most critical challenges. Project location, site accessibility and lack of labour were least critical. The major finding from the correlation analysis was the existence of the strong and positive correlation between “project location” and “site accessibility”.Research limitations/implicationsThe study is limited by its sample and geographical settings which focussed and confined the results on one country, Tanzania. However, the findings can be considered as important for other developing countries wishing to gain insights into the challenges impacting bid decisions.Practical implicationsMeasures for addressing the identified challenges impacting the bidding decisions of the indigenous small building contractors would be undertaken. The findings will enable contractors to not only reconcile the challenges with the industry and in so doing benefit both themselves and the clients but also enable them to be better prepared to deliver contractual obligations and generate socio-economic wealth. Government and policymakers will also be able to appropriately develop macro interventions for managing these challenges, which could be custom-tailored to indigenous small contractors. Finally, improving the ability of local firms to compete in the construction industry has been recognised as having the potential of advancing socio-economic development within the comity of developing countries.Originality/valueThe study enhances government, client and practitioners’ understanding of the challenges affecting the bidding practices among the indigenous building contractors in Tanzania. This area of investigation has previously been under explored particularly sub-Saharan Africa.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Chileshe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Neema Kavishe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Theo C.

10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0247,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Optimisation of government subsidies in infrastructure public-private partnerships,"Purpose This study aims to develop a Stackelberg Game Model for seeking the optimal subsidy plans with varying levels of government financial capability (GFC). Furthermore, the scenario-based analysis is conducted and will enable governments to identify a comprehensive subsidy plan as follows: improve project performance and optimise social welfare. Design/methodology/approach A Stackelberg Game Model is developed to optimise the effectiveness of subsidies on the performance of public-private partnerships (PPPs). Findings According to the scenarios that are generated from the model, governments that are confronting with limited public budgets could reduce the intensity of performance incentives and increase the participation-oriented subsidy. Whilst a participation-oriented subsidy can stimulate private organisations’ willingness to participate in infrastructure PPPs, a performance-oriented subsidy is capable of facilitating the projects’ performances. Intuitively, the performance-oriented subsidy enables the private entities of PPPs to improve their efforts on the projects to realise higher profits. However, the participation-oriented subsidy is unable to affect the level of their effort spent on the projects. To satisfy both parties’ expectations in a PPP, the performance-oriented subsidy needs to be prioritised for a purpose of enabling higher quality outputs. Practical implications The game model developed in this study contributes to the literature by offering new insight into the underlying mechanism of governments and private entities, in terms of their decision-making for subsidy planning and contributions (i.e. resource allocation and spending) during the life-cycle of PPPs. This research enriches the government subsidy model by revealing the effects of the GFC and clarifies the impacts of two different schemes of subsidy on the performance of PPPs. Originality/value The government has been conventionally viewed as being omnipotent to provide PPPs with a wide range of subsidies. However, the subsidies are not unlimited, due to GFC. In addressing this void, this study has modelled the impacts of government subsidy plans with a consideration of GFC-related constraints. The combined effects of the participation- and performance-oriented subsidies on the project performance of PPPs have been examined.","[{""name"": ""Dan Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xueqing Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lu Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Sing"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bingsheng Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000447"", ""10.1016/j.jebo.2011.10.003"", ""10.1080/01446193.2018.1467028"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.01.011"", ""10.1016/j.ijtm.2004.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.04.017"", ""10.1257/aer.103.6.2352"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(03)00004-3"", ""10.1287/mnsc.43.1.27"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2018.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2017.03.007"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2019-0063"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.05.013"", ""10.1155/2020/3928463"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2017-0030"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0195"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2017-0137"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2018-0001"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-01-2018-0012"", ""10.1016/j.cstp.2017.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.12.019"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001457"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2012.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2009.10.002"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.oep.a042114"", ""10.1111/jpet.12105"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2006.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2018.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2018.02.006"", ""10.3846/ijspm.2020.11545"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000843"", ""10.3846/1648715X.2014.971088"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02672.x"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2018.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2018.07.013"", ""10.1080/01441647.2015.1012696"", ""10.3846/jcem.2010.02""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1162/desi_a_00695,DESIGN ISSUES,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,New Design Knowledge and the Fifth Order of Design,"Abstract In this article, I examine the foundations of design knowledge and how they have been disrupted as the design discipline moves progressively away from industrial production. I consider design knowledge as a collection of different cognitive processes for developing artifacts for the human-made world. Adopting David Kolb's (1984, p.38) definition of learning as “the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience,” I discuss the change in design knowledge by examining how the characteristics of designed items have changed. Building on theories by Neri Oxman and Richard Buchanan, I identify relevant areas of design practice in which creativity is breaking free from disciplinary silos to flow between physical, digital, metaphysical, and biological layers. I then propose an updated map of the orders of design as a thinking tool and compass. I read the evolutions of design as it enters the Fifth Order of concerns, characterized by the centrality of data both as input and as output to a design process. Today, design deals with relationships and perceptions; it dialogues with people and all species ranging from machines to micro-organisms, all of which actively participate in reaching objectives. Here, design creates conversations to achieve several goals, including engagement, discovery, and decision making. Finally, I propose a shift in the traditional principles of designing, moving away from the idea of perfect solutions and toward learning systems that are good enough for now.","[{""name"": ""Marzia Mortati"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

At the same time, in this phase, project encounters the highest level of uncertainty in comparison of all phases of project lifecycle. This paper aims to support early decisions of project based on the progress forecasting. Design/methodology/approach The scope of study is limited to downstream projects of petroleum industry in Iran, and the proposed model is trained and tested based on 75 Iranian completed petroleum projects. First, types of progress curve functions are investigated, and various types are studied and the most appropriate ones are selected through curve fitting. In the next step, using questionnaire, dependent and independent variables are recognized. Finally, using historical data and s-curve generator functions, a fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based model have been developed to support early phases decision-making processes. Findings Based on the analysis of received questionnaires, six functional criteria in two groups as dependent variables and 25 independent variables, in two groups and four clusters are determined and categorized. Eventually, performance prediction model of a project has been developed by using Adaptive Nero Fuzzy Inference System. Originality/value The main contribution of this study to construction management knowledge is categorizing two groups of variables, which first one defines the project dynamic and the other calculates the key effects on previous one. Also, this investigation improves the current knowledge by analyzing the project system from the dynamic behavior perspective and modeling the defined variables using ANFIS tools.","[{""name"": ""Amir Faraji"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1992)118:3(525)"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.06.006"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001797"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)00069-6"", ""10.1002/pmj.20269"", ""10.2307/3250929"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:1(25)"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.12.005"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2007.00500.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.02.006"", ""10.1108/09699980410570166"", ""10.1007/s12205-014-0139-5"", ""10.1139/cjce-2018-0305"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2007.00478.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2015.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.03.011"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2007)133:6(425)"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2017.06.001"", ""10.1109/21.256541"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000018"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001515"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2007.12.048"", ""10.5465/amr.2011.0004"", ""10.3390/su12062347"", ""10.3390/app10062071"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)00040-4"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.07.093"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(01)00039-4"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:6(878)"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(97)00002-2"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-04-2016-0010"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00087-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2018.01.008"", ""10.14256/JCE.714.2012"", ""10.1108/09699980410512656"", ""10.1061/9780784413517.111"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2010.07.024"", ""10.1016/j.scient.2011.03.026"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.02.042"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.03.015"", ""10.1016/j.eiar.2017.04.004"", ""10.1002/smj.694""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2020-0020,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Multi-objective mathematical model based on fuzzy hybrid multi-criteria decision-making and FMEA approach for the risks of oil and gas projects,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing risk factors in oil and gas projects. Design/methodology/approach This paper consists of several sections. In the first section, 19 common potential risks in the projects of Pars Oil and Gas Company were finalized in six groups using the Lawshe validation method. These factors were identified through previous literature review and interviews with experts. Then, using the “best-worst multi-criteria decision-making” method, the study measured the weights associated with the performance evaluation indicators of each risk. Consequently, failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and the grey relational analysis (GRA)-VIKOR mixed method were used to rank and determine the critical risks. Finally, to assign response strategies to each critical risk, a zero-one multi-objective mathematical programming model was proposed and developed Epsilon-constraint method was used to solve it. Findings Given the typical constraints of projects which are time, cost and quality, of the projects that companies are often faced with, this study presents the identified risks of oil and gas projects to the managers of the oil and gas company in accordance with the priority given in the present research and the response to each risk is also suggested to be used by managers based on their organizational circumstances. Originality/value This study aims at qualitative management of cost risks of oil and gas projects (case study of Pars Oil and Gas Company) by combining FMEA, best worst and GRA-VIKOR methods under fuzzy environment and Epsilon constraints. According to studies carried out in previous studies, the simultaneous management of quantitative and qualitative cost of risk of oil and gas projects in Iran has not been carried out and the combination of these methods has also been innovated.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Khalilzadeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rose Balafshan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ashkan Hafezalkotob"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.shaw.2017.05.004"", ""10.2118/171722-PA"", ""10.2118/0413-0019-OGF"", ""10.1080/00207543.2014.919423"", ""10.1016/S0165-0114(97)00377-1"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2009.05.037"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.10.018"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.10.017"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.03.051"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001486"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2014.11.009"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.06.006"", ""10.1016/S0165-0114(98)00122-5"", ""10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X""]",['Decision Sciences'],"['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)]]"

It describes how the disneyfied main part of the UNESCO heritage site of universal values turned into a ghost town as functional changes were turning into physical ones amid restrictions. From the results of pre-pandemic processes (that, as we argue, turned the city into its disneyfied version), to the lockdown (that later revealed itself to be but the first one in a row), to the post-lockdown recovery, these changes are presented in modified figure-ground diagrams with accessibility being defined by both tangible and intangible properties. The results are set against the background of the city’s current policies regarding economic recovery, mobility and accessibility to urban green areas. As an attempt to address the present vulnerability of the once resilient historic city centres—of which Kraków Old Town is a luminous example—this paper tends to be a voice in the debate on the post-2020 planning and the strategies we will need to face the subsequent waves of this, or other, pandemics as well as consequences of climate change.","[{""name"": ""Anna Porębska"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Krzysztof Barnaś"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bartosz Dendura"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olga Kania"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marta Łukasik"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aleksandra Rogulska"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ernestyna Szpakowska-Loranc"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Miłosz Zieliński"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.oneear.2020.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139612"", ""10.1111/1467-954X.00161"", ""10.1057/s41289-019-00082-w"", ""10.1057/s41289-018-0070-3"", ""10.1016/j.ijdrr.2014.02.001"", ""10.3390/su13063071"", ""10.1016/j.econmod.2015.10.049"", ""10.22034/ijumes.2019.4.10.035"", ""10.4324/9780429450044"", ""10.3390/ijerph17072359"", ""10.6092/1970-9870/6971"", ""10.5822/978-1-61091-525-0"", ""10.31219/osf.io/rf7xa"", ""10.1057/s41289-020-00136-4"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2020.102746"", ""10.1080/01944360608976728"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.11.011"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/471/9/092031"", ""10.1108/IJTC-12-2018-0107"", ""10.3390/su12145539"", ""10.1080/13604813.2018.1548819"", ""10.1016/j.jdmm.2018.01.011"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142391"", ""10.1177/1206331220938628"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.12381"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/245/6/062037""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Living with Buildings (2018) was organised by the Wellcome Trust to trace the changing landscape of health and architecture, setting out to show how connections between the ways we feel and the places in which we spend our lives have historically evolved as our ideas about health and disease have changed. Taking our cue from the pieces at the exhibition, we discuss how the eighteenth century saw the emergence of an imaginary of cleanliness linked to miasma theory, locating bad smells and odours as the origin of disease and resulting in the adoption of rituals of purification in buildings. Treatments of plastering, coating and whitewashing popularised in the nineteenth century are testament to a shift from olfactory to visual codes of hygiene and to the ‘antibiotic turn’ in architecture.We extend the historical analysis to suggest that architecture finds itself at a crossroads. Although there is a growing understanding of how much architecture influences our wellbeing, architectural thought still clings to the antibiotic turn. Following the tradition of exchange between architecture and medicine, we propose the notion of Probiotic Architecture as a way of framing the shifting understanding of health in architectural design, suggesting that the microorganisms that colonise humans (the human microbiome) and our built environment (the built environment microbiome) have the potential to influence our health and the resilience of our buildings. Against the backdrop of the design research project Niches for Organic Territories in Bio-Augmented Design (NOTBAD), we suggest the need to reverse notions that all microbes are bad, to and propose instead materials and prototypes that encourage benign microbial growth.","[{""name"": ""Carolina Ramirez-Figueroa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Richard Beckett"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Medicine'],"['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)]]"

Considering the urgent need for rethinking how humans relate to nature, in this article we present a MA level course in the context of art, craft and design to discuss how learning with the natural environment approach can impact learning experiences. We introduce walking with nature as a creative method that fosters students’ ability to let the environment actively shape their creative events. The encounter with nature‐based materials in their different forms and following the material's flow provides students with a foundation for their creative processes. This study proposes that walking can facilitate the entanglement between the student's knowledge and encountered materials, generating an emotional and dialogical relationship with the natural environment that contributes to a holistic learning experience. We propose that such an experience can help in comprehending the importance of the caring actions we need to take and maintain towards the nonhuman world.","[{""name"": ""Maarit Mäkelä"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bilge Merve Aktaş"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.21606/drs.2020.229"", ""10.4135/9781446278925.n9"", ""10.1215/9780822391623"", ""10.1037/13620-004"", ""10.1007/s11097-019-09629-2"", ""10.4324/9780203020920"", ""10.4324/9781315813714"", ""10.1111/jade.12109"", ""10.1386/crre.6.1.57_1"", ""10.1177/1359183504046896"", ""10.4324/9780203559055"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.559"", ""10.1007/978-981-19-4855-8_7"", ""10.1386/crre_00064_1"", ""10.1386/adch.16.2.241_1"", ""10.7577/formakademisk.1818"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-74711-8_2"", ""10.1386/vi.3.1.21_1""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0109,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Ghana's green building assessment journey: an appraisal of the thermal performance of an office building in Accra,"Purpose Accra, the capital city of Ghana, is seeing high-rise buildings springing up with extensive glazing. Given the challenges of the country concerning energy provision, guaranteeing comfort in buildings and sustainability aspects, this trend is questionable and worrying in this pandemic era. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate how glazing types and their properties could reduce cooling loads and provide comfort by following the recommendations set by the Ghana Green Building Council (GHGBC) after the Green Star of South Africa, as well as other references found in literature. Design/methodology/approach Indoor thermal conditions were monitored to evaluate prevailing indoor conditions. Using a simulation application, various options were probed based on the Green recommendations and others found in literature to improve thermal comfort within the structure. Moreover, a questionnaire survey with observation was undertaken with 250 architects to understand the basis of decisions taken when specifying glazing for buildings. Findings The results indicate that cooling loads increased by 2% when the GHGBC after the Green Star of South Africa recommendations were applied. However, the use of the recommendations of previous research conducted in Ghana could reduce cooling loads by 38% to save energy. Suggested strategies of air velocity up to 1.0 m/s as well as thermal mass, comfort ventilation, conventional dehumidification and air-conditioning were found to be means to improve indoor comfort. Furthermore, the architects revealed that around 40% of multi-storey buildings are 70%–100% glazed. Of all the buildings, 62.4% was found to be glazed with single pane windows, making them use so much energy in cooling. Additionally, the survey underlined the client’s preference, cost and functionality as the three main bases for the choice of glazing in multi-storey office buildings. Originality/value A significant contribution of this study to the body of knowledge is the provision of empirical evidence to support the fact that due to climate difference, each country needs to undertake more experimental research works to be able to come out with standards that work. Thus, the GHGBC after the Green Star of South Africa does not necessarily work within the climatic context of Ghana.","[{""name"": ""Christian Koranteng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Barbara Simons"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kwabena Abrokwa Gyimah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jimmy Nkrumah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.692.27"", ""10.1177/1420326X11411235"", ""10.1080/00038628.1988.9697267"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.10.057"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.09.021"", ""10.3844/ajassp.2009.1973.1980"", ""10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00011-7"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.10.009"", ""10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00011-7"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/20140301026"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2005.06.013"", ""10.1016/S0378-7788(00)00050-5"", ""10.2298/FUACE1301035S"", ""10.1016/S0003-682X(00)00032-3"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2006.06.015"", ""10.1177/096032719202400203"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2011.06.016""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/jade.12429,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Gender-Based Differences in Academic Achievement in a University Design Program,"AbstractThere is a significant amount of research into gender differences in academic performance in the science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) fields. This has identified important differences between the academic achievement of men and women as measured through grade point averages and time to completion. However, the specific STEM fields of design have not been thoroughly explored. This research investigates the long‐term academic performance of a large group of architecture, industrial design, interior design and landscape architecture students at a major Australian university. The study followed the progress of 472 students over an 11‐year period. In most fields the academic achievement of students follows expected patterns; the difference in academic grades for male and female students reduces over time. However, in interior design, there are significant differences that increase with time, to the favour of women. A range of social, cultural and contextual influences are discussed including the signature pedagogy of the design studio and the hidden curriculum of design education.","[{""name"": ""Philip Crowther"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sarah Briant"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1207/s15326934crj1204_11"", ""10.1080/10668926.2016.1179606"", ""10.1002/j.2162-6057.2008.tb01289.x"", ""10.1080/01411920802642322"", ""10.1093/oxrep/graa050"", ""10.1086/228943"", ""10.1007/s10734-007-9065-5"", ""10.1111/jade.12329"", ""10.1016/j.learninstruc.2007.02.007"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.205"", ""10.1080/10464883.1987.10758461"", ""10.1080/09540253.2018.1513455"", ""10.1177/1521025119866689"", ""10.1080/09540253.2021.1947472"", ""10.1080/09518390500224887"", ""10.1080/09540253.2020.1775168"", ""10.1007/s10212-011-0099-9"", ""10.1080/09540253.2016.1262007"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0165037"", ""10.1080/0958517990100205"", ""10.3389/feduc.2019.00060"", ""10.19030/tlc.v5i7.1242"", ""10.1080/09540253.2018.1471198"", ""10.1007/s10459-008-9103-9"", ""10.2190/6841-42JX-X170-8177"", ""10.1080/0307507032000122305"", ""10.1111/gwao.12249"", ""10.1007/s11199-020-01155-9"", ""10.5539/jedp.v2n2p105"", ""10.1353/csd.2006.0013"", ""10.1162/0011526054622015"", ""10.1080/01425692.2014.987728"", ""10.1080/03075079.2014.974528"", ""10.1080/13600800500120142"", ""10.1353/jhe.2007.0019"", ""10.46504/14201901wa"", ""10.4018/jicte.2007010103"", ""10.21061/jte.v16i2.a.4"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2006.00495.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0281,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Fuzzy uncertainty and its applications in reinforced concrete structures,"Purpose The aim of this paper is mainly to handle the fuzzy uncertainties present in structures appropriately. In general, uncertainties of variables are classified as aleatory and epistemic. The different sources of uncertainties in reinforced concrete structures include the randomness, mathematical models, physical models, environmental factors and gross errors. The effects of imprecise data in reinforced concrete structures are studied here by using fuzzy concepts. The aim of this paper is mainly to handle the uncertainties of variables with unclear boundaries. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the intended objective, the reinforced concrete beam subjected to flexure and shear was designed as per Euro Code (EC2). Then, different design parameters such as corrosion parameters, material properties and empirical expressions of time-dependent material properties were identified through a thorough literature review. Findings The fuzziness of variables was identified, and their membership functions were generated by using the heuristic method and drawn by MATLAB R2018a software. In addition to the identification of fuzziness of variables, the study further extended to design optimization of reinforced concrete structure by using fuzzy relation and fuzzy composition. Originality/value In the design codes of the concrete structure, the concrete grades such as C16/20, C20/25, C25/30, C30/37 and so on are provided and being adopted for design in which the intermediate grades are not considered, but using fuzzy concepts the intermediate grades of concrete can be recognized by their respective degree of membership. In the design of reinforced concrete structure using fuzzy relation and composition methods, the optimum design is considered when the degree of membership tends to unity. In addition to design optimization, the level of structural performance evaluation can also be carried out by using fuzzy concepts.","[{""name"": ""Utino Worabo Woju"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A.S.

10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0504,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Fraud in higher education: a system for detection and prevention,"Purpose Academic corruption and fraudulent practices have become problematic in recent years. Governments around the world have introduced dedicated higher education commissions to regulate higher education providers. The purpose of this paper is to design a system for the detection and prevention framework of fraudulent behaviour in higher education. Design/methodology/approach This paper performs a survey on academic misconduct practices and expands the survey by analysing the accreditation process. This study further identifies common corrupt practices in the accreditation process with reference to particular accreditation standards or laws. If the accreditation process is as thorough as, this paper is led to believe, a higher institute may stop being compliant immediately after the accreditation process. playing a catch-me-if-you-can at the next accreditation cycle. The survey of the accreditation process and identification of corrupt practices lead to an identification of preventative and detective measures. Findings The review of accreditation procedures and conditions identifies that fraudulent practices can occur at every part of any policy and procedure. The framework prevents repudiation and allows for spontaneous investigations internally and externally. The blockchain prevented changes to the system and allow for auditing of changes. A system such as this could suppress accreditation fraud and minimise its corrupt impact. Not to mention identify with relative ease the severity and life of corrupt practice. Originality/value Contributions are made in the framework for detecting and preventing corrupt practices in Higher Education using blockchain immutable transactions. This enables real-time accreditation compliance checks and monitoring of conditions. External complaints or reviews can be conducted with minimum interactions from higher education providers.","[{""name"": ""Tony de Souza-Daw"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Robert Ross"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09540253.2015.1103842"", ""10.1038/499284c"", ""10.2304/rcie.2008.3.4.345"", ""10.1086/695833""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It is believed that an individual’s EI level (EIL) is a predictor of the preferred CM styles (CMS). This study aims to explore the relationships between EIL, preferred CMS and demographic factors in the construction sector of the Dominican Republic (DR). Design/methodology/approach The EIL and CMS of a sample of civil engineers in managerial positions were evaluated using the emotional intelligence appraisal and Rahim Organizational Conflict Inventory-II self-assessment tools. Findings There was a strong positive correlation between the rated EIL and the scores of collaboration and compromise styles, i.e. participants with higher EIL have stronger fit within the collaboration and compromise styles of managing conflicts. For participants with lower EIL, collaboration and compromise styles were also top preferences, but with no statistical significance. Significant relationships existed between gender, collaboration and compromise styles and between work experience and collaboration style. No significant relationship between demographics and EIL. Practical implications The construction industry needs innovative construction managers whose CMS and EIL are compatible with the culture and overall organisational objectives.

10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0403,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Evaluating the key risk factors in PPP-procured mass housing projects in Nigeria: a Delphi study of industry experts,"Purpose The purpose of the study is to elicit risk factors that are peculiar to public-private partnership (PPP)-procured mass housing in Nigeria from the expert perspectives in ensuring the success of the scheme thereby reducing housing deficit in the country. Design/methodology/approach The risk inherent in construction projects had been established through literature in general. The risk in PPP projects is emerging because of the recent acceptance of the procurement option by governments all over the globe. The Nigerian Government has also adopted the procurement option in bridging the housing deficit in the country. This study, therefore, conducts a Delphi survey on the probability of risk occurrence peculiar to PPP mass housing projects (MHPs) in Nigeria. Pragmatic research approach through the mixed method of both quantitative and qualitative methods was adopted for this study. The quantitative method adopts the administration of questionnaires through the Delphi survey, whereas the qualitative method used interviews with the respondents. A two-stage Delphi questionnaire was administered to construction practitioners that cut across academics, the public and the private sectors by adopting convenient sampling techniques and following the Delphi principles and procedures. A total of 63 risk factors were submitted to the expert to rank on a Likert scale of 7 and any risk factors that the mean item score (MIS) falls below the grading scale of the five-point benchmark is deemed not necessary a risk factor associated with PPP MHPs and thereby expunged from the second round of the Delphi Survey. The interview was subsequently applied to the respondents to substantiate the risk factors that are peculiar to PPP-procured mass housing in the study area. Findings The findings show that risk factors such as maintenance frequent than expected, life of facility shorter than anticipated and maintenance cost higher than expected fall below 5.0 benchmark with MIS of 4.64 and 4.55 indicating that the risk factors are not peculiar to PPP mass housing in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications The implication for practise of this research is that these risk factors provide the PPP stakeholders with the comprehensive checklists that can aid in developing PPP risk assessment guidelines in the sector though both partners should be aware of the dynamic nature of risk because new ones might be emerging.

This paper introduces and discusses a tool named Environment-based life cycle decomposition (eLCD) to adapt the Environment-based Design (EBD) methodology to sustainable design. The eLCD brings to EBD three major features: 1) a holistic environment structure for sustainable conceptual design, 2) an effective and efficient tool for collecting information for sustainability decision-making, and 3) an analysis tool that takes sustainability as an integral part of the design rather than as a burden. The environment of a product is everything except the product itself, which can be defined in three dimensions, namely, environment types, life cycle events, and life cycle time. The environment types are designated as natural, built (including physical artifact and digital artifact), economic, and social environment. The eLCD provides an effective template for information collection to support the design decision-making process. The effectiveness of eLCD is demonstrated by its application to the upscaling of a wind turbine, where an energy storage system is introduced to make full use of wind energy with the least waste in serving the electricity demand.","[{""name"": ""Jiami Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1M8""]}, {""name"": ""Yong Zeng"", ""affiliation"": [""Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1M8""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen Ekwaro-Osire"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas 79409, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Abraham Nispel"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas 79409, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Hua Ge"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Building, Civil, and Environmental Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1M8""]}]",[],['Environmental Science'],['Environmental Engineering'],"[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

It shares the findings of an eco‐art project that took place in the framework of an environmental education course, where the undergraduate students were encouraged to create eco‐art pieces, to investigate environmental problems/issues through art and to communicate their findings with the class. The research reflects on students' artworks and reveals the environmental problems and issues that were important for them. Furthermore, it discusses four dimensions of students' ecological consciousness that emerged: a) criticism for the ecological crisis and overconsumption, b) human‐nature relationship, c) empathy for nonhuman beings and d) vision of an ecological future.

10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0224,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Effect of the transversal-spacing of stirrup-legs on the behavior and strength of shallow concealed RC beams,"Purpose Shallow concealed reinforced concrete (RC) beams (wide beams) make parts of a structure and are used in the construction industry, especially in ribbed and waffle slab systems. They are designed based on the requirements and provisions of structural codes of practice, which are applicable for shallow dropped RC beams (narrow beams). The main concern in regard to the behavior of these shallow concealed RC beams is transversal-spacing of stirrup-legs across their width. This paper aims to investigate the transversal-spacing of stirrups-legs (Sw) for two shallow concealed RC beams, namely, WB-SC and WB-EC. Design/methodology/approach The beams are tested under a three point-loading system. Their design has been performed to the SBC304 for beam WB-SC (Saudi Building Code for concrete structures) and comparison to EC2 for beam WB-EC (Eurocode-2 for concrete structures) is addressed in terms of flexural and shear strength design requirements. Experimental behavior and results of both beams are analyzed and conclusions are provided; also, a comparison of these codes is performed. Both beams had dimensions of 3,400 mm length, 700 mm width and 350 mm height. Findings Experimentally, beam WB-SC failed in flexure while beam WB-EC failed shear. The investigation concludes in favor of a safer design for SBC304 Code compared to EC2 Code for designing shallow concealed RC beams. Originality/value This study recommends that the transversal-spacing of stirrups-legs of these beams has an influence on their strength and behavior and should not exceed the lesser of 0.56(d) or 170 mm (6.7 in.).","[{""name"": ""Ayed Eid Alluqmani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1985)111:2(353)"", ""10.1680/jstbu.15.00124"", ""10.1016/j.hbrcj.2013.05.011"", ""10.1680/macr.2002.54.3.181"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000408""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1386/adch_00015_1,ART DESIGN & COMMUNICATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION,1305 Design,Educating relational thinking to improve design creativity,Developing the creativity of design students is widely considered to be an important goal in design education. Finding effective training and instruction to improve creativity is a challenging subject for design educators and researchers. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of relational thinking training on creativity of design ideas in an analogical design task. The proposed training consisted of three steps: finding relations between two sources; the characteristics of each source; and relations between a new idea and the sources. The participants were 45 second-year architectural design students. The results indicated that the training significantly improved the quality of design ideas and significantly changed the type of similarity that designers established between source and design idea from literal similarity to analogical similarity. We concluded that stimulating relational thinking of design students by an educational training is an effective way in design education to improve the design creativity.,"[{""name"": ""Leyla Alipour"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406127950 University of Tehran""]}]","[""10.1002/jocb.37"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2013.10.002"", ""10.1080/00220973.2014.963216"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2017.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2008.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2015.01.002"", ""10.1002/j.2162-6057.2011.tb01086.x"", ""10.1002/j.2162-6057.2011.tb01092.x"", ""10.1068/b35073"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00032-5"", ""10.1068/b2565"", ""10.1115/1.4004396"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2015.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2013.02.002"", ""10.3758/BF03195939"", ""10.1509/jmkr.39.1.47.18930"", ""10.1007/s10648-013-9224-4"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2016.05.002"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog0702_3"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.52.1.45"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(80)90013-4"", ""10.1109/64.590078"", ""10.1002/j.2162-6057.2011.tb01088.x"", ""10.1080/21650349.2013.799309"", ""10.1386/adch.10.1.7_1"", ""10.1115/1.4024976"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.52.1.35"", ""10.1037/edu0000070"", ""10.1016/0142-694X(91)90003-F"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2008.07.001"", ""10.1002/acp.1699"", ""10.1115/1.4006145"", ""10.1115/1.4001110"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2013.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2012.11.006"", ""10.1080/09544820600679679"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2011.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2005.05.002"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(02)00034-0"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2014.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2015.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2010.08.001"", ""10.1017/S0890060414000043"", ""10.1007/BF01199293"", ""10.1386/adch_00015_1""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The Museum, Art and Wellbeing project undertook a participatory arts‐based approach to investigate how the assets of a large public institution such as Museums Victoria, Australia could reach out and engage different community groups. The seniors came from a local University of the Third Age (U3A) which offers a wide range of classes but does not usually engage with primary schools. Children at the primary school engage in art learning and separate wellbeing learning but these age‐stage sessions, as designated to incremental year levels, had not previously included direct involvement of seniors in learning activities. For both groups, the connection to Victoria’s state museums is marked by previous occasional one‐off visits. Museum resources have not been considered as ongoing assets for wellbeing that link to the local community in the way that this project does. The university’s role in brokering such connections by deploying often ignored human/institutional assets to support health and strengthen community has been explored in papers by fellow researchers, Justen O’Connor and Laura Alfrey. Our enquiry is extended in this article by focusing on how art education, specifically art‐making, and intergenerational learning can strengthen community and enhance wellbeing across school and community‐based educational contexts and museums.","[{""name"": ""Geraldine Burke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Alfrey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clare Hall"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Justen O’Connor"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13573322.2020.1814715"", ""10.1093/heapro/11.1.11"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq.8"", ""10.1215/9780822391623"", ""10.1177/160940691101000107"", ""10.4324/9781315579641"", ""10.1080/00043125.2017.1274196"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-61560-8_7"", ""10.4324/9780203872956-7"", ""10.1080/15350771003741899"", ""10.1080/14733285.2017.1409884"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-04600-6_6"", ""10.4324/9781315718002"", ""10.1016/j.healthplace.2019.05.004"", ""10.1080/02568543.2014.912995"", ""10.1177/1077800405280696"", ""10.1080/09647775.2015.1008390""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"
10.1111/jade.12373,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Doing Research-Creation in School: Keeping an Eye on the Ball,"AbstractThis article explores the potential of the idea of ‘research‐creation’ when working with children making films in the context of a project that explored children’s experience of school. The proposition of the article is that rather than see children’s work as something to be discussed or extracted from, if it is seen as ‘the work’ it is differently situated. In the article, an artist and an ethnographer explore the potential of artistic methodologies in working collaboratively with children. The article describes this process and engages with an interdisciplinary lens to explore the nature of this kind of work.

10.1111/jade.12321,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,"Discovery from Discomfort; Embracing the Liminal in Auto-Ethnographic, Biographical and Arts-Based Research Methods","AbstractIn this article I offer reflections on my experiences of using autoethnographic and arts‐based methodology in order to research within the realm of arts education. This approach enabled me to deeply analyse my own lived‐experiences and interact with the work and responses of others. Liminal spaces between identities of artist, researcher and teacher are explored through the creation of artwork, using discarded and leftover marks found in the classroom or recorded through the lens of a camera. Zones of discovery emerge from embracing initial discomfort. The images and photographs used throughout this research project, alongside the glimpses into both my own and interviewees’ lives, professional and personal, generate stories that begin to create a larger narrative. It has been recognised that stories can be found in moments and the visual representations offered by participants and through my own mark‐making and recording frame these moments. Ideas and findings were recorded as they emerged using a research journal and sketchbook, intentionally accepting my own contribution to the research, building on this, as opposed to pretending, that our interests and ways of making sense of others is, or should be, divorced from the people and experiences we are. This approach provided rich insights. Through shared experiences I felt that there was the space and opportunity for collaboratively generating meaning with participants as ideas, feelings and issues were clarified, mapped and negotiated through discussion, using both image and word.","[{""name"": ""Emma Sutton"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0038038509351616"", ""10.1177/1077800407304509"", ""10.5406/visuartsrese.38.2.0006"", ""10.4135/9780857028990"", ""10.1177/1077800405280696""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Music', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2023-0328,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Development of workplace well-being indexes at construction sites,"Purpose This study aims to develop workplace well-being indexes for construction sites of different project types (infrastructure, high-rise and low-rise). Accordingly, the study objectives are to identify the critical factors that affect workplace well-being at construction sites, compare the critical factors between different project types, categorize the critical factors into subgroups and compute indexes for the critical factors and subgroups. Design/methodology/approach Data from a systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews with construction industry professionals were used to extract 19 potential factors that affect workplace well-being. Then, a structured questionnaire survey was distributed, and 169 valid responses were collected. Finally, the data were analyzed using normalized mean analysis, agreement analysis, factor analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation. Findings The study findings revealed that there are 11, 11, 8 and 12 critical factors across overall infrastructure, high-rise and low-rise construction projects. Out of those, six critical factors are overlapping across project types, including “general safety and health monitoring,” “salary package,” “timeline of salary payment,” “working hours,” “communication between workers” and “planning of the project.” Accordingly, the critical factors can be categorized into two subgroups within each project type. Finally, the development of indexes shows that infrastructure construction projects have the greatest index compared to other project types. Originality/value This study contributes to filling the current knowledge gap by developing workplace well-being indexes at construction sites across different project types. The indexes would assist decision-makers in understanding the current state of workplace well-being. This increases the commitment and recognition of well-being across different construction project types.","[{""name"": ""Mazen M.

Thus, this study aims to bridge that gap. Design/methodology/approach The study conducted a review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and adopted interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to analyse and prioritise the drivers. Findings Eighteen drivers were identified and grouped into five, namely, policy instruments, bid-related, cost and risk, education and training, and reward and penalty drivers. The ISM revealed two hierarchical levels of the drivers with only higher cost of electricity/fuel on the higher level, making it the most important driver that could influence others. Practical implications The study presents an overview of decarbonisation drivers in the literature and would be of benefit to the government and stakeholders towards achieving net zero emissions in the construction industry. Originality/value The findings of the study present drivers of carbon reduction and prioritise and categorise them for tailored interventions within the construction sector. Also, it could serve as foundational knowledge for further study in the construction process decarbonisation research area.","[{""name"": ""Suhaib Arogundade"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Dulaimi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saheed Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdullahi Saka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olusegun Ilori"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.793"", ""10.3390/buildings13071780"", ""10.1038/s41558-017-0031-7"", ""10.1080/09613218.2014.894747"", ""10.1038/nclimate1767"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.04.028"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.12.007"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000738"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2016.06.013"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.023"", ""10.1080/14693062.2020.1730151"", ""10.1080/14693062.2020.1867491"", ""10.1108/SASBE-11-2012-0059"", ""10.3141/2139-20"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000127"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.036"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.02.044"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.044"", ""10.1108/01443579410062086"", ""10.3141/2079-08"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.070"", ""10.1007/s12053-018-9722-9"", ""10.1080/09613218.2021.2023350"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2019.101356"", ""10.1007/s12053-016-9430-2"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114848"", ""10.1108/CI-09-2019-0087"", ""10.1108/SASBE-05-2013-0028"", ""10.1007/s40171-012-0008-3"", ""10.5089/9781513595405.001"", ""10.1007/s12053-018-9670-4"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.11.004"", ""10.1080/01446191003674519""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2019-0337,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Day-ahead load forecasting using improved grey Verhulst model,"Purpose In the daily energy dispatch process in a power system, accurate short-term electricity load forecasting is a very important tool used by spot market players. It is a critical requirement for optimal generator unit commitment, economic dispatch, system security and stability assessment, contingency and ancillary services management, reserve setting, demand side management, system maintenance and financial planning in power systems. The purpose of this study is to present an improved grey Verhulst electricity load forecasting model. Design/methodology/approach To test the effectiveness of the proposed model for short-term load forecast, studies made use of Kenya’s load demand data for the period from January 2014 to June 2019. Findings The convectional grey Verhulst forecasting model yielded a mean absolute percentage error of 7.82 per cent, whereas the improved model yielded much better results with an error of 2.96 per cent. Practical implications In the daily energy dispatch process in a power system, accurate short-term load forecasting is a very important tool used by spot market players. It is a critical ingredient for optimal generator unit commitment, economic dispatch, system security and stability assessment, contingency and ancillary services management, reserve setting, demand side management, system maintenance and financial planning in power systems. The fact that the model uses actual Kenya’s utility data confirms its usefulness in the practical world for both economic planning and policy matters. Social implications In terms of generation and transmission investments, proper load forecasting will enable utilities to make economically viable decisions. It forms a critical cog of the strategic plans for power utilities and other market players to avoid a situation of heavy stranded investment that adversely impact the final electricity prices and the other extreme scenario of expensive power shortages. Originality/value This research combined the use of natural logarithm and the exponential weighted moving average to improve the forecast accuracy of the grey Verhulst forecasting model.","[{""name"": ""Ariel Mutegi Mbae"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nnamdi I.

10.1111/jade.12295,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Creative Arts Personal Pedagogy vs Marketised Higher Education: A battle between values,"AbstractThe ongoing marketisation of higher education in England can be understood both conceptually – in terms of its ideological commitment to competition and accountability; and practically – in terms of the way that it has altered higher education structurally in a variety of ways. Methods of standardisation and quantification offer validation and reward to institutions through criteria aligned with marketised principles, leading to institutions shaping their operations to suit these forms of justification. Historically, many arts subjects have operated conceptually and organisationally outside the traditional higher education paradigm, and pedagogic approaches and values that are attributable to this subject area could clash with marketised understandings of education, which are becoming more prevalent and influential.This article presents analysis of reflections from creative arts educational practitioners working within higher education institutions in England on explorations of an ontology of the creative arts, as well as experiences of the marketisation process. A series of values relating to the concept of ‘the personal’, inherent to the creative arts are discussed and an exploration of how these principles clash with the priorities of the marketised educational economy are articulated. The values and principles that are inherent to educators and practitioners working in the creative arts are competing with ‘marketised’ motives imposed on them by the institutions in which they work.","[{""name"": ""Ryan Gerald Wilkinson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/j.ctt1t88xk3"", ""10.1057/sub.2014.22"", ""10.1111/jade.12042"", ""10.1007/s10798-005-2110-8"", ""10.1108/10610420710740034"", ""10.1080/03075079.2015.1127908"", ""10.4324/9781315715421"", ""10.1080/13576280050074543"", ""10.1108/00400911011050954"", ""10.1386/adch.13.1.3_2"", ""10.1177/1532708609341169"", ""10.1386/jwcp.2.2.209/1"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199283262.001.0001"", ""10.2304/eerj.2006.5.1.1"", ""10.1080/13562510902898841"", ""10.1177/1474022216652765"", ""10.1080/02680930500108718"", ""10.1080/13562517.2016.1213229"", ""10.1080/07294360903384269"", ""10.1080/13562517.2011.611875"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2013.01753.x"", ""10.1002/berj.3512"", ""10.1080/01425692.2015.1113856"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2011.01722.x"", ""10.1080/13538320701629186"", ""10.1080/03075079.2013.806465""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2019-0170,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Concept evaluation in new product development A set-based method utilizing rapid prototyping and physical modelling,"Purpose This paper proposes the combination of rapid prototyping and physical modelling as a set-based concept evaluation method in the early stage of new product development. Design/methodology/approach The concept evaluation method is applied in a case study of a new metal additive manufacturing process for aluminium, where a set of four extruder concepts has been modelled and evaluated. Rapid prototyping was used to produce plastic models of the different designs, and plasticine feedstock material was used to physically model the metal flow during operation. Finally, the selected concept has been verified in full-scale for processing of aluminium feedstock material. Findings The proposed method led to several valuable insights on critical factors that were unknown at the outset of the development project. Overall, these insights enabled concept exploration and concept selection that led to a substantially better solution than the original design. Research limitations/implications This method can be applied for other projects where numerical approaches are not applicable or capable, and where the costs or time required for producing full-scale prototypes are high. Practical implications Employing this method can enable a more thorough exploration of the design space, allowing new solutions to be discovered.

This influence is reflected both in the increasingly efficient ecological performance of built structures and the growing array of related technologies, and in the aesthetic expression of these environmentally conscious designs. The aesthetic expression of sustainability concept and values is sometimes referred to as sustainability aesthetics. The aim of this research is to develop and test a methodological framework for characterizing the sustainability aesthetics of the built environments. The elaborated methodological framework integrates biophilic design, sustainability aesthetics, regenerative design and genius loci as the most promising approaches, allowing the integration of human and environmental concerns. To test the framework, we selected historic built environments that reflect long-lasting sustainable co-existence between humans and their environment and represent hybrid characteristics of both architectural and urban space. One of the purposes selecting these environments for the case study was to determine the features of an organically evolved sustainability aesthetics that could become a valuable source of inspiration for architectural design and management of the built environments.","[{""name"": ""Aurelija Daugelaite"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Huriye Armagan Dogan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Indre Grazuleviciute-Vileniske"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.11.018"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2013.01.008"", ""10.26687/archnet-ijar.v8i2.436"", ""10.5860/choice.47-3556"", ""10.1016/j.cortex.2020.01.009"", ""10.1080/096132199369354"", ""10.7202/1035398ar"", ""10.1111/j.0031-806x.2004.00167.x"", ""10.2495/sc140031"", ""10.1080/09613218.2012.628548"", ""10.4324/9780203646724"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104119"", ""10.2298/spat2145079g"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/409/1/012001"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/213/1/012016"", ""10.22545/2011/00014"", ""10.1177/2373379917719729"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2012.09.003"", ""10.1080/01426390701773854"", ""10.1080/13602360701865373"", ""10.26687/archnet-ijar.v9i2.464"", ""10.1080/09613218.2014.979082"", ""10.3846/1392-1630.2009.33.270-278"", ""10.1088/1757-899x/890/1/012013"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199584451.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2019.07.001"", ""10.1007/s10970-005-6157-0""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Environmental Science']","['Archeology', 'Building and Construction', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

The human-centered design of public spaces around subway stations is a critical issue in TOD. In this study, a socio-technical system-based perspective was adopted to investigate the impact of using different design strategies in public spaces around subway stations on human emotional responses. The novelty of this study lies in performing a human factors experiment to examine human emotional reactions to outdoor public spaces surrounding transit stations using a comprehensive method combining physiological assessment and subjective self-report. Thirty-four participants were recruited for the experiment, which was conducted at the catchment areas of two subway stations in Nanjing, China. Urban design characteristics related to open space enclosure and visual elements, natural elements, pedestrian access, surrounding buildings or walls, and land use and activities were tested in both semi-underground and above-ground public spaces. Additionally, human emotions were assessed using the pleasure, arousal, and dominance model and by investigating the four response systems that predominantly reflect people’s emotional states. These results led to design and policy suggestions that could assist practitioners and researchers in selecting relevant approaches for human-oriented and place-based TOD planning.

10.1386/adch_00016_1,ART DESIGN & COMMUNICATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION,1305 Design,Art school as a transformative locus for risk in an age of uncertainty,"Risk is not a neutral term even in (western) contexts of art and design pedagogic practice, where risk-taking is entwined into the matrices of the academy from the macro to the micro: from institution to studio to tutor to student. Neither design education nor practice exist in a vacuum, so the conditions and contingencies of risk in contemporary design pedagogy are unpicked, in relation to place, process and people, as inter-connected (though often fragmented) components of study. Art school is examined as a transformative locus for risk: a conceptual-architectural site for knowledge but also a temporal space of subversion, within which the studio provides students with a relatively safe setting for risk in individual and collective formulations. Neo-liberal policies of standardization and competition are as embedded in educational institutions as they are across all levels of society: the resultant loss of agency is felt individually and collectively. This article reframes risk as fundamentally located and dialogic, an autonomous cooperative and collective action, underpinned by critical thinking and disobedient pedagogies. This is a transformative educational process anticipating change in an expanded mode of design in which the student members of the Alternative Art School are considered as critical agents, employing creative reflexivity as an antidote to the neo-liberal stifling of risk.","[{""name"": ""Cathy Gale"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000105363773 Kingston School of Art""]}]","[""10.1007/BF00138871"", ""10.1162/desi.2006.22.2.27"", ""10.1386/adch.16.1.99_1"", ""10.1080/00933104.1979.10506048"", ""10.1007/BF01405730"", ""10.1016/0950-7051(92)90020-G"", ""10.1386/adch_00016_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

Design/methodology/approach The investigation consists of establishing the student learning levels then mapping the student learning levels (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation) through program outcomes with appropriate evaluation components. 270 continuing education students enrolled during six years were selected to be observed as part of this study. These students were divided into two subgroups, one with 135 students who were offered simulation lab (G2) and the other 135 students were not offered simulation lab (G1) in this investigation. Subsequently, a comparative analysis was carried out on these two groups to assess the student performance in multiple evaluation components with respect to student learning level and program outcome achievement. Findings It was identified that student performance in the application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation learning levels has improved for the group with simulation lab, and no change or minimal change was observed for the group without simulation lab. It was revealed that the simulation lab practice problems needs to be aligned with the theoretical concepts in the course to get a better performance from the students.

This study aims to explore organisational influences on digitalisation within construction firms. Design/methodology/approach The study uses structured open-ended questions as a data collection tool for a qualitative investigation. The qualitative approach enabled participants to express their inputs and maximise the diversity of data, offering new insights and discussions that are distinct from previous works. Findings Construction professionals from 22 organisations provided their perspectives on digital transformation and their organisations. Under four constructs – structure, culture, leadership and internal processes, findings uncovered 16 determinants critical to digitalisation in construction firms. The study offers a theoretical perspective supported by empirical data to explore the complex dynamics and internal interactions of organisational influence on the uptake of digitalisation in the construction industry. Originality/value This paper offers arguments from a theoretical lens by applying the organisational influence model and capturing the variables under each construct in an exploratory manner to highlight the reasoning behind the low digital uptake in construction firms. This research aids academia and practice on the pressure points responsible for enhancing, or undermining, digital uptake in construction firms at an organisational level.","[{""name"": ""Sambo Lyson Zulu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ali Saad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saheed Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria Unuigbe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Dulaimi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/EMR.2020.3013206"", ""10.1080/15228053.2007.10856111"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.06.014"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002103"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2021.01.124"", ""10.1111/nup.12073"", ""10.1108/ECAM-07-2020-0587"", ""10.1080/21568235.2021.2004184"", ""10.1080/14780887.2019.1670765"", ""10.1016/j.arcontrol.2019.06.001"", ""10.1108/AAAJ-03-2017-2891"", ""10.1080/09537287.2020.1780509"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.03.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001928"", ""10.1177/1523422310365486"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2014.12.001"", ""10.1080/01446193.2011.570357"", ""10.1080/01446193.2021.1988667"", ""10.1080/03075079.2017.1284191"", ""10.2307/258434"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2020.103677"", ""10.1080/01446193.2021.1955398"", ""10.1080/00049670.2014.966408"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog2506_2"", ""10.1111/corg.12351"", ""10.3390/app11135909"", ""10.3390/su132413983"", ""10.3390/su11092713"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002148"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103452"", ""10.1177/1350508417733137"", ""10.3390/ijerph18116135"", ""10.18267/j.cebr.284"", ""10.1080/16258312.2021.1942190"", ""10.1007/s11831-020-09455-9"", ""10.3390/buildings12020090"", ""10.1111/1467-9566.12838"", ""10.1177/1468794112446106"", ""10.1177/002224299505900105"", ""10.1002/ir.37019823403"", ""10.1177/1420326X13498400"", ""10.1111/bjet.12617"", ""10.3390/buildings12040396"", ""10.1016/j.jamda.2020.10.024"", ""10.36680/j.itcon.2020.016"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.11.004"", ""10.1007/s13520-019-00090-7"", ""10.1007/s10668-021-01769-3"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149892"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2017.1381165"", ""10.1080/01446193.2021.1930080""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0033,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A review of the significance effect of external factors of the solar dyer design to dried foods product quality,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss the external factors of the solar dryer design that influenced the thermal efficiency of the solar dryer that contribute to the better quality of dried food products. Design/methodology/approach From the reviewed works of literature, the external factors including the drying temperature, airflow rate and relative humidity have significant effects to increase the rate of moisture diffusivity of the freshly harvested products during the drying process. The proper controls of airflow rate (Q), velocity (V), relative humidity (RH%) and drying temperature (°C) can influence the dried product quality. The dehydration ratio is the procedure to measure the quality of the dried food product. Findings The indirect solar dryer including the mixed-mode, hybrid and integrated was found shorter in drying time and energy-intensive compared to sun drying and direct drying. The recommended drying temperature is from 35.5°C to 70°C with 1–2 m/s velocity and 20%–60% relative humidity. The optimum thermal efficiency can be reached by additional devices, including solar collectors and solar accumulators. It gives a simultaneous effect and elongated the drying temperature 8%–10% higher than ambient temperature with 34%–40% energy saving. The recommended airflow rate for drying is 0.1204 to 0.0894 kg/s. Meanwhile, an airflow rate at 0.035–0.04 kg/m2 is recommended for an optimum drying kinetic performance. Research limitations/implications This paper discusses the influence of the external factors of the solar dryer design on the thermal performance of the solar dryer and final dried food products quality. Therefore, the findings cannot serve as a statistical generalization but should instead be viewed as the quantitative validation subjected to fundamentals of the solar dryer design process and qualitative observation of the dried food product quality. Practical implications A well-designed of solar dryer with low operating and initial fabrication cost, which is simple to operate is useful for the farmers to preserve surplus harvested crops to an acceptable and marketable foods product. The optimization of the external and internal factors can contribute to solar dryer thermal performance that later provides an organoleptic drying condition that results in good quality of dried product and better drying process. The recommended drying temperature for a drying method is between 35°C up to 70°C. Drying at 65.56°C was effective to kill microorganisms. Meanwhile, drying at 50°C consider as average drying temperature. The recommended airflow rate for drying is 0.1204 to 0.0894 kg/s. Meanwhile, air flowrate at 0.035–0.04 kg/m2 is recommended for optimum drying kinetic performance. The recommended value of aspect ratio and mass flow rate is 200 to 300 for an optimum evaporation rate. The good quality of dried products and good performance of solar dryers can be developed by proper control of airflow rate (Q), velocity (V), relative humidity (RH%) and drying temperature (°C). Social implications The proper control of the drying temperature, relative humidity and airflow rate during the drying process will influence the final dried food products in terms of shape, color, aroma, texture, rupture and nutritious value. It is crucial to control the drying parameters because over-drying caused an increment of energy cost and reduces the dry matter. The quick-drying will disturb the chemical process during fermentation to be completed. Originality/value This study identifies the potential of the solar drying method for dehydrating agricultural produces for later use with the organoleptic drying process. The organoleptic drying process can reduce mold growth by promising an effective diffusion of moisture from freshly harvested products. The research paper gives useful understandings that well-designed solar drying technology gives a significant effect on dried product quality.","[{""name"": ""B. Norerama D.

10.1108/JEDT-09-2023-0383,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Theoretical framework for carbon trading in the built environment,"Purpose This conceptual paper aims to develop a theoretical framework for carbon trading in the built environment through theories to expand current knowledge on components of carbon trading systems. Design/methodology/approach This theoretical framework was developed and supported with existing theories and past empirical literature from built environment, economics and finance. Underlying theories used in the framework were selected due to their significance and applicability to carbon trading projects. Hypotheses set in the study summarise the propositions developed from the theories and past empirical literature. Findings The framework reveals four major components of carbon trading for the built environment. Six hypotheses were further proposed to unravel the resultant influence of their interactions on each component in the trading system. Research limitations/implications This paper sought to undertake a theoretical review of classical theories and past studies on carbon trading. Even though a systematic review was undertaken, the constructs in the theoretical framework may not be exhaustive.

10.1108/JEDT-05-2022-0257,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,The use of alternative building technologies as a sustainable affordable housing solution: perspectives from South Africa,"Purpose This study aims to evaluate the perception of the local experts and end users on the drivers, barriers and strategies to the use of alternative building technologies (ABTs), with a focus on sandbag building technologies (SBTs) in the provision of sustainable housing in South Africa towards improving the public's understanding of SBTs. Design/methodology/approach This research adopted a qualitative approach that used focus group meetings as the primary data collection method for this study. This study's focus group participants comprised ABT experts and end users of ABT houses in South Africa who were selected using a convenient sampling technique. The data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo 11 software. Findings This study found that the perceived drivers to using ABTs such as SBT comprise sustainability, affordability, job creation potentials, fire-resistant and earthquake resistance. This study revealed strategies for the SBTs, including awareness, building sandbag prototypes across cities and training. Practical implications This study's findings have practical implications for the practice and praxis of ABT implementation and uptake in South Africa. This study provides a framework for broadening the worldwide understanding of use and uptake of SBTs to provide sustainable and affordable housing. Originality/value This study adds significantly to the limited body of knowledge on ABTs, focusing on sandbag houses. Consequently, the findings provide policymakers with information on the expert and end-user perspectives on the barriers and strategies to using ABTs.","[{""name"": ""Johnson Adetooto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abimbola Windapo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francesco Pomponi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.030"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.119995"", ""10.3390/buildings12060859"", ""10.29007/nqpb"", ""10.1177/1757975919856273"", ""10.5688/aj7408141"", ""10.1080/08882746.2006.11430534"", ""10.3992/1943-4618.15.1.87"", ""10.4067/S0718-915X2016000300002"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2014-0087"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.318"", ""10.1142/9789813272491_0016"", ""10.1177/1049732307308450"", ""10.1080/02673037.2018.1458289"", ""10.1038/bdj.2008.192"", ""10.1080/13645579.2017.1281601"", ""10.1680/ensu.2007.160.3.141"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.118615"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.05.004"", ""10.3390/buildings11080317"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.02.055"", ""10.1111/2041-210X.12860"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2010.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100732"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2016.03.021"", ""10.3390/su8020151"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.402"", ""10.29007/w511""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Urban Studies', 'Social Psychology', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0085,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Technological learning modelling towards sustainable energy planning,"PurposeObviously, the development of a robust optimization framework is the main step in energy and climate policy. In other words, the challenge of energy policy assessment requires the application of approaches which recognize the complexity of energy systems in relation to technological, social, economic and environmental aspects. This paper aims to develop a two-sided multi-agent based modelling framework which endogenizes the technological learning mechanism to determine the optimal generation plan. In this framework, the supplier agents try to maximize their income while complying with operational, technical and market penetration rates constraints. A case study is used to illustrate the application of the proposed planning approach. The results showed that considering the endogenous technology cost reduction moves optimal investment timings to earlier planning years and influences the competitiveness of technologies. The proposed integrated approach provides not only an economical generation expansion plan but also a cleaner one compared to the traditional approach.Design/methodology/approachTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, so far there has not been any agent-based generation expansion planning (GEP) incorporating technology learning mechanism into the modelling framework. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a multi-agent based modelling for long-term GEP and undertakes to show how incorporating technological learning issues in supply agents behaviour modelling influence on renewable technology share in the optimal mix of technologies. A case study of the electric power system of Iran is used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed planning approach and also to demonstrate its efficiency.FindingsAs seen, the share of the renewable technology agents (geothermal, hydropower, wind, solar, biomass and photovoltaic) in expanding generation increases from 10.2% in the traditional model to 13.5% in the proposed model over the planning horizon. Also, to incorporate technological learning in the supply agent behaviour leads to earlier involving of renewable technologies in the optimal plan. This increased share of the renewable technology agents is reasonable due to their decreasing investment cost and capability of cooperation in network reserve supply which leads to a high utilization factor.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, so far there hasn’t been any agent-based GEP paying attention to this integrated approach. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a multi-agent based modelling for long-term GEP and undertakes to show how incorporating technological learning issues in supply agents behaviour modelling influence on renewable technology share in the optimal mix of technologies.

This article examines a study conducted after distance education had been universally implemented in one college of art in Australia. The data analysis highlighted inconsistency across art and design student engagement. Generally, students who were situated in the later years of their degree programmes fared better than first year students new to the processes, practices and socialisation of studio learning.

10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0347,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Sub-grade characteristics of clayey soil incorporating municipal solid waste incineration ash and marble dust,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to use the waste materials in soil stabilization and low traffic volume roads so as to minimize the cost of subgrades for road construction along with solving disposal problems of waste materials thus protecting the environment. Design/methodology/approach An extensive laboratory study has been carried out on various samples of soil alone and along with waste materials such as municipal solid waste incineration ash and marble dust by adding cement to evaluate their effect on geotechnical characteristics of clayey soils. Findings The experimental study revealed that mixture of soil:Municipal solid waste incineration ash (MSWIA):Cement and soil:Marble dust (MD):Cement can be successfully used for the construction of low traffic volume roads. The differential free swell of the clayey soil is nil on adding MSWIA: cement and MD: cement to clayey soil in optimum amounts. Research limitations/implications The research needs further experimentation on combining both MSWIA and MD together to stabilize clayey soil. Practical implications The research can be successfully used by government agencies in subgrades of low traffic roads. Social implications The utilization of waste materials in the study solved the disposal problem of both waste materials, thus protecting the environment and giving quality living standards to people. Originality/value The use of MSWIA along with cement and use of MD along with cement for evaluating geotechnical properties has not been studied in the past.

After showing the relationships between the Gestalt Theory and the principal teachers of the Bauhaus (Johannes Itten, Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, László Moholy‐Nagy, Josef Albers), the pedagogical epistemology of Walter Gropius is critically presented. The epoché, the intersubjective criterion and the anti‐psychologism are examined. In conclusion, it is evidenced that Gropius was strongly influenced by Gestalt psychology. This undeclared influence was a necessary consequence of the fact that phenomenological attitude is a crucial operating modality for the concrete practice of design.","[{""name"": ""Michele Sinico"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1525/9780520351271"", ""10.2307/1511669"", ""10.2307/1576669"", ""10.1037/h0058484"", ""10.2307/1511466"", ""10.1162/07479360152103796"", ""10.1017/S0140525X15000965"", ""10.1080/10400419109534381"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-88748-2"", ""10.1080/00393541.2005.11650075"", ""10.4159/9780674239890"", ""10.4159/9780674239890"", ""10.1017/S0140525X99002022"", ""10.2478/gth-2019-0004"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45566-8_6"", ""10.18848/2325-128X/CGP/v06i02/57905""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The industrial waste like blast furnace slag (GGBFS), fly ash, metakaolin and silica fume can be partly used as a replacement for cement and manufactured sand obtained from crusher and partly used as fine aggregate. The purpose of this paper is to predict the shear strength of concrete using artificial neural network (ANN) for concrete made by using different pozzolans and partly replacing NFA by manufactured sand (MS) which can reduce the time and experimental cost. Design/methodology/approach In this work, MATLAB software model is developed using neural network toolbox to predict the shear strength of concrete made by using pozzolanic materials and partly replacing NFA by manufactured sand (MS). Shear strength was experimentally calculated, and results obtained from experiment were used to develop the ANN model. A total of 131 results values were used to modeling formation, and from that 30% data record was used for testing purpose and 70% data record was used for training purpose. In total, 25 input materials properties were used to find the 28 days shear strength of concrete obtained from partly replacing cement with pozzolans and partly replacing NFA by manufactured sand (MS). Findings The results obtained from ANN model provide very strong accuracy to predict shear strength of concrete obtained from partly replacing cement with pozzolans and NFA by manufactured sand.

This study aims to investigate the areas of service responsible for determining client satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach The study uses questionnaire for data collection on perceived service quality and indicators of clients’ satisfaction. Findings The results of descriptive statistics suggest that efficient analysis and compliance with client brief along with buildability, flexibility and comprehensiveness of the design are the main technical determinants of clients’ satisfaction. Management measures for engendering clients’ satisfaction include team communication and collaboration as well as regular site visits when required. The study established a significant relationship between the perceived service quality and client satisfaction. At technical level, economical design and compliance with budget, buildability, optimal and error-free design and timely delivery have significant correlation with the perception of service quality, which could engender client satisfaction. At management level, collaboration and coordination, integrity and trust, regular site visits and project management knowledge and skills had significant relationships with perceived service quality. Originality/value To improve overall client satisfaction, architects are expected to focus on these factors in the process of service delivery. Architects’ expertise and skills can be further harnessed through continuous training and understanding of the project environment.","[{""name"": ""Olusola Ralph Aluko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Godwin I.

10.1111/jade.12312,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Pedagogies for the 'Dis-engaged': Diverse Experiences of the Young People's Arts Award Programme,"AbstractArt education is often praised for its engaging programmes and inclusive pedagogies, with many initiatives created with the intention of widening access for those who are deemed to be lacking. This article investigates one such programme – the young people’s Arts Award, which is a nationally recognised qualification for young people aged 11–25. I call upon a range of pedagogies in order to critique the Arts Award within the context of informal and alternative education settings in the United Kingdom. Drawing on a 12‐month ethnographic study, the research was conducted across five diverse programmes which included youth work projects and alternative provision. I present two cases – ‘learning to be an artist’ and ‘learning to behave’ – which demonstrate a hierarchy of pedagogy in the application of this programme across these particular contexts. Artists’ Signature Pedagogies are used as an analytical framework to explore the affordances of working with artists through the programme. Further, I engage with the Pedagogy of Poverty to demonstrate that young people who were classified as ‘dis‐engaged’ were more likely to receive lower quality programmes, low‐level work and over‐regulated teaching. I argue that despite changes to the ways that young people access art education, there continues to be unequal opportunities. This finding is significant for not only creative practitioners and youth arts workers, but also arts education policy makers and programmers.","[{""name"": ""Frances Howard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/002205748016200106"", ""10.1111/jade.12089"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2014.934204"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00338"", ""10.1177/003172171009200223"", ""10.1080/01425690701505466"", ""10.1111/jade.12120"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2012.01760.x"", ""10.1080/09695940701592022"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2014.12008.x"", ""10.1080/02680930500499968"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2011.01720.x"", ""10.1080/14681366.2012.759136"", ""10.1080/13603116.2015.1102340"", ""10.4135/9781446219454.n1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Participatory Design (PD) methodology has become a promising pedagogical approach to engage diverse stakeholders and communities in the design process. The twofold goal of this article is to describe and categorise student learning experiences in an architecture studio and to delineate the benefits of applying PD methodology to architecture studio pedagogy. Students from a graduate level integrated architectural studio participated in the study and led a series of three participatory co‐creation activities with diverse stakeholders who were planned for the front, middle and backend of the design process. Observations, questionnaires and interviews were used to describe and categorise student learning experiences as well as determine the benefits of integrating PD methodology into a design studio. The study results demonstrate that participatory activities positively impact student learning experiences as well as greatly enhance student empathy for stakeholders, thus integrating the social and technical aspects of their experience and demonstrating the importance of stakeholder engagement in collective and creative experimentation.","[{""name"": ""Tejas Dhadphale"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Brad Wicks"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4135/9781526417015.n13"", ""10.1080/15710882.2012.690232"", ""10.1080/15710882.2014.881883"", ""10.1080/10888691.2011.587720"", ""10.1080/15710882.2012.693187"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(03)00040-1"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2018.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2018.10.003"", ""10.1108/02640471111177099""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-11-2019-0311,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Optimization by mixture design approach Impact of marble and ceramic recycle on properties of mortar based on air lime,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to fit an appropriate mathematical model to express response variables as functions of the proportions of the mixture components. One purpose of statistical modeling in a mixture experiment is to model the blending surface such that predictions of the response for any mixture component, singly or in combination, can be made empirically. Testing of the model adequacy will also be an important part of the statistical procedure. Design/methodology/approach A series of mortar using air lime, marble and ceramic sanitary waste aggregates were prepared for statistically designed combinations. The combinations were designed based on the mixture-design concept of design of experiments; this mortar is often used as a filler material in restoration projects. The aim of this work is to find an optimal composition of a paste for the manufacture of air lime mortar with ceramic and marble waste. This investigation aims to recommend mix design for air lime-based mortar, by optimizing the input combination for different properties, and to predict properties such as mechanical strength, thermogravimetric and x-ray diffraction analysis with a high degree of accuracy, based on a statistical analysis of experimental data. Findings This paper discusses those mortar properties that architects, contractors and owners consider important. For each of these properties, the influence of ceramic and marble waste in the air lime mortar is explored. The flexibility of lime-based mortars with waste materials to meet a wide range of needs in both new construction and restoration of masonry projects is demonstrated. Originality/value The objective of the present investigation is to recommend mixture design for air lime mortar with waste, by optimizing the input combination for different properties, and to predict properties such as compressive strength, flexural strength with a high degree of accuracy, based on the statistical analysis of experimental data. The authors conducted a mixture design study that takes into account dependent parameters such as the constituents of our air lime-based mortar where we have determined an experiment matrix to which we have connected the two responses, namely, compressive and flexural strength. By introducing the desirability criteria of these two responses, using JMP software, we were able to obtain a mixture optimal for air lime mortar with ceramic and marble waste.","[{""name"": ""Yacine Abadou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abderrahmane Ghrieb"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rosa Bustamante"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hayette Faid"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.02.065"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.03.011"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.04.027"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.03.016"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.02.030"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.04.199"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.332"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.09.001"", ""10.14359/51688632"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.09.108"", ""10.1002/app.21008"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.05.062"", ""10.2174/1874149520130815006"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.07.223"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.06.058"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.cogsc.2018.06005"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.034"", ""10.1080/15583050902914678"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.069""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Earth-Surface Processes', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0709 地质学', 0.7376), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7361)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1017/S1359135522000148,ARQ-ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Microbiome-Inspired Green Infrastructure: a bioscience roadmap for urban ecosystem health,"Microbiome-Inspired Green Infrastructure (MIGI) was recently proposed as an integrative system to promote healthy urban ecosystems through multidisciplinary design. Specifically, MIGI is defined as nature-centric infrastructure restored, designed, and managed to enhance health-promoting interactions between humans and environmental microbiomes while sustaining microbially mediated ecosystem functionality and resilience. MIGI also aims to stimulate a research agenda that focuses on considerations for the importance of urban environmental microbiomes.In this article, we provide details of what MIGI entails from a bioscience and biodesign perspective, highlighting the potential dual benefits for human and ecosystem health. We present ‘what is known’ about the relationship between urban microbiomes, green infrastructure, and environmental factors that may affect urban ecosystem health - taken here to mean ecosystem functionality and resilience, as well as human health. We discuss how to start operationalising the MIGI concept based on current available knowledge and present a horizon-scan of emerging and future considerations in research and practice.We conclude by highlighting challenges to implementing MIGI and propose a series of workshops to discuss multi-stakeholder needs and opportunities. This research will enable urban landscape managers to incorporate initial considerations for the microbiome in their development projects to promote human and ecosystem health. However, overcoming the challenges to operationalising MIGI will be essential to furthering its practical development. Although the research is in its infancy, there is considerable potential for MIGI to help deliver sustainable urban development driven by considerations for reciprocal relations between humans and the foundations of our ecosystems – the microorganisms.","[{""name"": ""Jake M.

10.1108/JEDT-12-2021-0742,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Infrastructure design stage considerations for environmental sustainability in Zambia,"Purpose While previous studies have highlighted the importance of incorporating environmental sustainability in building designs, there is a paucity of studies that assess the extent to which design teams in developing countries consider environmental sustainability at the building design stage. Therefore, using Zambia as a case study, this study examined the extent to which infrastructure design teams in a developing country consider environmental sustainability at the design stage. Design/methodology/approach The study used a qualitative research approach using structured interviews because there are hardly any studies which have explored the extent to which designers incorporate environmental sustainability in infrastructure designs in developing countries. The data is analysed thematically using the ATLAS.ti software. Findings The results show that environmental sustainability is not an important design consideration because it is secondary to functional, technical and aesthetic considerations. Environmental considerations are also made in an ad hoc manner and when it is cost-effective for the project. Regulatory requirements pertaining to environmental protection are adhered to without any cost considerations. It was, therefore, theorised that building design teams in developing countries make technical, functional and aesthetic consideration during the infrastructure design stage ahead of environmental considerations. Originality/value There is a paucity of studies that have investigated whether building infrastructure designers consider issues of environmental sustainability at the design stage in developing countries. The findings have practical implications on how developing countries can foster environmental sustainability at the design stage and avoid generating a building infrastructure stock that will require environmental resilience adaptation in the future.","[{""name"": ""Ephraim Zulu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sambo Lyson Zulu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mwansa Chabala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Neema Kavishe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Charles Chifunda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Innocent Musonda"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-04-2020-0113"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2019-0002"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.743"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2020-0369"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.988"", ""10.1108/02632771011083694"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.019"", ""10.1007/s10668-007-9117-0"", ""10.1016/j.rset.2021.100001"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2516.2008.01701.x"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2009.07.004"", ""10.1557/mre.2018.14"", ""10.2307/258557"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2019.08.010"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.515"", ""10.3390/su9020165"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.09.010"", ""10.3390/su13126593"", ""10.3390/su12229494"", ""10.3390/proceedings2019016053"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.03.041"", ""10.1080/01446190320000000000"", ""10.3992/jgb.8.3.166"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2021.111874"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2018.11.027"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2011.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.07.041"", ""10.1080/01446193.2012.674211"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0044"", ""10.1021/es402618m"", ""10.1016/j.dibe.2021.100049"", ""10.1016/j.clet.2021.100226"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2019.01.995"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.109783"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0064"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2017-0087"", ""10.1016/j.foar.2016.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2019.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.395"", ""10.3390/su9040623"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.08.039"", ""10.1007/s11135-017-0574-8"", ""10.1080/2159676X.2017.1393221"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/245/2/022073"", ""10.1177/1049732307307031"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.217"", ""10.1016/j.eng.2017.12.013"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2016-0141"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-11-2018-0151"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0233"", ""10.1080/17452007.2016.1213153""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1111/jade.12448,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,How Does the Design Guidelines for Traditional Cultural Artefacts Inspire Design in a Culturally Inspired Design Process? A Comparative Study with Novice Design Students,"AbstractDesign guidelines for traditional cultural artefacts play an important role in Culturally Inspired Design (CID) activities and design education. In this paper, a comparative study was performed to assess the impact of present‐day design guidelines for traditional Chinese cultural artefacts on novice designers in a CID process. In all, 42 novice designers enrolled in a cultural product design course participated in this study, under two different design conditions: an unaided condition and a guideline‐aided condition. Each condition includes three stages: identification stage, translation stage and implementation stage. In the unaided condition, each participant was asked to finish an investigative report on traditional cultural artefacts without any guidance and then carry out a detailed cultural product design. These results were then compared with those of the participants in the guideline‐aided condition, who received a design guideline for traditional cultural artefacts. The results were assessed by expert raters against six design metrics: breadth, depth, quantity, variety, novelty and quality. They revealed that the design guideline for traditional cultural artefacts in a CID process promoted the analysis of cultural features and increased the novelty and quality of design outcomes but resulted in decreased variety. We propose that the design guideline for traditional cultural artefacts may be useful as part of the design process and as a pedagogical tool in cultural creative design, but the best moment at which to introduce the design guideline should be further examined.","[{""name"": ""Yenan Dong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shangshang Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wenjie Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Minxi Lin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.destud.2015.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2004.05.004"", ""10.1145/2377783.2377797"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2012.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.ergon.2015.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2014.07.001"", ""10.1080/14606925.2018.1440842"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21660-2_4"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2014.02.004"", ""10.17705/1jais.00106"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2010.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2006.01.002"", ""10.1111/jade.12145"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(99)00030-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21660-2_7"", ""10.1145/2347635.2347647"", ""10.1162/074793603768290838"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2015.07.024"", ""10.1115/DETC2006-99123"", ""10.1080/14626268.2014.904367"", ""10.1145/2347635.2347647"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(02)00034-0"", ""10.1016/j.intcom.2005.11.014"", ""10.1080/17543266.2011.579578"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2016.01.001"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01646.x"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2008.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2016.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2015.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2012.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2009.10.003"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(00)00043-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21660-2_13"", ""10.1111/jade.12213""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Museology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.1111/jade.12434,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Expanding Multimodal Artistic Expression and Appreciation Methods through Integrating Augmented Reality,"AbstractIncreasing usage of digital technologies in daily life has affected even tech savvy students. With the prominent development of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality technologies, this study concentrates on the ongoing development of AR in art education and its potential in art education. As an educator in visual arts at a higher education institution, the author explored AR‐integrated curriculum by introducing an AR creation tool (Adobe Aero) and AR education tool (Merge Cube) into visual arts education classes. The lessons were designed with multimodal delivery methods for learning effectiveness with AR, and students learned about the concepts of arts integration and AR technologies. This study examines how newly developed AR‐based curriculum expanded students’ art expression and represented artwork in real and virtual spaces. In outlining the results, this study explains the practice of two‐dimensional (2D) and virtual‐based three‐dimensional (3D) hybrid art creations in AR, and digital storytelling with AR.

10.1108/JEDT-08-2023-0330,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Evaluating Construction 4.0 technologies in enhancing safety and health: case study of a national strategic plan,"Purpose Policymakers are developing national strategic plans to encourage organizations to adopt Construction 4.0 technologies. However, organizations often adopt the recommended technologies without aligning with organizational vision. Furthermore, there is no prioritization on which Construction 4.0 technology should be adopted, including the impact of the technologies on different criteria such as safety and health. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate Construction 4.0 technologies listed in a national strategic plan that targets the enhancement of safety and health. Design/methodology/approach A list of Construction 4.0 technologies from a national strategic plan is evaluated using the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Then, the data are analyzed using reliability, fuzzy TOPSIS, normalization, Pareto, sensitivity, ranking and correlation analyses. Findings The analyses identified six Construction 4.0 technologies that are critical in enhancing safety and health: Internet of Things, autonomous construction, big data and predictive analytics, artificial Intelligence, building information modeling and augmented reality and virtualization. In addition, six pairs of Construction 4.0 technologies illustrate strong relationships. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by ranking a list of Construction 4.0 technologies in a national strategic plan that targets the enhancement of safety and health. Decision-makers can use the study findings to prioritize the technologies during the adoption process. Also, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the impact of Construction 4.0 technologies listed in a national strategic plan on a specific criterion.","[{""name"": ""Hazwani Shafei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rahimi A.

10.1108/JEDT-12-2019-0348,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Energy consumption analysis of glass house using electrochromic window in the subtropical region,"Purpose Electrochromic window (ECW) has been gradually applied to building engineering in recent years. However, empirical study of this technology used in green building design is still lacking. This study aims to verify the lighting and energy-saving performance of ECW under a specific geographical environment. Design/methodology/approach The meditation pavilion of Jinwan new materials research institute in Zhuhai is taken for research object. Three kinds of sun-shading techniques, namely, ECW, Low-E window and ordinary glass window, with same specifications are selected as the building facade structure for simulation. Day lighting analysis, sun-shading performance and annual energy consumption are separately simulated in the same environment by the Autodesk Ecotect Analysis software. The energy-saving performance of ECW is obtained by comparisons. Findings Result shows that the shading performance of ECW is much better than ordinary window and Low-E window. When ECW is used in the east, west or top lighting interfaces of a building, about 40% of the total solar radiation can be reduced during daytime in summer. Taking the ordinary glass window as a basic reference, ECW can save about 90% of the annual energy consumption of the glass house. ECW can effectively reduce the annual refrigeration energy consumption of buildings in the subtropical region. Practical implications Reasonable use of ECW in the subtropical region can effectively reduce the annual energy consumption of buildings. Originality/value It is a precedent study to analyze the lighting performance and energy consumption of a glass house with ECW. The energy-saving characteristics and beautiful appearance of ECW shall make it a future green building technology.","[{""name"": ""Yang Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Misheng Lin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ke Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shuyang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hongwei Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113522"", ""10.1016/j.tsf.2018.02.032"", ""10.1016/j.apmt.2018.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109454"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2018.08.096"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.101089"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.10.057"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.05.025"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.08.020"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.10.021"", ""10.3763/aber.2009.0404"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-0449-8_37"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.01.281"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2013.02.006"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2019.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2019.02.041"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.090"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.087"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.03.242"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.tsf.2014.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.07.046"", ""10.1016/j.ijsbe.2016.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2009.08.021"", ""10.1016/S0038-092X(01)00019-6"", ""10.1039/C5EE03160E"", ""10.1016/0165-1633(85)90033-4""]","['Environmental Science', 'Materials Science']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Polymers and Plastics', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

City tourism based on the attractiveness of the city is an important policy objective to secure competitiveness and sustainability of the city. However, as a city attracts more tourists, this uniqueness tends to decrease with the introduction of global corporate franchises as well as the construction of standardised buildings. Policymakers focus more on building hotels and shopping centres than on enhancing the cityscape. Therefore, this article aims to analyse the effect of cityscapes on tourist satisfaction. It encourages policymakers to bear in mind what really matters in fostering tourist satisfaction. During this research, about 250 foreign tourists visiting Seoul were given questionnaires to complete. Ordered logistic regression was used to analyse the data collected. The results demonstrated that among several elements that affected tourist satisfaction, such as shopping, security, and public transportation services, the cityscape had the greatest influence. This fact shows that urban competitiveness and sustainable city tourism are more important than the construction of new buildings or infrastructure in the short term. In the future, policymakers should seek to strengthen the city’s competitiveness from a longer-term perspective for its sustainable economic revitalisation.","[{""name"": ""Chehyun Ryu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Youngsang Kwon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/10548408.2018.1541775"", ""10.1016/j.annals.2009.07.001"", ""10.1016/S0264-2751(02)00024-0"", ""10.1016/S0264-2751(01)00046-4"", ""10.1016/j.apgeog.2006.11.002"", ""10.1080/09595238200185471"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2015.09.016"", ""10.1016/S0261-5177(99)00070-9"", ""10.1177/002224378201900410"", ""10.1177/003803857901300203"", ""10.1016/0160-7383(79)90004-5"", ""10.1177/002224299405800110"", ""10.3280/MC2011-003008"", ""10.1016/j.annals.2008.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2014.09.003"", ""10.1080/10548408.2017.1350250"", ""10.1177/004728759103000201"", ""10.1080/09654310120079841"", ""10.1177/109634808801200246"", ""10.1080/09669589608667261"", ""10.1016/0160-7383(82)90049-4"", ""10.1086/209428"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2003.12.006"", ""10.1080/10548408.2015.1094001"", ""10.1016/0160-7383(87)90105-8"", ""10.1080/0022250X.1975.9989847"", ""10.1016/S0261-5177(01)00036-X"", ""10.1177/002224378001700405"", ""10.1016/S0022-4359(97)90021-X"", ""10.1016/0264-2751(90)90047-B"", ""10.1016/0261-5177(93)90022-D"", ""10.1080/10548408.2014.890158"", ""10.1177/002224299405800109"", ""10.1177/002224298504900403"", ""10.1080/00049537708255282"", ""10.1080/13683501003623802"", ""10.1016/S0160-7383(01)00073-1"", ""10.1177/004728757801700105"", ""10.1080/1461668042000208426"", ""10.1108/eb059919"", ""10.1016/S0261-5177(97)00094-0"", ""10.1086/462677"", ""10.1080/10548408.2010.527249"", ""10.1080/19368621003667101"", ""10.1177/0047287516657891"", ""10.1016/j.annals.2017.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.tourman.2005.06.003""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was adopted, using a structured questionnaire distributed to AECO professionals across four selected regions (North Central, North West, South-South and South West) in Nigeria. The data were analysed using Kruskal–Wallis test and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings The study findings show a robust consensus of opinions among the respondents across regions and professions. The SEM analysis establishes the significant influence of the hypothesized drivers, regulatory and institutional, supply chain collaboration, technological advancements, organizational support and business strategies on the successful implementation of circular economy principles in the Nigerian AECO industry. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to specific regions and professions within Nigeria. Further limitation is the quantitative orientation of this study, which collects data using only a questionnaire. Practical implications The findings imply that stakeholders can adopt a unified approach to promote circular economy principles in the AECO industry. By recognizing the common understanding of circular economy drivers, collaborative efforts can be streamlined to advance sustainability, resource efficiency and circularity in the industry. Originality/value This study contributes to the nascent field of circular economy implementation in the Nigerian AECO industry. It offers a unique perspective by exploring variations in stakeholder opinions, providing insights into the nuanced understanding of circular economy drivers.","[{""name"": ""Abdulkabir Opeyemi Bello"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rasheed Babatunde Isa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oladayo Popoola Afolabi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suhaib Arogundade"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayaz Ahmad Khan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/su13116241"", ""10.1080/09613218.2022.2067111"", ""10.1680/jwarm.16.00011"", ""10.1108/MD-11-2018-1178"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2018.01.025"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110445"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123250"", ""10.1080/21681015.2016.1172124"", ""10.2307/3151312"", ""10.1002/bse.2513"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.048"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.207"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130395"", ""10.1080/07421222.2001.11045669"", ""10.1080/00207543.2017.1402141"", ""10.1504/IJMDA.2017.087624"", ""10.1108/EBR-11-2018-0203"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2018.12.015"", ""10.1007/s11747-014-0403-8"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130049"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199902)20:2<195::AID-SMJ13>3.0.CO;2-7"", ""10.30564/jmser.v6i2.5846"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.06.003"", ""10.3390/su15075929"", ""10.1002/sd.2100"", ""10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.028"", ""10.4018/ijec.2015100101"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122596"", ""10.1111/deci.12445"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129400"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.01.026"", ""10.1016/j.cogsc.2018.02.010"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2022-0175"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121134"", ""10.3390/en13071805"", ""10.1007/s00267-021-01473-y"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108556"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2018.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2020.102143"", ""10.1016/j. jbusres.2020.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104426"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.055"", ""10.2307/23042796"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.03.049"", ""10.3390/en14082219"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.10.033"", ""10.1038/531435a"", ""10.3390/buildings11110501"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.202"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133318"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2021.01.022"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.04.015"", ""10.1080/09613218.2023.2211689"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2021.11.010"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104192"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.06.030""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2021-0723,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Development of pavement roughness regression models based on smartphone measurements,"Purpose The purpose of this paper was to study the possibility of using smartphone roughness measurements for developing pavement roughness regression models as a function of pavement age, traffic loading and traffic volume variables. Also, the effects of patching and pavement distresses on pavement roughness were investigated. The work focused on establishing pavement roughness prediction models and applying these models to pavement management systems (PMS) to help decision-makers choose the best maintenance and rehabilitation (M&amp;R) options by using cost-effective methods. Design/methodology/approach Signal processing techniques including filtering and processing techniques were used to obtain the International Roughness Index (IRI) from raw acceleration data collected from smartphone accelerometer sensors. The obtained IRI values were inputted as a dependent variable in analytical regression models as well as several independent variables with proper transformations. Findings According to the study results, several regression models were developed with a big variation in the coefficients of determination (R2). However, the best models included pavement age, accumulated traffic volume (∑TV) and construction quality factor (CQF) with R2 equal to 0.63. It was also found that the effects of pavement distresses and patching was significant at a-level &lt; 0.05. The patching effect on pavement roughness was found higher than the effect of other pavement distresses. Practical implications The presented results and methods in this paper could be used in the future predictions of pavement roughness and help the decision-makers to estimate M&amp;R needs. The work focused on establishing IRI prediction models and applying these models to the PMS to help decision-makers choose the best M &amp; R options. Originality/value To develop sound pavement roughness models, it is essential to collect roughness data using automated procedures. However, applying these procedures in developing countries faces several difficulties such as the high price and operation costs of roughness equipment and lack of technical experience. The advantage of using IRI values taken from smartphones is that the roughness evaluation survey may be expanded to cover the full road network at a cheaper cost than with automated instruments. Therefore, if the roughness survey covers more roads, the prediction model’s accuracy will be improved.","[{""name"": ""Turki I.

10.1111/jade.12286,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Designing Learning Outcomes in Design Higher Education Curricula,"AbstractNew and flexible educational paradigms, based on creative, innovative and open‐minded competences, are required in the development of curricula in design, working as an essential skill toolkit for future designers, particularly in higher education. This study aims to explore how learning outcomes, usually expressed by the knowledge, skills, abilities, attitudes and competences expected to be achieved by students as a result of an educational experience, are defined and formulated in design study programmes in Portugal. The investigation relies on the linguistic analysis of a corpus composed of a collection of learning outcomes extracted from the Portuguese undergraduate and post‐graduate study programmes in design. The analysis was performed through the application of natural language tools and resources to that corpus. Specifically, we used computational lexicons and grammars to gather information on word frequency, lexical density, syntactic distribution and the morphology used in texts. Additional discourse dimensions, such as the length of sentences, the frequency of specific linguistic patterns, and the presence of subjective items, like evaluative adjectives, were also considered. Results suggest that Portuguese design and art higher education institutions are committed to follow the learning outcomes recommendations, trying to identify measurable ‘design’ skills. Moreover, the results show that, despite of being confined to 1,000 characters, learning outcomes are expressed differently, both in terms of lexicon and grammar, depending on the study cycles, fostering the idea that skills and competences required become more complex as the level of qualification increases.","[{""name"": ""Diana Soares"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paula Carvalho"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diana Dias"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/jade.12063"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804489"", ""10.4324/9780203969717"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9553-1_317-1"", ""10.1007/s10734-006-9050-4"", ""10.7551/mitpress/3007.003.0013"", ""10.18870/hlrc.v2i2.23"", ""10.1080/03075079.2016.1190704"", ""10.1111/jade.12118"", ""10.21125/inted.2017.2184"", ""10.1177/2332858417690112"", ""10.1108/QAE-09-2011-0059"", ""10.1007/s10798-013-9246-8"", ""10.1080/13639080.2012.687574""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Media Technology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Design/methodology/approach The mechanism is mainly composed of longitudinal slope leveling mechanism, transverse slope leveling mechanism and control components. According to the tractor body attitude in operation, the longitudinal slope leveling and lateral slope leveling can coordinate to realize the adaptive adjustment of tractor body. For this mechanism, the support mode of the linear three-point support and plane positioning combining is designed, and the leveling method of electromechanical combination is designed. The servo motor controls the longitudinal slope leveling mechanism through the reducer with self-locking function to realize the longitudinal leveling, and the servo driver controls the expansion and contraction of electric cylinder to realize lateral leveling. The designed mode can realize the relative independence and coordination of leveling in different directions. Findings The performance test results of the leveling mechanism are shown: the mechanism can work normally; the leveling accuracy can reach within 1°; and the leveling accuracy and stability can meet the design requirements. The leveling accuracy and stability of longitudinal slope are higher than that of lateral slope, and the coordination leveling effect of longitudinal slope and lateral slope is better than that of the independent leveling.

10.1111/jade.12294,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Decolonising Design Education through Playful Learning in a Tertiary Communication Design Programme in South Africa,"AbstractThis article introduces playful learning as part of the decolonising project at institutes of higher learning in South Africa with specific reference to the discipline of communication design. Not only does the article interrogate the content of design education, specifically design for development, but more specifically the way that design for social innovation is taught. The article begins with a contextualisation of the decolonisation debate both locally and internationally, which is followed by a brief historical overview of formal design education. Design education’s trajectory informs the contemporary conception of design as a form of rhetoric. Design and play are then interfaced theoretically, and pragmatically through a case study to explore how deeper learning was made possible by play in a curriculum‐based project. Ultimately, the article aims to highlight the value of playful learning in design higher education to nurture alternate modes of design thinking that favour localised practice, intersubjective relationships between designers and their stakeholders and the enabling of students’ self‐realisation through real world experience.","[{""name"": ""Fatima Cassim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1162/074793604772933739"", ""10.1080/713845282"", ""10.1162/desi.2008.24.4.38"", ""10.2307/1511524"", ""10.1353/par.2001.0012"", ""10.5040/9781474293884"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2011.07.006"", ""10.21606/drs.2016.287"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00248"", ""10.1525/9780520917538"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9188.001.0001"", ""10.11120/jebe.2009.04020094"", ""10.1093/acref/9780191762963.001.0001""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0437,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Critical skills for infrastructure procurement: insights from developing country contexts,"Purpose Effective procurement of infrastructure is partly dependent on infrastructure procurement personnel having the skills that are important for the discharge of their role. Addressing the infrastructure deficits in developing countries, therefore, calls for an understanding of the skills that are important for the discharge of the roles of public personnel that are involved in infrastructure procurement. This study aims to investigate these skills from the perspective of public infrastructure procurement personnel in the sub-Saharan African region. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey of procurement personnel yielded 590 useable responses, which were analysed using t-tests and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Findings EFA established eight key components of important infrastructure procurement skills to include skills related to: project success factors; social and environmental sustainability; marketing and e-procurement; project phase management, the application of procurement laws and procedures; soft skills, ICT and communication; and data analysis and team building. Originality/value The findings are crucial in developing infrastructure procurement capacity building programmes that would be appropriate for infrastructure procurement personnel in developing country contexts. Infrastructure procurement personnel ought to engage more in capacity development training that is aligned to enhancing skills within the eight components.","[{""name"": ""Richard Ohene Asiedu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patrick Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdul-Majeed Mahamadu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Colin Anthony Booth"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paul Olomolaiye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kofi Agyekum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Abadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.12.001"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2020-0274"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.09.006"", ""10.1080/01446190802621028"", ""10.14424/ijcscm202012-55-65"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2009.06.011"", ""10.1007/s12205-015-0544-4"", ""10.1108/JOPP-10-2019-0067"", ""10.1080/01972240701572913"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.251"", ""10.1108/01443570610672239"", ""10.1080/0144619042000202726"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000107"", ""10.1108/JOPP-13-02-2013-B001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000141"", ""10.1093/oep/53.3.508"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2018.294"", ""10.1016/j.agwat.2009.08.004"", ""10.1108/ECAM-10-2020-0848"", ""10.1108/01443570610672257"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.102"", ""10.1108/IJPSM-03-2017-0066"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.05.004"", ""10.1108/SCM-02-2016-0059"", ""10.1016/j.pursup.2016.09.001"", ""10.1080/14719030701763195"", ""10.1108/ECAM-08-2014-0108"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2017-0089"", ""10.1108/ECAM-11-2017-0240"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-02-2018-0038"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2020-0375"", ""10.1080/15623599.2017.1354497"", ""10.1016/j.pursup.2006.08.002"", ""10.1108/13598540910954557"", ""10.1108/JOPP-10-04-2010-B002"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2016-0058"", ""10.1108/00070700610702082"", ""10.2753/MIS0742-1222280109"", ""10.1108/JOPP-06-01-02-2006-B001"", ""10.1016/j.pursup.2008.01.005"", ""10.1108/JOPP-03-2018-004"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.04.015"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2014-0043"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-4712"", ""10.1080/1540496X.2015.1105603"", ""10.1080/014461998372501"", ""10.1504/IJASM.2006.011628""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

Design/methodology/approach This study made use of quantitative approach. Questionnaires were used as a form of data collection, and it was distributed to construction professionals such as quantity surveyors, architects, builders, civil engineers, project managers and construction managers in Ondo and Lagos state to ascertain various factors that cause conflict among professionals in the Nigerian construction industry. A total number of 150 questionnaires were distributed, but 135 were received from the respondents that represent 90 per cent of response rate. In this study, the descriptive analysis and exploratory factor analysis were used. Findings The findings from this study show that the major cause of conflict among the professionals is favouritism. This is followed by role ambiguity that occurs due to improper definition of the role of different construction professionals, and it leads to a misunderstanding culminating into conflict. Also, other major causes of conflict among construction professionals in Nigeria include differences in professionals’ experience, differences in level of education, differences in personalities and differences in professionals’ goal and views. Originality/value It should be emphasized that professionals must avoid and desist from any factors that can cause conflict among them. Strict adherence by construction professionals in Nigeria will encourage free flow of ideas and will help them progress. This will actually lead to improvement on professionals tasks.","[{""name"": ""Benjamen Sunkanmi Adeyemi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3250929"", ""10.14424/ijcscm301013-01-15"", ""10.1002/job.71"", ""10.1108/eb022840"", ""10.5267/j.msl.2013.06.036"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.11.156"", ""10.1108/eb022835"", ""10.15580/GJER.2012.4.102412131"", ""10.1177/1741143214523007"", ""10.1177/014920630002600205"", ""10.14488/BJOPM.2015.v12.n2.a3"", ""10.1177/1558689806292430"", ""10.9790/487X-0860716"", ""10.1007/s11747-010-0211-8"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.58.3.182"", ""10.1108/10444060810909301""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Drawing on methods from arts‐based research and qualitative case study, it reports on an investigation into what can be learned from creating environmental art installations with preservice teachers (those training to be K‐12 teachers), as part of an environmental art education programme in a leading Canadian university. Findings support that preservice teachers experienced behavioural and attitudinal shifts towards sustainability after engaging in the processes of creating environmental art; involvement in the programme also provided opportunities for building community, engaging multiple domains of learning, modelling sustainable art‐making practices and prompting environmental activism. The results of this study inform a developing pedagogy for environmental art education in higher education settings.","[{""name"": ""Hilary Inwood"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alysse Kennedy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3193878"", ""10.1080/00393541.2012.11518865"", ""10.2307/3193682"", ""10.2307/1320835"", ""10.3197/096327110X519871"", ""10.1111/j.1442-8903.2009.00487.x"", ""10.18113/P8ijea1908"", ""10.1093/envhis/14.1.9"", ""10.1177/1077800402250965"", ""10.2307/1320367"", ""10.1080/00393541.2007.11650115"", ""10.1080/00043125.2014.11519296"", ""10.1080/00043125.2010.11519100"", ""10.1080/00043125.2018.1465318"", ""10.1080/00393541.2007.11650113"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.45.2.0017"", ""10.1177/1474474009349997"", ""10.1353/een.2003.0013"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2004.00404.x"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2009.01588.x"", ""10.1080/13504622.2012.670208"", ""10.1007/s10798-008-9077-1"", ""10.2307/3193638"", ""10.1525/9780520954236"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01659.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2019-0336,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Commute and labour productivity: investigation of inner city construction sites,"Purpose This paper aims to identify the impact that commute patterns pose on construction labour productivity (CLP). There is limited research focussed on the impact of workforce transportation on productivity, even fewer in a construction environment. In particular, this study seeks to fill a gap in the understanding of how commute patterns may influence CLP. Design/methodology/approach Key factors reported affecting CLP were identified through a comprehensive literature review. Data were collected from 27 interviews and observational evidence at construction sites on Auckland Central Business District (CBD). Findings Shortage of skills, communication among workers, shirking behaviour, absenteeism and tardiness were perceived as the most critical labour productivity factors that are influenced by commute patterns. It is considered that stressful commutes may lead to shirking behaviours (absenteeism and calling sick). Meanwhile, ridesharing may encourage communication among workers. Research limitations/implications The study was carried out in a central business district, focussing on a geographic area with its particular characteristics. The results, thus, may not be generalised in general urban settings. Originality/value The research outcomes can be used as guidelines for companies considering travel plans for their employees, to minimise the negative impact commuting can have on workers, especially in industries with low productivity.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Alejandro Chaparro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fei J.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0074,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Challenges and drivers to data sharing among stakeholders in the South African construction industry,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the challenges to data sharing among construction stakeholders in the South African construction industry and also assess stakeholders’ perceptions of the benefits of data sharing. Design/methodology/approach This study is a cross-sectional survey administered via a Web-based online survey on construction professionals registered with the South African Council for the Project and Construction Management Professions (SACPCMP). The respondents rated on a five-point Likert scale the level of influence of the challenges of, and the benefits derivable from data sharing. These were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. Findings The results of the principal component analysis (PCA) presented a five-factor structure of the challenges to data sharing, including reporting context/framework/lack of expertise, cost considerations/clients’ influences, data interoperability, stakeholders conservative attitude and personal interest/data confidentiality. These have percentage variances 17.124%, 16.929%, 13.786%, 13.353% and 12.961%, respectively. For the benefits of data sharing, the constructs were categorized into four themes, namely, optimal project decisions/stakeholders’ confidence, benchmarking/ collaboration among firms, time and cost benefits and enhanced market intelligence. These have respective variances of 24.598%, 18.393%, 16.160% and 14.685%. Practical implications It is expected that this study will provide information to stakeholders towards implementation policies and practices that could eliminate the challenges to data sharing and assemblage, thereby enhancing the level of data sharing in the construction industry. Originality/value Given the increasing global and technological changes, it might be expected that there will be an increased appeal by construction stakeholders towards embracing data sharing and assemblage owing to the inherent benefits and value.","[{""name"": ""Timothy Oluwafemi Ayodele"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kahilu Kajimo-Shakantu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/ECAM-01-2018-0035"", ""10.1504/IJAIP.2018.092944"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2016.07.001"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-02-2018-0042"", ""10.1155/2018/5249548"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.07.011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2006.07.008"", ""10.1080/01446190210159908"", ""10.1080/10286600410001665644"", ""10.1080/01446190802621044"", ""10.1126/science.aap8395"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2018-0218"", ""10.1108/02635571211278956""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-01-2022-0012,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Assessing the factors of transactional leadership style for construction projects: a case of Nigerian construction industry,"Purpose The role of construction industry in harnessing human and material resources of a nation cannot be overemphasised; hence, the emergence of the requirement of leadership. This study aims to assess the usage of factors of transactional leadership style (TSLS) by the project managers (PMs) in the Nigeria construction industry. Design/methodology/approach A survey research design approach with questionnaire as an instrument of gathering data was adopted. Out of 1,233 questionnaires distributed, data from 975 received with acceptable feedback were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings This study revealed the following factors under active management by exception as the TSLS factors often employed by PMs in Nigeria. These factors are the three frequently used factors: they are: “always give clear and final instructions to be implemented in the project”; “always observed the progress of the project, assessed risk and took precaution to avoid mistakes in the project”; and “always closely monitor performance for errors needing correction”. This study concludes that it is imperative for PMs in the study area to adopt and incorporate these factors to ensure continuous successful delivery of construction projects. Practical implications Therefore, it is hoped that the findings of this research will help the construction industry managers to address the age-long but unrecognised leadership problem confronting the sector, thereby boosting project delivery. Originality/value The findings establish the appropriateness or otherwise of adoption of factors of transactional leadership, either in part or a whole.","[{""name"": ""Femi-favour Olabode Olasunkanmi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dubem Isaac Ikediashi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ikenna Reginald Ajiero"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-01-2019-0025"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00028-5"", ""10.1016/S1048-9843(03)00030-4"", ""10.1207/s1532754xjprr160_2"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.12.019"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2003.12.001"", ""10.1177/1059840512341234"", ""10.1108/17260531211211881"", ""10.1287/orsc.12.4.435.10635"", ""10.1108/17260530910974970"", ""10.26725/JEE.2019.1.31.6200-6208"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.755"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2019-0099"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.03.015"", ""10.1108/JMD-08-2014-0080"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.10.018"", ""10.1108/17260530810891298""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Drawing on action research methods, the participants were children with disability and resident teachers, in accordance with the schools involved in the study. The aim of our work was to accomplish a set of art practices so as to develop empowerment and human values in order to offer an artistic and pedagogical training to the local teachers involved in the project. Broadly speaking, our results approach the notions of development cooperation and art education, understanding art education as a vehicle for emancipation and social transformation. Therefore, art education for development cooperation is comprehended as a process that encourages social inclusion, respect for diversity, education in values, cooperation and whole‐person development. As a result, the experiences presented derive from a process of action research and favour the development of guidelines for possible good practices.","[{""name"": ""Carlos Escaño"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ana Maeso‐Broncano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julia Mañero"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.18061/dsq.v32i1.3027"", ""10.1386/vi.6.2.135_2"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-17771-4"", ""10.1080/09650790500200345"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674061200"", ""10.1111/jade.12229"", ""10.1111/jade.12052"", ""10.1080/00393541.2015.11518956"", ""10.1111/jade.12168""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Therefore, effectively teaching visual representational and interpretational skills is vital for the communication and articulation of such ideations. This article will explore examples from two specific introductory design studios where my personal pedagogical approach emphasises drawing as a creative language of reflection and critical conceptualisation. The aim of my approach accentuates the exploration any idea through drawing and thus allowing this graphic language to aid in the generation of creative thinking. Drawing, then, assumes the role of a research process concerned not only with the projection of thoughts, but with the study of correlations, and the consequent incorporation of perceptive and conceptual articulations.","[{""name"": ""Chahid Akoury"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.11.182"", ""10.2752/146069210X12766130824975"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00021-0"", ""10.1080/10400419109534381"", ""10.1080/10464883.1985.10758354"", ""10.1037/11494-000"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11160.001.0001""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

However, this definition does not specifically define the artist‐teacher in adult community learning (ACL). This article considers if this definition is applicable to artist‐teachers working in this sector. ACL has its own qualities that set it apart from other educational sectors, such as secondary and higher education, including precarious work hours (Westminster Hall 2021). This article interrogates if these affect the identity of the artist‐teachers working in ACL, and thus how they need to be defined. In this article, several similar terms and definitions are considered for their applicability to the artist‐teacher in ACL and results from artist‐teacher participants in relation to this are analyzed.","[{""name"": ""Abbie Cairns"", ""affiliation"": [""Norwich University of the Arts  Norwich UK""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2007.00537.x"", ""10.4324/9781315545417"", ""10.1080/13632430701606152"", ""10.1386/jaac.1.3.265_1"", ""10.1080/15411790903158670"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36xw1vs"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2011.01673.x"", ""10.1080/15411796.2014.844625"", ""10.4324/9781315169170"", ""10.5430/wje.v2n6p39"", ""10.1007/978-94-6300-633-0""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1162/desi_a_00722,DESIGN ISSUES,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Advancing Donald Schon's Reflective Practitioner: Where to Next?,"Abstract In 1983, Donald Schön published his seminal work, The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action. The book emerged during the peak of the Design Methods movement, when works like L. Bruce Archer's Systematic Method for Designers and Herbert A. Simon's The Sciences of the Artificial argued for recognizing design processes as scientific inquiries. Coincidentally, Schön posited an alternative view to rationalizing design processes, called professional artistry, which is implicit professional knowledge. Using protocol studies in various disciplines, he demonstrated that professionals reflect-in-action while working and, as a result, learn and produce knowledge through doing (knowing-in-action). Since the 1980s, design theorists, researchers, and professionals have used Schön's work enthusiastically to articulate that designers learn more about their design process and design project as they design. Forty years after publication, The Reflective Practitioner continues to serve many design researchers as a foundation of learning from the experience of their design processes. However, this theory has limitations that must be recognized and addressed to stay relevant today. The Reflective Practitioner was written for individuals, whereas nowadays, designers often work in teams. The next step is to consider how individual reflections are shared and learned with other designers so that the team benefits from its collective reflective practices.","[{""name"": ""Linus Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anita Kocsis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jane Burry"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

In particular, we present part of the work of Aconcagua Fablab, a mobile design and digital fabrication laboratory. We situate it in relation to the Fablab movement, highlighting its focus in generating processes of ecological understanding, immersion and literacy, working in association with BioGeoArt, an action‐research project inquiring about humanity‐nature relationships in Chile. Unfolding this discussion, we present two workshops developed by Aconcagua Fablab with children and young people, focused in designing / fabricating artefacts and occasions for the exploration of more‐than‐human languages in territorial expressions and immersion in sensitive landscapes – one of them focused on biomimesis and filotaxis; the other one on soundscapes. In doing so, we discuss digital fabrication technologies from a convivial conceptualization, in relation to a more‐than‐human geographical understanding of nature, and concepts such as relational agency, intra‐action, more‐than‐human languages and representation, and situated knowledge, arguing for the role that these technologies and arts in general can play, when used within creative and collaborative learning processes, in awakening ‘the curiosity about life on earth that we will need to limit the destruction we call Anthropocene and protect the Holocene entanglements that we need to survive’.","[{""name"": ""Juan Carlos Jeldes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Susana Cortés‐Morales"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Renée Rodo Lunissi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrés Moreira‐Muñoz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/jade.12293"", ""10.2307/j.ctv12101zq"", ""10.1215/9780822391623"", ""10.14361/transcript.9783839423820.203"", ""10.1145/2485760.2485884"", ""10.1111/jade.12010"", ""10.1287/orsc.13.4.442.2953"", ""10.1080/14729679.2014.919866"", ""10.1080/13504622.2015.1057554"", ""10.55612/s-5002-030-003"", ""10.2307/1320367"", ""10.1080/15710882.2017.1378684"", ""10.1215/9780822373780"", ""10.1111/tran.12077"", ""10.1080/14649365.2014.973900"", ""10.2304/pfie.2007.5.4.431"", ""10.1111/jade.12310"", ""10.1177/0309132511435352"", ""10.1111/jade.12182"", ""10.1080/14733285.2013.812278"", ""10.1162/inov_a_00211"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01648.x"", ""10.1080/01596306.2019.1583822"", ""10.1515/9781400873548"", ""10.1098/rsif.2006.0127"", ""10.54675/YFRE1448"", ""10.17645/si.v8i2.2590""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Design/methodology/approach The ontology composes the main framework to categorize data of product life cycle with eco-design mode (PLC-EDM) and automatically infer specialists’ knowledge for data confirmation, eventually assisting the utilizations and generation of strategies toward decision-making Findings (i) utilization of a novel model with ontology mode for information reuse cross the different eco-design applications; (ii) generation of a sound platform toward life cycle evaluation; and (iii) implementation of the PLC-EDM model along the product generation process. Research limitations/implications It cannot substitute an evaluation tool of life cycle. Certainly, this model does not predict the “target and range” and/or the depiction of the “utility module” that are basic activities in life cycle assessments as characterized through the international organization for standardization regulations. Practical implications As portion of this framework, a prototype Web application is presented which is applied to produce, reuse and verify knowledge of product life cycle. Social implications By counting upon the ontology, the information conducted by the utilization is certainly semantically represented to promote the data sharing among various participants and tools. Besides, the data can be verified against possible faults by inferring over the ontology. Hence, a feasible way to a popular topic in the domain of eco-design applications extension in the industry. Originality/value The goals are: to lean on rigid modeling principles; and to promote the interoperability and diffusion of the ontology toward particular utilization demands.","[{""name"": ""Jeremy S.

However, cities still face numerous challenges in terms of providing and maintaining green spaces. Thus, collaboration and partnerships between various stakeholders are being promoted as a possible solution to such a dilemma with a specific focus on community engagement and placemaking. This research examines the gaps triggering the scarce green open space challenge in Cairo, Egypt, as an example of a rapidly urbanising city in the Global South. In contrast to previous research on green spaces in Cairo, the current study investigates the cascade of the different scales and hierarchical levels of strategies as well as stakeholders concerned with green spaces. The results demonstrate the importance of understanding the dynamics and activating stronger networks between different stakeholders, especially on the community scale. The current research also highlights the importance of determining the actual value of green open spaces for various stakeholders as an essential entry point for placemaking. In addition, it is urging considering the multifunctionality of green spaces as a basis for formulating and negotiating an urban greening policy and strategy in Cairo.","[{""name"": ""Merham M.

If no tasks are specified, do individuals see the item or scene in the same way? How are one's spatial ability and creative performance in spatial design related to visual attention when looking at various visual aspects of an environment scene? This exploratory case study aimed at understanding individuals’ visual attentional pattern when looking at three–dimensional environment scenes with spatially relevant or decorative elements and its potential link with spatial ability and creative performance, using eye–tracking technology. Thirty–eight interior design students at a Midwestern university participated in the study. Three results emerged. First, visual engagement with spatially relevant elements in an environment scene was typically stronger with the high spatial ability group. Second, although the statistical evidence was not strong, regardless of the location of the decorative visual stimuli, the high spatial ability group tended to pay more attention to spatial components than the low spatial ability group; whereas the low spatial ability group seemed to be more attracted to decorative visual stimuli. Third, in a few images, an individual's tendency to view certain aspects was found to negatively or positively correlate with creative performance. The study represents the initial step in understanding an individual's visual attention to spatial elements in environment scenes and its potential correlation with spatial ability and creative performance in spatial design.","[{""name"": ""Joori Suh"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cincinnati, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Ji Young Cho"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyung Hee University, South Korea""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001706"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.997"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.45.2.357"", ""10.1111/joid.12143"", ""10.1037/1040-3590.6.4.284"", ""10.17705/1thci.00046"", ""10.1080/10400419.2003.9651420"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2006.01.002"", ""10.1080/07370008.2017.1323902"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2003.09.006"", ""10.3758/PBR.16.5.850"", ""10.6035/MonTI.2014.ne1.6"", ""10.1016/B978-044451020-4/50031-1"", ""10.1086/209540"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(76)90015-3"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.92.2.137"", ""10.1016/S0167-9236(00)00067-1"", ""10.4018/978-1-59140-562-7.ch034"", ""10.1007/1-84628-062-1_23"", ""10.1002/ase.1583"", ""10.1002/ase.1654"", ""10.3389/fnagi.2017.00285"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4879.003.0007"", ""10.1038/nn1150"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2020.100628"", ""10.1080/07370008.2013.828727"", ""10.1007/s00426-011-0397-5"", ""10.1007/978-1-4899-5379-7"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01647""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-02-2022-0096,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Using the TOE theoretical framework to study the adoption of BIM-AR in a developing country: the case of Ghana,"Purpose Building information modelling (BIM) and augmented reality (AR) are unique technologies in the digitalized construction industry. In spite of the numerous benefits of BIM-AR, its adoption has been at a relatively slow pace. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the factors within technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework influence the adoption of BIM-AR in the context of construction companies in a developing country. Design/methodology/approach By using a mainly deductive quantitative design, survey data were collected from senior management of built environment companies in Ghana using questionnaires. The study adopted a mixture of both purposive and snowball sampling approaches. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyse how the factors within the TOE framework explain BIM-AR adoption in Ghana. Findings Findings from the study show that the top three factors within the TOE framework that facilitate the adoption of BIM-AR include ICT infrastructure within construction firms; the size of the construction firm, which may influence the financial capacity to accommodate BIM-AR; and competitive pressure. The inhibitors of BIM-AR at the company level included external support and trading partners’ readiness. Research limitations/implications Implicit is that the significant factors will be useful to policymakers and companies in developing programs that appeal to non-adopters to aid in mitigating their challenges and further enhance BIM-AR adoption. Originality/value The value of this paper has been the use of the theoretical framework TOE to explain the adoption factors of BIM-AR in the Ghanaian construction industry. The originality of the paper is further anchored in consideration of BIM-AR, which is quite nascent in emerging countries.","[{""name"": ""Michael Nii Addy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Titus Ebenezer Ebenezer Kwofie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Divine Mawutor Agbonani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adikie E.

One approach to produce sustainable designs is upcycling, defined as the salvage and reuse of discarded or found items into new products. This study examines a pedagogical approach for engaging 2nd year undergraduate textile and fashion design students in sustainable fashion design practice. Working in groups, students are challenged to upcycle old clothing into a little black dress, using a keyword as direction for concept, design development, and garment construction techniques. To elevate value in post‐consumer textile waste, it is necessary to develop high‐quality contemporary design outcomes. This teaching approach aims to encourage the revaluation of recyclable resources, the exploration of the creative potential of fabric manipulation techniques, experimental design development, and professional production techniques. This is achieved through the implementation of a design brief that establishes original approaches to upcycling, contrary to the arbitrary processes that are typically used.","[{""name"": ""Angela Burns"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17569370.2016.1148309"", ""10.1108/RJTA-17-02-2013-B011"", ""10.1080/17569370.2016.1227146"", ""10.1080/17569370.2017.1413797"", ""10.1177/0887302X0402200108""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Architecture', 'Museology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0813 建筑学', 0.7506), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7274)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

In a therapeutic setting, engagement in creative and making activities have been associated with improvements in people's well‐being, yet when deploying these as part of co‐design practices, these outcomes are often overlooked. This paper presents the results from a series of workshops that focused on the well‐being benefits of participating in co‐design practices. The research uses Max‐Neef's (1991). Theory of Needs to explore how innate human needs might be satisfied through participation in co‐design practices, and demonstrates how this framework might be used for planning and evaluating co‐design practices through a wellbeing lens. Finally, it suggests that future generations of design practitioners would benefit from exposure to the consideration of co‐design as a process of “welldoing.”","[{""name"": ""Aaron Davis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michelle Tuckey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ian Gwilt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Niki Wallace"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01944366908977225"", ""10.1111/jade.12372"", ""10.1093/pubmed/fdr041"", ""10.1111/jade.12349"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113888"", ""10.4013/sdrj.2021.141.11"", ""10.24404/621CB2143AA4C8889C8A79ED"", ""10.21606/drs.2022.313"", ""10.1111/jade.12427"", ""10.1111/jade.12280"", ""10.5502/ijw.v10i5.1509"", ""10.1016/j.cct.2005.02.003"", ""10.1057/9780312299064"", ""10.1177/1466424006064301"", ""10.7577/formakademisk.1908"", ""10.1080/19452829.2020.1801610"", ""10.1186/s12913-018-3397-y"", ""10.1111/jade.12345"", ""10.1080/15265161.2019.1630498"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9873.001.0001"", ""10.1037/h0054346"", ""10.4324/9780203407448"", ""10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00135"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2016.07.001"", ""10.5751/ES-04554-160430"", ""10.1609/icwsm.v5i1.14105"", ""10.1080/09638288.2017.1278797"", ""10.1145/1900441.1900476"", ""10.5040/9781474250160"", ""10.1080/07293682.2015.1135816"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00207"", ""10.1080/15710882.2019.1654522"", ""10.1108/OIR-08-2014-0188""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Through an historical survey of the development of syllabi and assessment methods, it traces how the role of drawing in the curriculum has changed over the past sixty years. From a series of prescribed observational drawing exercises, the A level exam has evolved into a holistic exploration of each student’s creative process, and drawing is now seen mainly as an integral part of that process. The article demonstrates how the art history element of the syllabus has also been gradually integrated into practice, and thus into the drawing process itself. Questions are raised about how these changes have influenced the nature of the portfolios which students entering higher education bring to interview. In short, this article seeks to answer the question: do we now teach and assess observational drawing skills ‘through a glass darkly’, obscured by other considerations within the art educational curriculum?","[{""name"": ""Chris Owen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3192201"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.1985.tb00155.x"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.1990.tb00483.x"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.1994.tb00723.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

The purpose of the article is to identify the features of the architectural mutual influences of Chinese and European cultures. The method of historical analysis, the method of comparative analysis and the graphoanalytical method are used. The lack of identity between the Chinese and European gardens and the park with the pavilions is proved at the different hierarchical levels. Two groups of European Chinoiserie style pavilions have been identified: which give a false idea of Chinese architectural traditions and which represent a simplified version of those traditions. There is noticed the influence of the traditional Chinese approach to the architectural objects placement in the natural environment on the development of the contextualism concept in Western architecture (since the 1960s) which proclaims its purpose to preserve the natural beauty of the site through careful design that relates to its surroundings. The concept of contextualism is now widely used in the design of small architectural forms in the urban environment and in the design of the architectural environment in general, both in Europe and in China. This is a clear example of mutual enrichment with the ideas of two civilizations, each of which preserves its own culture.","[{""name"": ""Maria Żychowska"", ""affiliation"": [""Cracow University of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Yulia Ivashko"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture""]}, {""name"": ""Peng Chang"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture""]}, {""name"": ""Andrii Dmytrenko"", ""affiliation"": [""National University “Yuri Kondratyuk Poltava Polytechnic”""]}, {""name"": ""Nataliia Kulichenko"", ""affiliation"": [""Prydniprovska State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Mu Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture""]}]","[""10.3866/pku.whxb20000802"", ""10.37188/ope.20223012.1394"", ""10.26789/yljg.2021.12.013"", ""10.22616/j.landarchart.2019.15.08"", ""10.22616/j.landarchart.2019.15.11"", ""10.18686/bd.v2i5.1374"", ""10.26789/yljg.v7i2.1220"", ""10.1007/bf03397033"", ""10.1007/s11712-012-9272-3"", ""10.37155/2717-5162-0312-11"", ""10.37155/2717-5588-0304-46"", ""10.5768/jao202041.0302003"", ""10.1007/s11712-021-09796-7"", ""10.14711/spcol/991013158525503412"", ""10.11834/jrs.1991045"", ""10.11834/jrs.1991045"", ""10.12677/ass.2021.109360"", ""10.3390/su7010747"", ""10.1007/s11712-012-9272-3"", ""10.3866/pku.whxb201404161"", ""10.3788/lop20094608.0048""]",['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0315,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,The effect of CO2 loading on the properties of normal concrete vs fly ash concrete,"Purpose There is an increase in greenhouse gasses and global climate change is frequently reported on. What can be done? Certainly to try and reduce the carbon footprint, which is not a new topic, by encouraging applications and activities for concrete during its lifetime (Portland Cement Association, 2019). This study aims to focus on introducing CO2 to normal and fly ash concrete and thus investigating the effect on the carbon footprint of the samples and the effectiveness of the CO2 introduction methods, namely, carbonated water addition during the mixing process and by means of an infusion pipe directly into the concrete when the samples are casted and have been casted. Design/methodology/approach The feasibility of carbon dioxide storage within concrete is determined by investigating the effects of introduced carbon dioxide into concrete samples and the effectiveness of the concrete at storing carbon dioxide. The concrete was mixed in a 1:3:3 ratio for the OPC or blended 52.5 R cement:sand:stone (22 mm) with a 28 day strength of 50 MPa. Samples were also prepared containing low-grade fly ash cement contents ranging from 15% to 60%. CO2 was introduced to the concrete via carbonated mixing water and an infusion pipe system directly to the hardening concrete cubes. In total, 16 g CO2 bicycle carbon dioxide inflators and valve system were used to infuse the concrete over a period of a week until the canister was emptied with valve release on the lowest setting. A compression test was carried out to determine the strength of the concrete cubes with, and without, the introduction of carbon dioxide. Results were also obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) to determine how the carbon dioxide changed the microscopic composition and chemical composition of the concrete. A microcontroller with carbon dioxide sensors was used to gather carbon dioxide emission data for a period of three months. Findings The compressive strength tests show by introducing carbon dioxide to the concrete, the compressive strength has increased by as much as 13.86% as expected from the literature. Furthermore, by infusing carbon dioxide with the fly ash blended cement, will give a higher strength compared to the control with ordinary portland cement. This correlates to an overall reduction in cost for the structure. The optimal fly ash content for the control with minimal strength degradation is 30%. Where the optimal fly ash content for the concrete with carbon dioxide stored within, is 45%. The SEM analysis showed the concrete with sequestered carbon dioxide has significantly more calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel formation, thus the strength increase. Furthermore, the carbon dioxide emission test showed the concrete with infused carbon dioxide stores carbon dioxide more efficiently compared to the control sample. With the data showing the infused sample releases 11.19% less carbon dioxide compared to the control sample. However, the carbonated water sample releases 20.9% more carbon dioxide when compared to the control sample. Thus the introduction of carbon dioxide by means of infusion is more effective. Practical implications This is a practical pilot investigation of carbon dioxide introduction via two methods, one being infusion of CO2 into normal concrete and fly ash concrete and two, mixing normal and fly ash concrete with carbonated water. These results show, cheaper cement can be used to achieve equivalent or better strength. This can help in the reduction of the construction industry’s carbon footprint. Originality/value By reducing the construction industry’s carbon footprint with this research results, a saving can not only be made financially in the construction industry, but this will help to preserve our environment for future generations.","[{""name"": ""Pierre van Tonder"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Malcolm Shaun Low"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0156"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2012-0033"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.174"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.04.133"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.207"", ""10.1016/j.procbio.2019.08.018"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.424"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.301"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2013.06.530""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The purpose of the article is to identify traditional and innovative elements in the landscaping of modern Ukrainian Orthodox churches.The descriptive method, the graphical-and-analytical method, the methods of historical and comparative analysis were used. The main traditional methods of Ukrainian landscape design of the XVII–XVIII centuries are determined. Examples of traditional landscape design of Polish monasteries are given, taking into account the rather long influence of Polish culture on a large part of Ukrainian territories. The modern landscape techniques in Ukraine based on the use of folk traditions are described and analyzed. Two main directions of modern landscape design of territories around cult buildings are defined – repetition of the established receptions (in ethno-complexes) and creative modernization of architectural forms in combination with landscape design (on examples of newly built churches). It is shown how both methods enhance the properties and aesthetic expressiveness of architecture.","[{""name"": ""Oleg Sleptsov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yulia Ivashko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrii Dmytrenko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michał Krupa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.28925/2311-259x.2016(4)951"", ""10.22616/j.landarchart.2020.17.02"", ""10.17721/2522-4611.2019.40.5"", ""10.1080/02665433.2021.1927158"", ""10.15633/fhc.1358"", ""10.15633/fhc.1336""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

Public spaces within university campuses should constitute an essential component of the learning landscape as arenas of planned and serendipitous encounters, which may foster creativity and trans-disciplinary networking. However, their spatial configurations remain an under-researched topic. This paper assesses the quality of public spaces on campus based on the results of a crowdsensing survey. The Third Campus of Jagiellonian University in Krakow was selected as a case study; this is one of the largest projects of this kind carried out in Poland since the political and economic transformation of 1989. The behaviour of users provides evidence of the generally low quality of the public spaces despite the advantages of the urban layout of the campus. The paper proposes recommendations that may bring the spatial organisation of the campus closer to a fully fledged learning landscape.","[{""name"": ""Jarosław Działek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bartłomiej Homiński"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Magdalena Miśkowiec"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Agnieszka Świgost-Kapocsi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Krzysztof Gwosdz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.12688/f1000research.4702.1"", ""10.1177/00139169921972344"", ""10.1002/geo2.77"", ""10.1177/0739456X04270195"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-06-2018-0109"", ""10.1057/udi.1999.22"", ""10.1057/s41289-018-0070-3"", ""10.1080/13574809.2014.991382"", ""10.1080/14681366.2020.1788124"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-75593-9_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-20967-8"", ""10.1080/02815738608730092"", ""10.1057/palgrave.udi.9000162"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.09.012"", ""10.1177/0263775816680820"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36071-8_2"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.foar.2014.06.006"", ""10.5719/hgeo.2017.112.2"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.09.009"", ""10.21273/HORTTECH.18.2.232"", ""10.3109/13561820.2013.807225"", ""10.1080/07293682.2015.1135810"", ""10.26687/archnet-ijar.v12i2.1611"", ""10.1057/s41289-017-0041-0"", ""10.1089/eco.2013.0103"", ""10.31338/uw.9788323543718"", ""10.3390/ijerph17207421"", ""10.3390/su12219263"", ""10.5719/hgeo.2013.71.21"", ""10.1007/978-94-6091-609-0_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-20684-4_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-69179-4_40"", ""10.1057/s41289-020-00130-w"", ""10.1080/02723638.2018.1481602""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/joid.12234,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,The Presentation of Self in Virtual Reality: A Cognitive Load Study,"The use of virtual reality (VR) in interior design has increased dramatically. Its interactive and visualization benefits are undeniable. Designers, clients, developers, and stakeholders can immerse themselves in future or existing design projects without the need to be physically there. Thanks to more immersive and realistic experiences, the boundaries that separate the physical and the virtual world are becoming nonexistent. Nonetheless, research has focused on the visual characteristics of the virtual space, undermining the consequences for individuals engaged within it. In this study, we assessed the effects on mental workload caused by how individuals visualize themselves in VR using a virtual body (VB). The VB is typically represented by the use of avatars. An experimental setup was carried out with a convenience sample of 72 individuals. Participants interacted in an immersive VR interface with three different conditions of the VB. They were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions and engaged for a period of approximately 20 minutes in tackling a design-like activity. Data were collected through self-report questionnaires in addition to a psychophysiological device accounting for the cognitive load (CL) and task difficulty. The statistical analysis supported differences in CL between conditions. A more detailed visual representation of the VB increased the sensation of being there but contributed extraneous CL that can hinder the task at hand. The findings of this study can guide interior designers in selecting the type of VB they should use for their immersive VR experiences.","[{""name"": ""Luis Mejia-Puig"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Florida, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Tilanka Chandrasekera"", ""affiliation"": [""Oklahoma State University, USA""]}]","[""10.1016/S0004-3702(03)00054-7"", ""10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627113"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2013.00871"", ""10.1126/science.1736359"", ""10.1016/j.concog.2008.02.001"", ""10.1002/hfm.20128"", ""10.18848/2325-1662/CGP/v09i01/38384"", ""10.1145/3131277.3132171"", ""10.1007/978-1-4939-0968-1_2"", ""10.1155/2020/7067846"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_15"", ""10.1016/j.neuron.2011.10.008"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-21716-6_7"", ""10.1186/s41235-016-0039-y"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7221.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.045"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00991.x"", ""10.1037/10692-005"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.049"", ""10.1109/VR.2018.8448293"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0190109"", ""10.3390/app11041475"", ""10.1177/154193120605000909"", ""10.1016/S0166-4115(08)62386-9"", ""10.1080/19488300.2011.609524"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-39907-2_2"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2017.05.004"", ""10.1162/PRES_a_00124"", ""10.2196/21879"", ""10.1207/s15516709cog1804_1"", ""10.1586/ern.10.201"", ""10.1109/ICCECE54139.2022.9712831"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2020.100705"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0709-60"", ""10.1037/h0043158"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2016.38"", ""10.3390/su10041074"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0071275"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_1"", ""10.1007/BF02213420"", ""10.1145/3359996.3364270"", ""10.4324/9781003183105-5"", ""10.1080/15710882.2011.563313"", ""10.1207/S15326985EP3801_3"", ""10.1109/VR51125.2022.00025"", ""10.1145/1180495.1180502"", ""10.1108/00251740610673332"", ""10.1145/1778765.1778829"", ""10.1162/pres.1997.6.6.603"", ""10.1109/VR.2016.7504689"", ""10.1016/0959-4752(94)90003-5"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511844744.004"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-387691-1.00002-8"", ""10.1023/A:1022193728205"", ""10.1007/s10459-016-9725-2"", ""10.14733/cadconfP.2021.324-328"", ""10.1177/001872089303500205"", ""10.3758/BF03196322"", ""10.1162/105474698565686""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

In this paper, we report on the development process as well as the validity and reliability of the Architecture and Interior design domain–specific Spatial Ability Test (AISAT), a new instrument that measures domain–specific spatial ability in the field of architecture and interior design. A total of 142 college students in Korea and the U.S. engaged in the final stage of the development process—the validity and reliability check—by taking both the AISAT and two general spatial ability tests. The results from the split–half correlation and internal consistency showed that the AISAT reached a desirable level of reliability. Face, content, concurrent, and convergent validity were achieved to verify the AISAT. The authors hope that the AISAT will be used to measure domain–specific spatial ability, ultimately expanding our understanding of the role of spatial ability in spatial design thinking and performance. The AISAT has the potential to benefit (1) researchers who seek a credible tool to assess design students’ spatial ability, (2) educators investigating the effect of their intervention in spatial design performance in relation to spatial ability, and (3) researchers in spatial ability who would like to extend their interest in spatial design beyond the traditional psychometric approach.","[{""name"": ""Ji Young Cho"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyung Hee University, South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Joori Suh"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cincinnati, USA""]}]","[""10.1080/10400419.2010.503530"", ""10.20429/ijsotl.2017.110215"", ""10.5455/ijmsph.2013.191120133"", ""10.1080/10382046.2019.1626124"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.609363"", ""10.1002/acp.1182"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8260.1985.tb01312.x"", ""10.1016/0191-8869(91)90115-R"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20969-8_2"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2016.11.006"", ""10.1111/joid.12143"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2012.05.007"", ""10.3200/GENP.134.3.361-381"", ""10.1037/h0046827"", ""10.1016/j.intell.2003.12.001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610448.005"", ""10.1080/00330124.2012.724350"", ""10.18205/kpa.2010.15.4.014"", ""10.3758/BF03200477"", ""10.1080/00221341.2011.583262"", ""10.2307/1130467"", ""10.1007/s10648-012-9215-x"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.86.5.889"", ""10.1111/0004-5608.00160"", ""10.4324/9781315724515"", ""10.1006/brcg.1995.1032"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2018.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2020.100628"", ""10.2466/pms.1978.47.2.599""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-04-2023-0164,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Sustainable building materials utilization in the construction sector and the implications on labour productivity,"Purpose The United Nations has demonstrated a commitment to preserving the ecosystem through its 2030 sustainable development goals agenda. One crucial objective of these goals is to promote a healthy ecosystem and discourage practices that harm it. Building materials production significantly contributes to the emissions of greenhouse gases. This poses a threat to the ecosystem and prompts a growing demand for sustainable building materials (SBMs). The purpose of this study is to investigate SBMs to determine their utilization in construction operations and the potential impact their application could have on construction productivity. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of the existing literature in the field of SBMs was conducted for the study. The search strings used were “sustainable” AND (“building” OR “construction”) AND “materials” AND “productivity”. A total of 146 articles were obtained from the Scopus database and reviewed. Findings Bio-based, cementitious and phase change materials were the main categories of SBMs. Materials in these categories have the potential to substantially contribute to sustainability in the construction sector. However, challenges such as availability, cost, expertise, awareness, social acceptance and resistance to innovation must be addressed to promote the increased utilization of SBMs and enhance construction productivity. Originality/value Many studies have explored SBMs, but there is a dearth of studies that address productivity in the context of SBMs, which leaves a gap in understanding. This study addresses this gap by drawing on existing studies to determine the potential implications that using SBMs could have on construction productivity.","[{""name"": ""Oluseyi Julius Adebowale"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Justus Ngala Agumba"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103299"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0277"", ""10.1108/IJPPM-09-2021-0505"", ""10.35683/jcm20028.78"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2022.104294"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-11-2020-0100"", ""10.3389/fbuil.2022.1014473"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.084"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2021.07.346"", ""10.1007/s12665-021-09439-3"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2021.08.249"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120350"", ""10.1016/j.susmat.2015.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2017.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.051"", ""10.1016/j.enbenv.2021.02.003"", ""10.1115/1.4044564"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2022.09.218"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.12.009"", ""10.3390/su13137376"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.116874"", ""10.3390/ma14082048"", ""10.37934/arfmts.99.1.6689"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1378/2/022045"", ""10.1080/19397038.2020.1821403"", ""10.12913/22998624/149737"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.117149"", ""10.3390/su13137484"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101584"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119884"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.06.063"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119455"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102418"", ""10.1109/JOE.1979.1145428"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.12.002"", ""10.1787/9789264202955-en"", ""10.3390/su9050852"", ""10.3390/ma13245699"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2020.02.225"", ""10.1080/09613210701467040"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/202130901080"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2021.110751"", ""10.1504/IJETP.2017.080621"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.057"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120853"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2022.118374"", ""10.1016/j.esd.2014.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108753"", ""10.3390/su12062485"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109739"", ""10.4236/msa.2016.72008"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.04.214"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2020.06.219"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.03.022"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154077"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.107"", ""10.1016/j.susmat.2020.e00178"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/2385/1/012009"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.12.081"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2022.07.394"", ""10.17580/cisisr.2021.01.16"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2023.01.031"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/1026/1/012011"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.02.040"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2021.12.113"", ""10.35940/ijeat.F8603.088619"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.157"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2021.01.165"", ""10.3390/ijerph14091055"", ""10.29007/f8r3"", ""10.3390/en6083901"", ""10.1080/17452007.2018.1540968"", ""10.3390/su12187427"", ""10.1533/9780857097729.1.38"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2013.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2022.04.866"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.04.038"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.01.081""]",['Engineering'],['Building and Construction'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

However, there is no empirical work about the implementation of BIM in the country. This study aims to critically appraise and document the status of the implementation of BIM in the DR to raise awareness and understand how BIM can be successfully implemented in the country. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was adopted in which data was collected through semi-structured interviews, with the participation of 53 professionals from 36 construction organisations. The data collected was analysed with the method of content analysis. Findings The results confirmed that the DR is a BIM infant country. There are low levels of BIM implementation. The reasons why BIM is not implemented are explored, and a significant interest in implementing BIM in the future was also reported. Drivers to implement BIM include BIM benefits, competitive advantage and pressure from external partners. Current BIM approaches are mainly single-disciplinary, principally in architecture, and the effectiveness and scope of implementation are highly affected by intra-organisational and inter-organisational barriers. Originality/value There is a lack of research about the implementation of BIM in the DR. This study bridges this research gap by collecting primary data from Dominican construction organisations and construction professionals to report findings related to BIM implementation.","[{""name"": ""Ana Karina Silverio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Subashini Suresh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suresh Renukappa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Heesom"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.07.166"", ""10.1080/17452007.2016.1186589"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2020.02.002"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2017-0091"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000127"", ""10.29007/v8xl"", ""10.1016/j.npls.2016.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.11.649"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.10.014"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.09.001"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04569.x"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.083"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.002"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.18235/0003023"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.144"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2015.07.003"", ""10.1108/BIJ-05-2018-0138"", ""10.3390/su12093710"", ""10.4018/IJ3DIM.2017040104"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2014-0124"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2014.10.575"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2008.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.04.018"", ""10.1111/nhs.12048"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.12.004"", ""10.5539/ijms.v7n6p162""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-04-2020-0129,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Statistical analysis of wind resource and energy potential assessment of Quaidabad site, Sindh Pakistan","Purpose Pakistan is an energy starving country that needs continuous supply of energy to keep up its economic speed. The aim of this paper is to assess the wind resource and energy potential of Quaidabad site for minimizing the dependence on fuels and improving the environment. Design/methodology/approach The Quaidabad site wind shear coefficient and turbulence intensity factor are investigated. The two-parameter k and c Weibull distribution function is used to analyze the wind speed of site. The standard deviation of the site is also assessed for a period of a year. The wind power density and energy density are assessed for a period of a year. The economic assessment of energy/kWh is investigated for selection of appropriate wind turbine. Findings The mean wind shear coefficient was observed to be 0.2719, 0.2191 and 0.1698 at 20, 40 and 60 m, respectively, for a period of a year. The mean wind speed is found to be 2.961, 3.563, 3.907 and 4.099 m/s at 20, 40, 60 and 80 m, respectively. The mean values of k parameters were observed to be 1.563, 2.092, 2.434 and 2.576 at 20, 40, 60 and 80 m, respectively, for a period of a year. The mean values of c m/s parameter were found to be 3.341, 4.020, 4.408 and 4.625 m/s at 20, 40, 60 and 80 m, respectively, for a period of a year. The major portion of values of standard deviation was found to be in between 0.1 and 2.00 at 20, 40, 60 and 80 m. The wind power density (W/m2) sum total values were observed to be 351, 597, 792 and 923 W/m2 at 20, 40, 60 and 80 m, respectively, for a period of a year. The mean coefficient of variation was found to be 0.161, 0.130, 0.115 and 0.105 at 20, 40, 60 and 80 m, respectively.

Art is often classified by school leaders, students, parents and even teachers as different from other subjects; sometimes viewed as almost magical, enabling students to explore and develop an innate creativity; sometimes simply unimportant, a therapeutic respite from the more demanding academic subjects. In this article, I trace the problematic relationship between visual arts and educational knowledge. I propose that this dynamic prevents the function of robust assessment systems and constrains equal access. I investigate how my subject has been thus marginalised, with reference to curriculum and policy documents that influence my immediate situation, and turn to the work of educational sociologist Basil Bernstein and his followers, to define the problem and plot a possible future for art education. Bernstein’s model of the pedagogic device, his work on the recontextualisation of knowledge and his concept of pedagogic rights assist me in formulating a case for an articulated conceptual grammar in visual arts education.","[{""name"": ""Bridget Green"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00071005.2011.650940"", ""10.1080/0142569022000038468"", ""10.3998/mpub.7558"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2005.00440.x"", ""10.1080/14703290802176253"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.45.3.0001"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2006.00477.x"", ""10.4324/9780203818251"", ""10.4324/9780203930502"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.12006""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.3233/JID200020,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,Research Strategy in 4D Printing: Disruptive vs Incremental?,"The paper aims at presenting 4D printing as a research-intensive technology from a critical external perspective. It provides a comprehensive discussion on the possible future of this emerging domain and also highlights weaknesses and strengths of applying a disruptive or incremental research strategy. Most scientific research efforts in 4D printing contribute to developing the spectrum of possible changes by investigating stimulus/smart materials combinations with additive manufacturing technologies. Although the current results are spectacular, the performances are still far from the basic requirements expected in the industry. The paper highlights the current limitations and trends towards incremental research strategies and argues in favor of risk-taking and the disruptive nature of research to make leaps that benefit society. Even if transgressive promises are associated with this technology with high growth potential in academic research, where creativity is involved and related invention derived, targeted applications are far from being achieved leading to a risk of the slow death of the field and unsatisfactory innovation. Based on this assessment, it appears that close fields in a situation of possible disciplinary porosity can – with a little openness and some creativity – move away from the current highly self-centered work to try to rekindle 4D printing, provided that risk-taking in interdisciplinary research is better supported. If creativity and interdisciplinary project management for innovation are to be promoted, the organizational context must be conducive to risk-taking for this redeployment.","[{""name"": ""Frédéric Demoly"", ""affiliation"": [""ICB UMR 6303 CNRS, Univ.

The challenges associated with Covid‐19 will make this increasingly difficult. An integrated approach to research and teaching, where students are directly engaged in the production of research, may provide a useful strategy to support ongoing research within the design disciplines whilst befitting student learning. The production of original research requires a willingness to engage in – and manage –uncertainty. Contemporary higher education acknowledges that global challenges are increasing in complexity and, thus, students require opportunities to learn to productively manage this complexity. Utilising teacher observations and student feedback, this article reflects critically on a studio model, iteratively refined over two semesters, with the deliberate intent of exacerbating the complexity already present within studio pedagogy for the production of new knowledge. It outlines a set of strategies for making manageable this uncertainty for students to ensure it is beneficial for their learning. It also identifies a number of challenges educators can face when assuming a duel role as teacher and research partner; and provides advice for negotiating these challenges.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca McLaughlan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alan Pert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jason M.

Our planet is still home to many ‘worlds’ that have resisted the cultural homogenization promoted by colonialism and imperialism. Pluriversality proposes a path for transformational world-building that begins with the belief that alternatives to capitalist modernity are possible. This essay investigates the relationship between the narratives and metaphors a society adopts and the kind of world we design. Pluriversality is focused on creating and nurturing new models of life and reweaving our reality, not on destroying the old. Recognizing and making visible and viable alternatives that enable healthier relationships with nature and each other, particularly the ones created by Indigenous and marginalized communities and peoples of color, is at the core of what pluriversality is about.","[{""name"": ""Renata M.

In developing countries, safety-related problems are amplified, resulting in higher incidences of serious accidents and occupational diseases. This study aims to evaluate employees’ knowledge and attitudes toward occupational health and safety, and how these influence overall occupational health and safety compliance. Ghana’s oil and gas industry provides the contextual backdrop for this research, given it is characterized by high rates of injury. Design/methodology/approach A positivist and deductive research strategy was used to quantitatively analyze both primary and secondary data sources. A structured survey was administered to industry employees, and multiple linear regression was used to establish the effects of employee’s knowledge and attitude toward occupational health hazards on overall health and safety compliance. Findings The findings indicate that most employees had both a high level of knowledge and positive attitude toward mitigating occupational health hazards. Moreover, the study reveals that most employees complied with occupational health safety practices. However, the study also reveals that the effect of employees’ knowledge and attitude toward occupational health hazards does not translate into deployment of comprehensive safety practices. Interestingly, female employees were found to be more knowledgeable and compliant with occupational health and safety practices than their male counterparts. Practical implications Premised upon the findings, the study recommends: implementation of relevant education and training programs encompassing the proper usage of machinery and equipment, tailored hazard safety training appropriate to specific employee job requirements, effective dissemination of risk information and governance initiatives that enforce strict adherence to correct safety procedures. Originality/value The study uniquely examines the influence of employee’s knowledge of health and safety to overall compliance within the oil and gas industry. Cumulatively, the study’s findings and recommendations contribute to improving the occupational health and safety outcomes within the industry.","[{""name"": ""Rhoda Ansah Quaigrain"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""De-Graft Owusu-Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mavis Hammond"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mabel Hammond"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Igor Martek"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.009"", ""10.4314/just.v27i2.33052"", ""10.1080/10803548.2015.1081764"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1819584"", ""10.1186/s40991-017-0016-x"", ""10.3390/buildings11070283"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105284"", ""10.1177/0193945910367229"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2017.12.009"", ""10.1108/17260530810863343"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2015.10.031"", ""10.1108/13552519810369057"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.08.012"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2018-0125"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-09-2020-0079"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-804111-6.00007-8"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-12-2019-0111"", ""10.1348/014466610X486347"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2018.12.010"", ""10.5539/ijbm.v11n5p146"", ""10.1155/2020/6354895"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2020-0016"", ""10.3390/ijerph18105064"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000423"", ""10.1108/F-03-2018-0039"", ""10.1177/09504222211044894"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2017-0032"", ""10.1108/IJWHM-11-2018-0147"", ""10.1108/17260531111151069"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2017-0017"", ""10.2478/picbe-2018-0056"", ""10.11648/j.jhrm.20170505.11"", ""10.1108/ECAM-10-2020-0880"", ""10.1016/j.shaw.2014.10.006"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0201"", ""10.1186/s12939-021-01394-6"", ""10.5539/jms.v7n1p11"", ""10.11648/j.hep.20170203.17""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Health Professions', 'Decision Sciences']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-03-2021-0143,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Neural network-based estimation of lighting condition in indoor environment with improved brain storm algorithm,"Purpose For decades, continuous research work is going on to maximize the power harvested from the sun; however, there is only a limited analysis on exploiting the microwatt output power from indoor lightings. Microelectronic system has power demand in the µW range, and therefore, indoor photovoltaics would be appropriate for micro-energy harvesting appliances. “Energy harvesting is defined as the transfer process by which energy source is acquired from the ambient energy, stored in energy storage element and powered to the target systems”. The theory of energy harvesting is: gathering energy from surroundings and offering technological solutions such as solar energy harvesting, wind energy collection and vibration energy harvesting. “The solar cell or photovoltaic cell (PV), is a device that converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect”. Factors such as light source, temperature, circuit connection, light intensity, angle and height can manipulate the functions of PV cells. Among these, the most noticeable factor is the light intensity that has a major impact on the operations of solar panels. Design/methodology/approach This paper aims to design an enhanced prediction model on illuminance or irradiance by an optimized artificial neural network (ANN). The input attributes or the features considered here are temperatures, maxim, TSL, VI, short circuit current, open-circuit voltage, maximum power point (MPP) voltage, MPP current and MPP power, respectively. To enhance the performance of the prediction model, the weights of ANN are optimally tuned by a new self-improved brain storm optimization (SI-BSO) model. Findings The superiority of the implemented work is compared and proved over the conventional models in terms of error analysis and prediction analysis. Accordingly, the presented approach was analysed and its superiority was proved over other conventional schemes such as ANN, ANN-Levenberg–Marquardt (LM), adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and brainstorm optimization (BSO). In addition, analysis was held with respect to error measures such as mean absolute relative error (MARE), mean square root error (MSRE), mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. Moreover, prediction analysis was also performed that revealed the betterment of the presented model. More particularly, the proposed ANN + SI-BSO model has attained minimal error for all measures when compared to the existing schemes. More particularly, on considering the MARE, the adopted model for data set 1 was 23.61%, 48.12%, 79.39% and 90.86% better than ANN, ANN-LM, ANFIS and BSO models, respectively. Similarly, on considering data set 2, the MSRE of the implemented model was 99.87%, 70.69%, 99.57% and 94.74% better than ANN, ANN-LM, ANFIS and BSO models, respectively. Thus, the enhancement of the presented ANN + SI-BSO scheme has been validated effectively. Originality/value This work has established an improved illuminance/irradiance prediction model using the optimization concept. Here, the attributes, namely, temperature, maxim, TSL, VI, Isc, Voc, Vmpp, Impp and Pmpp were given as input to ANN, in which the weights were chosen optimally.

10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0201,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Multi-criterion analysis based on integrated process-risk optimization,"Purpose This paper aims to propose a process optimization approach showing how organizations are able to achieve sustainable and efficient process optimization, based on integrated process-risk analysis using several criteria to a better decision-making. Design/methodology/approach Several approaches are used (functional/dysfunctional) to analyze how processes work and how to deal with risks forming multi-criteria decision-making. In addition, a risk factor is integrated into the structured analysis and design techniques (SADT) method forming a novel graphical view SADT-RISK; it identifies process’s failures using the traditional failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) and economic consideration “failure mode and effect, criticality analysis-cost FMECA-C” making a multi-criterion matrix for better decision-making. Subsequently, some recommendations are proposed to overcome the failure. Findings This paper illustrates a methodology with a case study in a company, which has a leading brand in the market in Algeria. The authors are integrating a varied portfolio of approaches linking with each other to analyze, improve and optimize the processes in terms of reliability and safety to deal with risks; reduce the complexity of the systems; increase the performance; and achieve a safer process. However, the proposed method can be readily used in practice. Originality/value The paper provides a new approach based on integrated management using new elements as an innovative contribution, forming a novel graphical view SADT-RISK; it identifies process’s failures using the traditional FMECA and economic consideration “a new multi-criterion matrix for better decision-making and using the SWOT analysis – Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats – as a balance to decide about the process improvement”. The authors conclude that this methodology is oriented and applicable to different types of companies such as financial, health and industrial as illustrated by this case study.","[{""name"": ""Rima Derradji"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rachida Hamzi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/9781118280294.ch1"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-25109-2_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38709-8_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-45348-4_22"", ""10.1109/HICSS.2008.211"", ""10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411973"", ""10.1109/SITA.2013.6560815"", ""10.1109/ICoCS.2014.7061003"", ""10.1109/MEI.2009.4802594"", ""10.5815/ijisa.2013.01.02"", ""10.3182/20130619-3-RU-3018.00225"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92898-2_20"", ""10.1109/ARES.2010.79"", ""10.1109/TSMCC.2007.905812"", ""10.1007/s11668-015-9986-8"", ""10.1109/IECON.2003.1280336"", ""10.1007/11678564_42""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
10.1386/adch_00031_1,ART DESIGN & COMMUNICATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION,1305 Design,Monster aesthetics as an expression of decolonizing the design body,"Institutionalized design education aims at training the human body to become a design body, a subject capable of designing according to aesthetic canons. In colonized territories, the modern canon predominates over indigenous, vernacular and other forms of expression. Manichaeism, utilitarianism, universalism, methodologism and various modern values are inculcated in the design body as if it did not have any. The colonization of design bodies makes young designers believe that once they learn what good design is, they need to save others from bad design. This research reports on a series of democratic design experiments held in a Brazilian university that questioned these values while decolonizing the design body. Comparing the works of design produced in the experiment with some works of art from the Neoconcrete movement, we recognize a characteristic form of expression we call monster aesthetics: a positive affirmation of otherness and collectivity that challenges colonialists’ standards of beauty and goodness.","[{""name"": ""Rafaela Angelon"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000102920044 Federal University of Technology – Paraná (UTFPR)""]}, {""name"": ""Frederick van Amstel"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000102920044 Federal University of Technology – Paraná (UTFPR)""]}]","[""10.1145/2930871"", ""10.1080/14626268.2020.1802295"", ""10.1386/adch.16.1.117_1"", ""10.1590/1980-4415v32n61a21"", ""10.29147/dat.v5i1.181"", ""10.1177/0268580900015002005"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2005.06.001"", ""10.1590/es0101-73302017165522"", ""10.1080/17547075.2018.1434368"", ""10.1386/adch.18.1.113_1"", ""10.1386/adch_00031_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the different dimensions of Syrian refugees’ location choices at the urban/neighbourhood level. Specifically, we aimed to understand the dynamics behind the growing tendency among Syrian refugees in Turkey to settle in neighbourhoods that are close to inner-city industrial sites by conducting two case studies in the Önder neighbourhood of Ankara and the Yunusemre neighbourhood of İzmir in a comparative manner. From the twenty-three interviews conducted with Syrians, we uncovered the themes of LC and categorized them in accordance with the dimensions of LC addressed in the literature. We identified three main dimensions that affected Syrians’ location choices at the neighbourhood level as: economic (the availability of job opportunities, public and commercial services, the affordability of accommodation), socio-cultural (the existence of co-ethnics, kinship/ethnic relations) and socio-spatial (proximity to the city centre, transportation, public and commercial services, workplaces). Here, we acknowledged the intertwined relation between these dimensions and refugee subjectivity in LC.","[{""name"": ""Feriha Nazda Güngördü"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000405955447 Çankaya University""]}, {""name"": ""Zerrin Ezgi Kahraman"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000405955447 Çankaya University""]}]","[""10.1386/ijia_00049_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

To reduce this menace, this study aims to evaluate the factors affecting health and safety practices on construction sites to improve health and safety practices. Design/methodology/approach First, this study reviewed previous studies to derive the factors affecting health and safety practices on construction sites, and based on the literature review, the 50 factors identified were used in developing the questionnaire that was administered to construction professionals. The returned questionnaire was then analysed using fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE). Findings According to the FSE results, inadequate safety planning has the highest critical value, followed by management failure, inadequate safety promotion, safety ignorance, poor supervision and enforcement, a casual attitude towards safety and insufficient experience. The analysis showed that the overall criticality of the factors to the Malaysian construction industry is high, suggesting that if addressed, the health and safety practices of the industry will be improved. Originality/value The study provides a holistic approach to the factors affecting health and safety practices in the construction industry using a method that has not been used by previous researchers. The findings will furnish decision makers in the construction industry with practical approaches to adapt and reinforce in the industry to improve health and safety practices.","[{""name"": ""Olatoyese Zaccheus Oni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""AbdulLateef Olanrewaju"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Soo Cheen Khor"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1051/shsconf/20141101003"", ""10.3390/ijerph18168469"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.01.029"", ""10.1080/10803548.2014.11077064"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000292"", ""10.3390/ijerph15061251"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.03.060"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2013.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2011.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2015.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.01.009"", ""10.3846/jcem.2020.11926"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0159"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/291/1/012018"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1529/4/042079"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.124"", ""10.12691/ajcea-3-5-5"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.04.014"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2004.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.11.042"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2014.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2011.07.005""]","['Engineering', 'Health Professions', 'Decision Sciences']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

A renewed analysis of this influential event demonstrates that it featured a network of distinct – though often interlinked – installations that come under the label of 'Islamic art', situated across a complex site. These included national initiatives, such as L'Égypte des Khalifes, sponsored by the ruling Khedive of Egypt, and the purpose-built Pavillon de la Perse, constructed by master-builders dispatched from Qajar Tehran. Commercial undertakings included a display of Vincent Robinson's Iranian carpets in the British India section. At the Galerie orientale curated by Albert Goupil in the Palais du Trocadéro, other objects loaned from private collections were presented. Common across these various displays was persuasively staged architecture. This article argues for the centrality of architectural salvage and reconstruction in the early history of private and public displays of Islamic art. By examining the different individuals who created both L'Égypte des Khalifes and the Galerie orientale, article proposes a new assessment of an elite domestic culture, pursued by affluent bachelor aesthetes of the period, with many modern resonances.","[{""name"": ""Moya Carey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mercedes Volait"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Archeology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)]]"

The methodology of the research approach used a quasi-experiment through questionnaire surveys and physical measurements of indoor air parameters to associate correlation and deduction. A technical college building in Saudi Arabia was used for the case study. The study developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model to define and predict relationships between teachers' performance and IAQ. Findings This paper contains a detailed investigation into the impact of IAQ via direct parameters (relative humidity, ventilation rates and carbon dioxide) on teacher performance. Research findings indicated an optimal relative humidity with 65%, ranging between 650 to 750 ppm of CO2, and 0.4 m/s ventilation rate. This ratio is considered optimum for both comfort and performance Originality/value This paper focuses on teacher performance in Saudi Arabia and used ANN to define and predict the relationship between performance and IAQ. There are few studies that focus on teacher performance in Saudi Arabia and very few that use ANN in data analysis.","[{""name"": ""Hamdan Alzahrani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Arif"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amit Kant Kaushik"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Qasim Rana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hani M.

10.1111/joid.12195,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Effective Critique Through Affective Peer Engagement,"The critique in design education is founded on philosophical traditions that have remained embedded in pedagogical practices as a mode for assessing and developing students’ ability to communicate processes and ideas. Research, however, indicates that the traditional critique may not always be effective at aligning with or supporting contemporary learning and professional practice. As a discipline, interior design is inherently related to and reliant on interpersonal relationships, collaboration, communication, and empathy, all of which require cognitive skills along with inclusion of the affective domain. While the term “affect” is typically associated with emotional reaction in absence of reason, as a taxonomy of learning it involves social and emotional development through levels of “receiving,” “responding,” “valuing,” “organizing,” and “characterizing.” Building on research related to design critiques and diverse disciplinary perspectives on peer review, we investigated the affective domain of learning as a framework to reconceive critique pedagogies and practices in a fourth–year (40 students) and a first–year (35 students) interior design studio. As a generative and constructive process to engender dynamic conversation as well as active engagement, results revealed enhanced and effective learning outcomes as well as higher levels of skills and attributes essential for active, critical, and engaged professionals. The process also exposed implications for future research and exploration.","[{""name"": ""Helen Turner"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Kentucky, USA""]}]","[""10.1108/00197850010320699"", ""10.1111/jade.12042"", ""10.1386/adch.5.2.83_1"", ""10.2307/901128"", ""10.20429/ijsotl.2019.130308"", ""10.1080/03634520500213165"", ""10.20429/ijsotl.2008.020212"", ""10.1177/1050651907311923"", ""10.1080/03634523.2015.1058488"", ""10.1007/s10798-017-9424-1"", ""10.1386/adch.12.2.195_1"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2007.tb00320.x"", ""10.1080/87567555.1993.9926781"", ""10.1111/joid.12086"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2017-0079"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352654"", ""10.1007/BF00373956"", ""10.1080/03634520500076885"", ""10.1080/03634523.2015.1064144"", ""10.1080/03634523.2015.1058489"", ""10.1080/02602938.2013.795518"", ""10.1162/104648800564608"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2012.08.004"", ""10.1386/adch.2.3.143/0"", ""10.1080/0260293042003243896"", ""10.1007/s10798-013-9238-8"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1353024"", ""10.1080/13562517.2011.590977"", ""10.11120/jebe.2011.06010044"", ""10.1016/j.profnurs.2018.12.004"", ""10.1386/adch.16.2.145_1"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2006.00495.x""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

The mixture of Na2SiO3and NaOH was used as a liquid alkaline activator in geopolymerization. The ESP and FA content were varied as 30, 50 and 70% and Na2SiO3/NaOH ratios were varied as 0.5, 1 and 2. Geopolymer samples were cured at three heat conditions: 25°C (ambient temperature), 50°C and 80°C for seven days prior to durability tests.FindingsThe results of this study revealed that the strength loss of the geopolymer decreases with an increase in curing temperature up to 50°C and then increases for higher temperature up to 80°C. Further, the strength loss of the geopolymer decreases with an increase in FA replacement and Na2SiO3/NaOH ratio. Geopolymer composites exhibited early strength development because of the inclusion of calcium-rich ESP. The weight loss of the ESP–FA geopolymer follows a similar pattern of strength loss. Geopolymer samples previously cured at optimum heat condition of 50°C for seven days exhibited higher durability.Originality/valueThe inclusion of calcium-rich ESP in FA-based geopolymer is novel research. As ESP–FA geopolymer composites show higher mechanical strength and higher durability compared to Indian standards, the potential use of this geopolymer can be in road subbases/subgrades.","[{""name"": ""Poonam Shekhawat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gunwant Sharma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rao Martand Singh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3923/jas.2005.1474.1478"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.03.010"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.03.150"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.159"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2008.06.023"", ""10.1007/s11440-012-0200-9"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.10.049"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.06.037"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2005)17:5(544)"", ""10.1007/BF01912193"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2008.02787.x"", ""10.14445/22315381/IJETT-V14P214"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2009.11.003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000370"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.078"", ""10.28991/cej-2019-03091226"", ""10.14419/ijet.v7i4.30.22307"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.04.021"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2018.11.019"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.06.581"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0001526"", ""10.1007/s13369-014-1093-8"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(98)00243-9"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.07.018"", ""10.1080/14680629.2015.1132632"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.07.103"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.07.325"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2011.01.018"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.11.015"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002809"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.07.091"", ""10.1007/s40515-018-0056-z""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0242,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Developing an analytic hierarchy process-based decision model for modular construction in urban areas,"Purpose Modular construction is considered a well-established construction method for improving the efficiency of the construction industry worldwide. However, the industry struggles to achieve higher levels of modularisation in urban areas. Previous studies on decision-making for modularisation have, so far, not focussed much on its application in urban areas. As modular construction could bring lots of advantages such as speed of construction, This study aims to develop a decision-making tool that can assist the project planners in deciding whether the modular construction techniques should be applied in their urban area project. Design/methodology/approach Based on the literature review, a total of 35 decision-making factors of modularisation were identified for this study. The decision-making model is then developed to evaluate the significance of each factor using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach. A total number of 72 valid responses were obtained and analysed. The geometric mean of priorities is adopted to obtain the par-wise comparison between the critical factors in which each factor’s weighting in the decision-making model is calculated. Afterwards, the robustness of the decision-making model is demonstrated by the real-life projects in China, Hong Kong and the UK, respectively. Findings A total of 35 decision-making factors allocated in five criteria for modular construction selection in urban areas were identified. The criteria include site attributes, project characteristics, labour consideration, environmental and organisation and project risk. Their impact was calculated using the AHP to indicate the relative importance with respect to the adoption of modularisation in urban areas. Afterwards, a two-level decision-making model was developed that can be used as a decision-making tool for the adoption of modular construction. Practical implications The outcome of this research will be beneficial to industrial practitioners and academics in understanding the critical attributes that affect the adoption of modular construction in an urban area. It further enables the building professionals to assess the feasibility of using modular construction in their projects, especially at the early stage, so as to facilitate its use. Originality/value There is a number of literature on the decision-making model on the adoption of modular construction. However, previous studies did not provide specific concerns related to urban areas, whereas there is an urgent need to have an updated analysis that can be catered to the modular construction in the urban area. In this research study, the 35 decision-making factors were ranked by the experienced project managers and then a pair-wise comparison was conducted. With this information, the robust decision-making model is formulated to offer a kept promised indicator in adopting modularisation in the urban area.","[{""name"": ""Michael Sing"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joseph Chan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henry Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nancy N.H.

In which we identify the strengths and weaknesses of technological capabilities and work to improve them. Design/methodology/approach In this research, we investigate the capability level of technological construction for power plant equipment industries in Iran based on the development of a domestic model. In this study, more than 80 industry experts have filled the questionnaire that was designed based on the AHP method to measure the technological level of the industry. The result has shown the overall technology level about 63.26%. Based on this investigation, the technical capability in this industry is in the “C” class. However, the strategic, R&amp;D and innovation capabilities of the industry have ranked the highest in the dimensions of technological capabilities. Findings Because overall level of technological innovation capabilities in the industry is 63.50%, construction of power plant equipment industries in Iran is among the industries that are on the way to being strategic or class C industries. Industries in class C (strategic class) have proper insight into the way of promoting their technological capabilities. They are highly ability in project implementation and a strategic view of capability-building. Owing to a transparent priority attitude, these industries are able to formulate strategies and increase their internal capabilities in management and technical areas. Although industries in class C are able to react to new environment-orientated technological regulations quickly and effectively, they need a new policy for increasing innovation in leadership sections, and they need better access to capital and service goods. Class C industries take advantage of strategic awareness focused on the latest technologies required for mid and long term, and they need the support of other industries and institutions for development of technology among small- and medium-scale and other less-developed industries. These industries transcend technological boundaries in most areas and are able to turn into class D (innovative and creative) industries gradually. To this end, considering the ranking, strategic and R&amp;D capabilities, as well as learning and innovation capabilities, rank the highest among other aspects of technological innovation capabilities for industries. Thus, the improvement projects of industries should be of a higher priority and implemented quickly. Originality/value This article can be used as a model developed for technology-based companies in the field of power plant and energy supply in developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Abbas Khamseh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Parisa Marei"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.techfore.2017.07.010"", ""10.1108/IMDS-08-2017-0350"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.10.038"", ""10.1504/IJSTM.2019.098206"", ""10.1016/S0160-791X(02)00035-0"", ""10.1016/j.futures.2018.06.018"", ""10.1080/13547860500071493""]","['Engineering', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

This paper explores the importance of a decolonial pedagogical framework in visual art and design education by disrupting epistemic injustice through employing creative body‐based learning (CBL). This approach focuses on relationality and inter‐subjectivity through embodied strategies that create encounters to explore pluralist worldviews. Finally, by employing the cognitive, affective and aesthetic domains within a learning design, the paper argues for a decolonising approach to visual art and design education that embodies deep listening, dialogic meaning making and standpoint theory.","[{""name"": ""Belinda MacGill"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2478/jped-2014-0001"", ""10.1007/978-94-6091-512-3"", ""10.1515/9780748642441-002"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-2023-0"", ""10.4324/9780203113059"", ""10.21977/D97110007"", ""10.1080/08929090903281451"", ""10.2307/j.ctv36xw0wt"", ""10.1002/9780470756119.ch54"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00309230600552013"", ""10.1353/nlh.2013.0003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199256044.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1016/j.tate.2012.10.010"", ""10.18432/ari29413"", ""10.4324/9781003175988"", ""10.1177/2381336919870805"", ""10.1177/117718011401000101"", ""10.1007/s13384‐020‐00389‐6"", ""10.1177/0013124519896861"", ""10.2307/j.ctt7snkj.6"", ""10.1177/11771801221085353"", ""10.1080/17449642.2015.1039274""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

The purpose of the article is to compare the historical gardens and modern parks of China in order to determine the continuity and at the same time the features of innovation. The main difference between historical gardens and modern parks is emphasized: historical gardens were aimed at creating a calm, serene atmosphere of contemplation of nature; modern parks often combine traditional landscape techniques and the function of entertainment. The main historical landscape techniques provided for the presence of a lake and artificial mountains as symbols of immortality, a constant change of views, contemplation of the landscape through the opening as a picture in a frame, the inclusion of a small garden in the large, partitioning the space with ""green screens"". Modern parks in China still inherit these techniques in general: they have reservoirs, a lot of greenery, park pavilions, but there are already views from distant points, the parks are surrounded by a wall of skyscrapers, entertaining attractions have appeared in them, and in the evenings they are illuminated with bright illumination. Despite their attractiveness and modernity, the atmosphere of the Chinese garden has changed from a secluded personal to a public character, as can be seen in the examples of modern parks in Xi'an and Hong Kong.","[{""name"": ""Yulia Ivashko"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture""]}, {""name"": ""Peng Chang"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture""]}, {""name"": ""Polina Zueva"", ""affiliation"": [""Moscow Institute of Architecture (State Academy)""]}, {""name"": ""Yang Ding"", ""affiliation"": [""Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture""]}, {""name"": ""Tetiana Kuzmenko"", ""affiliation"": [""National University “Yuri Kondratyuk Poltava Polytechnic”""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Archeology'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0219,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Construction project performance: the role of client knowledge and procurement systems,"Purpose This study aims to investigate whether clients’ knowledge about construction procurement systems influence project performance objectives and the role of procurement systems on project performance objectives in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach Using a two-round survey, 90 usable questionnaires from construction professionals in South Africa plus 3 expert clients were collected. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics – means, percentages and the analytical hierarchy process to determine the rank of client project performance criteria, while inferential statistics – Pearson product-moment correlation was used in establishing the relationship between the level of clients’ knowledge and project performance. Findings It was found that the common procurement systems used are traditional, followed by management-oriented and integrated procurement systems. In addition, it emerged that client’s knowledge of procurement systems shows a positive relationship with the achievement of project performance objectives. Based on these findings, it is concluded that some procurement systems being selected by clients in South Africa are inappropriately selected. This is despite the emergence of more efficient procurement systems. If procurement systems are selected based on the knowledge of the client, it will give better chances of a successful project outcome. Practical implications The research suggests the need for clients to seek ways to improve their understanding or increase their knowledge of procurement systems in construction. Policymakers’ responsibilities in driving policies that will place responsibilities on clients to seek a reasonable way to improve their knowledge where possible is implied in the study. Originality/value It contributes to improving project performance by examining whether the level of knowledge possessed by a client influences project performance.","[{""name"": ""Abimbola Windapo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdulrauf Adediran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Olabode Bamidele Rotimi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nnedinma Umeokafor"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2478/otmcj-2018-0003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2000)126:3(176)"", ""10.3846/1392-3730.2008.14.1"", ""10.28945/3561"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(99)00026-5"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2002)18:3(120)"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.10.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1999)125:3(142)"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2003.06.001"", ""10.1080/01446190802244789"", ""10.1080/0144619032000056144"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.01.003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2003)129:4(382)"", ""10.1080/096132198369832"", ""10.1016/S0360-1323(00)00011-1"", ""10.1080/01446190500126866"", ""10.5772/intechopen.81673"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1588842"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2019.06.007"", ""10.4038/besl.v7i2.1943"", ""10.1287/inte.24.6.19"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2019-0130"", ""10.4102/ac.v12i1.127"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2005.10.018"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2016-0152"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2004.04.028"", ""10.1080/01446199100000027"", ""10.1155/2013/709423""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2022-0017,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Conceptual review study of working capital management practices in the construction industry: trends and research prospects in Ghana,"Purpose The concept of working capital management (WCM) has been a fundamental financial accounting term that has evolved in financial theory for centuries. Given that the construction industry (CI) is financially dynamic, there is an imperative need to understand its WCM practices. The call for the industry players to adhere to efficient financial management practices as a result of a huge financing gap requires consented effort. This study aims to explore the trend of practices of WCM in the CI and elicit a broader polemic dialogue about this crucial theme. Design/methodology/approach The source of information for the study was secondary mainly from referenced journals and international conference papers published on WCM relating to the CI. A three-step sample selection strategy was adopted to identify the range and scope of publications on WCM in the CI based on the systematic literature review method. Findings The CI cannot boost of enough empirical WCM research to gain in-depth understanding of its practical trend. The developing economies are failing to produce insightful peer-reviewed papers on WCM to assist in bridging the infrastructural financing gap through apposite strategies. Gaining appropriate knowledge of the short-term financial operations through a conceptualization of WCM practices in the CI may lead to better strategies formulated for smooth operations. Originality/value This is a pioneering paper in developing economies that have taken stock of WCM knowledge of the practical trend in the CI. Future research prospects in which WCM matters can use it as a reference point.","[{""name"": ""Emmanuel Asare"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""De-Graft Owusu-Manu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joshua Ayarkwa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David John Edwards"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/15623599.2020.1819584"", ""10.5897/JEIF2013.0539"", ""10.1108/MF-07-2016-0186"", ""10.1177/026465608300100404"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.09.025"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.02.032"", ""10.1080/014461998372006"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.12.007"", ""10.1108/IJHMA-11-2014-0048"", ""10.1108/eb013737"", ""10.9744/ced.22.1.37-46"", ""10.1108/17439130710738718"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490627"", ""10.1016/S1044-5005(03)00022-2"", ""10.1111/j.1936-4490.1999.tb00187.x"", ""10.1108/eb021135"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0193"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2020-0016"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2971477"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2020-0013"", ""10.1108/09555349810221844"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.02.008"", ""10.1108/eb001430"", ""10.1177/0266242696142004"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.08.009"", ""10.1111/joes.12299"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-09-2017-0036"", ""10.1108/QRFM-04-2013-0010"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2020-0289"", ""10.1080/0950069042000243727"", ""10.2174/1874836820130716002"", ""10.1108/13664381211274362"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2016-0006"", ""10.1108/09600030210430651"", ""10.1108/19355181200500007"", ""10.2307/3666040"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6288.1974.tb01453.x"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.03.098"", ""10.1007/BF02920497"", ""10.1177/0972150919865104"", ""10.29333/djfm/5874"", ""10.1108/eb027318"", ""10.1108/IJPPM-12-2012-0130"", ""10.1504/IJAMS.2012.044868"", ""10.1016/S1042-444X(01)00047-0""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Accounting', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

In this respect, the roles of design studio teachers in design education literature are seen rather dispersed. In this study, an integrative literature review of studies was conducted by examining pedagogical roles of design teachers within the frame of the learning processes (cognition, affection and psychomotor). This systematic review aims at wrapping up the literature on the design teacher’s pedagogical role and scrutinizing and mapping the contribution of the design teacher’s pedagogical role in learning processes. The articles reviewed were analysed in terms of their importance given to learning processes through the radar charts. With a critical lens, this review is expected to contribute both to nurture the practice of design teachers and to inform design education literature. Via this, design teachers can get informed and through the mappings offered in this study, and they can also explicitly appreciate their roles and strategies in their design studio courses.","[{""name"": ""Pelin Efilti"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012174543X Istanbul Technical University""]}, {""name"": ""Koray Gelmez"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012174543X Istanbul Technical University""]}]","[""10.1016/j.foar.2019.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2015.12.007"", ""10.17548/ksaf.2015.12.22.207"", ""10.26687/archnet-ijar.v10i1.767"", ""10.1080/03075079112331383081"", ""10.1016/S0169-2046(02)00063-4"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip3901_5"", ""10.1111/jade.12042"", ""10.1007/s10798-011-9181-5"", ""10.1080/03634520500213165"", ""10.1080/10464883.1987.10758461"", ""10.1386/adch.7.1.31_1"", ""10.1007/s10798-017-9424-1"", ""10.1017/S089006041000020X"", ""10.1016/j.ijedudev.2005.03.003"", ""10.2307/1319799"", ""10.1207/s15430421tip4104_2"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.1994.tb00194.x"", ""10.1080/10464883.1985.10758354"", ""10.58680/la198824992"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.1996.tb00661.x"", ""10.1162/104648800564608"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2012.08.004"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00029-5"", ""10.1080/13574809.2020.1734449"", ""10.2307/1319543"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00034-9"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.07.002"", ""10.1080/10464883.1984.10758345"", ""10.1080/10464883.1988.10758496"", ""10.1080/07294360903384269"", ""10.1177/1534484305278283"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(99)00002-2"", ""10.1386/adch.2.3.101/0"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2006.00495.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03621.x"", ""10.1386/adch_00041_1""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1017/S1359135520000275,ARQ-ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Briefing a children's hospice: bridging the evidence gap and redefining value in contemporary healthcare design,"Increasingly, healthcare providers are asking for evidence based design solutions in the construction of new facilities. But where does a designer begin when there is no credible evidence to support the design process because it has yet to gain the attention of researchers? Within this paper we reflect on a university-practice partnership undertaken to provide a feasibility study for the future redevelopment of an eight-bed paediatric hospice in Australia. In embarking on this project, the project team assumed that a thorough literature review would furnish a body of research to rigorously inform the feasibility study. The realisation that this research was not available necessitated an evidence gathering process from first principles, where methods from academic practice required translation and customisation to fit within commercial time frames and resourcing constraints. This article recommends a selection of research methods for use by architects working within healthcare settings where foundational research to inform the design process is not available. It also argues for a re-conceptualisation of the built environment’s value relative to wellbeing.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca McLaughlan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alan Pert"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions']","['Architecture', 'Speech and Hearing', 'Conservation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0813 建筑学', 0.7506), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7274)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

10.3233/JID-220002,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,An investigation of the design process's effect on a high-performance building's actual energy system performance,"The design intent and the performance targets of projects may sometimes fail to match a building’s actual post-occupancy performance. The mismatch of intended and actual building performance can be attributed to multifarious reasons. This study focuses on the role of project decisions made during design as one of the reasons of shortfall. The aim of the study is to unveil the design decision-making process of a state-of-the-art research building through the analysis of project’s available set of IDP (Integrated Design Process) documentation. To understand the relationship and correlation between the energy performance gap and the decision-making process of the case building, we investigated the design decisions’ effect on the actual performance. The particular emphasis is on the decisions that were based on assumptions rather than measured actual test data for the proposed innovative building systems. The designed heat recovery system, which was dependent on recovered heat from the neighboring research building, had a significant effect on the building’s poor energy performance. We investigated collected project data from coordination meetings, thoroughly analyzed project documentation, and quantified the building’s actual energy performance data. The analysis of the project information shows the ripple effect of decisions that were made based on assumptions, that triggered shortfalls in the building’s overall actual performance. Our qualitative analysis indicates that the poor system performance during operations was related with the design decisions that were not based on the measurement of the actual performance of the existing systems in the neighboring building. The performance of the heat recovery from the neighboring building as a highly dependent Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) analyzed through collected documents and data. The ambiguity of the available heat potential from the neighboring building and related testing issues defined on an explanatory timeline of process coding. The conclusion includes recommendations for the design decision-making process for innovative system integrations for high-performance buildings, and underlines the importance of IDP for complex buildings.","[{""name"": ""Belgin Terim Cavka"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Interior Architecture and Environmental Design, Yaşar University, Izmir, Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Hasan B.

Following a literature review, a draft Digital Industrial Design (DID) strategy that focuses on the core design activities of sketching, drawing, model making, and prototyping was generated. A paper‐based, theoretical model was established and presented to graduating students, academics and practitioners. The results indicated that, while graduating students were interested in employing an approach based entirely on digital methods, the majority had doubts about its capacity to replace conventional and hybrid methods. The removal of paper‐based sketching, the conventional hands‐on experience when model making, and the cost of digital tools were identified as primary concerns. Although academics believed that the future of industrial design programmes would become increasingly digital, it was identified that current programmes were failing to exploit the opportunities afforded by these technologies fully.","[{""name"": ""Noor Aldoy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Andrew Evans"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.destud.2012.09.001"", ""10.2752/175630611X13046972590923"", ""10.1201/9781315275246"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(02)00032-7"", ""10.1504/JDR.2018.092810"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00002-7"", ""10.1111/jade.12079"", ""10.1080/14606925.2016.1196091"", ""10.1016/S0924-0136(03)00510-7"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2015.07.007"", ""10.1017/S0890060409000213"", ""10.1108/10748120110424816"", ""10.1016/j.cag.2005.10.014"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2010.06.004"", ""10.1080/16864360.2006.10738470"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2004.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2005.06.002""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0488,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Advanced pest detection strategy using hybrid optimization tuned deep convolutional neural network,"Purpose Agriculture is the backbone of a country, contributing more than half of the sector of economy throughout the world. The need for precision agriculture is essential in evaluating the conditions of the crops with the aim of determining the proper selection of pesticides. The conventional method of pest detection fails to be stable and provides limited accuracy in the prediction. This paper aims to propose an automatic pest detection module for the accurate detection of pests using the hybrid optimization controlled deep learning model. Design/methodology/approach The paper proposes an advanced pest detection strategy based on deep learning strategy through wireless sensor network (WSN) in the agricultural fields. Initially, the WSN consisting of number of nodes and a sink are clustered as number of clusters. Each cluster comprises a cluster head (CH) and a number of nodes, where the CH involves in the transfer of data to the sink node of the WSN and the CH is selected using the fractional ant bee colony optimization (FABC) algorithm. The routing process is executed using the protruder optimization algorithm that helps in the transfer of image data to the sink node through the optimal CH. The sink node acts as the data aggregator and the collection of image data thus obtained acts as the input database to be processed to find the type of pest in the agricultural field. The image data is pre-processed to remove the artifacts present in the image and the pre-processed image is then subjected to feature extraction process, through which the significant local directional pattern, local binary pattern, local optimal-oriented pattern (LOOP) and local ternary pattern (LTP) features are extracted. The extracted features are then fed to the deep-convolutional neural network (CNN) in such a way to detect the type of pests in the agricultural field. The weights of the deep-CNN are tuned optimally using the proposed MFGHO optimization algorithm that is developed with the combined characteristics of navigating search agents and the swarming search agents. Findings The analysis using insect identification from habitus image Database based on the performance metrics, such as accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, reveals the effectiveness of the proposed MFGHO-based deep-CNN in detecting the pests in crops. The analysis proves that the proposed classifier using the FABC+protruder optimization-based data aggregation strategy obtains an accuracy of 94.3482%, sensitivity of 93.3247% and the specificity of 94.5263%, which is high as compared to the existing methods. Originality/value The proposed MFGHO optimization-based deep-CNN is used for the detection of pest in the crop fields to ensure the better selection of proper cost-effective pesticides for the crop fields in such a way to increase the production. The proposed MFGHO algorithm is developed with the integrated characteristic features of navigating search agents and the swarming search agents in such a way to facilitate the optimal tuning of the hyperparameters in the deep-CNN classifier for the detection of pests in the crop fields.","[{""name"": ""Prajakta Thakare"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ravi Sankar V."", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compeleceng.2016.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.micpro.2020.103607"", ""10.1108/17260531111179915"", ""10.1109/TDSC.2010.25"", ""10.4018/IJSESD.290310"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0504"", ""10.1016/j.compag.2016.02.003"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2018-0117"", ""10.1109/TWC.2002.804190"", ""10.1007/s11277-019-06740-0"", ""10.1016/j.compag.2020.105522"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2007.05.007"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2017-0026"", ""10.1007/s11276-015-1039-4"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2015.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2015.07.006"", ""10.1007/s10489-017-1019-8"", ""10.1016/j.jcde.2019.01.001"", ""10.1145/3232651.3232661"", ""10.1080/08839514.2020.1792034"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0216"", ""10.1002/9781119785521.ch13"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2017.07.006"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-7394-1_60"", ""10.1002/dac.4525"", ""10.1016/j.compag.2020.105222"", ""10.1080/10798587.2013.823783"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2014.10.008""]",['Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],"['Plant Science', 'Insect Science']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('0904 植物保护', 0.7302), ('0907 林学', 0.7243)]]"

The optimisation was initiated by developing a mathematical model to formulate the objective function. Findings Based on the case study, the proposed GA model was able to reduce the total cost of production. The cost was reduced by 73.09% compared to the existing system. Besides, the production time of the proposed model is within the capacity of both companies; hence, no penalty cost is imposed. Practical implications The proposed GA model has been implemented and tested to minimise production costs in the Indonesian furniture industry.

10.1108/JEDT-03-2023-0097,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A hybrid machine learning approach for early cost estimation of pile foundations,"Purpose This study aims at proposing a hybrid model for early cost prediction of a construction project. Early cost prediction for a construction project is the basic approach to procure a project within a predefined budget. However, most of the projects routinely face the impact of cost overruns. Furthermore, conventional and manual cost computing techniques are hectic, time-consuming and error-prone. To deal with such challenges, soft computing techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms are applied in construction management. Each technique has its own constraints not only in terms of efficiency but also in terms of feasibility, practicability, reliability and environmental impacts. However, appropriate combination of the techniques improves the model owing to their inherent nature. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a hybrid model by combining machine learning (ML) techniques with ANN to accurately predict the cost of pile foundations. The parameters contributing toward the cost of pile foundations were collected from five different projects in India. Out of 180 collected data entries, 176 entries were finally used after data cleaning. About 70% of the final data were used for building the model and the remaining 30% were used for validation. Findings The proposed model is capable of predicting the pile foundation costs with an accuracy of 97.42%. Originality/value Although various cost estimation techniques are available, appropriate use and combination of various ML techniques aid in improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed model will be a value addition to cost estimation of pile foundations.","[{""name"": ""G. Deepa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A.J.

10.1108/JEDT-07-2021-0345,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A hybrid approach for identifying and prioritizing critical success factors in technology transfer projects (case study: diesel locomotive manufacturing),"Purpose With the rapid advancement of technology, companies use new technologies to produce their products and services to maintain a competitive advantage. As companies alone cannot research and develop their technologies, they should use knowledge sources outside the organization that may exist throughout the world; hence, organizations need technology transfer. Because the success rate of technology transfer projects is low, the need to accurately assess and investigate the critical success factors of technology transfer projects is felt. In this regard, this study aims to identify and prioritize the critical success factors in technology transfer projects. Design/methodology/approach In this research, 56 critical success factor (CSF) were extracted from the context of the articles and were adjusted using experts’ opinions in different phases, as well as the fuzzy-Delphi approach. Finally, 15 factors were categorized in the form of steps of the technology transfer model: STAGE-GATE. In the next step, the set of criteria needed to prioritize CFSs was extracted from the literature and finalized with the help of the experts. Then, how each of the CSF influences the identified criteria was scored according to the organization’s export opinions. Finally, the priority of each key success factor was calculated using the additive ratio assessment (ARAS) method. Findings The results obtained for prioritization of the critical success factors show that experience in technology transfer in the transferee company, the existence of experienced technology transfer managers, sufficient organizational infrastructure and documenting project problems, achievements and experiences are four critical success factors of the technology transfer projects. Considering the long-term and short-term specific goals of the technology transfer process and the choice of technology in line with the company’s commercial strategy are also the critical success factors with the next priorities. Originality/value The combination of ARAS and step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis methods for identifying and prioritizing managerial decisions in the high-tech industries is a value of this research. Also, a combination of novel multi-attribute decision-making methods by the older framework of new product development is another contribution of this research.","[{""name"": ""Navid Mohammadi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jalil Heidary Dahooie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohamadreza Khajevand"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106557"", ""10.3846/20294913.2013.814606"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2006.10.003"", ""10.1007/s10961-012-9283-6"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101517"", ""10.1080/09537325.2019.1657568"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(90)90040-I"", ""10.1080/08956308.2018.1421380"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118522"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2006.01.011"", ""10.1177/000271628145800102"", ""10.1016/j.catena.2015.07.020"", ""10.18052/www.scipress.com/ILSHS.62.173"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119770"", ""10.5437/08956308X5503048"", ""10.3846/20294913.2014.881435"", ""10.1002/hfm.20713"", ""10.3390/sym10020045"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.05.008"", ""10.1386/tmsd.17.1.49_1"", ""10.3846/jbem.2010.12"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.03.209"", ""10.1142/S1363919621500183"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2009.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.12.030"", ""10.1007/s10961-016-9532-1"", ""10.1504/IJBSR.2020.104151"", ""10.1504/IJBSR.2021.113409"", ""10.1080/03075079.2021.1896802"", ""10.1016/0024-6301(89)90089-7"", ""10.1504/IJTTC.2003.003173"", ""10.1080/14778238.2019.1678415"", ""10.1007/BF02371355"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.163"", ""10.1002/csr.2046"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119906"", ""10.1142/S0219622020500376"", ""10.1504/IJSSCA.2020.110976"", ""10.1504/IJTTC.2002.001784"", ""10.3846/jcem.2010.30"", ""10.1016/S1644-9665(12)60141-1"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2013.06.040""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

In a well-conceived BEP, the MIDP facilitates collaboration among stakeholders. However, current approaches to generating MIDP are manual, making it tedious, error-prone and inconsistent, thereby limiting some expected benefits of BIM implementation. The purpose of this study is to automate the MIDP and demonstrate a collaborative BIM system that overcomes the problems associated with the traditional approach. Design/methodology/approach A BIM cloud-based system (named Auto-BIMApp) involving naming that automated MIDP generation is presented. A participatory action research methodology involving academia and industry stakeholders is followed to design and validate the Auto-BIMApp. Findings A mixed-method experiment is conducted to compare the proposed automated generation of MIDP using Auto-BIMApp with the traditional practice of using spreadsheets. The quantitative results show over 500% increased work efficiency, with improved and error-free collaboration among team members through Auto-BIMApp. Moreover, the responses from the participants using Auto-BIMApp during the experiment shows positive feedback in term of ease of use and automated functionalities of the Auto-BIMApp. Originality/value The replacement of traditional practices to a complete automated collaborative system for the generation of MIDP, with substantial productivity improvement, brings novelty to the present research.

This article investigates young children’s cultural engagement and wellbeing within a festival experience – as creators making work for an exhibition at the festival, and as consumers participating in theatre, dance and festival activities. The case study involved 105 children (64 girls and 41 boys, aged 7 years 11 months to 9 years 1 month) and used a mixed methods approach incorporating quantitative surveys, qualitative focus groups and participant observation. Though the surveys did not show any changes in children’s views of wellbeing before, during or after the festival, focus group conversations revealed almost unanimous perspectives of positive wellbeing after the festival. The findings indicate that children’s wellbeing is a complex phenomenon that may be best explored using composite standpoints of children, teachers, parents and artists for achieving a clearer understanding.","[{""name"": ""Barbara Piscitelli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/183693911003500203"", ""10.1177/1757913912466946"", ""10.1186/s12889-015-2672-7"", ""10.3102/0002831217701830"", ""10.1111/cdev.12884"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.05.015"", ""10.1080/17533015.2012.712979""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

A Holistic Approach to Six-Year-Old Children's Art Experiences,"AbstractThe case study is a part of the research and art‐based developmental project Rinnalla (Side by Side) – Mentors of Arts‐ and Narrative‐based Approaches as a Support for Social‐Emotional Learning and Growth in Early Childhood Education, where arts and narrative‐based methods were used to support children’s social‐emotional growth in early childhood education. This research focuses on six‐year‐old children’s experiences of a fairy tale and music based on H.C. Andersen’sThe Ugly Duckling. The research questions are: (1) How do children express the emotions they experience while listening to a fairy tale and music? (2) How do the children express and build their peer relationships through communication while drawing? The intervention was implemented in a preschool group of 15 children. The data included around 120 minutes of recorded video and 30 drawings. The holistic and context‐sensitive interpretation method of visual analysis was used to analyse the data. The interpretation demonstrated the importance of peer relationships and offered insight into the context significance. By drawing together and telling small stories in a shared time and place, the children negotiated their roles within the small group. They strengthened friendships and built peer relations. The drawing situation probably exposed pre‐existing tensions between the children, and the children showed interest, support, care, and willingness to welcome others. The music and fairy tale experiences allowed children to process emotions and share their current daily lives.","[{""name"": ""Päivi Granö"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Serja Turunen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03004430.2020.1717480"", ""10.1515/TEXT.2008.018"", ""10.2304/ciec.2005.6.1.11"", ""10.5406/28315081.19.1.11"", ""10.4135/9781849209823.n1"", ""10.1016/j.jsp.2011.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.04.004"", ""10.1080/00043125.2006.11651589"", ""10.1080/17405629.2016.1196178"", ""10.1080/1350293X.2017.1380888"", ""10.1080/09518398.2012.762481"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2015.1102864"", ""10.1080/10409289.2013.745183"", ""10.1007/s10643-016-0798-6"", ""10.1177/8755123312473609"", ""10.4324/9780203854679""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Education']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

This article examines attempts between 2007 and 2020 to establish Muslim cemeteries in four white, English-speaking, Christian-majority (WEC) countries, and the resulting backlash as a geographic form of Islamophobia. These countries are England, Scotland, Australia, and the United States. By drawing theoretically on the geographies of Muslim minorities, Islamic necrogeographies, and theories of Islamophobia and whiteness, we engage five case studies to provide a detailed examination of the Islamophobic objections to attempts to establish Muslim cemeteries. More specifically, we analyse the discursive strategies contained in the speech of hostile locals as presented in newspaper articles. Our analysis identifies a number of key themes mobilized by cemetery opponents to frame the burial sites as a threat to suburban or rural space, often in environmental terms.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0104,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Wind flow on and around U-shaped buildings,"Purpose This paper presents the numerical examination of wind pressure distributions on U-plan shaped buildings having four different depth ratios (DR) as 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 over wind incidence angle (WIA) of 0°. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of irregular building form, DRs, distances from the reentrant corner, wind velocity values on and around wind pressure distributions of the buildings. With this aim, ANSYS Fluent 20.0 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program is used for the analysis. Design/methodology/approach Four U-shaped buildings having the same height, width and wing length but having different DR in plan were analyzed by the application of CFD package of ANSYS 20. With this purpose, wind pressure distributions on and around U-plan shaped buildings were analyzed for the wind velocity values of 2 and 5 m/s over WIA of 0°. Comprehensive results were obtained from the analyses. Findings While the change in the DR values did not create a significant change in positive pressure coefficients on A and E surfaces, negative pressure values increased as the DR decreased. The negative pressure coefficients observed on the A and E surfaces become higher than the positive pressure coefficients with the decrease in the DR. On contrary to that condition, with the decrease in the DR, G surfaces take higher positive pressure coefficients than the negative pressure coefficients. The reason for this is that the DR decreases and negative pressure values on G surface significantly decrease. The effect of the DR on the pressure coefficients is remarkable on B and D surfaces. The negative pressure coefficients on the B and D surfaces tend to increase as the DR decreases. Research limitations/implications This study focused on DRs and wind velocity values effect on pressure coefficients to limit variables. Different building wing dimensions did not take into account. Originality/value Although there are a number of studies related to wind behavior of irregular plan shaped buildings, irregular building forms have not been extensively investigated parametrically, especially in terms of the effect of DR on wind pressures. This study is therefore designed to fill this gap by analyzing impacts of various parameters like building shape with various DRs, WIA and wind velocity values on wind pressure distributions and velocity distributions on and around the building.","[{""name"": ""Tugba Inan Gunaydin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0167-6105(02)00152-6"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002686"", ""10.12989/was.2018.26.2.099"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2007.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2005.08.008"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2013.08.003"", ""10.1093/jcde/qwaa095"", ""10.1177/1369433220906934"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106583"", ""10.1007/s12273-019-0583-8"", ""10.1007/s12205-019-1929-6"", ""10.12989/was.2014.19.5.523"", ""10.13189/cea.2021.090313"", ""10.1007/s12046-021-01592-6"", ""10.1007/s42107-020-00265-9"", ""10.1016/0167-6105(93)90308-B"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2008.02.058"", ""10.12989/was.2021.32.3.227""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

This will contribute towards circular economy which has gained momentum in recent years throughout the world. Design/methodology/approach Waste materials cause enormous environmental problems that can have an adverse effect on the environment. Recycling of waste consists an important part of the circular economy. Therefore, researchers have been investigating the economic use of a variety of waste materials for reducing their environmental impact. One potential usage is in road subbase fill materials where wastes can be incorporated in large quantities. In this study, the engineering properties of road subbase fill materials (i.e. kaolinite) mixed with Granite Waste (GW), coal Fly Ash (FA) and lime are investigated. Kaolinite was replaced with 15% lime and FA, whereas the GW replacement varied from 10% to 20%. Testing included strength of the various soil compositions subjected to different curing times. Also the microstructural analyses and phase changes of samples were conducted using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques, respectively. The results obtained indicate that GW can be incorporated in road base materials to improve its bearing capacity. The mixture consisting of 15% lime, 15% FA, 20% GW and 50% kaolinite resulted in maximum dry unit weight and optimum moisture content. Using GW exhibited a noticeable increase in the California Bearing Ratio of more than eight times at 1 day and 28 days curing regime compared with the control sample. Findings This study shows that GW and FA can be used for road subbase materials and can contribute toward a better and cleaner environment. Originality/value In this study, the engineering properties of road subbase fill materials (i.e. kaolinite) mixed with GW, coal FA and lime are investigated.

10.1111/jade.12343,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Visual Instruction to Enhance Teaching of Technical Subject to Design Students,"AbstractVisual instruction complementing verbal lectures is known to promote learning among students. In this study, the role of visual instruction in engaging learners effectively via the simplification of technical concepts was examined. Different aspects of visualisation, such as order of presenting and dimensionality, were tested to observe their effect on students’ approach to learning and learning outcomes. In this mixed‐method quasi‐non‐experimental explanatory study, visual instruction was applied in one of the undergraduate architecture modules that teaches fundamentals of building systems, which students often find difficult to comprehend. Three key variables, including spatial cognitive ability, approach to learning and learning outcomes, were measured using statistically valid instruments along with students’ feedback and interviews. These factors were also measured for the control group that did not receive visual instruction (n = 32), to assess the effect of the intervention. When taught with visualisation, students (n = 69), showed a significant increase in deep approach to learning (e.g., deep motive: t = 2.584, p = 0.011). In interviews, students expressed a deeper interest in the subject and reported that the topic was engaging in class. Visualisation favours students with a higher spatial ability and, thus, is useful for design students who receive spatial ability training in the course. Two‐dimensional visuals must be followed and preceded by three‐dimensional visuals to provide advanced organisation and the connection of new knowledge with known organisational models to be made.","[{""name"": ""Siu‐Kit Lau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Noopur Joshi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ming Fai Pang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3991/ijoe.v14i09.8734"", ""10.1007/BF01680526"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.1993.tb01038.x"", ""10.1348/000709901158433"", ""10.1007/s00897970138a"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2004.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.paid.2018.08.009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511571312"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2016.07.003"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01643.x"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00089.x"", ""10.3758/BF03200867"", ""10.1007/s10648-010-9126-7"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.042"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00180.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_64"", ""10.1007/s10648-004-0002-1"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.1976.tb02980.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811678"", ""10.4324/9781315736419"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.82.4.715"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.86.3.389"", ""10.1016/j.cedpsych.2008.04.002"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02747.x"", ""10.1111/j.1937-8327.1993.tb00572.x"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.2012.02066.x"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.1991.tb00984.x"", ""10.1111/j.2044-8279.1984.tb00846.x"", ""10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532836""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Sydney’s Metro mega transportation infrastructure is used as a case study. Sydney’s Metro was selected because of its sustainability challenges faced because of the areas’ diverse ecological zones. Sydney’s Metro is thus examined as the basis of best practice for the determination of the sustainability factors of transportation infrastructures. Design/methodology/approach Using the significance matrix as a methodology, this research evaluates the environmental impact assessment and environmental assessment processes, to alleviate the problems of the mega transportation infrastructure. Findings This research found that a more comprehensive determination is needed to further analyse the sustainability factors of mega transportation infrastructures, use of a significance matrix would further assess the environmental complexities of mega transportation infrastructures and the sustainability factors of mega transportation infrastructures should include a nonlinear and asymmetrical scheme highlighting its components and carefully outlining its integration and consolidation. Originality/value Although there is concurrent research into sustainability factors of mega transportation, this paper undertakes a new methodology for such infrastructure. While the significance matrix is not a new concept, it has never been used specifically for mega transportation infrastructure. Subsequently, using the significance matrix as a methodology, this research undertakes such environmental analysis and assessment and thus produces a qualitative risk analysis matrix. The findings from this research will ultimately assist the key stakeholders of mega transportation infrastructures to better plan, monitor and support similar projects.","[{""name"": ""Koorosh Gharehbaghi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kerry McManus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maged Georgy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ken Farnes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Francesca Pagliara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matt Myers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.trd.2021.102734"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2013.04.056"", ""10.1016/S0195-9255(03)00093-3"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2017.04.032"", ""10.1016/j.eiar.2006.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2021.102731"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.051"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2018-0117"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2018-0223"", ""10.1504/WRITR.2020.106926"", ""10.1016/j.envsoft.2003.12.020"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2014.03.006"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000246"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2021.102716"", ""10.1111/j.1745-5871.2012.00759.x"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2015.02.008"", ""10.1007/s10531-006-9100-3"", ""10.1016/S0195-9255(00)00056-1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70223-0_5"", ""10.1177/0739456X15595866"", ""10.1109/MIS.2007.4338487""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Ecology', 'Transportation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('0713 生态学', 0.7889), ('0907 林学', 0.7722)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

The case demonstrates how music and dance became a new tradition that nurtures a collective attachment to the Plazuela and contributes to it being regarded as heritage. The privately initiated revitalisation borrows potency from prior nostalgic memories and traditions to overpower the past notoriety of the square. Dance and music, besides creating pleasant associations, effectively build a network of friendships that engages people in the square and through which the history of the place becomes remembered. All these effects deepen the meaningfulness of the Plazuela, which fosters personal affection towards the square and ultimately, it is proposed, translates into a general appreciation—a lesson to be learned for emerging urban planning practices.","[{""name"": ""Fernando Gutiérrez H."", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ilkka Törmä"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4324/9780080489025"", ""10.3828/tpr.48.4.f646k8765512762n"", ""10.1057/udi.2015.17"", ""10.1177/0042098007085100"", ""10.2307/462374"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.12091"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1g69z0m.10"", ""10.1006/jevp.2000.0185"", ""10.22201/fa.14058901p.2016.32.56194"", ""10.24275/WQWC5867"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226774497.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203118597"", ""10.3758/MC.38.1.102"", ""10.3758/s13421-015-0573-8"", ""10.4324/9780203001219"", ""10.2307/3338699"", ""10.1068/a311547"", ""10.7560/747135"", ""10.5822/978-1-61091-567-0"", ""10.1057/s41289-019-00087-5"", ""10.1017/S0261143012000062"", ""10.3828/tpr.48.3.g58m031x54655ll5"", ""10.4324/9780203884539"", ""10.1177/009614428100800102"", ""10.1068/a251131""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Their strong links with other sectors of the economy have a multiplier effect on any country’s growth. However, the construction business, especially for SMCs, is not an easy business as several roadblocks affect their sustenance. This study aims to examine the factors affecting the sustainable competency of SMCs emerging from the business environment in which the Ethiopian construction industry (CI) operates. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted to identify 39 factors arising from five core sources (i.e. government policies, regulatory frameworks, industry networks, competitive bidding culture and construction technology and innovation). A questionnaire survey was conducted to gather industry stakeholders’ perceptions of the identified factors, and the results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings Findings indicate 37 significant factors affecting sustainable competency arising from five sources, and the top factors from their respective sources were unfavorable financial policy; unfavorable economic regulatory framework; lack of trust between parties in the industry; inability of SMCs to compete with bigger construction companies; and poor linkages between CI and research and development institutions. Furthermore, factor analysis identified 12 components, and the top ones were competition and uncertainties in the supply chain; unsuitable bidding environment; and ineffective industry networks. Originality/value The findings will contribute to the body of knowledge on the factors affecting the sustainable competency of SMCs in the Ethiopian CI.

Undefined lands present a compelling area for landscape research, aesthetical experience, and development of cities which discuss irregular and unexpected aspects in landscape settings. Having lacked a formal definition of undefined land, this study aims at proposing keywords of undefined lands, a comprehensive review of knowledge, and definition. In order to promote new aspects of such spaces in the future research, the study conducts a systematic analysis of 65 peer-reviewed papers for their temporal trends, locations, methods, key authors, and commonly studied aspects. Results show the production of vacancy and the temporary use of undefined lands as an opportunity, and a flexible method of regeneration. An increase in publications over the past 30 years demonstrates that leftover space is an evolving subject. Although socio-ecological aspects are the most effective, serious gaps are mentioned in the literature considering aesthetical and ecological qualities in leftover spaces formed by visual, sensorial (hearing, touch, smell, taste), and cognitive perception. These gaps in the literature suggest that it is important to understand the potential effects of repurposing citizen's ideas about interventions in which to use leftover spaces. Having identified the knowledge gaps, undefined lands are suggested as a significant sub-discipline in landscape research.","[{""name"": ""Maryam Naghibi"", ""affiliation"": [""Iran University of Science and Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Mohsen Faizi"", ""affiliation"": [""Iran University of Science and Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Ekhlassi"", ""affiliation"": [""Iran University of Science and Technology""]}]","[""10.1111/0735-2166.00058"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2016.11.015"", ""10.21837/pmjournal.v16.i7.512"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2009.06.005"", ""10.69554/ITKG5645"", ""10.3390/su4061154"", ""10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5[80:shiuer]2.0.co;2"", ""10.1016/s0169-2046(02)00149-4"", ""10.3368/lj.33.1.17"", ""10.1177/0096144214563502"", ""10.1080/13604810050147857"", ""10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.04.002"", ""10.4324/9780203799574"", ""10.1136/injuryprev-2012-040439"", ""10.1007/s11524-012-9782-7"", ""10.4135/9781526441867"", ""10.4324/9780203834381"", ""10.1016/j.progress.2009.09.001"", ""10.1080/10511482.2011.585164"", ""10.1007/s10021-001-0101-5"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2013.05.005"", ""10.3390/su8050486"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2017.10.022"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2015.05.003"", ""10.3390/su8040296"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2017.09.014"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2020.102730"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.05.003"", ""10.3390/su10051513"", ""10.1002/ldr.3125"", ""10.1080/01426397.2017.1355446"", ""10.1177/0265813515599981"", ""10.1080/08941929709381034"", ""10.1080/01426397.2017.1355445"", ""10.1177/0042098017705546"", ""10.1177/0042098017705546"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2019.04.017"", ""10.1177/0308518x15599294"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.10.008"", ""10.1080/18626033.2016.1188578"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2013.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2016.05.018"", ""10.1080/01426397.2017.1363877"", ""10.1080/1747423x.2016.1162861"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2017.10.005"", ""10.3368/lj.36.1.37"", ""10.1080/13574809.2016.1167589"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08299-8_13"", ""10.1080/01426397.2017.1372398"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2013.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2010.04.007"", ""10.1016/s0921-8009(00)00217-2"", ""10.1080/07294360.2013.841651"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-73412-5_7"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2003.10.035"", ""10.1111/j.1936-704X.2007.mp136001006.x"", ""10.1080/01426397.2011.647898"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2014.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2016.07.002"", ""10.1080/01944360802354956"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000154"", ""10.69554/GPPW4508"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.02.011"", ""10.1057/9780230117204"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2017.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2013.10.008"", ""10.5751/ES-01573-110112"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2016.07.016"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2018.10.014"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2018.10.014""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Urban Studies', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"
10.3233/JID-220011,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,"Transdisciplinary Team Science in Health Research, Where Are We?","Modern medicine and healthcare systems focus on diagnosing, treating, and monitoring diseases in clinical practice. However, contemporary disease burden is driven by chronic diseases, whose determinants occur across multiple levels of influence, from genetics to changes in the natural, built environments to societal conditions and policies. Conventional discipline-specific approaches are useful for the discovery and accumulation of knowledge on single causes of disease entities. Multidisciplinary collaborations can facilitate the identification of the causes of diseases at multiple levels, while interdisciplinary collaboration remains limited to transferring tools from one discipline to another, perhaps creating new disciplines (molecular epidemiology, etc). However, these forms of disciplinary collaboration fall short in capturing the complexity of chronic disease. In addition, these approaches lack sufficient power to generate knowledge that is translatable into implementable solutions, because of their failure to provide a holistic view limited their ability to capture the complexity of real-world problems. Transdisciplinary collaborations gained popularity in health research in the 1990 s, when disciplinary researchers began to develop integrated research frameworks that transcended discipline-specific methods. Using cancer research as an example, this position paper describes the nature of different disciplinary collaborations, reviews transdisciplinary research projects funded by the US National Cancer Institute, discusses frameworks to develop shared mental models in teams and to evaluate transdisciplinary collaboration, highlights the role of team science in successful transdisciplinary health research, and proposes future research to develop the science of team science.","[{""name"": ""Lin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Cancer Research and Analytics, Cancer Care Alberta, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Canada"", ""Departments of Oncology and Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Brittany Shewchuk"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Cancer Research and Analytics, Cancer Care Alberta, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Ce Shang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology Division, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jung Ae Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Sarah Gehlert"", ""affiliation"": [""Suzanne Dworak-Peck School, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA""]}]","[""10.1093/ntr/ntp112"", ""10.1057/s41599-017-0039-7"", ""10.1177/00333549141291S206"", ""10.1111/1467-8721.ep10773005"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2017.09.010"", ""10.22545/2015/0126"", ""10.1016/0277-9536(90)90074-3"", ""10.1080/19371910903241124"", ""10.2165/0115677-200816060-00003"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2008.03.035"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2011.10.011"", ""10.1007/s13142-012-0167-y"", ""10.5751/ES-03802-160146"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61766-8"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.85.2.273"", ""10.1080/14622200310001625537"", ""10.1007/s10552-013-0150-z"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32203-7"", ""10.22545/2015/00070"", ""10.22545/2017/00083"", ""10.1177/1555343416682891"", ""10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1214"", ""10.1007/s10552-005-0546-5"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2008.05.002"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2021.784200"", ""10.1038/s41558-021-01058-x"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2006.102525"", ""10.1186/1471-2288-13-84"", ""10.1002/cne.920180503""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.3233/JID-220003,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,The vision of self-evolving computing systems,"Computing systems are omnipresent; their sustainability has become crucial for our society. A key aspect of this sustainability is the ability of computing systems to cope with the continuous change they face, ranging from dynamic operating conditions, to changing goals, and technological progress. While we are able to engineer smart computing systems that autonomously deal with various types of changes, handling unanticipated changes requires system evolution, which remains in essence a human-centered process. This will eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status quo, we put forward an arguable opinion for the vision of self-evolving computing systems that are equipped with an evolutionary engine enabling them to evolve autonomously. Specifically, when a self-evolving computing systems detects conditions outside its operational domain, such as an anomaly or a new goal, it activates an evolutionary engine that runs online experiments to determine how the system needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby evolving its architecture. During this process the engine can integrate new computing elements that are provided by computing warehouses. These computing elements provide specifications and procedures enabling their automatic integration. We motivate the need for self-evolving computing systems in light of the state of the art, outline a conceptual architecture of self-evolving computing systems, and illustrate the architecture for a future smart city mobility system that needs to evolve continuously with changing conditions. To conclude, we highlight key research challenges to realize the vision of self-evolving computing systems.","[{""name"": ""Danny Weyns"", ""affiliation"": [""Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium and Linnaeus University, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Thomas Bäck"", ""affiliation"": [""Leiden University, The Netherlands and NORCE Norwegian Research Centre, Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Renè Vidal"", ""affiliation"": [""Johns Hopkins University, USA and NORCE Norwegian Research Centre, Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Yao"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Birmingham, UK and Southern University of Science and Technology, China""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Nabil Belbachir"", ""affiliation"": [""NORCE Norwegian Research Centre, Norway""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-35813-5_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-72522-0"", ""10.1109/MC.2009.326"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24774-6_3"", ""10.1002/smr.319"", ""10.1145/3089649.3089656"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2256797"", ""10.1109/TEVC.2017.2669638"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2020.2985293"", ""10.1145/3204459"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-04425-0_36"", ""10.1504/IJAOSE.2016.080896"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72062-9_22"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2012.02.033"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35813-5_9"", ""10.1109/MC.2004.175"", ""10.1080/00401706.1969.10490657"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2017.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2017.04.001"", ""10.1023/A:1018990005598"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-08738-2_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54432-3_5"", ""10.1109/MC.2003.1160055"", ""10.1109/MIC.2019.2906528"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2017.2731741"", ""10.1016/S0020-0190(03)00382-X"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2014.12.027"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-802855-1.00003-4"", ""10.1016/j.cosrev.2020.100308"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-56345-9_13"", ""10.1109/5254.769885"", ""10.1145/3205455.3205497"", ""10.1016/j.neunet.2019.01.012"", ""10.1021/acssensors.8b00276"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-13499-0"", ""10.1016/j.jss.2015.12.015"", ""10.1145/1516533.1516538"", ""10.1109/MS.2020.3006970"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2011.2161529"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00262-6_9"", ""10.1109/TII.2018.2873186"", ""10.1109/TII.2018.2873186"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107751"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-79629-6_7"", ""10.1002/9781119574910"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-74183-3_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_4"", ""10.1145/1809049.1809078"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2015.2503119"", ""10.1016/j.future.2016.06.034""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Some factors are critical to CSMC development. Hence, following the restrictions occasioned by the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, this study reviewed and examined these factors to understand their level of influence in the remote development of CMSC adopted by the industry within and post the disruptions induced by the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a quantitative and descriptive research method. Data were sourced from 155 completed and usable survey questionnaires with registered and licensed engineering and construction professionals practicing in both private and public sectors in Nigeria. Participants were drawn from the membership database of the Nigeria Society of Engineers. Findings The identified critical success factors (CSFs) are categorised into organisational factors which include leadership, engineering project networks and eLearning, measurement and review system, strategy and resources, organisational culture, tradition and structure. In addition to individual factors in this order of influence; willingness to learn, promotion and career development, obtaining certified qualification and obtaining respect of peers are CSFs of remote development of CMSC in Nigeria. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to identify and examine the CSFs to remote development of CMSC tailored to developing countries in Africa. It explored the two categories of CSFs in both remote and traditional CMSC developments and established that the organisational factors remain positively dominants in traditional as well as in remote development of CMSC. It further ranked the individual factors in their order of influence in Nigeria, offered insights into motivation of construction management trainees in developing countries and offered areas of improvements such as quality of training and certification.","[{""name"": ""Uzor Onyia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Charles Egbu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Subashini Suresh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suresh Renukappa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.504"", ""10.1007/s10639-020-10219-y"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2015-0144"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.11.056"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.01.014"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.051"", ""10.1016/j.jhtm.2017.01.002"", ""10.1108/JMD-03-2013-0046"", ""10.1108/09699980410558494"", ""10.1108/EJTD-09-2013-0093"", ""10.1177/0170840610372203"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2018.12.047"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2017-0079"", ""10.1080/03043797.2017.1415298"", ""10.1007/s12205-016-1233-7"", ""10.1108/MD-07-2014-0464"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949044"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.02.027"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5915.1989.tb01421.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.07.006"", ""10.1108/02635570510590101"", ""10.1108/13665629910300478"", ""10.1016/j.iedeen.2017.04.001"", ""10.1111/1468-2370.00053"", ""10.1108/02635570010273018"", ""10.1108/03090590010321205"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2008.05.003""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Much more rapidly, design methods are being embraced by legal institutions as a means reforming everything from commercial legal product lines to civil court forms. What explains the rapid embrace of legal design when digital legal technology took decades to break through? We think that a deliberately human-centered approach to law helps explain the sudden advantageousness of legal design. But what must be done about the bias and inequity that is embedded within the legal systems we seek to redesign, and within the legal design movement itself? We propose that a radical iterative and collaborative effort that is deliberately structured to address systemic bias has the strongest potential to deliver on the promise of both design and justice.","[{""name"": ""Dan Jackson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Miso Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jules Rochielle Sievert"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Law']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

The study focussed specifically on student and tutor perceptions of online design studio before the sudden transition to online delivery, and how those perceptions shifted through the initial months of online delivery. We consider the pedagogical context in which the shift to online teaching took place and the evident successes and failures in the early iterations of online studio. We discuss similar and contrasting perceptions in student and tutor groups and observe the changes in these perceptions prior to and after teaching and learning in online studios.

The current study proposes a framework that relates problem statement types in a design brief to creative outcomes by promoting the priming effect, which is a cognitive phenomenon describing the ways individuals behave accordingly to the way they receive a stimulus. The claim is that the brief has the potential to stimulate creativity and influence the type of outcomes by priming the design students using the problem statement. An experiment was conducted in which two groups of design students generated sketches in response to two types of problem statements (in noun and verb formations) in similar design briefs. The problem statements in verb formation were found to lead to a higher number of sketches containing more novel and flexible, yet less realisable ideas. The results support the contention that the design brief and the type of problem statements have the potential to act as a catalyst for creativity early in the design process.","[{""name"": ""Engin Kapkın"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sharon Joines"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/0022-3514.81.6.1014"", ""10.1086/341577"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.230"", ""10.1111/j.0963-7214.2006.00395.x"", ""10.2307/1511637"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2014.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2004.06.005"", ""10.1162/desi.2006.22.3.4"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.50.2.229"", ""10.1006/jesp.1999.1409"", ""10.1515/9783112313121"", ""10.1037/h0063487"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2014.01778.x"", ""10.1509/jmkg.68.2.114.27788"", ""10.1162/0747936054406753"", ""10.4324/9780203305683"", ""10.1115/1.4043207"", ""10.1145/1978942.1979048"", ""10.1016/S0022-5371(74)80011-3"", ""10.1037/h0046541"", ""10.1515/9781400828678"", ""10.1007/BF01405730"", ""10.1080/0031383990430303"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2011.01.002"", ""10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80448-1"", ""10.1162/0747936053103020"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.32.6.1119"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1319672"", ""10.1037/0021-843X.107.3.440"", ""10.1126/science.2296719"", ""10.1002/j.2162-6057.1989.tb00518.x""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The vibration response signals of the bridge structure are collected using sensors placed at different nodes. The different damaged states such as no damage, single damage, double damage and triple damage are introduced by cutting members of the bridge. The masked noise with recorded vibration responses generates challenge to properly analyze the health of bridge structure. Design/methodology/approach The analytical modal properties are obtained from finite element model (FEM) developed using SAP2000 software. The response signals are analyzed in frequency domain by power spectrum and in time-frequency domain using spectrogram and Stockwell transform. Various low pass signal-filtering techniques such as variational filter, lowpass sparse banded (AB) filter and Savitzky–Golay (SG) differentiator filter are also applied to refine vibration signals. The proposed methodology further comprises application of Hilbert transform in combination with MUSIC and ESPRIT techniques. Findings The outcomes of SG filter provided the denoised signals using appropriate polynomial degree with proper selected window length. However, certain unwanted frequency peaks still appeared in the outcomes of SG filter. The SG-filtered signals are further analyzed using fused methodology of Hilbert transform-ESPRIT, which shows high accuracy in identifying modal frequencies at different states of the steel truss bridge. Originality/value The sequence of proposed methodology for denoising vibration response signals using SG filter with Hilbert transform-ESPRIT is a novel approach. The outcomes of proposed methodology are much refined and take less computational time.","[{""name"": ""Anshul Sharma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pardeep Kumar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hemant Kumar Vinayak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raj Kumar Patel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suresh Kumar Walia"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/03772063.2015.1009398"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.005"", ""10.1080/15732479.2019.1599964"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.11.001"", ""10.1007/s11803-015-0022-5"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2010.07.018"", ""10.1016/j.bspc.2018.06.009"", ""10.1007/s13349-016-0173-8"", ""10.1080/23248378.2017.1338538"", ""10.1109/LSP.2013.2244593"", ""10.1007/s11803-015-0056-8"", ""10.1002/stc.466"", ""10.1109/78.218136"", ""10.1515/acgeo-2015-0062"", ""10.1016/j.dsp.2004.09.008"", ""10.1109/MSP.2011.941097"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000280"", ""10.1006/mssp.1997.0102"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2010.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2005.11.002"", ""10.1021/ac0600196"", ""10.1007/s13349-015-0116-9"", ""10.1109/TGRS.2012.2187665""]",['Engineering'],"['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The documents mainly consist of decisions and support to meet practical or business-friendly needs. Along with the increased attraction of EU investment in agriculture, the mentioned issues become even more aggravated – at which expense the areas and the respective payments are increasing? The answer is one – at the expense of the landscape. In each of Latvian counties, there are territories that cannot lose historical value and we must search for a mutually beneficial algorithm. EU funding projects must contribute to the preservation of the cultural landscape heritage, i.e. to the introduction of Europe's best philosophy and practices. The recovery of the cultural landscape, including maintenance works and its progress in postsocialist areas, is not an easy task, knowing the existing ownership and the economic situation in the country. Will we really get a greater contribution to the state economy from the amount of threshed centners than from the preservation of landscape values in the long term? A task of crucial importance is the research of each region's landscape space, the development of a concept and elaboration of project documentation. As the study shows, Latvian greenfields and cultural heritage calls for the actions to form several areas of the museum reserve.","[{""name"": ""Aija Ziemelniece"", ""affiliation"": [""Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies""]}, {""name"": ""Una Ile"", ""affiliation"": [""Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies""]}, {""name"": ""Ilze Stokmane"", ""affiliation"": [""Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

The current paper examines the emergence of storefront churches and the ways in which their interior spaces are adapted and experienced by their congregants and clergy. This paper brings to light how disenfranchised groups became associated with the storefront churches and contested a history of marginalization to create unique spaces of religious, social, and cultural importance for themselves. Observations of the arrangement of interior space, the use of everyday objects to shape religious and social gatherings, and in–depth interviews were conducted in seven storefront churches. The study found that clergy and congregants shared a history of migration from the rural South and that the churches generally adhered to southern forms of worship of the sanctified church. Storefront church space was adapted to support aspects of sanctified worship, along with particularistic forms of expressivity of each church's view of the world. The study provides insight into the ways in which storefront churches have emerged as an important space where marginalized groups shape their own designs for modes of worship, communion, and expressivity, disassociated from the dominant society.","[{""name"": ""Asha Kutty"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Carolina-Greensboro, USA""]}]","[""10.1515/9781400880171"", ""10.1215/9780822381648"", ""10.1177/000271627944100114"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-24439-3_4""]","['Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Plant Science', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2021-0699,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Risk resources management influence on public-private partnership risk management in construction industry. Confirmatory factor analysis approach,"Purpose Construction organisations cannot underestimate the improvement in public–private partnership (PPP) projects’ implementation. At the same time, construction organisations cannot overlook the risk arising from engaging in PPP construction projects. Hence, this study aims to establish the influence of risk resource management (RRM) in managing PPP risk in the construction industry in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The researchers adopted qualitative and quantitative research methods to achieve the aim of the study, in which Delphi questions and a close-ended questionnaire were developed. A total of 650 construction specialists, including procurement officers, consultants, project managers, quantity surveyors, site engineers and planning officers were chosen using random and purposive sampling techniques. Recovered data were analysed using descriptive statistics and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The CFA maximum likelihood estimation extractor compresses 19 variables into 3 pattern matrices. Findings The results of the study revealed three factors that measure RRM in Ghana’s PPP construction industry, including financial resource management which was influenced by communicating the budget to project team members and project partners understanding the budget, and material resource management which was influenced by the provision of materials transportation and provision of delivery programs and labour resource management which was impacted by a commitment to pay social security and taxes and provision of good salaries, to address RRM in PPP construction organisations. Research limitations/implications To incessantly improve the PPP risk management (RM) in construction through RRM, there should be a strong liaison between the universities, government agencies and the construction industry, and such collaboration will assist the industry to obtain first-hand information regarding the study findings and how they can be implemented to help the development of RM in the construction industry. This study is limited to Ghana and CFA and further study should explore structural equation model to determine the structure and measurement model of the risk resource variables. Originality/value The study may be valuable to industry stakeholders looking for new approaches to improve RM in their construction activities, particularly in PPP projects. Also, to assist reduce PPP risk, construction companies should use RRM in their organisations.","[{""name"": ""Timothy Adu Gyamfi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wellington Didibhuku Thwala"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00035-X"", ""10.1177/0095399712459728"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0246"", ""10.1002/pad.584"", ""10.1080/01441647.2015.1012696"", ""10.1080/01446190110066128"", ""10.3390/sym10020046"", ""10.1108/03090590010358205"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-0280-5"", ""10.9744/ced.22.1.37-46"", ""10.1080/00223890802484126"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2207811"", ""10.1177/0951484816639742"", ""10.1108/09513550410546598"", ""10.3846/1392-3730.2008.14.4"", ""10.1007/s11067-009-9112-0"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(03)00005-X"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0071"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2010.11.022"", ""10.1002/ffo2.56"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.119982"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.08.007"", ""10.4314/majohe.v10i2.9"", ""10.1787/3ebfe901-en"", ""10.3846/1648715X.2016.1246388"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2016-0007"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2017-0137"", ""10.1504/IJPOM.2011.042036"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2019-0138"", ""10.2466/03.CP.4.10"", ""10.21833/ijaas.2017.06.00"", ""10.1080/01446190802140086"", ""10.1080/15309576.2020.1741406"", ""10.3390/buildings12020098"", ""10.4018/978-1- 68318- 016-6r"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-03-2015-0023"", ""10.1007/s10551-010-0657-0"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2013.05.018"", ""10.1080/0144619032000064127"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.792380"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2018-0247"", ""10.1111/puar.12020"", ""10.1080/14719037.2018.1428415"", ""10.1108/JPIF-10-2012-0049"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0332"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2005)131:1(71)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479. 0000384"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000434"", ""10.3846/bme.2014.03"", ""10.3846/13923730.2007.9636434"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:3(217)"", ""10.1007/BF02291575"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.06.003""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2022-0323,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Residential satisfaction of vertical urban settlements in Hong Kong,"Purpose Vertical urban settlements are becoming the predominant form of contemporary urban design in response to population increase and rapid urbanization. These developments are, however, perceived to be poorly designed and incongruent with the users’ needs. The purpose of this study was to present a resident satisfaction assessment of Hong Kong’s vertical settlements. Design/methodology/approach A review of the literature was conducted on the concept of vertical urbanism, residential satisfaction and postoccupancy evaluation. Fifty performance indicators were classified into three groups including indoor environment, safety and maintenance; furniture, utilities and spaces; and privacy, appearance and city life. These indicators were used to develop a Web-based questionnaire administered to residents in the three administrative regions of Hong Kong. Ninety-eight respondents participated in the study, and the results were analyzed using the resident satisfaction index and the overall satisfaction index. A multilinear regression analysis was also made to develop a model describing the most relevant performance indicators for determining the overall residential satisfaction. Findings The results revealed that residents expressed dissatisfaction with performance indicators, including “level of noise generated from outside the building (neighboring buildings, traffic, noise, etc.),” “variation and stability of indoor temperature,” “sustainable design of the building’s environment (cyclability, walkability, electric charging stations, etc.),” “availability and capacity of car parking,” “size and adequacy of spaces for social interaction” and “considerations for occupants with special needs (disabled, aged people, children, occupants with a medical condition, etc.).” The results also revealed that some indicators such as the maintenance of elevators, adequate interior space and surrounding areas were considered as significantly influencing residential satisfaction. Similarly, the building height and wind-induced motion were not significantly influencing residential satisfaction. The results also revealed that a multilinear Regression model with five variables and an adjusted R2 value of 93% could estimate the overall residential satisfaction. Originality/value The concept of vertical urban design is the new paradigm in the shaping of future cities. The originality of this study is its adoption of post-occupancy evaluation to assess occupants’ residential satisfaction.

10.1108/JEDT-11-2018-0205,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Research on comprehensive environmental impact assessment of shale gas development,"Purpose In recent years, to solve the contradiction between energy supply and demand, the Chinese Government has vigorously promoted shale gas development. With the rapid development of the shale gas industry, the environmental impact problems have become increasingly serious. Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of shale gas development. This study aims to provide a theoretical basis for enterprises to make development decisions on shale gas projects by constructing a model of comprehensive environmental impact assessment for shale gas development. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the comprehensive environmental impact factors of shale gas development are analyzed from the two aspects of the natural environment and macro environment, and the index system of comprehensive environmental impact assessment for shale gas development including 7 secondary indicators and 24 tertiary indicators is constructed. Owing to the fact that qualitative indicators are difficult to quantify in the evaluation process, the method of intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IFAHP) is adopted for evaluation. This method (IFAHP) can delicately describe the hesitancy degree of the decision-makers in the process of assigning a weight to the indicators, and make the weight assignment of each index more accurate. Furthermore, this method overcomes the shortcomings of the conventional methods, such as the complexity of calculation and the large amount of calculation. Findings The evaluation model is applied to a shale gas platform drilling project in Southwest China. Based on the ratings from 13 experts, the comprehensive environmental impact assessment grade of this project is good, indicating that the shale gas development project is feasible. The result is basically in line with the actual situation. Originality/value Based on the consideration of the natural environmental impacts of shale gas development, this paper also has considered the macro environmental impact of shale gas development, and has established the index system of comprehensive environmental impact assessment for shale gas development from the two aspects of the natural environment and macro environment. To overcome such difficulties as incomplete evaluation by decision-makers, cumbersome calculation process and a large amount of calculation, this paper has adopted the method of IFAHP to evaluate and has established a comprehensive environmental impact assessment model for shale gas development based on IFAHP.","[{""name"": ""Zhenhua Luo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yixi Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kang Cen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haize Pan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mengfan Zhong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jian He"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0165-0114(86)80034-3"", ""10.1038/477271a"", ""10.1007/s10584-011-0061-5"", ""10.1016/j.proeps.2013.03.213"", ""10.1021/es405118y"", ""10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2272585"", ""10.1016/j.jngse.2016.07.009"", ""10.2172/1044520""]","['Environmental Science', 'Energy', 'Engineering']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0332,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Regression analysis of the influence of demographic characteristics using risk management practices within South African small and medium construction enterprises,"PurposeDemographics are perceived to influence risk management practices (RMPs) in construction. However, empirical evidence supporting this perception is lacking in the South African Construction Industry (SACI), especially within small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This study, therefore, aims to investigate the influence of demographic characteristics on RMPs.Design/methodology/approachThis study followed a positivist research philosophy, using a questionnaire survey for data collection. In total, 225 questionnaires were distributed, of which 187 were returned from conveniently sampled respondents, which included owners and senior managers of construction SMEs organizations in Gauteng province in South Africa (SA). In total, 181 questionnaires were usable, yielding a response rate of 80.44%. Data from the survey were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics i.e. multiple regression analysis (MRA). The outputs were represented using percent and regression coefficients values, respectively.FindingsIn total, 42 practices were established from the literature review and grouped into 9 major RMPs. The data analysis suggested that understanding the organizational environment, defining objectives, resource requirements, risk measurement, risk identification, risk assessment, risk response and action planning, communication and monitoring and review are reliable and valid practices. Findings from MRA established that demographic characteristics i.e. experience in the construction industry (CI), education level and the number of employees in the organization are not good predictors to determine the use of RMPs.Research limitations/implicationsThe study was limited to the data acquired from the SACI and to a lesser extent, construction SMEs in Gauteng. Therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to all SMEs in SA. Though neighboring and developing countries can use the RMPs identified in this study, the results cannot be directly used in developed countries without adequate substantiation.Practical implicationsThe current study provides useful information to assist construction organizations to pay more attention to risk management implementation. The RMPs established in this paper are reliable and valid in projects undertaken by SMEs, and therefore, may be used by top management and/or the risk task team of these enterprises for effective project risk management.Originality/valueThe study presents findings of an investigation of the influence of demographics on RMPs from the perspectives of construction SMEs, an area less explored. This work advances knowledge of RMPs in the SME sector. It, therefore, adds value to researchers and industry practitioners on the theme where no agreement has been attained relating to key factors and practices that should constitute a risk management model.","[{""name"": ""Berenger Yembi Renault"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Justus Ngala Agumba"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nazeem Ansary"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s13753-020-00247-0"", ""10.1177/0266242614542853"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2013-0001"", ""10.2903/j.efsa.2019.e170707"", ""10.3390/su10051609"", ""10.3846/jcem.2018.284"", ""10.3846/20294913.2014.994582"", ""10.5901/jesr.2017.v7n2p15"", ""10.1111/biom.12709"", ""10.22495/rgc7i4c2art7"", ""10.17159/2309-8775/2018/v60n4a3"", ""10.18775/ijmsba.1849-5664-5419.2014.44.1001"", ""10.4102/sajems.v20i1.1621"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2017.07.249"", ""10.19044/esj.2018.v14n19p181"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00082-8"", ""10.4102/ac. v18i1.591"", ""10.21511/ppm.15(2-2).2017.08"", ""10.5772/intechopen.68798"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.11.036"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"", ""10.1111/ejed.12014"", ""10.18178/ijtef.2017.8.2.550"", ""10.18178/ijtef.2017.8.2.550""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Accounting', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7331), ('0714 统计学', 0.7175)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1111/joid.12232,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Reframing Third Places: Environmental Changes of Merging Places During COVID-19,"The ubiquitous nature of technology is changing the way humans interact with interior space and redefining the third place, venues where individuals gather for socialization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the fusion of physical and virtual space led to an overlapping of the first place (home) that served as the physical host for the virtual second (work), and third (social gathering) places. Most critically, the first place (home) became a proxy for second and third place experiences as we started connecting with the outside world, albeit virtually. The goal of this study was to determine the extent that individuals relied on technology to meet their socializing needs in response to COVID-19, verify if individuals are altering their environment as a result of the pandemic and whether these changes align with physical third-place characteristics, and inform interior designers on how to intentionally design physical space in ways that include virtual experiences. The researchers employed a mixed-methods approach by gathering data from an online survey, incorporating closed-ended and open-ended questions, using two different convenience sampling approaches ( N = 229), and asking participants to submit photos to support their responses. Results illustrated that during the pandemic, virtual environments integrated with the home and became a substitute for physical third places. Four themes identified the modifications in physical space that occurred because of COVID-19 as individuals accommodated the merging of their home, work, school, and social places. Insights regarding the design of successful physical spaces that embrace virtual experiences are provided.","[{""name"": ""Dana E.

10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0461,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Quality management of RDP housing construction: myth or reality?,"Purpose South Africa has a large social housing scheme to provide primary housing for less privileged citizens who obtain an average monthly income of less than R 3,500.00. The government seeks to promote an integrated society by developing sustainable human settlements and quality housing within a subsidy system for different income groups. This study aims to examine whether quality management is applied to the reconstruction and development programme (RDP) housing programme during construction. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative survey approach was selected for this study. This involved using a close-ended questionnaire to collect data amongst 1,893 households who are currently residing in government housing units in the city of Bloemfontein, in the Free State province. The questionnaires were self-administered amongst randomly selected respondents based on their availability at the time of the visit to the above area. However, only the occupants of a household were included in the study. The data gathered were analysed by making use of R-programming software. Findings The findings revealed that a low level of quality is evident in the already constructed RDP housing units. Most of the inspected units were built with low-quality building materials or were not well-constructed, with derelict structural frames and finishes being evident in most houses. Respondents also indicated that they were not satisfied with the quality of some aspects of the units, such as the plaster and paint finishes, door frames built into walls and uneven floors and floor finishes. These complaints indicate that little to no quality management was applied at the time of construction or even afterwards during the latent defects period. Research limitations/implications The survey was limited to responses amongst randomly selected government RDP housing occupants in seven communities in Bloemfontein’s periphery, in the Free State Province of South Africa. Practical implications The empirical results from the findings indicate that the South African Government should ensure that quality management is applied during the housing units’ construction. This may mean that a new strategy for verifying the units’ quality will need to be developed, considering the respondents’ concerns by improving the quality of the construction materials and methods used to erect these units. The government should also consider improving contractors’ tender selection criteria to ensure higher quality construction methods, materials and management. Originality/value The study has identified quality challenges in constructing the social housing and stated recommendations that will address the identified issues if implemented by the programme implementers. This will help achieve the programme's objective, which is to improve the living conditions of previously disadvantaged individuals through social housing scheme.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Amoah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tanya Van Schalkwyk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kahilu Kajimo-Shakantu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/02630800910971365"", ""10.5379/urbani-izziv-en-2011-22-01-005"", ""10.1080/15623599.2012.10773181""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Urban Studies', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1111/jade.12342,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Qualified Satisfaction: First-Year Architecture Student Perceptions of Teamwork,"AbstractAcross disciplines, skills associated with collaboration are now ubiquitously considered requisite graduate attributes. Despite decades of studies on the various dimensions of academic teamwork, challenges for both students and staff remain. For this year‐long study at a UK school of architecture, we considered teamwork as a thread woven through the first‐year curriculum, traversing course modules and project types. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the collective impact of teamwork activities on the incoming cohort of 200+ undergraduate students and how the structuring and coordination of such activities might improve the holistic student experience. Across two rounds of online questionnaires and focus group sessions, student participants articulated the benefits of collaboration for learning, socialisation and professional development. However, resentment towards teamwork increased throughout the year, as frustration with disengaged cohort mates grew, and student sought greater structure and oversight from tutors. On the other hand, when given the chance to reflect on the multidimensional nature of teamwork in focus group discussions, many students adopted a productively nuanced perspective toward the topic. This implies that, whether students like or dislike certain aspect of collaborative projects, opportunities for critical conversation can promote or prompt an appreciation for the educational value of including teamwork projects in curricula. The results of this study should be relevant to educators seeking to improve the implementation and effectiveness of team‐based learning, particularly those in design‐based fields and those in higher and professional education contexts.","[{""name"": ""James Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tarek Teba"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roberto Braglia"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0098628315573147"", ""10.1016/S0360-1315(98)00031-1"", ""10.21606/drs.2020.120"", ""10.1080/08832320309598613"", ""10.1187/cbe.17-09-0199"", ""10.1080/14623940220129861"", ""10.1177/105256290202600404"", ""10.1080/135580000750052973"", ""10.3926/jotse.530"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1177/0273475302250571"", ""10.1177/1046496416665221"", ""10.7206/jmba.ce.2450-7814.190"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.1999.tb00344.x"", ""10.1108/ARCH-10-2020-0227"", ""10.4018/978-1-5225-0726-0.ch015"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2005.tb00407.x""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Thus, the objective of this article is to define and prioritize the necessary activities and short- to long-term outcomes that will aid in developing high-skill career pathways that will positively impact children and families, students and teachers, and future workers. Expert perspectives from industry and academia have been analysed through two lenses: education (primary/secondary, technical, and university levels) and policy/innovation. The nominal group technique (NGT) is applied in this research to capture these perspectives, which enabled the generation of ideas followed by discussion and ranking by the experts. This approach encourages participation and avoids the associated drawbacks of typical group interactions. As a result, prioritized activities, short-term outcomes, and policy ideas to introduce children and families, students and teachers, and future workers to careers in advanced manufacturing are presented for each lens of focus. In addition, inputs from experts were captured to discuss desired medium- to long-term outcomes. In conclusion, this article summarizes the key findings from the study.","[{""name"": ""Karl R.

10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0501,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Optimizing stabilization of laterite as walling unit,"Purpose Over dependence on river/sea sand as building material has impacted the environment negatively. However, laterite, which is an environment-friendly indigenous building material in sub-Saharan Africa, has been less exploited as a suitable alternative. This paper aims to ascertain the optimum cement–laterite mix proportion at which laterite can be stabilized for production of walling units. Design/methodology/approach Using an experimental method, laterite was collected from three borrow pit sites. Sieve analysis was performed to determine the particle size distribution. Also, the degree of workability of the cement–laterite mix was ascertained using slump test. Compressive strengths were determined at cement stabilization percentages of 3%, 7% and 10% on 12 cubes of100 mm cast and cured for 14 and 28 days, respectively. Findings The results showed that the lateritic soil investigated, achieves its optimum strength in 28 days of curing, at a stabilization level of 10%. An average compressive strength of 2.41 N/mm2, which is 20.5% greater than the target strength, was achieved. Practical implications To meet the desired compressive strength of alternative walling units while achieving environmental sustainability and efficiency in production, cement stabilization of lateritic soils should become a recommended practice by built environment professionals in sub-Saharan Africa. Originality/value This paper is one of the first research works that attempts to determine the optimum level at which the abundant sub-Saharan laterite can be chemically stabilized for the production of non-load bearing walling units. This research promotes an environment-friendly alternative building material to sea sand, river sand and off-shore sand.","[{""name"": ""Sarfo Mensah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Collins Ameyaw"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Blondel Akun Abaitey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hayford Obeng Yeboah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.foar.2017.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.04.019"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.01.014"", ""10.1038/d41586-019-02042-4"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.03.014"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/JERA.39.86"", ""10.1080/15583058.2018.1459954"", ""10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106764"", ""10.1080/20450249.2019.1656448"", ""10.20944/preprints201811.0100.v1"", ""10.1108/SASBE-06-2020-0089"", ""10.1080/01446190600601313"", ""10.1007/s12665-010-0781-2"", ""10.1016/j.clay.2016.10.042"", ""10.5958/2454-8634.2019.00004.4"", ""10.1533/9780857096166.2.222"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000148"", ""10.1016/j.cscm.2020.e00448"", ""10.1016/j.jcsr.2018.12.009"", ""10.1007/978-81-322-2187-6_138"", ""10.3390/ma13020262"", ""10.1007/s13369-014-1286-1"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2012.09.008"", ""10.2166/wcc.2019.063"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0680(2008)13:2(98)"", ""10.1002/esp.4941"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.101135"", ""10.1016/j.cscm.2020.e00331"", ""10.37933/nipes/2.2.2020.15"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2016.03.018"", ""10.1007/s00267-010-9571-6"", ""10.1080/08120099.2015.1053985"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.08.130"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.119"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.121264""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

It demonstrates the positionality inherent within frames insofar as frames articulate subordinated or dominant status, or express normative understandings until challenged. In doing so, we build a conceptualization of the political foundations of design framing practices and their implications for those contexts within which design operates. Consequently, we argue for dissensual counter-framing design practices that unsettle institutionalized norms and ideologies played out within frames, and through which a form of political agency is sociomaterially enacted.","[{""name"": ""Sharon Prendeville"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pandora Syperek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Santamaria"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2021-0310,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Nonlinear modelling and finite element analysis on the load-bearing capacity of RC beams with considering the bond-slip effect,"Purpose This paper aims to present nonlinear numerical simulations using the versatile finite element (FE) analysis tool ANSYS and theoretical analysis based on code provisions to assess the load-carrying capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) beams under two-point monotonic static loadings. Design/methodology/approach Four quarter-size FE models with load and geometry symmetry conditions were constructed, the load-bearing capacity and associated mid-span deflections at critical points are verified against the full-scale experimental RC beams available in the literature. These developed FE models incorporated the tension stiffening effects and bond–slip behaviour. Theoretical analyses based on Indian standard code IS: 456–2000 and ACI 318–19 were also carried to verify the experimental and numerical predicted moments at critical loading points. Findings The load-deflection curves predicted through FE models exhibit closer corroboration with the experimental curves throughout the loading history. The contour plots for deflections, concrete principal stresses, reinforcement yield stresses are satisfactorily predicted by the FE models, which reveal the complete information of nonlinear behaviour of RC beams. The developed model well captured the initial and progressive crack patterns at each load increments. Practical implications The FE modelling is an efficient, valid and economical tool that is an alternative to the expensive experimental program and can be used to explore, analyse and fully understand the nonlinear response of RC beams under static loadings. Originality/value The ultimate moment capacity evaluated based on ACI 318–19 code provision show a better correlation with the experimental data as compared to the IS: 456–2000 code provision. The ultimate loads and associated centre-span deflections predicted by RN-2, RN-3, RB-12 and RB-16 FE model show a discrepancy of 1.66 and –0.49%, –4.68 and –0.60%, –9.38 and –14.53% and –4.37 and 4.21%, respectively, against the experimental results, which reveals that the developed ANSYS FE models predict consistent results and achieved a reasonable agreement with the experimental data.","[{""name"": ""Pandimani Pandimani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markandeya Raju Ponnada"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yesuratnam Geddada"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compstruc.2014.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.01.089"", ""10.1108/WJE-04-2019-0121"", ""10.1016/j.finel.2018.06.004"", ""10.1007/s11223-010-9212-6"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.311"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.09.023"", ""10.1080/15376494.2018.1432803"", ""10.1007/s40999-018-0387-8"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2014.04.064"", ""10.1007/s40999-016-0076-4""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0254,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Methodology for the design of a reconfigurable guillotine shear and bending press machine (RGS&BPM),"Purpose In manufacturing, dedicated machine tools and flexible machine tools are failing to satisfy the ever-changing manufacturing demands of short life cycles and dynamic nature of products. These machines are limited when new product designs are introduced. The solution lies in developing responsive machines that can be adjusted or be changed functionally when these change requirements arise. These machines are reconfigurable machines which are becoming the new focus, as they rapidly respond to product variety and volume changes. A sheet metal working machine known as a reconfigurable guillotine shear and bending press machine (RGS&amp;BPM) has been developed. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology, function-oriented design approach (FODA), which was developed for the design of the RGS&amp;BPM. Design/methodology/approach The design of the machine is based on the six principles of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs), namely, modularity, scalability integrability, convertibility, diagnosability and customisability. The methodology seeks to optimise the design process of the RGS&amp;BPM through a design of modules that make up the machine, enable its conversion and reconfiguration. The FODA is focussed on function identification to select the operational function required. Two main functions are recognised for the machine, these being cutting and bending; hence, the design revolves around these two and reconfigurability. Findings The developed design methodology was tested in the design of a prototype for the reconfigurable guillotine shear and bending press machine. The prototype is currently being manufactured and will be subjected to functional tests once completed. This paper is being presented not only to present the methodology by to show and highlight its practical applicability, as the prototype manufacturers have been enthusiastic about this new approach. Research limitations/implications The research was limited to the design methodology for the RGS&amp;BPM, the machine which has been designed to completion using this methodology, with prototype being manufactured. Practical implications This study presents critical steps and considerations in the development of reconfigurable machines. The main thrust being to explore the best possibility of developing the machines with dual functionality that will assist in availing the technology to manufacturer. As the machine has been development, the success of the design can be directly attributed to the FODA methodology, among other contributing factors. It also highlights the significance of the principles of RMS in reconfigurable machine design. Social implications The RGS&amp;BM machine is an answer for the small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), as the machine replaces two machines with one, and the methodology ensures its affordable design. It contributes immensely to the machine availability by eliminating trial and error approaches.

10.1108/JEDT-07-2023-0325,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Methodology for retrospectively developing a BIM model from point cloud scans using ongoing building project as case study,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the suggestions that construction processes could be considerably improved by integrating building information modelling (BIM) with 3D laser scanning technologies. This case study integrated 3D laser point cloud scans with BIM to explore the effects of BIM adoption on ongoing construction project, whilst evaluating the utility of 3D laser scanning technology for producing structural 3D models by converting point cloud data (PCD) into BIM. Design/methodology/approach The primary data acquisition adopted the use of Trimble X7 laser scanning process, which is a set of data points in the scanned space that represent the scanned structure. The implementation of BIM with the 3D PCD to explore the precision and effectiveness of the construction processes as well as the as-built condition of a structure was precisely captured using the 3D laser scanning technology to recreate accurate and exact 3D models capable of being used to find and fix problems during construction. Findings The findings indicate that the integration of BIM and 3D laser scanning technology has the tendency to mitigate issues such as building rework, improved project completion times, reduced project cost, enhanced interdisciplinary communication, cooperation and collaboration amongst the project duty holders, which ultimately enhances the overall efficiency of the construction project. Research limitations/implications The acquisition of data using 3D laser scanner is usually conducted from the ground. Therefore, certain aspects of the building could potentially disturb data acquisition; for example, the gable and sections of eaves (fascia and soffit) could be left in a blind spot. Data acquisition using 3D laser scanner technology takes time, and the processing of the vast amount of data acquired is laborious, and if not carefully analysed, could result in errors in generated models. Furthermore, because this was an ongoing construction project, material stockpiling and planned construction works obstructed and delayed the seamless capture of scanned data points. Originality/value These findings highlight the significance of integrating BIM and 3D laser scanning technology in the construction process and emphasise the value of advanced data collection methods for effectively managing construction projects and streamlined workflows.","[{""name"": ""Kenneth Lawani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Farhad Sadeghineko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Tong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mehmethan Bayraktar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.aei.2018.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102877"", ""10.3390/ijgi10050316"", ""10.21315/jcdc2019.24.2.2"", ""10.3390/heritage6020087"", ""10.4995/var.2022.15313"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000433"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2014.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100764"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104731"", ""10.3390/s23052497"", ""10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.111100"", ""10.3390/app112110370"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103686"", ""10.1007/s11831-018-9265-4"", ""10.3390/su10114024"", ""10.3390/rs14102325"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104096"", ""10.3390/buildings12101754"", ""10.3390/buildings12122052"", ""10.3390/virtualworlds2020006"", ""10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.12.014"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2021.101501"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.07.020"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.06.016"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.08.043"", ""10.3390/app12094376"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.03.015"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2018.06.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000322"", ""10.3390/heritage3010004"", ""10.1016/j.dibe.2020.100011"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000919"", ""10.3390/buildings12071037"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.09.014"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103998"", ""10.3390/rs12152492"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0001012"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2021.101490"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.10.023"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.04.001"", ""10.3390/rs15010064"", ""10.1016/j.ophoto.2023.100032"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-102696-0.00007-5"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2015.09.008""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geology', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2023-0444,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Mapping out focus for circular economy business models (CEBMs) research in construction sector studies - a bibliometric approach,"Purpose The circular economy business models (CEBMs) provide ways for firms operating in the construction industry to move from a linear to a circular approach. Thus, this study aims to explore CEBM research within the construction sector to show the focus area of studies, highlighting new areas that require attention. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a bibliometric approach, using the Scopus database as the data source. The keywords used for paper extraction from the database were “circular economy business” OR “circular business” AND “model” OR “models” AND “construction industry” OR “building industry”. The VOSviewer software was then used to prepare a co-occurrence and co-authorship map based on the bibliographic data gathered. Findings The study’s findings reveal five research clusters in the construction industry. These clusters include circular construction intelligence, modular business modelling, eco-construction, sustainable construction economics and smart energy-efficient buildings. The two most cited scholars had two publications each, while the top journals are the Journal of Cleaner Production and Sustainable Production and Consumption. This study concludes that there is a need for research within the construction sector to focus on CEBMs’ archetypes and frameworks. This will enable a smooth transition from linear to circular business models in the sector. Research limitations/implications The information was gathered from a single database, Scopus; hence, using other databases, including Web of Science, Google Scholar and Dimensions, might produce more articles for examination and, consequently, different findings on the subject under investigation. Practical implications These findings would assist researchers in considering the areas mentioned, which are yet to receive attention, and, by extension, enhance economic development while maintaining environmental sustainability. Originality/value This paper made a significant contribution to the body of knowledge by identifying scholars and platforms that have been instrumental in advancing CEBM research and highlighting new areas that require attention in the construction sector.","[{""name"": ""Osamudiamen Kenneth Otasowie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Adekunle"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/bsd2.241"", ""10.24928/2023/0138"", ""10.24928/2023/0134"", ""10.1002/bse.3057"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.109522"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.126870"", ""10.1080/21681015.2016.1172124"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2018.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.11.039"", ""10.3390/su13116348"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128639"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.10.004"", ""10.1287/mnsc.32.2.156"", ""10.3390/su12187272"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104673"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2020.12.032"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.048"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118710"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.207"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130395"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105617"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129125"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118160"", ""10.1007/s10778-009-0189-4"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104634"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130049"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.109948"", ""10.1016/j.jad.2014.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.09.029"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/201911002030"", ""10.3390/su8010043"", ""10.1111/jiec.12597"", ""10.6028/NIST.SP.800-145"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2020.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121134"", ""10.1007/s11192-017-2281-6"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102704"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118546"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105847"", ""10.3846/13923730.2017.1374301"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131927"", ""10.1108/SASBE-04-2020-0034"", ""10.24928/2023/0137"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105029"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.055"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.11.013"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-04-2020-0077"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119238"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.014"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124339"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.07.034"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2019.06.035"", ""10.1177/14614448211027175"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.126130"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.047"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10377-8_13"", ""10.1007/s11192-009-2178-0"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.190"", ""10.1016/j.cec.2022.100003"", ""10.1111/jiec.12754"", ""10.1002/cl2.1230"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-18458-1_50""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Engineering']","['Strategy and Management', 'Building and Construction', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0339,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Management of variations in the public-sector building construction projects in Sri Lanka,"Purpose Many public-sector building projects in developing countries are prone to variations owing to the changes made to their original project scopes, and economic depressions and stagnations. Cost and time-overruns are consequences of such variations. Thus, variation management in these projects is important. Hence, this paper aims to analyse the methods of managing variations in public-sector building projects in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a mixed research approach. Seventeen expert interviews and a questionnaire survey were conducted to identify the causes and consequences of the variations, and the strategies that will help manage those variations. Manual content analysis and mean weighted rankings (MWR) were used to analyse the collected quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Findings The employer, consultant, contractor and several other factors are mostly responsible for the variations in public-sector building projects in Sri Lanka. Cost and time-overruns, rework and demolition and disputes are the major consequences of such variations. The study findings reveal that a detailed employer’s brief, clearly defined project objectives, a comprehensive design and set of specifications, and preliminary investigations are the strategies that will mostly minimise the variations in public-sector building projects in Sri Lanka. Originality/value The study proposes strategies to avoid or minimise the adverse impact of variations, which the industry practitioners can adopt for variation management in public-sector building projects. The study theoretically contributes to knowledge by revealing how variations in public-sector building projects in Sri Lanka can be managed by identifying their causes and consequences.","[{""name"": ""B.A.K.S.

This housing policy has been pursued as a legitimate solution for housing low- and middle-income households where the houses are individually financed by bank loans or mortgages raised by the occupants. John Turner criticised conventional housing solutions by affirming that ‘developing governments take the perspective of the elite and act as if the process of low-income houses were the same as in high-income countries and the same as for the small upper-middle class of their own countries’.1 Bruce Ferguson and Jesus Navarrete extend this argument with their critique of distributing finished houses to low-income populations and then requiring long-term payments, which are harmful to the beneficiaries. They note that ‘governments think of housing as complete units built by developers that households must purchase with a long-term loan rather than as a progressive process’.2","[{""name"": ""Goran Ivo Marinovic"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Finance', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1111/jade.12454,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Is Creativity Masculine? Visual Arts College Students' Perceptions of the Gender Stereotyping of Creativity and Its Influence on Creative Self-Efficacy,"AbstractThis study investigated visual arts college students’ perceptions of the gender stereotyping of creativity and the influence of this stereotyping on creative self‐efficacy. The sample consisted of 1198 Chinese visual arts college students. The results showed that (a) both male and female students identified stereotypically masculine traits as more important to creativity than stereotypically feminine traits are, (b) male students demonstrated higher creative self‐efficacy than their female counterparts did, and (c) students’ gender significantly moderated the effect of the gender stereotyping of creativity on creative self‐efficacy. Specifically, the gender stereotyping of creativity had a positive effect on male students and a negative effect on female students. These findings revealed that gender stereotypes dominate concepts of creativity in Chinese art education and may hinder female students’ development of creative self‐efficacy, resulting in gendered inequality in the visual arts field. The implications of these findings for visual arts education in China are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Ning Luo"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Education Guangzhou University  Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Tao Guan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Music and Dance Guangzhou University  Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Jinling Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Fine Arts South China Normal University  Guangzhou China""]}]","[""10.1007/s11682-015-9410-8"", ""10.1002/j.2162-6057.2008.tb01289.x"", ""10.4278/0890-1171-12.1.8"", ""10.1207/s15326934crj1804_4"", ""10.1177/0894845313483003"", ""10.24926/ijps.v3i2.130"", ""10.1080/00393541.2003.11651756"", ""10.1002/jocb.395"", ""10.1080/00131857.2018.1488215"", ""10.1002/9781118978061.ead113"", ""10.1111/1467-954X.12238"", ""10.1057/9781137408570"", ""10.1016/j.tsc.2012.10.001"", ""10.1037/a0021427"", ""10.1016/j.lindif.2015.10.001"", ""10.2190/IC.29.3.c"", ""10.1080/00393541.2007.11650096"", ""10.4324/9780203646632"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1pwtb3r"", ""10.1111/soc4.12350"", ""10.1093/oxartj/18.2.59"", ""10.1002/jocb.18"", ""10.1007/BF00288365"", ""10.1002/jocb.17"", ""10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00088-X"", ""10.1177/0956797615598739"", ""10.3390/mti2020025"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2009.01590.x"", ""10.2307/3069429"", ""10.1215/9780822372479"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-13262-1"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.56.3.407""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2023-0005,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Investigating the implementation of immersive technologies within on-site construction safety processes,"Purpose The benefits of integrating immersive technologies (ImTs) within a construction safety context are acknowledged within the literature; however, its practical application on construction sites remains low. Whilst research into the integration of ImTs within the construction industry is underway, most have viewed this from a broader adoption context or within educational settings, and not specifically from a practical on-site safety perspective. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to address the contributing factors to its integration within on-site safety processes, using the experiences of active construction professionals. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a qualitative approach. Data was collected through online focus groups involving UK based construction professionals with experience in using ImTs, recruited using selective sampling. Data sets were subsequently analysed using inductive thematic analysis and are presented within key themes. Findings The results showed that among the experienced construction professionals, the use of ImTs specifically for on-site safety applications (including inductions/training/workshops) was rare on projects. The findings identified various contributing factors related to the integration of ImTs, including the potential improvements in on-site safety practices such as enhanced communication of hazards, safety planning, engagement during training and more accurate risk assessment. Critical challenges, concerns and frustrations included a lack of engagement from senior level management, inadequate leadership, limited investment, a need for digital expertise, fear of complacency and the acceptance of ImTs within existing safety processes from the wider project team. Originality/value This study provides a fresh perspective to this field by using practical accounts from active and experienced on-site construction professionals. This study supports the integration of ImTs within the construction industry, presenting key contributing factors influencing its integration within on-site safety processes. These factors can be considered by industry adopters, and includes the rationale, challenges and potential on-site benefits of ImTs.","[{""name"": ""Mark Swallow"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sambo Lyson Zulu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jsr.2023.01.007"", ""10.1061/9780784479070.040"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1080/14780887.2020.1769238"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2018.03.019"", ""10.1108/14714171211197481"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2004.07.013"", ""10.1177/1525822X16639015"", ""10.1177/1049732318821692"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000170"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.06.017"", ""10.18400/tekderg.423448"", ""10.1111/2041-210X.12860"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2021-0476"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2013.11.019"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104228"", ""10.1080/01446193.2013.828844"", ""10.1080/01446193.2015.1029504"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.019"", ""10.1080/01446193.2021.1930080""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

However, in particular, the paper focuses on the theme of façade as an inhabited threshold: not a two–dimensional vertical plane but a real architectural interior space. The inhabited façade becomes a place through which it is possible to experience the relationship between interior and exterior, between private and public, architecture and city, not only through the physical movement of “going inside,” “stepping outside,” “walking through” but also through the act of staying, living, and enjoying it as a space and a place that allows relationships between inside and outside.","[{""name"": ""Patrizio M.

This zine co‐design journey was articulated through the lens of Schumpeter’s hybridity perspective ‘new combinations’, in the context of transdisciplinarity. As both commercial and social organisations face increasing complexity and uncertainty, the rationally oriented tools developed for planning and decision‐making in more stable times need to be augmented by those which assume or even welcome ambiguity and not‐knowing. This creates an opportunity to draw on art‐based methods such as zines, given that the arts acknowledge, value and address such uncertainty.","[{""name"": ""Clive Holtham"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Monica Biagioli"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0021886392284003"", ""10.1353/amp.0.0004"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511852015"", ""10.1080/09650792.2017.1323657"", ""10.1515/9781503624849""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Psychology', 'Engineering']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

To meet this gap and create synergy, this paper aims at presenting pedagogical paths followed in a graduation studio, integrating the studio outcomes with UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have not been widely covered either in nationwide architectural education or professional policies. In addition, the paper focuses on how the SDG action plan is echoed in higher education as well as in the discipline of architecture in Turkey. The paper is a case study in architectural education of which the motivation is to create awareness about UN SDGs among the students; to give insights and demonstrate a realistic design policy to achieve development targets. The pedagogical path presented here is original and aims to fulfill an interlude in the literature, which is still emerging.

My research shows that the FR project team emphasised three educational principles to be integrated into the exhibition design: (1) interactive learning, (2) family as a learning unit, and (3) enhance the learning of basic artistic elements. The FR’s overarching educational objective is to encourage transfer of learning between the FR to the Getty traditional art galleries. My research concludes with three suggestions to be considered in future practices of art museum education (1) the limits and potentials of interactives, (2) the interactive exhibition design and scaffolding, and (3) transfer of learning between galleries.","[{""name"": ""Tiffany Shuang‐Ching Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/sce.20016"", ""10.2307/1320379"", ""10.1177/0011000006287390"", ""10.1179/msi.2010.5.1.15"", ""10.1111/cura.12341"", ""10.1111/j.2151-6952.2001.tb01164.x"", ""10.1002/sce.20193"", ""10.1179/jme.2012.37.1.29"", ""10.1179/msi.2010.5.1.35""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Design/methodology/approach The generative design methodology is applied to develop a low-weight design alternative to a standard control arm plate design. A static stress simulation and a fatigue life study are developed to assess the response of the plate against the loading criteria and to ensure that the plate sustains the theoretically determined number of loading cycles. Findings The approach implemented provides a justifiable outcome for a weight-factor of safety trade-off. In addition to optimal material distribution, the generative design methodology provides several design outcomes, for different materials and fabrication techniques. This enables the selection of the best possible outcome for several structural requirements. Research limitations/implications This technique can be used for applications with pre-defined constraints, such as packaging and loading, usually observed in load-bearing components developed in the automotive and aerospace sectors of the manufacturing industry. Practical implications Using this technique can provide an alternative design solution to long periods spent in the design phase, because of its ability to generate several possible outcomes in just a fraction of time.

10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0495,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Finite-element modeling of partially prestressed concrete beams with unbonded tendon under monotonic loadings,"Purpose The partially prestressed concrete beam with unbonded tendon is still an active field of research because of the difficulty in analyzing and understanding its behavior. The finite-element (FE) simulation of such beams using numerical software is very scarce in the literature and therefore this study is taken to demonstrate the modeling aspects of unbonded partially prestressed concrete (UPPSC) beams. This study aims to present the three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear FE simulations of UPPSC beams subjected to monotonic static loadings using the numerical analysis package ANSYS. Design/methodology/approach The sensitivity study is carried out with three different mesh densities to obtain the optimum elements that reflect on the load–deflection behavior of numerical models, and the model with optimum element density is used further to model all the UPPSC beams in this study. Three half-symmetry FE model is constructed in ANSYS parametric design language domain with proper boundary conditions at the symmetry plane and support to achieve the same response as that of the full-scale experimental beam available in the literature. The linear and nonlinear material behavior of prestressing tendon and conventional steel reinforcements, concrete and anchorage and loading plates are modeled using link180, solid65 and solid185 elements, respectively. The Newton–Raphson iteration method is used to solve the nonlinear solution of the FE models. Findings The evolution of concrete cracking at critical loadings, yielding of nonprestressed steel reinforcements, stress increment in the prestressing tendon, stresses in concrete elements and the complete load–deflection behavior of the UPPSC beams are well predicted by the proposed FE model. The maximum discrepancy of ultimate moments and deflections of the validated FE models exhibit 13% and −5%, respectively, in comparison with the experimental results. Practical implications The FE analysis of UPPSC beams is done using ANSYS software, which is a versatile tool in contrast to the experimental testing to study the stress increments in the unbonded tendons and assess the complete nonlinear response of partially prestressed concrete beams. The validated numerical model and the techniques presented in this study can be readily used to explore the parametric analysis of UPPSC beams. Originality/value The developed model is capable of predicting the strength and nonlinear behavior of UPPSC beams with reasonable accuracy. The load–deflection plot captured by the FE model is corroborated with the experimental data existing in the literature and the FE results exhibit good agreement against the experimentally tested beams, which expresses the practicability of using FE analysis for the nonlinear response of UPPSC beams using ANSYS software.","[{""name"": ""Pandimani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markandeya Raju Ponnada"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yesuratnam Geddada"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-09-2011-0063"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0224"", ""10.1002/pse.168"", ""10.1108/WJE-04-2019-0121"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000479"", ""10.15554/pcij.11011985.72.91"", ""10.1016/j.hbrcj.2012.10.008"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2018-0102"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2009.01.033"", ""10.1016/S0958-9465(01)00040-3"", ""10.1108/WJE-04-2021-0212"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2021-0310"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0281"", ""10.15554/pcij63.4-03""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Also, given that the container terminals constitute more than 70% of the port area and as pavement in these areas is subject to heavy loads due to the long-term container storage, wheels of transport and movement equipment, the pavement must tolerate a distributed loading of at least 4 ton/m2in accordance with the type and weight of the containers imposed on the pavement. This study aims to investigate a variety of common pavement designs in coastal areas of southern Iran. The pavement type and characteristics of the subgrade layers are the same for each port; the thickness of different pavement layers is designed.Design/methodology/approachDue to problematic soil in the pavement subgrade, heavy and long-term container loading and the associated equipment, port pavement enjoys great importance.FindingsThe designed pavements are modeled by ABAQUS finite element software. The pavements are subject to a static load imposed by the corner casting container and resulted a distributed load 4 tons/m2. The results from data analysis show that the concrete block pavements influenced by the containers static loads of 3%–20% have less vertical displacement on the subgrade than other pavements (rigid and flexible).Originality/valueThis paper is modeling 3 port pavement in Iran.

10.1108/JEDT-07-2023-0327,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Exploring mental health challenges and implications for construction safety,"Purpose Over 2.7 million workers are employed in the UK construction industry and with the fragmented nature of the construction sector; cases of poor mental health of workers are on the increase. This upsurge in the number of workers experiencing poor mental health could directly impact construction safety with significant financial adverse consequences on employers and the UK economy. Studies have identified lapses within the construction sector emphasising the lack of transparency regarding reporting of mental health and well-being of construction workers due to the inadequate engagement from employers and the lack of genuine leadership commitment to tackle mental health. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a non-probability purposive sampling strategy, using a self-selected sample. A self-administered questionnaire benchmarked against the mental health core and enhanced standards tools by the “Stevenson/Farmer review of mental health and employers” served as the basis for the methodology. A total of 106 industry managers from highways, construction, maritime, utilities, home building, rail and haulage/fleet were involved in this study. Findings The findings indicate that the industry is making good strides towards addressing mental health issues; poor mental health have significant financial burdens on businesses and the economy; some contractors have mental health initiatives and programmes in place; there is inconsistency of support available to employees; some contractors now integrate leadership training; the level of engagement vary based on the strategy and action plan adopted by organisations; different mechanisms are adopted for monitoring mental health issues, and there are cross-industry initiatives. Research limitations/implications A limitation of this study is the number of participants which is not representative of the entire UK construction workforce. Therefore, the findings from this study as much as it presents some understanding of employee mental health and well-being cannot be overtly generalised across multiple industries, different geographic regions or contexts. Originality/value Employers should have a clear representation of the mental health of their employees to help them understand what affects worker’s mental well-being and how they can support them. Disregarding the multifaceted causes of mental ill-health due to the perceived financial implications could be more devastating for the industry.","[{""name"": ""Kenneth Lawani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Billy Hare"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Tong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iain Cameron"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ergon.2010.12.002"", ""10.5694/mja17.00950"", ""10.1186/s12889-020-08542-7"", ""10.1017/S0033291714000129"", ""10.1680/jmapl.20.00050"", ""10.1108/IJWHM-03-2018-0031"", ""10.19082/5212"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000658"", ""10.1080/01973533.2012.746606"", ""10.1007/s00406-022-01443-3"", ""10.1177/1049732305276687"", ""10.1080/1359432X.2017.1374245"", ""10.1177/1609406917724916"", ""10.3390/ijerph15102106"", ""10.1111/inm.13084"", ""10.5093/jwop2019a15"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.03.029"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0485"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000373"", ""10.1080/01446193.2014.997259"", ""10.3390/su14148300"", ""10.1186/s12889-017-4500-8"", ""10.1016/j.ssmph.2017.12.007"", ""10.3390/ijerph20021453"", ""10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-12253"", ""10.1007/s10488-013-0528-y"", ""10.1097/JOM.0000000000002688"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61139-3"", ""10.3390/healthcare11121792"", ""10.1177/0013916502034005001"", ""10.1002/hfm.20882"", ""10.1176/appi.ps.52.12.1633"", ""10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1078478"", ""10.1521/aeap.2011.23.4.382"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2022.106039"", ""10.3390/su15021531"", ""10.1080/01446193.2017.1337916""]",['Health Professions'],"['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'General Health Professions']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2022-0512,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Examining the potential use of augmented reality in construction cost management tools and techniques,"Purpose Construction cost management is one of the important processes that should be achieved effectively and accurately for successful project delivery. Modern-day construction cost management demands a high level of spatial skills. Augmented reality (AR) can potentially increase the stakeholders’ spatial skills as a supportive technology to traditional cost management tools and techniques. AR is a breakthrough technology that could considerably ease execution in various industries, but AR applicability in cost management has not been studied extensively. Thus, this study aims to explore the use of AR in construction cost management tools and techniques. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a qualitative approach consisting of two rounds of the Delphi technique. A total of 22 experts in the construction and information technology fields were interviewed using a purposive sampling technique. The manual content analysis helped analyse data. Findings The study identified AR features with the potential to increase the usage of cost management tools and techniques. AR can enable spatial skills (abilities, thinking and tasks) in most cost management tools and techniques. However, technical, cultural and technical and cultural barriers obstruct the use of AR in the construction industry. Originality/value The usage of AR in construction cost management tools and techniques has not been examined in detail until now. Thus, the study was developed to meet the industry needs and fill the literature gap to investigate the potential use of AR in construction cost management tools and techniques.","[{""name"": ""S.M.A.H.

10.1108/JEDT-07-2022-0379,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Ensemble of ensembles for fine particulate matter pollution prediction using big data analytics and IoT emission sensors,"Purpose The study aims to develop a multilayer high-effective ensemble of ensembles predictive model (stacking ensemble) using several hyperparameter optimized ensemble machine learning (ML) methods (bagging and boosting ensembles) trained with high-volume data points retrieved from Internet of Things (IoT) emission sensors, time-corresponding meteorology and traffic data. Design/methodology/approach For a start, the study experimented big data hypothesis theory by developing sample ensemble predictive models on different data sample sizes and compared their results. Second, it developed a standalone model and several bagging and boosting ensemble models and compared their results. Finally, it used the best performing bagging and boosting predictive models as input estimators to develop a novel multilayer high-effective stacking ensemble predictive model. Findings Results proved data size to be one of the main determinants to ensemble ML predictive power. Second, it proved that, as compared to using a single algorithm, the cumulative result from ensemble ML algorithms is usually always better in terms of predicted accuracy. Finally, it proved stacking ensemble to be a better model for predicting PM2.5 concentration level than bagging and boosting ensemble models. Research limitations/implications A limitation of this study is the trade-off between performance of this novel model and the computational time required to train it. Whether this gap can be closed remains an open research question. As a result, future research should attempt to close this gap. Also, future studies can integrate this novel model to a personal air quality messaging system to inform public of pollution levels and improve public access to air quality forecast. Practical implications The outcome of this study will aid the public to proactively identify highly polluted areas thus potentially reducing pollution-associated/ triggered COVID-19 (and other lung diseases) deaths/ complications/ transmission by encouraging avoidance behavior and support informed decision to lock down by government bodies when integrated into an air pollution monitoring system Originality/value This study fills a gap in literature by providing a justification for selecting appropriate ensemble ML algorithms for PM2.5 concentration level predictive modeling. Second, it contributes to the big data hypothesis theory, which suggests that data size is one of the most important factors of ML predictive capability. Third, it supports the premise that when using ensemble ML algorithms, the cumulative output is usually always better in terms of predicted accuracy than using a single algorithm. Finally developing a novel multilayer high-performant hyperparameter optimized ensemble of ensembles predictive model that can accurately predict PM2.5 concentration levels with improved model interpretability and enhanced generalizability, as well as the provision of a novel databank of historic pollution data from IoT emission sensors that can be purchased for research, consultancy and policymaking.","[{""name"": ""Christian Nnaemeka Egwim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hafiz Alaka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Youlu Pan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Habeeb Balogun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saheed Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdul Hye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oluwapelumi Oluwaseun Egunjobi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2018.08.026"", ""10.1038/s41562-022-01478-5"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2023.104441"", ""10.3390/su13020599"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2008.12.017"", ""10.1038/s41586-021-04190-y""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-12-2019-0343,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Engineering project networks: providing ""sustainable work systems"" for construction knowledge workers","Purpose The construction industry faces three emergent developments that in all likelihood will transform the industry into the future. First, engineering project networks (EPNs), in which teams collaborate on projects remotely in time and space, are transforming global construction practices. Second, as a major consumer of resources and significant producer of green-house gases, construction is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Third, the construction industry presents as one of the least socially sustainable work environments, with high job dissatisfaction, skewed work–life balance and over representation of depressive and mental disorders. It is incumbent on the industry to reconcile these issues. Specifically, what scope is there to shape the evolution of EPNs towards a configuration that both promotes sustainability generally, and enhances quality of work-life issues, while at the same time continuing to apprehend the economic dividends for which it is adopted? As salient as this question is, it has not been broached in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to survey the extent to which EPNs align with the sustainability agenda, more broadly, and that of employee work-place satisfaction, more specifically. Design/methodology/approach A literature review of current knowledge of these concerns is explored and a summative assessment presented. Findings To the best of the authors’ knowledge, as the first in its kind, the study brings to light that EPNs go a long way towards facilitating economic objectives, part way towards realising ecological and sociological objectives but make hardly any impact on improving employee work satisfaction. Originality/value This paper examines an entirely novel area that has not been studied yet. Future research should take up this finding to determine how EPNs may be further adapted to accommodate these wider necessary objectives.","[{""name"": ""M.

10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0554,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Effect of traffic data set on various machine-learning algorithms when forecasting air quality,"Purpose Road traffic emissions are generally believed to contribute immensely to air pollution, but the effect of road traffic data sets on air quality (AQ) predictions has not been fully investigated. This paper aims to investigate the effects traffic data set have on the performance of machine learning (ML) predictive models in AQ prediction. Design/methodology/approach To achieve this, the authors have set up an experiment with the control data set having only the AQ data set and meteorological (Met) data set, while the experimental data set is made up of the AQ data set, Met data set and traffic data set. Several ML models (such as extra trees regressor, eXtreme gradient boosting regressor, random forest regressor, K-neighbors regressor and two others) were trained, tested and compared on these individual combinations of data sets to predict the volume of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the atmosphere at various times of the day. Findings The result obtained showed that various ML algorithms react differently to the traffic data set despite generally contributing to the performance improvement of all the ML algorithms considered in this study by at least 20% and an error reduction of at least 18.97%. Research limitations/implications This research is limited in terms of the study area, and the result cannot be generalized outside of the UK as some of the inherent conditions may not be similar elsewhere. Additionally, only the ML algorithms commonly used in literature are considered in this research, therefore, leaving out a few other ML algorithms. Practical implications This study reinforces the belief that the traffic data set has a significant effect on improving the performance of air pollution ML prediction models. Hence, there is an indication that ML algorithms behave differently when trained with a form of traffic data set in the development of an AQ prediction model. This implies that developers and researchers in AQ prediction need to identify the ML algorithms that behave in their best interest before implementation. Originality/value The result of this study will enable researchers to focus more on algorithms of benefit when using traffic data sets in AQ prediction.","[{""name"": ""Ismail Abiodun Sulaimon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hafiz Alaka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Razak Olu-Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mubashir Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saheed Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdul Hye"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIV-4-W3-2020-21-2020"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0270"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2020.110423"", ""10.1016/j.apr.2016.12.014"", ""10.1111/all.12561"", ""10.1016/j.envpol.2018.07.012"", ""10.1016/j.ijtst.2019.05.008"", ""10.1016/j.apr.2021.101153"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0211"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0164"", ""10.1016/j.apr.2018.03.008"", ""10.1038/jes.2012.85"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0057"", ""10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.03.001"", ""10.3390/app10072401"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0195"", ""10.3390/atmos12060686"", ""10.1016/j.apr.2019.11.019"", ""10.1016/j.apr.2019.11.018"", ""10.1289/ehp.1002767"", ""10.3390/su12218984"", ""10.3390/app8122570"", ""10.1007/s00500-019-04556-5"", ""10.1016/j.apr.2020.02.024"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2921578"", ""10.1080/19942060.2021.1926328"", ""10.3390/ijerph14020114"", ""10.1016/j.apr.2020.09.003""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

The purose of this study is to uncover the factors influencing e-procurement acceptance in the public sector of Ghana’s construction industry (GCI). Using an extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT 2), variables that promote the acceptance of e-procurement in GCI were explored. Design/methodology/approach Data was collected using a mixed method strategy. In the first stage, a semi-structured interview was used to collect, assess and optimize the UTAUT2 model. Thematic analysis was used on the qualitative data, leading to modification of the proposed UTAUT2 model. The study subsequently used a questionnaire survey using the extended UTAUT2 model. Survey data was analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM), leading to the identification and validation of factors that facilitate e-procurement acceptance in Ghanaian construction as well as the impact of these factors. Findings The findings of the study reveal that five independent constructs of the proposed UTAUT2 model significantly affects the behavioural intention of practitioners to accept and use e-procurement in the construction industry in Ghana. Practical implications The study will be of utility to government agencies, contracting organizations and other construction stakeholders in developing policy and programmes to support e-procurement acceptance within the sector.

10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0477,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Durability and microstructure study of alkali-activated slag concrete with quartz sand subjected to different exposure conditions,"Purpose One of the sources for the increase in the carbon footprint on the earth is the manufacturing of cement, which causes a severer environmental impact. Abundant research is going on to diminish CO2 content in the atmosphere by appropriate utilization of waste by-products of industries. Alkali-activated slag concrete (AASC) is an innovative green new concrete made by complete replacement of cement various supplementary cementitious raw materials. Concrete is a versatile material used in different fields of structures, so it is very important to study the durability in different exposures along with the strength. The purpose of this paper is to study the performance of AASC by incorporating quartz sand as fine aggregate under different exposure conditions. Design/methodology/approach The materials for this innovative AASC are selected based on preliminary studies and literature surveys. Based on numerous trials a better performance mix proportion of AASC with quartz sand is developed with 1:2:4 mix proportion, 0.8 alkali Binder ratio, 19 M of NaOH and 50% concentration of Na2SiO3. Subsequently, AASC cubes are prepared and exposed for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, 90, 112, 180, 252 and 365 days in ambient, acid, alkaline, sulfate, chloride and seawater and tested for compressive strength. In addition, to study the microstructural characteristics, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis was also performed. Findings Long-term performance of AASC developed with quartz sand is very good in the ambient, alkaline environment of 5% NaOH and seawater with the highest compressive strength values of 51.8, 50.83 and 64.46, respectively. A decrease in compressive strengths was observed after the age of 14, 56 and 112 days for acid, chloride and sulfate exposure conditions, respectively. SEM image shows a denser microstructure of AASC matrix for ambient, alkaline of 5% NaOH and seawater. Research limitations/implications The proposed AASC is prepared with a mix proportion of 1:2:4, so the other proportions of AASC need to verify. In general plain, AASC is not used in practice except in few applications, in this work the effect of reinforced AASC is not checked. The real environmental exposure in fields may not create for AASC, as it was tested in different exposure conditions in the laboratory. Practical implications The developed AASC is recommended in practical applications where early strength is required, where the climate is hot, where water is scarce for curing, offshore and onshore constructions exposed to the marine environment and alkaline environment industries like breweries, distilleries and sewage treatment plants. As AASC is recommended for ambient air and in other exposures, its implementation as a construction material will reduce the carbon footprint. Originality/value The developed AASC mix proportion 1:2:4 is an economical mix, because of low binder content, but it exhibits a higher early age compressive strength value of 45.6 MPa at the age of 3 days. The compressive strength increases linearly with age from 3 to 365 days when exposed to seawater and ambient air. The performance of AASC is very good in the ambient, alkaline environment and seawater compared to other exposure conditions.","[{""name"": ""Santosh Kumar Karri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markandeya Raju Ponnada"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lakshmi Veerni"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.01.056"", ""10.3390/su9050767."", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2019-0020"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2019-0156"", ""10.1016/b978-0-08-100025-0.00012-0"", ""10.1016/b978-0-08-096446-1.10006-1"", ""10.3390/min11050544"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0263"", ""10.1007/BF01912193"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/SSP.296.105"", ""10.1021/cg8002959"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.01.021"", ""10.13140/RG.2.2.34337.25441"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.03.289"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.06.045"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.10.017"", ""10.14445/23488352/ijce-v2i10p106"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2010.03.020"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2019-0346"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.03.186"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.07.075"", ""10.1016/j.matpr (2020), 04.696"", ""10.1016/j.dib.2015.10.029"", ""10.29294/ijase.5.1.2018.789-885"", ""10.5860/choice.38-0966"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120636"", ""10.1016/j.hbrcj.2012.10.003"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2020-0031"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2020-0075"", ""10.3390/su11215935"", ""10.5829/idosi.wasj.2013.25.08.1376"", ""10.12989/acc.2017.5.6.671"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123383"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.11.095""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into how the development of an interactive digital twin creates a variety of interactions between users of this technology and assets to be monitored. Design/methodology/approach The development of a digital twin inspection model, focusing on the specific case of a sewage pumping station, is chosen as the subject of a case study. Through the development of this model, this study explores the various user–technology interactions that can be designed in a digital twin context. Findings Users interact with digital twins by following virtual instructions in a certain way, which creates a “quasi-other” relationship. A digital twin based on virtual reality (VR) also make users feel as if they are within the created VR of an inspection site, thereby immersing them in the VR environment. The design of a VR-based digital twin, which is determined by decisions made during the development process, shapes the context in which users interact with the technology and assets. Originality/value This study shows that a digital twin in construction practice may play different “actant” roles having different types of influences. Analyzing these actant roles and influences in terms of force and visibility adds a new perspective on the interaction between users and digital twins in construction and asset monitoring practice.","[{""name"": ""Hans Voordijk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Faridaddin Vahdatikhaki"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lars Hesselink"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09518398.2010.529849"", ""10.1108/ECAM-07-2014-0097"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.10.252"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.10.253"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103179"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1966980"", ""10.36680/j.itcon.2023.008"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001928"", ""10.1016/j.mfglet.2018.02.006"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104736"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103838"", ""10.1007/s13347-021-00484-1"", ""10.1061/9780784412329.061"", ""10.1016/j.mfglet.2014.12.001"", ""10.1080/15578771.2018.1479723"", ""10.1080/15623599.2023.2219941"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2023.104785"", ""10.54941/ahfe1002058"", ""10.3390/buildings12071013"", ""10.1007/s41062-017-0061-z"", ""10.1017/dce.2020.16"", ""10.3390/BUILDINGS12020120"", ""10.1145/1162511.1151586"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00087"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2016.11.152"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102853"", ""10.1177/0162243905285847"", ""10.1007/s11097-008-9099-x"", ""10.3389/frvir.2021.656423"", ""10.5840/techne201411322"", ""10.1162/105474698565686""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geology', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

It draws on literature on ‘dialogic feedback’ and theoretical accounts of ‘dialogue’, framing the notion of the dialogic as one in which meanings and identities are realized through a multi-voiced state, questioning the extent to which studio-based tutorials can be considered dialogic. The study uses thematic analysis to reflect on 212 accounts of educators and students at a UK-based architecture school. The article highlights that a comprehension-oriented praxis as opposed to an assessment-oriented praxis can better enable dialogic practice, allowing learners to realize, position and comprehend their own voice amongst the divergent views. The article extends the critical body of work dedicated to evaluating feedback delivery in one-off review sessions, to the context of tutorials and their longitudinal implications on the learning experience.","[{""name"": ""Mina Tahsiri"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120345266 University of the West of England""]}]","[""10.1080/03075071003731135"", ""10.1111/jade.12042"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1080/03075070600572132"", ""10.1080/03075071003642449"", ""10.1177/001316446002000104"", ""10.1093/poq/nfp031"", ""10.1017/S089006041000020X"", ""10.1080/13562510120045230"", ""10.1016/S0363-8111(02)00108-X"", ""10.1177/0959354302012002631"", ""10.1177/1354067X10388840"", ""10.1111/j.1360-6441.2006.00325.x"", ""10.1080/0260293042003243896"", ""10.1016/0732-118X(93)90008-2"", ""10.11120/jebe.2011.06010044"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(99)00002-2"", ""10.1386/adch.2.3.101/0"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2006.00495.x"", ""10.1080/01411920701532228"", ""10.1386/adch_00020_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Education', 'Language and Linguistics']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7459), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7421)]]"

This paper engages this problematic through the lens of Gibson’s theory of ‘affordances’—the ways the material world affords for human desires. We first explore some conceptual and methodological problems of the theory of affordances and its application in understanding and designing public space. These dimensions of affordance theory are then reconceived using the relational thinking of assemblage and actor-network theory (ANT). A key contribution of the paper is an expanded typology of affordances which includes improvised and serendipitous affordances that extend beyond the intentions of designers and users. This opens new ways of thinking about the design of urban public space as a space of possibility where outcomes are open, multiple, and unpredictable.

This trend is revolutionizing multiple application domains along the whole human activity spectrum, while pushing the growth of new businesses and innovations such as smart manufacturing, cities and transportation systems, as well as personalized healthcare. Technological advances in the Internet of Things, Big Data, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence have effected tremendous progress toward the autonomic control of SCPS operations. However, the inherently dynamic nature of physical environments challenges SCPS’ ability to perform adequate control actions over managed physical assets in myriad of contexts. From a design perspective, this issue is related to the system states of operation that cannot be predicted entirely at design time, and the consequential need to define adequate capabilities for run-time self-adaptation and self-evolution. Nevertheless, adaptation and evolution actions must be assessed before realizing them in the managed system in order to ensure resiliency while minimizing the risks. Therefore, the design of SCPS must address not only dependable autonomy but also operational resiliency. In light of this, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a reference architecture for designing dependable and resilient SCPS that integrates concepts from the research areas of Digital Twin, Adaptive Control and Autonomic Computing. Second, we propose a model identification mechanism for guiding self-evolution, based on continuous experimentation, evolutionary optimization and dynamic simulation, as the architecture’s first major component for dependable autonomy. Third, we propose an adjustment mechanism for self-adaptation, based on gradient descent, as the architecture’s second major component, addressing operational resiliency. Our contributions aim to further advance the research of reliable self-adaptation and self-evolution mechanisms and their inclusion in the design of SCPS. Finally, we evaluate our contributions by implementing prototypes and showing their viability using real data from a case study in the domain of intelligent transportation systems.","[{""name"": ""Luis F.

Governing partial differential equations for the coupled heat and moisture transfer were formulated. Four panel connections proposed by pre-cast/pre-stressed concrete institute were modeled for the ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete facade panel as illustrations and a finite element method was used to solve the numerical models.FindingsThe results of heat transfer analysis showed that steel connections could significantly reduce the thermal resistivity of facade panels by converging heat fluxes and acting as thermal bridges within facade panels. The results also showed that the maximum heat flux in the steel connector of the panel to foundation connection was 10 times higher compared to the other connections. Also, the results of moisture transfer showed that air gaps between the panels had higher moisture flux compared to the other layers in the models. The results show the significant importance of panel connections in the energy performance analysis of facade systems. They also highlight the importance of devising novel connection designs and materials that consider the transient, coupled heat and moisture transfer in the connections to effectively exploit the potential opportunities provided by innovative facade systems to improve building energy efficiency.Originality/valueThis paper, for the first time, investigates the effect of panel connections in the hygrothermal performance of building facade systems using a coupled, transient heat and moisture transfer analysis.","[{""name"": ""Bahram Abediniangerabi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohsen Shahandashti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Atefe Makhmalbaf"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.06.027"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2015.12.043"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2014.11.019"", ""10.1016/S0017-9310(00)00003-X"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.04.009"", ""10.21086/ksles.2017.12.24.6.752"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.10.043"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2019.101812"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.01.130"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2012.11.015"", ""10.1177/1097196304042436"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.04.020"", ""10.1016/j.calphad.2007.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.03.052"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.07.039"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.06.038"", ""10.30638/eemj.2014.320"", ""10.15554/pcij56.2-06"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.087"", ""10.18869/acadpub.jafm.73.238.26484"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.12.074"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2016.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.10.075"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.139"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.08.039"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2008.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.10.037"", ""10.1177/1744259114543984""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

This collaborative work will greatly enhance the formulation of theoretically relevant frameworks to guide empirical research and application, particularly relevant in the search for causal mechanisms to reduce costly and avoidable hospital readmissions for chronic conditions.

10.22616/j.landarchart.2023.22.09,LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE AND ART,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design; 0834 Landscape Architecture,Community Engagement in Urban Experiments: Joint Effort for Sustainable Urban Transformation,"The increasing complexity of urban regeneration issues has recently made multi-stakeholder collaboration an important part to solve policy problems. While residents form an important part in a variety of collaborative governance processes, approaches used are often criticized as too formal, and lacking more inclusive participation. Therefore, new informal mechanisms of collaboration are sought, to ensure a more effective engagement and representation of population groups. Although community-led participation is the approach that leads to a more effective collaborative process, issues of power and inequality are a challenge in many places in planning practice [13]. Ways of civic empowerment, communication, and negotiation provide participants with transformative learning opportunities so that not only their arguments change but also the participants of the participation process themselves [6]. In order to test urban development ideas, the notion of ""urban experiment"" has been developed in recent years as a recognized and effective approach. The urban environment is viewed as a creative laboratory for testing the implementation of diverse initiatives and innovations [8]. The inner-city neighbourhoods in many cities are struggling to ensure vitality and liveability, thus these areas often represent a widespread location of urban experiments. In addition to these questions, the problem of community representation manifests itself in many inner cities. The potential to transform city centre streets and vacant areas into user-friendly urban spaces and the impact of those transformations on the city’s livability were recently tested by Riga municipality. Urban experiments varied in scale and form, resulting in street pedestrianization, urban gardens, and other temporary initiatives, which allowed more space for walking and cycling, street sales, social events and other activities. Thus, the aim of this article is to explore processes of testbed planning with regard to the role of community participation in the designing, implementing, and analysing phases of the experiment. After presenting the findings, the article concludes with a discussion on factors that influence public participation in collaborative governance including communication, the balance of interests, and the degree of resident involvement in decision-making.","[{""name"": ""Sandra Treija"", ""affiliation"": [""Riga Technical University""]}, {""name"": ""Gintaras Stauskis"", ""affiliation"": [""Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Lithuania""]}, {""name"": ""Alisa Korolova"", ""affiliation"": [""Riga Technical University""]}, {""name"": ""Ugis Bratuskins"", ""affiliation"": [""Riga Technical University""]}]","[""10.1108/arch-10-2020-0246"", ""10.1080/01441647.2020.1761907"", ""10.1177/0739456x0202100301"", ""10.1080/17535069.2011.579767"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00773.x"", ""10.1177/1473095207082036"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00535.x"", ""10.1080/02723638.2016.1265870"", ""10.4324/9781315719825"", ""10.17645/up.v6i1.3545"", ""10.1080/17549175.2014.891149"", ""10.2478/aup-2020-0009"", ""10.1332/030557316x14817306640776"", ""10.1080/09613218.2013.736201"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.10.014"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.043"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.12053"", ""10.1080/17549175.2014.884975"", ""10.2478/aup-2022-0011"", ""10.1111/1468-2427.12075"", ""10.1080/09654313.2018.1435631"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2014.11.026"", ""10.1016/j.trip.2022.100585"", ""10.4324/9781315719825-4"", ""10.4324/9781315719825-6"", ""10.1080/09654313.2017.1393047"", ""10.1080/13549830050009328"", ""10.1177/0308518x19826085"", ""10.4324/9781315719825-12"", ""10.1080/15568318.2022.2095945"", ""10.17645/up.v6i4.4406"", ""10.3390/ijerph14010071"", ""10.3390/ijerph17103584"", ""10.22616/j.landarchart.2018.13.06"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2018.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127586"", ""10.1016/j.urbmob.2022.100015"", ""10.1080/13604813.2017.1325207"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2017.04.012"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121004"", ""10.1002/wcc.137"", ""10.4324/9781315719825"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2015.11.011"", ""10.1016/j.jth.2019.100613""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Urban Studies', 'Media Technology']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

In the absence of these interactions, alone in my flat, I've been thinking of the comfort that comes from not having my ideas challenged, although we continue our learning digitally, it feels stunted. Without our community we must travel a road upon which our own ideas are absolute and this I believe limits the learning experience.

Co-production has two sides—the ‘co’ side refers to actors and their motivations, while the ‘production’ side refers to phases and instruments. This paper examines privately owned public space/s (POPS) based on the two sides of co-production. Thereby, it addresses two research gaps. First, less has been written to date on the involvement of actors other than local authorities and developers. Second, little attention has been paid to the phase through which POPS are co-produced. The paper fills these research gaps by presenting the empirical work undertaken in HafenCity, Hamburg. It reveals a wide range of actors engaged in four different phases through various instruments. This paper also identifies challenges of co-production of POPS, and makes recommendations.","[{""name"": ""Dahae Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nele Scholten"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.22323/2.19040306"", ""10.1080/14719037.2013.806578"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00773.x"", ""10.1080/14719030601022874"", ""10.1007/978-3-7091-0107-0"", ""10.1177/0042098018819734"", ""10.1080/17549175.2023.2284221"", ""10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00041.x"", ""10.1080/13574809.2018.1429214"", ""10.3390/su13126730"", ""10.1177/0042098015613235"", ""10.4324/9780203495117"", ""10.1080/13574809.2013.800451"", ""10.1177/08854122231219919"", ""10.1080/17535069.2020.1815828"", ""10.14361/9783839462324"", ""10.1080/13574809.2022.2036110"", ""10.3828/tpr.64.2.6h26535771454436"", ""10.1177/1078087414522391"", ""10.1111/puar.12765"", ""10.1017/S1474746407004174"", ""10.1177/0042098009342903"", ""10.13060/00380288.2008.44.6.04"", ""10.1111/1467-8551.12010"", ""10.1016/0305-750X(96)00023-X"", ""10.1111/j.1541-0072.1981.tb01208.x"", ""10.1057/udi.2011.12"", ""10.1177/0020852314566008"", ""10.1177/1078087407306325"", ""10.3828/tpr.2016.12"", ""10.1080/13574809.2010.502350"", ""10.1007/s11266-012-9307-8"", ""10.1080/14719037.2014.930505"", ""10.2307/975377""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Architecture', 'Public Administration', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0813 建筑学', 0.7506), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7274)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-03-2023-0092,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,"Challenges, drivers and incentives to private sector participation in public-private partnership projects in developing countries: evidence from Zambia","Purpose Governments in developing countries seeking to meet their infrastructure backlog are increasingly turning to public–private partnerships (PPP) due to a lack of public funds. However, while there are factors which drive the current uptake of projects, there are challenges with attracting private finance, and it is not clear what incentives can be used to attract more private participation, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Therefore, this study aims to examine challenges, drivers and incentives that affect private participation in PPP projects in Zambia. Design/methodology/approach The study used a qualitative approach with semi-structured interviews with participants who had first-hand experience working on the administration of PPP projects. The participants were predominantly from the public sector, and so the results are largely a public sector perspective on the matter. Findings The findings show that bureaucracy and a poor business environment emanating from poor policies, long procedures and a poor economic environment are the main challenges affecting PPP projects. The current demand for the projects is being driven by a stable business and economic environment while incentives include enhancing the business environment by improving procedures and policies. Originality/value The study contributes to extant literature by proposing an overarching theory about the challenges affecting the implementation of PPP projects in Zambia, in particular, and in SSA, in general. The results show areas where governments and government agencies responsible for PPP projects can focus attention to promote private participation.","[{""name"": ""Ephraim Zulu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Josephine Mutwale"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sambo Lyson Zulu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Innocent Musonda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Neema Kavishe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cletus Moobela"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-01-2019-0028"", ""10.1515/ldr-2013-0018"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2016-0029"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-10-2019-0078"", ""10.1007/s12132-010-9108-3"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1736835"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000479"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2516.2008.01701.x"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-06-2019-0049"", ""10.1016/j.jdeveco.2021.102629"", ""10.1108/CCSM-04-2020-0101"", ""10.1002/sd.2165"", ""10.1016/B978-008043972-3/50022-0"", ""10.1002/epa2.1131"", ""10.1080/03768359908440101"", ""10.22617/WPS189626-2"", ""10.1177/0095399711413868"", ""10.3389/fbuil.2023.1098490"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001879"", ""10.17221/161/2017-AGRICECON"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1703088"", ""10.1080/01441647.2015.1077288"", ""10.1080/17452007.2018.1545632"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0195"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2019-0138"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0481"", ""10.28991/cej-2019-03091439"", ""10.1016/j.cstp.2018.04.003"", ""10.3905/jsf.2011.17.3.066"", ""10.5771/9783748908043-295"", ""10.1007/s11135-017-0574-8"", ""10.1080/2159676X.2017.1393221"", ""10.1177/1049732307307031"", ""10.3390/su13010153"", ""10.1332/030557318X15200933925414""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

It reflects on a specific case of design/research/teaching that transpired within the context of the Visual Communication Design curriculum at Stellenbosch University. A post-qualitative approach was followed; i.e. the researcher actively worked at resisting pre-conceived hierarchies and differences not just in thinking about the research, but also in its doing. The research demonstrated that decolonization requires relentless processes of collaborative resistance and that active commitment to new materialist praxis can positively contribute to individuals becoming more attuned to recognizing moments of transformation within their situated present. It was found that integrating creative play with representational media such as text and layout design within the research process facilitated this. The more transformative moments became visible and felt, the more ‘real’ decolonization seemed to become.","[{""name"": ""Karolien Perold-Bull"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 000000012214904X Stellenbosch University""]}]","[""10.1080/15575330409490110"", ""10.1111/j.1741-5446.2009.00345.x"", ""10.1177/0263276407085156"", ""10.1080/18186874.2018.1474990"", ""10.1177/1077800412471510"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.47.2.0049"", ""10.1177/1474022215618513"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00157"", ""10.1080/20421338.2014.987987"", ""10.15700/saje.v38n4a1699"", ""10.1080/02589346.2018.1418202"", ""10.1386/adch_00019_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/joid.12176,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Baby Boomer Knowledge and Stigma Toward Aging in Place and Residential Assistive Devices,"Aging in place (AIP) in one's existing residence is a more affordable housing alternative than long–term care and is desired by the majority of those aged 50–80. Considerable residential upgrades are required to accommodate the physical and mental effects of aging; however, U.S. housing is severely lacking in assistive devices required to respond to those needs. While research suggests that assistive device implementation can delay long–term institutionalization, baby boomer stigma and lack of knowledge may have an impact on why so few AIP upgrades have occurred. Using design thinking strategies, we explored baby boomer knowledge and stigma toward the term AIP and residential assistive devices. A secondary purpose was to expose baby boomers to an AIP checklist to determine if the checklist would influence participant knowledge and stigma. Fifteen baby boomers ( n = 15) participated in the study, and less than half expressed ( n = 7) familiarity with the term AIP. Participants used alternate phrases such as “avoiding the nursing home”; or “doing things to stay independent.” Most participants did not associate stigma toward the term AIP; yet, their knowledge of AIP devices was minimal until exposed to the AIP checklist. After exposure to the checklist, participants were significantly more familiar with the term AIP and significantly more likely to think standard products could be considered as AIP residential assistive devices. In this study, we also used participant created prototypes to understand the means by which baby boomers would like to gain knowledge on AIP upgrades.","[{""name"": ""Sharon E.

The objective is to optimize volumetric spaces (3D) instead of 2D spaces to enhance space utilization, thermal comfort, constructability and rental value of buildings Design/methodology/approach The integration of two fundamental concepts – BIM and MOO, forms the basis of proposed framework. In the early design phases of a project, BIM is used to generate precise building volume data. The non-sorting genetic algorithm-II, a MOO algorithm, is then used to optimize extracted volume data from 3D BIM models, considering four objectives: space utilization, thermal comfort, rental value and construction cost. The framework is implemented in context of a school of architecture building project. Findings The findings of case study demonstrate significant improvements resulting from MOO of building volumes. Space utilization increased by 30%, while thermal comfort improved by 20%, and construction costs were reduced by 10%. Furthermore, rental value of the case study building increased by 33%. Practical implications The proposed framework offers practical implications by enabling project teams to generate optimal building floor layouts during early design stages, thereby avoiding late costly changes during construction phase of project.

Design/methodology/approach The framework has been proposed based on an exhaustive literature review and statistical analysis of the PPI-ICT projects’ data set using logistic regression, F-test and student’s t-test. The proposed framework was also applied to the PPI-ICT projects. Findings The framework is an extension to NTCP (novelty, technology, complexity and pace) approach by including extrinsic factors such as income of the country, climate risk, religious diversity, political stability, regularity quality and control of corruption. The proposed framework was used to analyze project characteristics and their external conditions in the context of developing countries. Based on the analyses, the authors have presented a detailed set of recommendations for project managers, practitioners and governments to improve the success rate of these projects. Originality/value The major contribution of this study is the framework, which encompasses the NTCP model as well as extrinsic characteristics of PPI-ICT projects. The proposed framework is meant to assist the project managers to comprehend the project characteristics and its external environment to identify an adequate approach for managing projects successfully.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Ayat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sheheryar Mohsin Qureshi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Changwook Kang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.is.2011.10.010"", ""10.1111/j.1467-7679.2006.00321.x"", ""10.3390/app9010171"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.04.004"", ""10.1109/EUROMICRO.2007.35"", ""10.1177/875697280603700505"", ""10.1080/1097198X.2018.1462071"", ""10.1093/oxrep/grp024"", ""10.1016/j.telpol.2013.12.003"", ""10.1111/pirs.12050"", ""10.2307/3094871"", ""10.1002/tie.22120"", ""10.1002/cjas.1569"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.08.027"", ""10.1007/s11575-017-0312-4"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.giq.2007.08.007"", ""10.1108/09534810810884858"", ""10.1057/s41267-017-0104-x"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2020.09.016"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2007.04.003"", ""10.1596/1813-9450-3689"", ""10.2118/197858-MS"", ""10.1287/orsc.2013.0860"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.05.010"", ""10.1080/17509653.2019.1604191"", ""10.1016/j.infoandorg.2008.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2014.10.047"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-12-2019-0298"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.11.008"", ""10.4018/IJISSS.2020010103"", ""10.1016/S0954-349X(99)00010-7"", ""10.1007/s12205-013-0354-5"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2009.03.003""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-08-2022-0446,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,An analytical approach for the determination of helical gear tooth geometry,"Purpose This paper aims to present an analytical approach for the determination of helical gear tooth geometry and introduces the necessary parameters. Tooth geometry including tooth chamfer, involute curve, root fillet, helix as well as tooth microgeometry can be obtained using the presented approach. Design/methodology/approach The presented analytical approach involves deriving the equivalent equations at the transverse plane rather than the normal plane. Moreover, numerical evaluation of microgeometry modifications is presented for tooth profile, tooth lead and flank twist. Findings An analytical approach is presented and equations are derived and explained in detail for helical gear tooth geometry calculation, including tooth microgeometry. Method 1, which was presented by Lopez and Wheway (1986) for obtaining the root fillet, is examined and it is proven that it does not work accurately for helical gears, but rather it works perfectly in the case of spur gears. Changing the normal plane parameters in Method 1 to the transverse plane ones does not give correct results. Two alternative methods, namely, Methods 2 and 3, are developed in the current research for the calculation of the tooth root fillet of helical gears. The presented methods and also the numerical evaluation presented for microgeometry modification are examined against the geometry obtained from Windows LDP software. The results show very good agreement, and it is feasible to apply the approach using the presented equations. Originality/value In the gear design process, it is important to model the correct gear tooth geometry and deliver all related dimensions and calculations accurately. However, the determination of helical gear tooth geometry has not been presented adequately by equations to facilitate gear modelling. The detailed helical gear tooth root has been enveloped using software tools that can simulate the cutter motion. Deriving those equations, presented in this article, provides gear design engineers and researchers with the possibility to model helical gears and perform design calculations in a structured, applicable and accurate method.","[{""name"": ""Omar D.

While distributed ledger technology (DLT) offers substantial potential in tackling these issues, its implementation faces numerous obstacles. This study aims to investigate the challenges hindering the adoption of DLT within the Nigerian construction sector, capitalizing on a recognized research gap in this field. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review identified 20 challenges to DLT adoption. A structured questionnaire was developed and distributed to 98 construction professionals selected from a pool of 5,330 members using purposive and snowball sampling. Background information was assessed using frequency and percentage, data normality with the Shapiro–Wilk test and nonparametric data compared using the Kruskal–Wallis H-test. Factor analysis was then used to reduce the challenges into a more coherent set. Findings Findings revealed the top five challenges: power supply issues, data privacy and compliance, an uncertain legal framework, insufficient training and education and a lack of skilled workforce. Further analysis revealed four clusters of challenges, namely, technical and infrastructure barriers, organizational and cultural challenges, financial and economic challenges and regulatory and legal challenges. Practical implications Through the evaluation of challenges and potential strategies to overcome them, this study aims to lay a foundation that assists construction entities in effectively harnessing the benefits of DLT while navigating the obstacles inherent in its adoption. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering insights into the challenges surrounding the adoption of DLT, specifically within the Nigerian construction sector. By juxtaposing the findings from this study with existing research conducted in other countries such as India, South Africa and the USA, a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges unique to the Nigerian context can be gained.","[{""name"": ""Ayodeji Emmanuel Oke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""John Aliu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lydia Uyi Ehiosun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Farouk Kineber"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Seyi Segun Stephen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0292"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1894633"", ""10.3390/smartcities5030049"", ""10.3390/businesses2040030"", ""10.1108/JGOSS-06-2020-0027"", ""10.1108/BIJ-07-2021-0433"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2019.07.005"", ""10.1177/1744987120927206"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2021.102803"", ""10.1108/PM-10-2022-0072"", ""10.3390/su12229539"", ""10.3390/su13094672"", ""10.1680/ensu.2008.161.4.219"", ""10.1080/00949655.2019.1658763"", ""10.1002/bse.3110"", ""10.1108/IJCHM-03-2021-0365"", ""10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-11929"", ""10.1080/00036846.2021.1898535"", ""10.1080/20430795.2022.2030663"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1658697"", ""10.1016/j.jii.2020.100125"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2023.106609"", ""10.1007/s11356-021-16376-y"", ""10.1177/2277975220932343"", ""10.12691/ajams-9-1-2"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"", ""10.1016/j.im.2021.103444"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2021-0335"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.743"", ""10.1108/IMDS-08-2018-0365""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/jade.12424,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Abductive Reasoning: A Design Thinking Experiment,"AbstractDesign thinking fundamentally relies on abductive reasoning. Diverse thinking types such as divergent thinking, systems thinking, and empathetic thinking have been adopted in design thinking education. Yet, it is very rare to address abductive reasoning to be integrated in a design thinking course because of deductive validity and inductive strength. In practice, the quality of design thinking is judged from design outcomes in terms of creativity and innovation rather than the application of abductive reasoning in thinking that is necessary for educators to develop diverse instructional strategies for design thinking. Through a design thinking experiment where abductive reasoning was structured for groups of students to modify their chosen fairy stories by challenging identified lessons/values/beliefs, we articulated relevant strategies from case analysis. As a result, we discovered the following six strategies for abductive reasoning: questioning on socially given identity; restructuring a hierarchy of values; de‐ and re‐contextualisation; perspective‐taking; being intersubjective through body swapping; and developing imaginative empathy for compassion.

The COVID-19 crisis is also an opportunity for the extractive industry (EI) sectors to review their digitalization processes. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of infectious disease mitigation in EI and to evaluate the resilience of these industries as they address pandemic prevention and control. Design/methodology/approach Multi-case studies including digital and organizational responses to COVID-19 were analyzed to evaluate the readiness of health risk management (HRM) and resilience of EIs against the pandemic. The evaluation uses Google Scholar and Trends searches to compare the level of relevant activity in EIs with other industries. Findings Although EI sectors have various plans for minimizing pandemic impacts, unexpected disruptions and delays of the COVID-19 responses revealed many limitations of the existing HRM system. Digital technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence-based public health monitoring, digital collaboration, wearable health tracking and 3D printing) demonstrated their remarkable benefits in the pandemic responses and nontechnical elements affecting technology adoption (TA). Originality/value Lessons learned from the deployment of digital technologies against the pandemic help to improve the organizational capacity to deal effectively with future outbreaks and suggest lessons for the future trajectory of TA in these industries.","[{""name"": ""Trung Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ray Gosine"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Warrian"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/heapol/czw056"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2019.06.007""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Health Professions']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-02-2023-0040,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A categorization of factors affecting quality of design documentation in Tanzanian construction projects,"Purpose The design documents are products of a process that aims to provide sufficient details to enable the contractor to efficiently implement the project at a realistic cost. Accordingly, it is expected that these design documents must be of high quality to engender the attainment of the desired project objectives. The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors that affect the quality of design documentation in construction projects in the context of a developing country. Design/methodology/approach This study used a descriptive research design involving professionals from firms offering services in areas of design and documentation, mainly architectural, quantity surveying and engineering. A total of 80 out of 84 questionnaires were received and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25, and a factor analysis approach was used to categorize the factors into smaller five groups. Findings The factors were subsequently categorized according to size, time, staff, quality and training-related factors. Collectively, large size of the project, inadequate supervision of junior design staff, low professional fees, procurement process and system, failure to adopt quality management systems and allocation or assigning of staff to more than one project at the same time have high influence (component loading of 700) in respective groups. Research limitations/implications The reliance on data to analyze the factors of design documents in construction projects in developing economies context, using a Tanzanian exemplar, is considered a limitation. Developing countries with similar economic characteristics, procurement systems and cultural setup could benefit from the results of this study. Practical implications The study of factors affecting quality of design and documents in construction projects serves as a guide for built environment firms in Tanzania in conducting effective business and ensuring quality design documents, hence improved project performance. Understanding the nature of relationship between the design and construction teams as well as the impact of design documents on project performance is of great importance for the design teams of future projects and other decision-makers to pay attention when preparing design and related documents, especially during design stage of construction projects in developing countries. Originality/value The study contributes the knowledge by providing useful insights on the subject through a categorization of the factors affecting the quality of design documentation and exploring the nature of relationship between the design and construction teams in construction projects within a previously unexplored Tanzanian context focusing on a traditional procurement system for future improvement of project delivery, hence project success.","[{""name"": ""Nyamagere Gladys Sospeter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17452007.2018.1561412"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08- 2018-0137"", ""10.1016/s0263-7863(02)00083-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.11.010"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-10-2017-0050"", ""10.17159/2309-8775/2016/v58n3a5"", ""10.1108/CI-09-2019-0098"", ""10.1108/02630800910956434"", ""10.15641/jcbm.1.2.59"", ""10.1080/15578771.2017.1316802"", ""10.1080/09613218.2013.775895"", ""10.35188/UNU-WIDER/2018/573-2"", ""10.1080/01446193.2010.540019"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000116"", ""10.1080/15623599.2013.10773217"", ""10.1080/15578771.2017.1420711"", ""10.1504/IJPOM.2013.053153"", ""10.1108/MRR-02-2013-0027"", ""10.1108/JFM-02-2021-0025"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-03-2021-0065"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v8i1.2995"", ""10.3390/_su13148078"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-03-2020-0087"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-03-2021-0040"", ""10.1080/15578771.2022.2094506"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/471/5/052012"", ""10.5539/jsd.v10n4p130"", ""10.1016/j.jretai.2008.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1992)118:1(34)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(1989)115:2(125)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1988)114:1(69)"", ""10.1142/S1609945102000035"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0009.2012.00678.x"", ""10.1080/01446193.2010.540019"", ""10.5592/otmcj.2013.1.4""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1111/jade.12311,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,"A Cognitive Learning Account of the Avoidance, Omission and Exaggerated Phenomena and Expressions in Young Adolescents' Drawings of the Human Figure in the Visual Culture Art Education Context","AbstractIt is common in the everyday art class to find many examples of avoidance, omission and exaggeration in young adolescents’ depictions of the human figure. When students depict sophisticated human images, they make every effort to avoid the difficult parts, and some students tend to exaggerate the size or distort the shape of the human image. Art educators see these types of behaviour and modes of expression as unnatural, and claim that they may hinder the development of the creativity of young adolescents. Relevant discussions in the literature from a psychological perspective are mainly concerned with the negative impact of such behaviour and modes of expression on the formation of young adolescents’ identities. However, in the context of popular visual culture, the findings of recent studies on young adolescents’ comic drawings have suggested that when young adolescents draw comic characters, they use their everyday life experiences in their drawings. This article reports on a five‐year qualitative longitudinal study conducted in a Hong Kong secondary school. The aim of the study was to deepen our understanding of this behaviour on the part of adolescents in art classes. The findings of the study confirmed the view that these aspects should be interpreted from a cognitive learning perspective. It is suggested that art educators reconsider these types of behaviour and modes of expression as a potential means for improving secondary students’ learning of the art of popular visual culture.","[{""name"": ""Chung‐yim Lau"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1476-8070.1991.tb00561.x"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.1993.tb00587.x"", ""10.1037/10452-000"", ""10.2307/1320466"", ""10.5406/visuartsrese.39.2.0042"", ""10.4324/9780203420720"", ""10.4324/9780203397398"", ""10.1016/S0197-4556(97)00076-2"", ""10.1080/13645579.2015.1017900"", ""10.2307/3193941""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Design/methodology/approach A case study involving a broken chess piece was selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unconventional RE approach. Initially, a laser 3D scanner was used to acquire a (non-uniform rational B-spline) surface model of the object, which was then processed to develop a parametric computer aided design (CAD) model combined with geometric design and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) technique for evaluation and then for FP of the part using a computer numerical controlled (CNC) machine. Findings The effectiveness of the proposed approach for reconstruction and FP of rotational parts was ascertained through a sample part. The study demonstrates non-contact data acquisition technologies such as 3D laser scanners together with RE systems can support to capture the entire part geometry that was broken/worn and developed quickly through the application of computer aided manufacturing principles and a CNC machine. The results indicate that design communication, customer involvement and FP can be efficiently accomplished by means of an integrated RE workflow combined with rapid product development tools and techniques. Originality/value This research established a RE approach for the acquisition of broken/worn part data and the development of parametric CAD models. Then, the developed 3D CAD model was inspected for accuracy by means of the GD&amp;T approach and rapidly developed using a CNC machine. Further, the proposed RE led FP approach can provide solutions to similar industrial situations wherein agility in the product design and development process is necessary to produce physical samples and functional replacement parts for aging systems in a short turnaround time.","[{""name"": ""Boppana V.

The issue's leading fashion editorial feature, “Fashions of the Future,” invited nine industrial designers to dress the “woman of tomorrow.” The feature served as a promotional vehicle for the World's Fair and for the industrial designers who worked on it. Through a close examination of the issue's visual and textual content, this article explores the relationship between industrial design, fashion, consumption, and gender at a formative moment in the professionalization of design in the United States at the outbreak of the Second World War. It argues that fashion media served a discursive function in the elevation of the industrial designer's professional status, presenting a case for further consideration of the relationship between fashion and industrial design in the history of the design profession.","[{""name"": ""Leah Armstrong"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.1111/joid.12226,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Work Activity Pattern and Collaboration Network: New Drivers for Workplace Space Planning and Design,"Information about the users’ work activity patterns is essential for office space planning and the design of organizations. However, it is not clear yet what factors can be used for predicting work activities, especially at the group level. In this study, we found that work activity patterns of groups are associated with the workgroup's job function and their location in the organizational collaboration networks. Two hypotheses were tested through a survey conducted on a sample of 188 managers from an Italian utility company. The participants were asked about (1) the percentage of time different groups (based on job function and demographic composition) spent doing individual, collaborative, and mobile work; and (2) how network connectivity affected individual versus group work. The results showed that workgroups with different job functions spent different percentages of time on individual, mobile, and teamwork. Communication network connectivity is not significantly correlated with the amount of time spent on individual work, but statistical evidence confirmed that it plays an essential role for the assessment of the amount of work time spent on teamwork, even more than job functions. By investigating the factors affecting collaborations between groups, we advanced the research on work activity in large companies in order to complement existing studies that mostly addressed work activity patterns at the individual level. How information about collaboration networks can be utilized for space planning and flexible work arrangement policy–making is also discussed, in light of the changes that the COVID–19 pandemic has triggered.","[{""name"": ""Chiara Tagliaro"", ""affiliation"": [""Politecnico di Milano, Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Yaoyi Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Ying Hua"", ""affiliation"": [""Cornell University, USA""]}]","[""10.2307/41166381"", ""10.1177/001872087301500505"", ""10.1108/14630011111136830"", ""10.1111/joid.12020"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.1993.tb00152.x"", ""10.1108/14630019910811132"", ""10.1080/13678868.2014.979006"", ""10.1177/0013916518759146"", ""10.1108/14630010810881630"", ""10.4324/9780203223109"", ""10.1080/09613218.2018.1440958"", ""10.1057/omj.2009.33"", ""10.1108/02632771111101304"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.05.021"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.90.4.799"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2014.04.007"", ""10.2307/41166386"", ""10.1108/JCRE-03-2017-0009"", ""10.4018/jgim.2005040101"", ""10.1080/09585192.2016.1164217"", ""10.2139/ssrn.1162171"", ""10.1287/orsc.1120.0804"", ""10.1287/orsc.3.3.383"", ""10.1002/9780470759066.ch10"", ""10.1093/sf/sov122"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2011.04.009"", ""10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.707"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.45.2.109"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2009.07.002"", ""10.1177/0013916518794260"", ""10.1108/JCRE-10-2015-0034"", ""10.1108/JCRE-10-2020-0053"", ""10.1177/0013916506295602"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.1993.tb00069.x""]","['Engineering', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Psychology']","['General Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Psychology', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0201 理论经济学', 0.7592), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7575)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

This alternative art school is the most recent of many established in the UK since the government’s Independent Review of Higher Education Funding &amp; Student Finance or Browne Review. This article argues that the processes of ‘economisation’ enacted by this review have severely threatened the health of arts education in the UK, forcing the closure of provision and increasing barriers to higher education arts education for the disadvantaged. This article uses the example of Feral Art School to demonstrate how provincial art schools might re‐emerge in new, counter‐hegemonic forms.

Concepts related to dress, the control of movement, equity, and comfort are also examined. Fashion design process is unpacked, proposing that concepts of fit, tailoring, and mending be applied to interior design. Connections are drawn between the scale at which clothing is patterned and to that of which interior spaces are designed. These concepts are explored further through a creative study based on the pattern making of clothing. An expanded interior design process is proposed to acknowledge more outwardly that interior design understands differing bodies, potentially resulting in more equitable interiors that respond and fit to the evolving characteristics of individual bodies.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Sosa Fontaine"", ""affiliation"": [""Kent State University, USA""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Conservation', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

To achieve the aim, the objectives are to identify CDC that affect WELL collectively; determine CDC that affect health, well-being, and productivity simultaneously; and analyze the interrelationship between the CDC. Design/methodology/approach Data from the semi-structured interviews and a systematic review of the existing literature were gathered for survey development. Next, survey data was collected from 114 professionals living in multistory buildings. Finally, normalized mean analysis, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), agreement analysis and Spearman correlation analysis were used to analyze the collected data. Findings Out of the 51 potential design criteria, 16 are critically affecting WELL collectively. Furthermore, six are critically affecting WELL collectively as well as health, well-being and productivity simultaneously: property price, water flow and supply, water treatment, pest management, management services and waste management. Finally, “water treatment” is highly correlated to “water management” and “water flow and supply.” In addition, “waste management” and “management services,” as well as “fire safety” and “emergency evacuation plans,” are highly correlated. Originality/value This study's originality includes investigating the CDC of residential buildings for the first time, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, in a developing country. As a result, this study uncovers holistic design criteria for policymakers to establish holistic building assessment tools for residential buildings.","[{""name"": ""Salma Husna Zamani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rahimi A.

Case study of Liepaja,"Development of modern technologies and urbanisation enable cities to provide a broad range of services even at night, which means that the nightscape is becoming more used. The goal of the study is to develop recommendations for planning the night-time outdoor space and its elements in an urban environment, with a view to improve the functional and aesthetic quality of the city, and to reduce light pollution. To achieve this goal, the authors studied theoretical materials, analysed the experience of three cities in developing lighting plans, conducted field research and made photographic records to assess various areas, compiling and creating a visual representation of the results. The city-level focus in solving night-time cityscape problems is on the drafting of lighting master plans. Using such plans, one can spur tourism and economic growth, and improve the quality of life among the locals. On the level of the city, elements such as edges, neighbourhoods, roads, landmarks, viewpoints and nodes play an important role at night. One has to identify these elements and highlight them based on the recommendations developed. The proposed development of a Liepāja city lighting plan would strengthen the city’s identity, improve the safety of the night-time use of outdoor spaces, facilitate navigation, and create aesthetically pleasing views. Furthermore, this is an opportunity to reduce light pollution and transition to sustainable solutions through the use of various smart technologies associated with lighting.","[{""name"": ""Rēzija Sabīne Jurševska"", ""affiliation"": [""Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies""]}, {""name"": ""Kristīne Vugule"", ""affiliation"": [""Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies""]}]","[""10.4324/9780429345678"", ""10.2753/jei0021-3624440104"", ""10.36253/bsgi-1346"", ""10.20944/preprints201912.0291.v1"", ""10.22364/adz.56.12"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-2666-9"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3822-9"", ""10.1007/s11245-018-9562-4""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Urban Studies']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-05-2022-0231,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Unlocking the full potential of reality capture for construction project cost monitoring: a mixed review,"Purpose Digital data acquisition is crucial for operations in the digital transformation era. Reality capture (RC) has made an immeasurable contribution to various fields, especially in the built environment. This paper aims to review RC applications, potentials, limitations and the extent to which RC can be adopted for cost monitoring of construction projects. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach, using Bibliometric analysis and the PRISMA framework, was used to review and analyse 112 peer-reviewed journal articles from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Findings The study reveals RC has been applied in various areas in the built environment, but health and safety, cost and labour productivity monitoring have received little or no attention. It is proposed that RC can significantly support cost monitoring owing to its ability to acquire accurate and quick digital as-built 3D point cloud data, which contains rich measurement points for the valuation of work done. Research limitations/implications The study’s conclusions are based only on the Scopus and Web of Science data sets. Only English language documents were approved, whereas others may be in other languages. The research is a non-validation of findings using empirical data to confirm the data obtained from RC literature. Practical implications This paper highlights the importance of RC for cost monitoring in construction projects, filling knowledge gaps and enhancing project outcomes. Social implications The implementation of RC in the era of the digital revolution has the potential to improve project delivery around the world today. Every project’s success is largely determined by the availability of precise and detailed digital data. RC applications have pushed for more sustainable design, construction and operations in the built environment. Originality/value The study has given research trends on the extent of RC applications, potentials, limitations and future directions.","[{""name"": ""Godfred Fobiri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Innocent Musonda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Franco Muleya"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/SASBE-01-2021-0016"", ""10.3390/app10134480"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0013"", ""10.1007/s10064-015-0748-3"", ""10.5937/jaes14-10918"", ""10.3390/buildings11020077"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2018-0242"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103131"", ""10.3390/app11188770"", ""10.3390/app112110370"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.09.636"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2010.04.008"", ""10.3390/s21082580"", ""10.3390/s21113815"", ""10.1155/2021/6621440"", ""10.1016/j.wse.2015.03.001"", ""10.3390/s21124227"", ""10.3390/s20030721"", ""10.7250/bjrbe.2019-14.430"", ""10.3390/s21082834"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2018.11.008"", ""10.3390/app11198936"", ""10.1108/ECAM-05-2021-0414"", ""10.3390/app10238680"", ""10.24928/2021/0148"", ""10.3846/jcem.2020.11803"", ""10.3390/app11167626"", ""10.2495/BIM190121"", ""10.3389/fbuil.2020.581295"", ""10.1007/s11192-015-1765-5"", ""10.24928/2018/0443"", ""10.3389/fbuil.2020.00097"", ""10.1155/2020/8839923"", ""10.3390/buildings11050206"", ""10.1136/bmj.n71"", ""10.3141/2528-05"", ""10.1080/08911762.2020.1765444"", ""10.1155/2021/8899323"", ""10.29007/4nk3"", ""10.1186/s41182-019-0165-6"", ""10.3390/s20195457"", ""10.1016/j.mla.2011.05.006"", ""10.3390/app10031078"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.018"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102846"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10377-8_13"", ""10.1007/s11831-019-09320-4"", ""10.3390/buildings11090412"", ""10.1007/s10846-014-0116-8"", ""10.1108/CI-11-2019-0122"", ""10.1111/1467-8500.12343"", ""10.1177/1687814019872650"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.10.095"", ""10.3390/en12071304"", ""10.23968/2500-0055-2019-4-3-49-54""]","['Computer Science', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Human-Computer Interaction', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Geology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-10-2020-0436,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Tunicate swarm algorithm-trained multi-layered perceptron for data centre energy demand forecasting and relative percentage contribution analysis of input parameters,"Purpose Energy management is critical to data centres (DCs) majorly because they are high energy-consuming facilities and demand for their services continue to rise due to rapidly increasing global demand for cloud services and other technological services. This projected sectoral growth is expected to translate into increased energy demand from the sector, which is already considered a major energy consumer unless innovative steps are used to drive effective energy management systems. The purpose of this study is to provide insights into the expected energy demand of the DC and the impact each measured parameter has on the building's energy demand profile. This serves as a basis for the design of an effective energy management system. Design/methodology/approach This study proposes novel tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA) for training an artificial neural network model used for predicting the energy demand of a DC. The objective is to find the optimal weights and biases of the model while avoiding commonly faced challenges when using the backpropagation algorithm. The model implementation is based on historical energy consumption data of an anonymous DC operator in Cape Town, South Africa. The data set provided consists of variables such as ambient temperature, ambient relative humidity, chiller output temperature and computer room air conditioning air supply temperature, which serve as inputs to the neural network that is designed to predict the DC’s hourly energy consumption for July 2020. Upon preprocessing of the data set, total sample number for each represented variable was 464. The 80:20 splitting ratio was used to divide the data set into training and testing set respectively, making 452 samples for the training set and 112 samples for the testing set. A weights-based approach has also been used to analyze the relative impact of the model’s input parameters on the DC’s energy demand pattern. Findings The performance of the proposed model has been compared with those of neural network models trained using state of the art algorithms such as moth flame optimization, whale optimization algorithm and ant lion optimizer. From analysis, it was found that the proposed TSA outperformed the other methods in training the model based on their mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and prediction accuracy. Analyzing the relative percentage contribution of the model's input parameters based on the weights of the neural network also shows that the ambient temperature of the DC has the highest impact on the building’s energy demand pattern. Research limitations/implications The proposed novel model can be applied to solving other complex engineering problems such as regression and classification. The methodology for optimizing the multi-layered perceptron neural network can also be further applied to other forms of neural networks for improved performance. Practical implications Based on the forecasted energy demand of the DC and an understanding of how the input parameters impact the building's energy demand pattern, neural networks can be deployed to optimize the cooling systems of the DC for reduced energy cost. Originality/value The use of TSA for optimizing the weights and biases of a neural network is a novel study. The application context of this study which is DCs is quite untapped in the literature, leaving many gaps for further research. The proposed prediction model can be further applied to other regression tasks and classification tasks. Another contribution of this study is the analysis of the neural network's input parameters, which provides insight into the level to which each parameter influences the DC’s energy demand profile.","[{""name"": ""Oluwafemi Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Reolyn Heymann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-12767-1_5"", ""10.3390/info8010031"", ""10.1155/2015/369298"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04453-w"", ""10.1155/2019/1480392"", ""10.2298/APT1142241J"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2020.103541"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2020.103541"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-374105-9.00493-7"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-818247-5.00019-8"", ""10.1016/j.amc.2012.04.069"", ""10.1016/S0020-0255(00)00068-2"", ""10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599894"", ""10.3390/rs12060956"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2015.07.178"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.02.020"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.08.021"", ""10.1109/ISI.2015.9"", ""10.1109/ICENCO.2015.7416360"", ""10.1155/2014/878262"", ""10.3390/su12104272""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

The focus of the study is on traditions and peculiarities of their formation, which developed historically in the period of the 18th-19th centuries. Historical-factual, monographic, stylistic, and comparative-historical methods were used during the research. The methods of theoretical analysis, visual inspection and graphic reconstruction were also applied. The article presents a brief history of the emergence of manor and park complexes in the region. Foreign and local specialists, who were involved in their formation, including park areas, are presented. Manor parks were distinguished by the nature of landscape design and planning composition. The article proves that the functional and planning composition of manor parks of the Poltava Region was based on the following structural elements: park (landscape), economic and production, greenhouse, and orchard zones. The main features of the solution of the Poltava Region historical manor parks were revealed. They consisted in the harmonious combination of a natural massif of greenery with created landscape groups, existing water sources with artificial ponds, and architectural buildings of estates. Traditionally, life in Poltava manors was mainly focused on calm rest and the development of agricultural (or industrial) productions’ branches. The landscape and hydrological characteristics of the area and the dendrological composition of the vegetation were the basis for the landscape-planning solution of manor parks. Local gardeners and gardening experts involved in the work tried to preserve and emphasize them. Manor parks continue to interest researchers as examples of garden and park art. Exquisite stylistic solutions, interesting landscape and dendrological compositions were tested on these private territories. Unique views and landscapes were created here.","[{""name"": ""Liudmyla Shevchenko"", ""affiliation"": [""National University “Yuri Kondratyuk Poltava Polytechnic”, Poltava, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Natalia Novoselchuk"", ""affiliation"": [""National University “Yuri Kondratyuk Poltava Polytechnic”, Poltava, Ukraine""]}, {""name"": ""Olena Troshkina"", ""affiliation"": [""National Academy of Fine Arts and Architecture, Kyiv, Ukraine""]}]","[""10.23968/1999-5571-2017-14-3-5-14"", ""10.7312/chet14356-013"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-85043-2_50"", ""10.17721/1728-2640.2017.133.2.04"", ""10.22616/j.landarchart.2022.20.09"", ""10.37222/2524-0331-2021-11(29)-12""]",['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"
10.22616/j.landarchart.2022.21.02,LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE AND ART,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design; 0834 Landscape Architecture,The planning of green infrastructure using a three-level approach,"In recent years, global research in spatial planning has focused on the sustainable development of green infrastructure (GI) in order to reduce the consequences of urbanization processes on the ecological, socio-economic and visual quality of the environment. Problems with stormwater management, floods, storms and global warming in general are just some of the reasons why GI planning has gained popularity. According to other current strategies (EU Biodiversity Strategy, EU GI strategy, Green Deal initiatives, etc.), GI plans, which include social, economic and ecological aspects, are being developed for territories of different scales. Until recently, green infrastructure was just an added value to real estate, but today it plays a completely different, much more important role. In Europe, the GI planning process has already begun, with several European countries developing GI plans in urban environment, different scales across country and even at national level. Depending on the scale chosen, the principles of GI planning differ. In European examples, GI is considered in large-scale regional landscapes, where the green network and connections are formed from natural areas, but at the urban scale, the creation of GI goes hand in hand with the creation of a green network in the city, connecting the largest green areas with each other (squares, parks, urban forests, etc.). However, in the scientific literature, the basic principles and the correlation of GI planning at different scales have not been widely studied and analyzed. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to define the main principles in the planning of GI in Latvia using a three-level approach. Each level corresponds to a specific scale of the territory, starting with the regional scale, moving to rural and urbanized areas and concluding with the site scale. Each lower level is subordinated to the highest, thus forming a single GI planning system. At each level, GI key planning principles and prerequisites to be considered are defined. The town of Aizpute, its neighboring villages and rural areas in Latvia were chosen as a case study territory for the article. Article discusses the planning of GI in the context of three levels and also the different approaches of GI planning in the rural and urban landscape.","[{""name"": ""Daiga Skujane"", ""affiliation"": [""Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies""]}, {""name"": ""Aiga Spage"", ""affiliation"": [""Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies""]}]","[""10.1007/bf00133027"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2017.05.037"", ""10.1016/s0169-2046(03)00163-4"", ""10.1002/9781444345025"", ""10.3390/su10124571""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Urban Studies', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1386/ijia_00008_1,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,The Preservation of Ottoman Monuments in Hungary: Historical Overview and Present Endeavours,"Abstract In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the central territory of Hungary was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. This long occupation resulted in the creation of what are the northernmost examples of Ottoman architecture in a cultural environment framed by non-Muslim structures. Since 1699, when the Ottoman Empire lost its influence over its Hungarian territories, Islamic religious buildings became private property or came under the maintenance of the Church or monastic orders. In 2013, an extraordinary process began: with the official cooperation and the financial support of the Republics of Turkey and Hungary, experts from both countries initiated projects to preserve and restore the Ottoman monuments in Hungary. Although a similar approach had been adopted in many countries in the Balkan Peninsula – for example in Macedonia, Albania, Serbia, and Kosovo, this was one of the first attempts at an institutionalised, global dialogue on the preservation and restoration works of Islamic sacral heritage within both Hungary and the European Union. This article presents the history of the preservation and restoration works of Ottoman heritage in Hungary. In addition, some of the unique structural features are outlined as these will be taken into consideration during present and future restoration efforts.","[{""name"": ""Gergő Máté Kovács"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121800451 Budapest University of Technology and Economics""]}, {""name"": ""Péter Rabb"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121800451 Budapest University of Technology and Economics""]}]","[""10.1386/ijia_00008_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Space and Planetary Science', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7451), ('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.7369)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

This article introduces a point lattice-based method of visual organization that is derived from Kolam drawings. In it, a point lattice formed by a regularly spaced array of points is used to structure visual compositions, as an alternative to a network of orthogonal lines (also known as the grid). First, I show how the point lattice system is used to structure Kolam drawing compositions, including the lattice's construction, types, and uses. Second, through a formal analysis of such a points system in structuring forms, patterns, letters, and layouts in graphic design, I show that this system offers a whole alternate universe of compositional possibilities that are not apparent when graphic designers see a grid not as points, but as a series of constraining straight lines. Through this research, I look inward into the design ethos and tools present in Indian arts and crafts and present its application in contemporary design practice.","[{""name"": ""Anika Sarin"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Architecture', 'Social Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0813 建筑学', 0.7506), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7274)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Arguing that this permeates into professional practice, this article explores the ambivalence of professional graphic designers towards the term ‘graphic design’ itself. Drawing on interviews with practitioners and discussions in online graphic design forums, the article argues this ambivalence derives from perceptions that the term reduces the design capital held by graphic designers. In turn, this negatively influences the graphic designers’ perceptions of professional relationships with creative stakeholders. Placing the study outcomes alongside existing academic literature, this article confirms anecdotal industry narratives about graphic designers’ perceptions of their capital. Moreover, it identifies a series of nuances to these narratives, challenging stereotypical educational and industry assumptions. In doing so, it argues that practitioner ambivalence towards the term ‘graphic design’ is symptomatic of an academic gap, resulting from inadequate pedagogic engagement with the specific discipline and practice of graphic design. This poses challenges for practitioners, as well as for the organisations they work within, at the same time presenting opportunities for researchers to make further headway into the specific discipline and methods of graphic design.","[{""name"": ""Yaron Meron"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9781350089020"", ""10.5040/9781474270304"", ""10.1111/1467-8691.00257"", ""10.1177/1052562913507571"", ""10.1016/j.intcom.2006.02.001"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00441"", ""10.1086/228943"", ""10.1080/14606925.2019.1682446"", ""10.5040/9781474293693.ch-006"", ""10.1111/1559-8918.2017.01150"", ""10.5040/9781350070660"", ""10.1080/14606925.2018.1444874"", ""10.1076/digc.13.4.193.8672"", ""10.1590/S0102-69922002000100009"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00054"", ""10.4236/ajibm.2016.61005"", ""10.1108/JSTP-05-2015-0121"", ""10.5040/9781474223577.0003"", ""10.1108/13665620610682062"", ""10.5210/fm.v17i10.4171"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-2094-4_20"", ""10.1080/09502380210139124"", ""10.12968/sece.2013.8.1826"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01653.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2011.00431.x"", ""10.1162/DESI_a_00051"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32415-5_7"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1347416"", ""10.1016/0048-7333(95)00847-0"", ""10.25300/MISQ/2013/37.2.10""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Design/methodology/approach In this study both quantitative and qualitative research approaches were adopted. While a structured questionnaire was used for the quantitative data collection, semi-structured interview was used for qualitative data collection. In analyzing the quantitative data, mean score was used to rank the variables and factor analysis was conducted to identify the underlying dimensions of the research constructs. The qualitative data was analyzed thematically focusing on specific objectives of the study; the challenges and improvement mechanisms of technology and innovation development. Findings The findings indicate that the major challenges are nature of the industry and lack of awareness, weak capacity of companies and the regulatory instruments, inadequate tender duration and poor monitoring and controlling practice. The suggested improvement mechanisms are effective coordination of the process and awareness creation, promoting technology and innovation in the procurement process and technology and innovation consideration in construction project registration. Originality/value Effectiveness of construction industry improvement programmes is affected by inappropriateness of the adopted implementation mechanisms. Understanding the operating environment; the enablers and potential barriers, is important for the success of any envisioned improvement programme. The improvement framework proposed by this study indicates the potential intervention areas and improvement mechanisms to effectively induce and enhance technology and innovation development in the construction industry. Major pillars of the improvement framework are improving regulatory framework, raising awareness and stakeholder engagement and continual monitoring and controlling of the practice.","[{""name"": ""Desalegn Girma Mengistu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Alemayehu Ashene"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Handebo Ayele Halabo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/15623599.2020.1868092"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1634666"", ""10.1108/14714170410815060"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.089"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2007.03.003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000499"", ""10.1080/01446193.2011.570357"", ""10.1080/01446193.2011.570355"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2013.09.018"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490153"", ""10.1080/01446190500204648"", ""10.1080/20421338.2022.2040828"", ""10.1108/JOPP-13-04-2013-B001"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1678863"", ""10.1016/j.pursup.2022.100747"", ""10.1080/0144619032000123725"", ""10.1177/1558689815607096"", ""10.1080/20421338.2019.1654252"", ""10.5089/9781463922054.002"", ""10.1108/17260530810891252"", ""10.1080/014461997372999"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001608"", ""10.1787/9789264265820-en"", ""10.1016/0197-3975(88)90041-0"", ""10.1080/014461900446894"", ""10.1016/j.jwb.2013.12.009"", ""10.1108/17538371011036563"", ""10.1108/CI-12-2021-0246"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2016-0149"", ""10.1108/CI-07-2014-0038"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001445"", ""10.1080/15623599.2017.1423162"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2014.04.003"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v10i4.1883"", ""10.1260/1757-2223.6.2.111""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

Educators have recognised its value and advocate that schools can provide an environment for fostering the creative thinking skills of students. Makerspaces are emerging in school contexts, and they carry great opportunities for engaging students in creative thinking processes. The school makerspace also offers a professional learning space for teachers and artists to collaborate to support students’ creative potential through making activities linked to the curriculum. This paper proposes a teacher–artist partnership framework within the makerspace to support mutual professional growth and opportunities to foster a learning environment conducive to creative expressions.

It depicts informal play areas and patterns in the centre of the city and those that emerge in the informal settlements of the Burj Al-Barajneh Palestinian camp. The study depicts the children’s ability to understand the environment around them while transforming it into a stage for loosely structured forms of play. It is important to note that the article does not aim to portray the dense and overcrowded urban setting of Beirut and its informal settlements as favourable environments for children at play. Instead, the discussion focuses on the children’s ability to re-semanticize and colonize anonymous places. Our aim is to demonstrate that Syrian displaced children develop a cognitive relationship to the spaces around them that goes beyond the physical boundaries of their play areas. Additionally, we argue that the formal urban fabric and the local population of the city alienate these children by maintaining their status as strangers or ‘others’. Despite the dire conditions and the seemingly chaotic setting of the informal camp settlement, Syrian children residing there are able to free themselves from the perception of estrangement and integrate as part of their new context.","[{""name"": ""Roula El Khoury"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000123245973 Lebanese American University""]}, {""name"": ""Paola Ardizzola"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000406258088 German University in Cairo""]}]","[""10.1386/ijia_00052_1""]","['Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['General Health Professions', 'Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7259), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7229)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Unlike metallic structures, the deformation behavior of polymeric components is difficult to quantify through the classical numerical analysis approach as a result of their nonlinear behavior under mechanical loads. Design/methodology/approach Geometric models of periodic lattice structures were designed via PTC Creo. Imperfections in the form of missing unit cells are introduced in the replica of the lattice structure. The perfect and imperfect lattice structures have the same dimensions – 10 mm × 14 mm × 30 mm (w × h × L). The fused deposition modelling technique is used to fabricate the parts. The fabricated parts were subjected to physical compression tests to provide a measure of their transverse compressibility resistance. The ensuing nonlinear response from the experimental tests is deployed to develop a support vector machine surrogate model. Findings Results from the surrogate model’s performance, in terms of correlation coefficient, rose to as high as 99.91% for the nonlinear compressive stress with a minimum achieved being 98.51% across the four datasets used. In the case of deflection response, the model accuracy rose to as high as 99.74% while the minimum achieved is 98.56% across the four datasets used. Originality/value The developed model facilitates the prediction of the quasi-static response of the structures in the absence and presence of defects without the need for repeated physical experiments. The structure investigated is designed for target applications in hierarchical polymer packaging, and the methodology presents a cost-saving method for data-driven constitutive modelling of polymeric parts.","[{""name"": ""Khameel Mustapha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jamal Alhiyafi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aamir Shafi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sunday Olusanya Olatunji"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.asoc.2016.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.jngse.2015.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.petrol.2016.11.033"", ""10.1016/S1359-6454(03)00441-5"", ""10.1016/S0079-6425(00)00002-5"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2006.06.013"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.01.027"", ""10.1145/130385.130401"", ""10.1039/B918972F"", ""10.1142/S1758825115400049"", ""10.1007/BF00994018"", ""10.1007/BF00994018"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2006.11.013"", ""10.4050/JAHS.44.260"", ""10.1007/BF00554981"", ""10.1016/S1359-6454(00)00379-7"", ""10.19026/rjaset.7.724"", ""10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00104-0"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.01.033"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/11/2/310"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2005.08.013"", ""10.1016/S1359-835X(02)00081-7"", ""10.1016/j.tws.2018.03.013"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2011.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.02.016"", ""10.1016/S0894-9166(13)60041-5"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.08.103"", ""10.1186/2008-6695-4-7"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2018.07.139"", ""10.1016/S0263-8223(00)00175-6"", ""10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2021.110591"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2006.04.090"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2015.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2016.03.116"", ""10.1063/1.4966043"", ""10.1007/s00521-014-1788-5"", ""10.3397/1.2888387"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.10.031"", ""10.1007/s10999-008-9071-5"", ""10.1126/science.1211649"", ""10.1177/1099636209104536"", ""10.1109/72.870050"", ""10.1007/s12541-016-0185-7"", ""10.1016/S0020-7683(98)00280-7"", ""10.1016/S0266-3538(03)00266-5"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.11.088"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.01.039"", ""10.1016/j.ijlmm.2021.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2010.10.050"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.05.048"", ""10.1177/0021998313490582"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.04.031"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.01.012"", ""10.1126/science.1252291""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

When living in student housing—be it purpose–built student accommodations or a house with multiple occupants—students with autism share most spaces with their housemates. This could lead to social situations in which they feel uncomfortable. In the study reported here, we explored the role of student housing in experiences of three students on the autism spectrum (and their housemates/proxies). Using participative methods including photovoice, walk–along interviews, and co–analysis (taking initial findings back to participants), we identified four concepts that offer in–depth insight into the participants' experiences: independence, (not) feeling at home, finding rest and avoiding stress, and shared versus individual space. Zooming in on the latter, we identified spatial aspects that may contribute to making student life on the autism spectrum and beyond more comfortable, which can inform future work on designing student housing.","[{""name"": ""Elise Tackx"", ""affiliation"": [""dmvA architecten, Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Phuong Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": [""Belgium and National University of Civil Engineering, Vietnam""]}, {""name"": ""KU Leuven"", ""affiliation"": [""Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Ann Heylighen"", ""affiliation"": [""Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""KU Leuven"", ""affiliation"": [""Belgium""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-28833-4_8"", ""10.1007/978-1-84996-166-0_2"", ""10.1080/03098265.2018.1514489"", ""10.1016/j.healthplace.2008.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.09.012"", ""10.4324/9781315856872"", ""10.1353/etc.2017.0025"", ""10.1111/area.12226"", ""10.1023/A:1025817121137"", ""10.1177/1362361315588200"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-05095-9_16"", ""10.1007/s10901-015-9451-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-28833-4_6"", ""10.1108/OHI-01-2010-B0004"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-28833-4_5"", ""10.1038/nrn.2017.112"", ""10.1080/1367626042000209930"", ""10.18061/dsq.v30i1.1075"", ""10.1080/13676260701582062"", ""10.1007/s10803-014-2324-2"", ""10.1007/s10803-007-0524-8"", ""10.1007/s10901-016-9522-5"", ""10.1177/109019819702400309"", ""10.1007/s10901-017-9582-1""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This approach will contribute to resolving social, environmental and community issues through design‐oriented thinking Accordingly, the aim of this research in a senior design studio course is to promote a better connection to the local environment needs without losing the creativity aspect. This study covered two semesters and used multiple data collection methods, including interviews, observational field notes, discussions and personal reflections. The findings showed that jury critiques and case study analysis were the most beneficial sources of information for students to develop their project ideas and solutions. The paper illustrates processes, products and aspects that are used in senior projects to find solutions to environmental needs. In addition, the study offers lessons learned and reflections to raise students’ awareness of the cultural needs in relation to the interior design field. This study shows findings similar to earlier research that found that students who identified and analysed a local case study understood the design problem better and were creative in linking their project design solution to the society's needs. The study also reveals that students who relied on analysis of well‐defined local case studies developed focused and detailed concepts and design solutions according to the instructor's and jurors’ assessments. The study also contributes to literature by using a multi‐method approach and offers implications for local and international policy‐makers on interior design curricula.","[{""name"": ""Rehab Aburas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5040/9781501371523"", ""10.1111/jade.12042"", ""10.1177/1476750310362435"", ""10.1080/00405840902776459"", ""10.1177/14767503030011002"", ""10.7771/1541-5015.1253"", ""10.5040/9781474293884"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2009.01591.x"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2010.01649.x"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2004.tb00401.x"", ""10.11120/jebe.2009.04010008"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.1994.tb00194.x"", ""10.1007/s11135-007-9105-3"", ""10.1111/jade.12086"", ""10.1108/14725960610673751"", ""10.11120/jebe.2011.06020054"", ""10.1080/02697459815978"", ""10.1177/073945600128992636"", ""10.1080/09650792.2016.1221838"", ""10.1177/0739456X9801700409""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Coarse aggregates were crushed granite and natural local stones mined from Umunneochi, Lokpa and Uturu, Isuakwato, respectively, in Abia State, Nigeria. Fine aggregate (river sand) and another coarse aggregate (river stone) were dredged from Otammiri River in Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria. The nominal mix ratios were 1:1:2, 1:2:4 and 1:3:6, whereas the respective water–cement ratios were 0.45, 0.5, 0.55 and 0.6. Findings The compressive strength of granite concrete, river stone concrete and local stone concrete ranged 17.79-38.13, 15.37-34.57 and 14.17-31.96 N/mm2, respectively. Compressive strength was found to increase with decreasing water–cement ratio and increasing cement content. Practical implications Granite concrete should be used in reinforced-concrete construction, especially when a cube compressive strength of 30 N/mm2 or higher is required. Originality/value Granite concrete exceeded the target compressive strength for all the concrete specimens, whereas river stone concrete and local stone concrete failed to achieve the target strength for some mix proportions and water–cement ratios.","[{""name"": ""Uchechi G.

10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0170,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Stacked value streams of hybrid energy storage systems in prosumer microgrids,"Purpose Storage systems are deemed to be unable to provide revenue commensurate with the resources invested in them, thus discouraging their incorporation within power networks. In prosumer microgrids, storage systems can provide revenue from reduced grid consumption, energy arbitraging or when serving as back-up power. This study aims to examine stacking these revenue streams with the aim of making storage systems financially viable for inclusion in prosumer microgrids. Design/methodology/approach With the aim of reducing self-consumption and maximising revenue, the prosumer microgrid incorporating hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) and solar PV power is solved using the CPLEX solver of the Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling Software (AIMMS). The financial analysis of the results is carried out to provide the payback periods of different system configurations of the prosumer microgrid. Findings The findings reveal that the payback period of the three HESS when minimising grid expenses during self-consumption alone and when compared with stacked revenue streams shows an improvement from 4.8–11.2 years to 2.4–6.6 years. With stacked HESS revenues, the supercapacitor-lithium ion battery HESS gave the shortest payback period of 2.31 years when solar PV power is at 75% penetration level. Originality/value Existing literature has considered revenue streams of storage systems at the electrical power transmission and distribution levels, but not for prosumer microgrids in particular. This study has captured these benefits and verified the profitability of stacking revenue from HESS to prosumer microgrids, using a case study.","[{""name"": ""Azizat Olusola Gbadegesin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yanxia Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nnamdi I.

These practices were formed by a continual process of practical involvement and reflection (through writing) and evaluation (funding permitting), alongside the author-practitioners' search for theoretical concepts that would bring clarity and an alternative perspective to the processes and outcomes. Concepts and approaches taken from pedagogical theory and, uniquely in the case of architecture, improvisational theory, will be used to explore critical aspects of the specific practices, and more generally assert that such socio-spatial ‘street pedagogy’ offers a space of rehearsal and ultimately, a site for the development of socially-just aesthetics. The paper thus proposes a theoretical scaffolding for practices which increase diversity and diminish resource consumption in the contexts of climate emergency and a politics of precarity.","[{""name"": ""Ruth Morrow"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peter Mutschler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Timothy Waddell"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0234,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Simplified probabilistic seismic assessment of dampers in tall and braced structures in buildings,"PurposeThe paper aims to focus on adjacent buildings response, equipped with damper, to analyze the vibration reduction in the nearby buildings. The nearby buildings were also equipped with dampers. The occurrence of adjacent buildings with adequate or inadequate space in between is a common phenomenon. However, many a times not much attention is paid to provide or check gap adequacy or to connect the two buildings suitably to avoid pounding of two structures on each other. This study emphasizes the utility of providing a damper in between two adjacent buildings for better performance.Design/methodology/approachThe two steel structures taken for study are prototype of two structures normally found in industrial structure such as power plant, where in one of boiler structure is often tall and braced and short structure of turbine building which is moment resistant, modeled in SAP. There could be similar such structures which are often connected to a platform or a walkway with a sliding end, so as not to transfer horizontal force to other structures. If the advantage of stiffness of tall braced structure is taken into account, shorter structure can be suitably connected to braced structure to transfer forces during seismic cases under nonlinear conditions, thereby avoiding pounding (incase gap is too less), reducing response and thus optimizing the section sizes. The structures were subjected to El Centro earthquake, to simulate MCE (which could be the other site TH scaled up as desired for real site PGA), and damper location and parameters were varied to find optimum value which offers reduced base shear, reduced top floor displacement and minimum inter story drift and highest energy absorption by fluid viscous dampers.FindingsThe findings show that taller structures, which are braced, have more stiffness; the effect of damper is more pronounced in reducing displacement of shorter moment resistant structure to the tune of 60%, with suitably defined Cd value which is found to be 600 KNs/m for the present study. Thus, advantage of stiffener structure is taken to leverage and reduce the displacement of shorter moment resistant structure in reducing its displacement under nonlinear conditions of seismic case.Originality/valueThis work shows the original findings, of the adjacent buildings response, equipped with damper, to analyze the vibration reduction on other buildings which were planned to be constructed nearby.","[{""name"": ""Tanuja Singh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Megha Kalra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anil Kumar Misra"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2006)132:6(853)"", ""10.56748/ejse.1172"", ""10.14429/dsj.59.1517"", ""10.1002/eqe.4290180508""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

The article also addresses the ways digitization not only affects the constitution of new objects (interactive objects/devices) but also produces changes in the industrial forms of production. Last but not least, we argue that the innovation aspects related to the development of new materials and their forms of production have to be addressed on different scales, by following trans-disciplinary approaches within a deliberate framework of philosophical questioning.","[{""name"": ""Tincuta Heinzel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juan P.

10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0073,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Residential adaptations as users' tacit means of communicating spatial needs in housing design A case study,"Purpose Knowing and understanding the spatial needs of users is imperative for the design of livable and sustainable houses. However, the practical and theoretical difficulties associated with this, especially in social housing, create a shortfall in design knowledge known as user needs gap. To bridge this gap, design researchers over the years, have sought to provide feedback for design decision-making through post-occupancy evaluation studies using preferences and residential satisfaction as constructs. In view of their limitations, this study aims to explore residential adaptations as residents’ tacit means of communicating their spatial needs, and a pathway to understanding residents’ housing requirements. Design/methodology/approach The study was exploratory in nature and a case study by design using a convergent parallel design within the mixed methods tradition. Activity Theory as used as a conceptual framework. The study involved three strands of research as follows: estimation of the floor areas of the rooms and spaces of the case study designs using the International Standards Organisation intramuros method; a survey of households and their activities using questionnaires; and observation of residents’ adaptations captured photographs and drawings. In all, 43 households out of the 66 apartments in the two case designs were surveyed. Findings The study found that while the units were theoretically large, they were practically inadequate when average household sizes were taken into account in a space per person analysis. In response, particularly to sleeping requirements of children, residents make different forms of adaptations – normative, such as house sharing, compositional and organizational, as well as add-ins and add-ons including and illegal alterations. Originality/value The paper presents residential adaptations as an empirically grounded, contextually embedded and practically useful means of exploring and understanding users’ spatial needs in housing design. Residential adaptations provide a means through which residents communicate their housing needs, albeit tacitly – a means for self-expression, self-extension and self-determination. To theory, the study shows that residential adaptations can be useful as a construct for understanding residents’ spatial needs, though fuzzy. It also helps understand how the tensions in an activity system, may result from contradictions produced by the lurking effect of contextual factors. This makes contextual knowledge, particularly cultural knowledge, critical to the design.","[{""name"": ""Stephen Agyefi-Mensah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zoya Evans Kpamma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Ebo Hagan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.25336/P6NG60"", ""10.3102/01623737015002195"", ""10.1037/h0040957"", ""10.1080/02673030701731258"", ""10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01"", ""10.2478/jesr-2019-0002"", ""10.1080/001401300409143"", ""10.1007/s00766-009-0087-7"", ""10.3102/01623737011003255"", ""10.1080/09613210801995882"", ""10.1080/09613210500161950"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-01-2018-0011"", ""10.1007/s12132-018-9337-4"", ""10.1177/1558689806298224"", ""10.1207/s15327884mca1201_2"", ""10.1080/10749039.2017.1393089"", ""10.1145/306412.306431"", ""10.1111/isj.12187"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2015-0085"", ""10.1080/09613218.2010.495217"", ""10.1108/EJTD-08-2018-0077"", ""10.1177/1558689812437100"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2009.04.002"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80140-9"", ""10.1080/01634372.2018.1454566"", ""10.1080/17452007.2018.1489212"", ""10.1080/00420988320080811"", ""10.1023/B:JOHO.0000030675.41440.f0"", ""10.1080/02673037.2017.1346192"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(85)80028-1"", ""10.1080/09613210801936472"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2019.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.landusepol.2009.08.024"", ""10.1080/17452007.2015.1106399"", ""10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.12.012"", ""10.1007/s10901-007-9082-9"", ""10.1080/09613218.2010.494377"", ""10.1016/0142-694X(91)90026-S"", ""10.1016/0360-1323(91)90060-O""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Social Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

To better understand the processes behind the memorability differences, we also looked at how spatial memorability interacted with visual attention and spatial pleasantness. After extensive pre–testing, two standardized photographic stimulus sets were created and used during the experiment, controlling for variables such as novelty, complexity, pleasantness, and the number and density of interior architectural elements. Each stimulus set contained equal numbers of photographs with biomorphic elements and photographs with non–biomorphic elements. Subjects ( N = 68 students, mean age = 25.4 years) viewed the first stimulus set, then were given a “distractor” task. Next, subjects viewed the second stimulus set, and for each photograph indicated whether the image was one they had seen or whether it was new. Visual attention for each photograph was monitored using eye–tracking technology, and subjects also rated the pleasantness of each environment. The data were analyzed to test for the relative strength of memorability between environments with biomorphic elements and non–biomorphic elements, as well as the links between recognition memory, visual attention, and pleasantness.

Design/methodology/approach This study deploys smart sensors to monitor the key environmental parameters of a house. Using Internet of Things technology, a prototype of a CPS has been developed for capturing the environmental conditions over time. A case study involving a property in New Zealand was undertaken to validate the prototype. Findings The study proposes a monitoring platform, enabled by the CPS and smart sensing devices, that collects, shares, stores, analyses and visualises indoor environment data. The reliability and accuracy of the monitoring system were enhanced by comparing the activity of house occupants with sensor data. Research limitations/implications Due to limited time, the prototype was tested in one house for a period of one month. Air quality was not considered in this study. However, the work suggests that such an approach provides an effective solution for government organisations and housing agencies to collect information for the purpose of assessing building thermal performance. Originality/value This research proposes a new lens consisting of a home environment monitoring application with health and well-being implications. It could also be used to inform the future design of healthy homes and buildings, both in New Zealand and internationally.","[{""name"": ""Na Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alice Chang-Richards"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kevin I-Kai Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kim Natasha Dirks"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/s18030817"", ""10.1108/F-10-2013-0076"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2015.12.019"", ""10.3390/s17020365"", ""10.1016/j.maturitas.2011.03.016"", ""10.3390/s16070969"", ""10.3390/s130100393"", ""10.3390/s150510350"", ""10.1049/cce:20060601"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.02.027"", ""10.1109/MIM.2021.9513634"", ""10.20943/01201705.5055"", ""10.1007/s11277-009-9881-2"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.05.057"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.166"", ""10.1007/s13320-017-0419-z"", ""10.3390/jsan2030557"", ""10.3390/en8077279""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Speech and Hearing', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

However, the industry suffers buildability problems. Improving construction projects buildability is the duty of every key stakeholder. Thus, this study aims to identify and evaluate the project designers’ roles in improving construction projects buildability in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted quantitative research method. A purposive sampling approach was used in identifying the representative sample for the administration of the questionnaire survey. A total of 122 questionnaires were distributed to the targeted construction professionals, out of which 93 questionnaires were sufficiently filled and returned, representing a response rate of 76%. This study used descriptive and inferential statistics for data analyses. Findings The results from factors analysis show that the roles of project designers in improving construction projects buildability in Nigeria can be categorised into two constructs: “discuss fully the design objectives with builders” and “prepare cost effective and buildable designs”. Originality/value This study contributed to more effective buildability studies by highlighting the roles of project designers in improving construction projects buildability in the construction industry. An understanding of these roles is vital for reducing buildability problems as well as for improving and embedding buildability as a practice in construction management.","[{""name"": ""Innocent Chigozie Osuizugbo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anthony Ogochukwu Onokwai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oluyemi Oladeji Faleti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.9734/BJAST/2015/12617"", ""10.1177/001872679905200401"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.020"", ""10.25103/jestr.031.24"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001062"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2001)127:4(281)"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1233088"", ""10.3763/asre.2008.5121"", ""10.1080/01446190802570498"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2005.10.003"", ""10.1080/1023697X.2008.10668104"", ""10.1108/14714171211215958"", ""10.1680/jmapl.15.00012"", ""10.1080/00038628.2000.9696888"", ""10.1080/00038628.2001.9696916"", ""10.1108/02632770810840327"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2004.10.006"", ""10.1080/09613219608727541"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-09-2015-0094"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0338"", ""10.2478/jeppm-2020-0007"", ""10.2478/emj-2020-0011"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-03-2022-0051"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2021-0738"", ""10.1108/CI-12-2021-0246"", ""10.1108/CI-05-2022-0112"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1829784"", ""10.1080/014461998371971"", ""10.1108/20441241211280855"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-03-2021-0054"", ""10.1007/s00158-014-1057-3"", ""10.1002/tal.1570"", ""10.3390/buildings5020521"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000198"", ""10.1080/15578771.2020.1826609"", ""10.1108/17260530710746614"", ""10.1080/01446190600830649"", ""10.1108/JOPP-03-2019-0015"", ""10.3763/asre.2006.4910"", ""10.1108/02656710710757781"", ""10.1139/L06-022"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001323""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Considering the total annual cost as the objective function, a network of plate-finned heat exchanger is designed and optimized. Design/methodology/approach Accurate evaluation of plate-finned heat exchanger networks depends on different fin types with 10 different geometrical parameters of heat exchangers. In this study, fin numbers are considered as the main decision variables and geometrical parameters of fins are considered as the secondary decision variables. The algorithm applies heat transfer and pressure drop coefficients correction method and differential evolution (DE) algorithm to obtain the optimum results. In this paper, optimization and minimization of the total annual cost of heat exchanger network is considered as the objective function. Findings In this study, a novel and applied method for optimum designing of plate-finned heat exchanger network is presented. The comprehensive algorithm is applied into a case study and the results are obtained for both counter-flow and cross-flow plate-finned heat exchangers. The total annual cost and total area of the network with counter-flow heat exchangers were 12.5% and 23.27%, respectively, smaller than the corresponding values of the network with cross-flow heat exchanger. Originality/value In this paper, a reliable method is used to design, optimize parameters and the economic optimization of heat exchanger network. Taking into account the importance of plate-finned heat exchangers in industrial applications and the complexity in their geometry, the DE methodology is adopted to obtain an optimal geometric configuration. The total annual cost is chosen as the objective function. Applying this technique to a case study illustrates its capability to accurate design plate-finned heat exchangers to improve the objective function of the heat exchanger network from the economic viewpoint with the design of details.","[{""name"": ""Reza Ramezanpour Jirandeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mehrangiz Ghazi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amir Farhang Sotoodeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammad Nikian"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.04.038"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.11.071"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.11.099"", ""10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2019.104283"", ""10.1002/cjce.21731"", ""10.1016/0009-2509(83)80185-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.03.066"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.05.154"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2015.04.012"", ""10.1016/j.cherd.2014.02.005"", ""10.1016/S1359-4311(02)00074-1"", ""10.1016/S1359-4311(98)00098-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2010.04.001"", ""10.1007/s12667-016-0221-9"", ""10.1080/01457630600559462"", ""10.1023/A:1008202821328"", ""10.1016/j.cherd.2014.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.10.018""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Control and Systems Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The role of design educators is to structure projects seeking to promote inclusive group dynamics and democratic participation among team members. Navigating the challenges of group work should not rest solely on the shoulders of students. Repeated group work in educational settings does not suffice, on its own, for fostering constructive team dynamics or for preparing students to successfully manage conflict, which, if it remains positive, can yield more creative design outcomes. This article, animated by critical and poststructural curriculum theories, proposes pedagogies incorporating positive interdependence and complex instruction for collaborative, inclusive group work and co‐design tasks that leverage conflict and promote constructive relations within teams. Instilling democratic values in design students is equally important for higher education as it is for the design discipline itself.","[{""name"": ""Rim Fathallah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4018/978-1-5225-0726-0.ch005"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2007.tb00319.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8691.2010.00553.x"", ""10.1386/ctl.9.3.257_1"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2012.01079.x"", ""10.1080/00405849909543836"", ""10.1080/10464883.1987.10758461"", ""10.3102/0013189X18809053"", ""10.4324/9780203584071"", ""10.7551/mitpress/12044.001.0001"", ""10.1109/TIDMS.2013.6981228"", ""10.3200/MONO.131.4.285-358"", ""10.3102/0013189X08330540"", ""10.5926/arepj1962.47.0_29"", ""10.1109/44.788770"", ""10.1007/978-94-6209-938-8_6"", ""10.1080/14675986.2014.905360"", ""10.1111/joid.12117"", ""10.5040/9781474274395"", ""10.1080/14606925.2021.1881204"", ""10.1111/joid.12072"", ""10.1177/1076217517735355"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2005.tb00407.x"", ""10.1111/joid.12103"", ""10.1080/00220272.2013.764505""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Education', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

Historically, as an academic subject, professional practice and research area, design has suffered from a lack of formal, established research frameworks and theoretical practices. By drawing on established literature, this article makes the case for the use of methods and practices developed in Participatory Action Research (PAR) to inform and enrich design practice, research and particularly education. The article identifies three shared areas between PAR and design that offer an opportunity for further interrogation; these are: a central concern of working with people; the use of iteration and reflection; and the measuring of success through change.","[{""name"": ""Aidan Rowe"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000404597625 University of Alberta""]}]","[""10.15353/joci.v7i3.2592"", ""10.1080/19235003.2011.11782257"", ""10.1162/desi.2006.22.2.3"", ""10.2307/1511556"", ""10.1162/desi.2007.23.4.62"", ""10.1016/0142-694X(79)90026-7"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.05.069"", ""10.2752/175470811X13071166525216"", ""10.2752/175470812X13281948975413"", ""10.33524/cjar.v13i2.37"", ""10.1177/0001848191041003003"", ""10.1080/0965079940020302"", ""10.1162/desi_a_00509"", ""10.1080/15710880701875068"", ""10.1007/BF02173417"", ""10.1162/07479360252756287"", ""10.1515/9783035606539-017"", ""10.1386/adch_00013_1""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This study aims to report on overlapping indicators for benchmarking sustainable construction for construction organisations. Design/methodology/approach Online survey data were collected from construction professionals, academics and senior managers in government bodies. Pearson chi-squared tests and overlapping analysis were used to determine significant indicators. Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to determine statistically significant differences among the dimensions. Findings Overlapping analysis determined indicators significant for economic, environmental and social performance. Environmental protection and reporting (pollution and emissions) were significant for all three performance dimensions. The most significant indicators are economic performance (adequate competence of key project staff), environmental performance (environmental protection and reporting – pollution and emissions) and social performance (adequate sustainability expenditure by construction organisations). Significant differences due to dimensions existed for adequate competence of key project staff, sustainable construction and eco-design, adequate governance and organisational excellence of construction projects and satisfactory workers’ morale. Research limitations/implications Determining overlapping indicators enables prioritised implementation that ensures sustainable construction. Excluding construction workers was a significant limitation for a holistic interrogation. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to determine overlapping indicators for sustainable construction performance in Zimbabwe.","[{""name"": ""Tirivavi Moyo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mazen Omer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benviolent Chigara"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/CI-05-2012-0025"", ""10.1002/csr.2261"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.01.081"", ""10.1177/001872679905200401"", ""10.1108/BIJ-08-2019-0376"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.11.039"", ""10.1108/CG-06-2013-0078"", ""10.1108/BIJ-11-2016-0171"", ""10.1108/SASBE-08-2021-0151"", ""10.1108/WJEMSD-07-2016-0032"", ""10.1108/09699981211206070"", ""10.1108/08858621211197001"", ""10.1108/CG-11-2014-0134"", ""10.1108/ECAM-06-2015-0097"", ""10.1108/09699981311303017"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000501"", ""10.1108/SASBE-07-2020-0111"", ""10.1108/MEQ-04-2019-0085"", ""10.21315/jcdc2022.27.1.6"", ""10.3390/su14105907"", ""10.3390/su9010125"", ""10.1108/14635771011049380"", ""10.1108/WJSTSD-05-2015-0022"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2018-0031"", ""10.1080/15623599.2016.1222665"", ""10.1108/ECAM-02-2018-0056"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1887718"", ""10.1108/MEQ-09-2013-0099"", ""10.1080/1051712X.2016.1169119"", ""10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2"", ""10.1108/EBR-02-2014-0018"", ""10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-14-00067.1"", ""10.1108/14777830710753839"", ""10.1108/WJSTSD-02-2015-0008"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2020-0321"", ""10.1108/14714170910950830"", ""10.1108/17422040510577889"", ""10.1108/JFMPC-03-2020-0013""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-04-2019-0113,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Optimal location of UPQC for power quality improvement: novel hybrid approach,"PurposeIn general, the optimal reactive power compensation could drastically enhance the performance of distributed network by the reduction of power loss and by enhancement of line loadability and voltage profile. Till now, there exist various reactive power compensation models including capacitor placement, joined process of on-load tap changer and capacitor banks and integration of DG. Further, one of the current method is the allocation of distribution FACTS (DFACTS) device. Even though, the DFACTS devices are usually used in the enhancement of power quality, they could be used in the optimal reactive power compensation with more effectiveness.Design/methodology/approachThis paper introduces a power quality enhancement model that is based on a new hybrid optimization algorithm for selecting the precise unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) location and sizing. A new algorithm rider optimization algorithm (ROA)-modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) in fitness basis (RMPF) is introduced for this optimal selections.FindingsThrough the performance analysis, it is observed that as the iteration increases, there is a gradual minimization of cost function. At the 40th iteration, the proposed method is 1.99 per cent better than ROA and genetic algorithm (GA); 0.09 per cent better than GMDA and WOA; and 0.14, 0.57 and 1.94 per cent better than Dragonfly algorithm (DA), worst solution linked whale optimization (WS-WU) and PSO, respectively. At the 60th iteration, the proposed method attains less cost function, which is 2.07, 0.08, 0.06, 0.09, 0.07 and 1.90 per cent superior to ROA, GMDA, DA, GA, WS-WU and PSO, respectively. Thus, the proposed model proves that it is better than other models.Originality/valueThis paper presents a technique for optimal placing and sizing of UPQC. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that introduces RMPF algorithm to solve the optimization problems.","[{""name"": ""Kaladhar Gaddala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P.

By incorporating these technologies, Industry 4.0 provides new tools for production planning processes, allowing to address problems in an innovative and efficient manner. From these technologies and tools, it is that in this work a One-of-a-Kind Production (OKP) process is approached, where the products tend to be highly customized. OKP implies working with a very large variability within production, demanding very efficient planning systems. For this, a planning model based on CONWIP-type strategies was proposed, which seeks to level the production of a shop floor configured in the form of a job shop. Even more, for having a more realistic shop-floor representation, machine failures have been included in the model. In turn, different dispatching rules were proposed to study the performance and analyze the behaviour of the system. From the results obtained, it is observed that, when the production demand is very exigent in relation with the capacity of the system, the dispatching rules that analyze the workload generated by each job tend to perform better. However, when the demand on the capacity of the production system is less intense, the rules associated with due dates are the ones that obtain the best results.","[{""name"": ""Guido Vinci Carlavan"", ""affiliation"": [""Engineering Department, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Alejandro Rossit"", ""affiliation"": [""Engineering Department, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina"", ""INMABB, Universidad Nacional del Sur and CONICET, Bahía Blanca, Argentina""]}]",[],['Engineering'],['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)]]"

10.3233/JID200009,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,On Reasonable Inquiry and Analysis Domains of Symperasmology,"Sympérasmology was proposed as the theory of synthetic system knowledge (SSK), which is seen as the fuel for the engine of systelligence. There are two main reasons why the proposal is made: (i) rapidly growing, SSK represents a third category of knowledge beside common personal knowledge and testified scientific knowledge, and (ii) though important, neither modern gnoseology nor contemporary epistemology studies its nature, principles, progression, and impacts. The need for rational and empirical studies of SSK is also underpinned by the on-going intelligence revolution, in which knowledge is deemed to be a productive power, a cognitive enabler of smart systems, and a strong transformer of social life. Sympérasmology is still in an embryonic state. Notwithstanding, a map of possible inquiry and analysis domains is released for a public debate in this paper. These domains can be sorted into four categories: (i) rudiments, (ii) principles, (iii) faculties, and (iv) implications. This paper explains these categories and the related domains of interest, and discusses some relevant aspects of study. Without striving for exhaustiveness, it elaborates on many relevant discussion topics and issues. The paper emphasizes that a precise specification of the scope and objectives of sympérasmology needs a stream of exploratory research studies as well as further insightful philosophical discussions.","[{""name"": ""Imre Horváth"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Sustainable Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands""]}]",[],"['Physics and Astronomy', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Astronomy and Astrophysics', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-10-2020-0419,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Making distribution operations lean: the management system approach in a case,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a distribution management system that determines the path toward lean distribution through teamwork. This system introduces a set of lean distribution initiatives regarding the structural and strategic facets of organizations. Design/methodology/approach Through studying the case, which is one of the largest distribution companies in the Middle East, the deployment process of the developed system is examined through chartering focus, deployment and operational teams. These teams held several rounds of panel discussions to formulate the strategic, tactical and technical plans required for making distribution operations lean. Findings It is found that the strategic focus of the case should not only be restricted to distribution initiatives but also the company can achieve a suitable competitive position by focusing on leadership and integral architecture of information, distribution and transportation channels. The first semi-year cycle of implementing the lean distribution system in the case targeted a 2.5% reduction in the ratio of distribution cost to sales by planning for the cross-docking adoption. It also aimed at a 10% increase in the market share for the prioritized market by a 20% reduction in lost sales owing to improper implementation of the processes. Originality/value The developed lean distribution management system is novel in the way it includes the strategy, structure and capabilities of an organization. Deploying this system causes a meaningful connection between lean distribution principles and operational initiatives.","[{""name"": ""Ashkan Ayough"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Reza Rafiei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ashkan Shabbak"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/IJLSS-10-2017-0119"", ""10.1108/IJQRM-12-2018-0346"", ""10.3926/jiem.3100"", ""10.1109/EMR.2019.2898952"", ""10.1016/j.egyr.2019.10.042"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2009.10.008"", ""10.1108/IJQRM-11-2014-0190"", ""10.1108/IJQSS-03-2018-0024"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.427"", ""10.1108/IJLSS-10-2017-0118"", ""10.1108/JMTM-08-2019-0289"", ""10.1016/j.mfglet.2019.12.003"", ""10.1108/01443571211226498"", ""10.1016/S0969-7012(98)00015-X"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2006.04.001"", ""10.1108/IJQRM-11-2017-0228"", ""10.1108/IJQRM-02-2017-0024"", ""10.1108/02634500010327908"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2009.10.028"", ""10.1080/02642060701846853"", ""10.1080/09537287.2018.1519731"", ""10.1108/17410380910984221"", ""10.1080/00207543.2011.645954"", ""10.1080/00207540701223576"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99034-7_6"", ""10.1108/IJQRM-05-2017-0098"", ""10.1108/13598540610662185"", ""10.1007/s10098-010-0329-x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-005X.2006.00163.x"", ""10.1108/01443570310501880""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

In this article, we draw upon the work of two student groups – one in Norway, one in Singapore – to investigate the relationship between input and how they are used to design the packaging of food products. Two classes got similar design briefs and worked simultaneously in two countries, communicating through a common Facebook group. By the end of the project, each class discussed and analysed their sources of inspiration. The design solutions were dissected in separate design elements to look for national characteristics, despite similar international digital inspiration. By investigating cultural differences and similarities in designing based on the hypothesis that design students in Singapore and Norway have the same online design inspiration, this article demonstrates how international sources of inspiration affect the local visual traditions of designers. However, the prioritisation of design elements reveals that despite living in a global network society, designers still adhere to national design traditions.","[{""name"": ""Margaret Rynning"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1037/0022-3514.81.3.492"", ""10.5040/9781350096516"", ""10.4000/aof.7296"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-8728-8_31"", ""10.4324/9780203934968"", ""10.5040/9781474294027"", ""10.5040/9781474287302"", ""10.1145/1518701.1518717"", ""10.1002/asi.23231"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2016.04.002"", ""10.1504/JDR.2008.026987"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2008.11.006"", ""10.3402/jac.v8.32573""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

From an experiential and phenomenological perspective, and taking into account the situations lived in 2020, the paper invites to examine the existing relations between architecture and urban landscape at three levels: first, the experience of the environment from the architectural space —namely, the home—; second, the experience of the “interior urban landscape” at street level; and finally, the experience of the “exterior urban landscape” from the city fringe or vantage points that provide vast prospects.

It is necessary therefore to address the conditions that have produced this antinomy. Using the Hegelian category of the determination of reflection, complexity is then reconsidered as the effect of the circular logic by which a social system is defined.

10.3233/JID200008,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,Interval Algebra and Region Connection Calculus for Ontological Spatiotemporal Assembly Product Motion Knowledge Representation,"Over the last decades, noticeable efforts have been made to construct design knowledge during the detailed geometric definition phase systematically. However, physical products exhibit functional behaviors, which explain that they evolve over space and time. Hence, there is a need to extend assembly product knowledge towards the spatiotemporal dimension to provide more realistic knowledge models in assembly design. Systematic semantic knowledge representation via ontology enables designers to understand the anticipated product’s behavior in advance. In this article, Interval Algebra (IA) and Region Connection Calculus (RCC) are investigated to formalize and construct ontological spatiotemporal assembly product motion knowledge. IA is commonly used to represent the temporality between two entities, while RCC is more appropriate to represent the ‘part-to-part’ relationships of two topological spaces. This paper discusses the roles of IA and RCC and presents a case study of a nutcracker assembly model’s behavior. The assembly product motion ontology with the aid of IA and RCC is evaluated using a task-based approach. The evaluation shows the added value of the developed ontology compared to others published in the literature.","[{""name"": ""Md Tarique Hasan Khan"", ""affiliation"": [""Postdoctoral Associate, Cyberlearning Innovation & Research Centre, Rutgers University, New Jersey, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Frédéric Demoly"", ""affiliation"": [""Associate Professor, ICB UMR 6303 CNRS, Univ.

10.1111/jade.12402,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,Integration of Design Thinking with Cultural Intelligence in Higher Education for a Socially Complex Environment,"AbstractThis article focuses on international design education and the benefits of combining design thinking with cross‐cultural empathy, in addressing ‘wicked’ global problems in our society. There is a lack of cross‐cultural design thinking‐specific approaches in international education literature. This study aims to cover the main contributors to the development of design thinking, Cultural Intelligence (CQ), and explore their different views. It discusses the metric of CQ, its importance in the world today and how to improve CQ, through cross‐cultural design workshops and units that deal with ‘wicked’ global problems and scenarios. The approach involves a combination of design thinking methods with an empathy framework, to seek meaningful participation in the entire design process for a socially complex environment. Furthermore, the results reveal that, co‐design with cross‐cultural empathy relates to the increasing development of CQ.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0081,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Influence of selection criteria on clients' satisfaction with construction consultancy services in Nigeria,"Purpose To receive a satisfactory consultancy service, a construction client must first select suitable consultants. While numerous criteria for the selection of construction consultants have been suggested in the literature, their influence on client satisfaction has hardly been statistically established. This study aimed to reduce the criteria for the selection of construction consultants into a more manageable set of fewer factors and ascertain the influence of the factors on client satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered through a purposively administered cross-sectional survey of public sector clients in Nigeria. Analyzes were done using relative importance index, factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings The results proved that the criteria for the selection of consultants can, in the order of decreasing influence on client satisfaction, be grouped into service delivery approach (SDA), relationship with the client, the caliber of personnel, firm reputation and firm certification. However, SDA is more influential on client satisfaction. All the factors were found to have significant statistical effects on clients’ overall satisfaction with consultancy services. Originality/value The study demonstrates the extent to which construction consultant selection criteria are relevant to client satisfaction. It shows that SDA is the most important predictor of clients’ satisfaction with consultancy services. The results are helpful for grouping consultant selection criteria in future studies, and in guiding clients on the weights to assign to consultant selection criteria during tender evaluation.","[{""name"": ""Chukwuemeka Patrick Ogbu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Monday Omogiate Imafidon"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5130/AJCEB.v16i4.4979"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(1995)11:2(36)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2006)132:7(667)"", ""10.1108/09699981211206098"", ""10.1108/03090569610105762"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2006.10.006"", ""10.1108/09699980610712373"", ""10.1080/01446190210159818"", ""10.1080/0144619032000049737"", ""10.1108/01437730210441292"", ""10.1016/0019-8501(92)90015-L"", ""10.1016/0019-8501(92)90002-B"", ""10.1080/20421338.2019.1585676"", ""10.3846/jcem.2018.297"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.09.001"", ""10.4314/gjss.v19i1.4"", ""10.1080/09613210600980192"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000129"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v11i4.2271"", ""10.1016/S0165-1889(02)00079-9"", ""10.1177/875697280303400103"", ""10.1080/01446190500126866"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001620"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70491-3_6"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(00)00037-5"", ""10.1177/002224298504900403"", ""10.21315/jcdc2017.22.supp1.1"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000183"", ""10.1142/S1609945104000164"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v11i4.2297"", ""10.1016/0148-2963(87)90014-2"", ""10.7748/nr2004.07.12.1.35.c5929"", ""10.1504/IJBPM.2014.063026"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2003)19:4(166)"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.12.027"", ""10.1108/F-07-2015-0047"", ""10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p079"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2005)131:6(631)"", ""10.1016/S0969-7012(96)00015-9""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0100,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Including decision-makers preferences in the cost-deprivation trade-off during disaster interventions,"PurposeIn this contribution, the purpose of this study is to extend the established social cost concept of humanitarian logistics into a preference-based bi-objective approach. The novel concept offers an efficient, robust and transparent way to consider the decision-maker’s preference. In principle, the proposed method applies to any multi-objective decision and is especially suitable for decisions with conflicting objectives and asymmetric impact.Design/methodology/approachThe authors bypass the shortcomings of the traditional approach by introducing a normalized weighted sum approach. Within this approach, logistics and deprivation costs are normalized with the help of Nadir and Utopia points. The weighting factor represents the preference of a decision-maker toward emphasizing the reduction of one cost component. The authors apply the approach to a case study for hypothetical water contamination in the city of Berlin, in which authorities select distribution center (DiC) locations to supply water to beneficiaries.FindingsThe results of the case study highlight that the decisions generated by the approach are more consistent with the decision-makers preferences while enabling higher efficiency gains. Furthermore, it is possible to identify robust solutions, i.e. DiCs opened in each scenario. These locations can be the focal point of interest during disaster preparedness. Moreover, the introduced approach increases the transparency of the decision by highlighting the cost-deprivation trade-off, together with the Pareto-front.Practical implicationsFor practical users, such as disaster control and civil protection authorities, this approach provides a transparent focus on the trade-off of their decision objectives. The case study highlights that it proves to be a powerful concept for multi-objective decisions in the domain of humanitarian logistics and for collaborative decision-making.Originality/valueTo the best of the knowledge, the present study is the first to include preferences in the cost-deprivation trade-off. Moreover, it highlights the promising option to use a weighted-sum approach to understand the decisions affected by this trade-off better and thereby, increase the transparency and quality of decision-making in disasters.","[{""name"": ""Florian Diehlmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patrick Siegfried Hiemsch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marcus Wiens"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markus Lüttenberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Schultmann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.cor.2013.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2015.01.008"", ""10.1080/13675560701561789"", ""10.1016/bs.adcom.2015.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2017.11.010"", ""10.1007/s11067-017-9382-x"", ""10.1002/nav.21801"", ""10.1016/j.seps.2018.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.jocm.2018.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.369"", ""10.1108/20426741111188329"", ""10.1007/s10100-017-0518-3"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2018.03.019"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2013.06.002"", ""10.1007/s10100-019-00612-5"", ""10.1016/j.seps.2015.09.002"", ""10.1007/s00158-004-0465-1"", ""10.1007/s10898-014-0227-6"", ""10.1108/09600030710734820"", ""10.1007/s10100-007-0029-8"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2018.05.003"", ""10.1080/13675567.2018.1437894"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2018.02.022"", ""10.1007/s00291-011-0258-z"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.009"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2018.09.042"", ""10.1287/trsc.2014.0565"", ""10.1111/itor.12163"", ""10.1016/j.seps.2016.07.001"", ""10.1007/978-81-322-2416-7{\\_}1"", ""10.1007/s10100-014-0358-3"", ""10.1108/JHLSCM-01-2015-0002"", ""10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101343"", ""10.1057/ori.2011.6"", ""10.3390/buildings11020037"", ""10.1111/poms.13024"", ""10.1111/poms.12760"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68606-6_10"", ""10.1007/s11067-010-9140-9"", ""10.1007/s10479-018-3089-3""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Engineering']","['Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.76), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7394)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

While the complexity of these projects will continue to increase, there is an urgent need to perform better. Although the integrated design process is critical for project success, the literature lacks studies describing the link to project performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the dominant variables that affect the integrated design process and consequently project performance. Design/methodology/approach A multiple case study was conducted to determine the dominant variables that affect the integrated design process and project performance. The research included four projects. Semi-structured interviews were the main source of data. Findings The cases indicated that the extent to which an integrated approach is achieved in the design process is essential for project performance. This applies to the integration of stakeholders’ interests as well as the integration of disciplines. Above all, it was concluded that the project team participants’ competencies for integration are a dominant factor for project performance, as the integrated design process has changed from a technical challenge to an integrative one. Originality/value This study provides insights into the dominant variable of the integrated design process that affects project performance, which is underexposed in the literature. The study results reveal the importance of competencies related to integration and adoption of the design problem context, which are not yet included in civil engineering design methods. In this respect, empathy is introduced as a new and critical competence for the civil engineering industry, which needs further research.","[{""name"": ""Guus Keusters"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hans Bakker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erik-Jan Houwing"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/rlp.2009.20"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2019-0299"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.02.006"", ""10.1177/1525822X10388468"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352932"", ""10.1108/02632771211252351"", ""10.1016/j.sheji.2019.05.001"", ""10.1177/1077800405284363"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2006)22:1(35)"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-06823-7_2"", ""10.1108/17260530810918243"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2019.11.001"", ""10.1080/09544820902875033"", ""10.1108/JOPP-15-04-2015-B001"", ""10.1108/TPM-03-2018-0019"", ""10.1177/1466138111435738"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2009)25:4(221)"", ""10.2478/sbe-2019-0019"", ""10.3390/su3081090"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1052-3928(2006)132:3(272)"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2014.11.004"", ""10.1108/03684920810884928"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(02)00112-6"", ""10.1177/1469605318822551"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2018-0091"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2018-0211"", ""10.1017/dsi.2019.6""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-04-2022-0217,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Identifying the capacity needs of built environment professionals to deliver environmentally sustainable buildings: a scientometric review,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the capacity needs of building professionals to deliver environmentally sustainable buildings (ESBs) globally, from a unique systems approach. Through a review of extant literature, this study contributes to knowledge of the global delivery of ESBs by identifying research trends and gaps that can be tackled in future research, and current hotspots in capacity building (CB) research within the built environment (BE). The adopted systems approach to CB postulates that the construction industry is systemized in nature, and thus, CB solutions within the industry should be approached from a systems approach. Design/methodology/approach A literature search was conducted using the Scopus search engine, augmented by Google Scholar and Web of Science, to produce 54 relevant articles for analysis. The scientometric analysis was undertaken with the use of VOSViewer to better understand the broad literature on CB in the construction industry which would not have been possible with traditional data analysis. The content analysis allowed, for a systematic review of selected articles, to reveal key themes in this study. Findings Through a content analysis, four levels of CB were identified within the construction industry; individual level, organizational level, industry level and state level. Nine sub-capacities were subsumed under the four identified levels adopted from Potter and Brough (2004), including but not limited to Performance capacity, Workload capacity, Supervisory capacity, Industry Role capacity and Systems capacity. Under each sub-capacity, key questions were posed to aid identify the capacity needs of BE professionals. A framework for identifying capacity needs in the BE is proposed. Practical implications The findings of this study serve as a useful reference for practitioners and policymakers to assess their level of commitment to CB efforts for ESB delivery. The findings of this study have revealed that building the capacities of BE professionals to deliver ESBs should be addressed as part of a broader framework, interdependent on the other levels of CB in the systemic construction industry. Originality/value As a review study identifying capacity needs for BE professionals to deliver ESBs, this study enhances knowledge of CB within the construction industry.","[{""name"": ""Aba Essanowa Afful"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joshua Ayarkwa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Godwin Kojo Kumi Acquah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ama Antwi Darkwa Ossei Assibey"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dickson Osei-Asibey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/SASBE-12-2019-0170"", ""10.1108/SASBE-04-2021-0077"", ""10.1108/ECAM-07-2021-0628"", ""10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2007.01.016"", ""10.1108/SASBE-02-2019-0017"", ""10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00424"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2019-0028"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1967577"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000089"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.04.065"", ""10.1080/2093761X.2012.759887"", ""10.1108/ECAM-08-2017-0175"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/640/1/012020"", ""10.1080/23311916.2020.1726069"", ""10.3390/en13092308"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.1073-1076.1282"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-01-2021-0003"", ""10.1108/CI-10-2021-0182"", ""10.1080/01446193.2017.1287926"", ""10.1108/BIJ-07-2016-0117"", ""10.1108/00400911211210323"", ""10.4314/just.v32i1.7"", ""10.1108/00400911111159485"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-09-2014-0044"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1634666"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2019-0126"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0444"", ""10.1108/BIJ-11-2019-0489"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.235"", ""10.1080/07038992.2021.1894915"", ""10.1080/01446193.2016.1248988"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.12.059"", ""10.18260/1-2–21431"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104192"", ""10.2495/ARC140501"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2021-0453"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10377-8_13"", ""10.1108/SASBE-08-2016-0018"", ""10.3763/aedm.2008.S807"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002242"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001896"", ""10.1080/10485236.2013.10596285"", ""10.1108/ECAM-04-2020-0271"", ""10.1108/EJTD-10-2020-0147"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.12.002"", ""10.1007/s10098-018-1598-z"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105576"", ""10.1108/JEDT-01-2020-0027"", ""10.14716/ijtech.v9i8.2756"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-10-2017-0099"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002037"", ""10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2004.01.002"", ""10.1080/09614520050116677"", ""10.14424/ijcscm602016-34-47"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0432"", ""10.1108/09699981211192580"", ""10.1108/ECAM-08-2014-0108"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000575"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.444"", ""10.1097/PHH.0b013e31825ce928"", ""10.1108/APJBA-10-2020-0370"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2002)18:2(61)"", ""10.1108/SASBE-07-2021-0125"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.012"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-10-2017-0090"", ""10.24928/2021/0154"", ""10.1093/heapol/czh038"", ""10.1111/joes.12183"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-03-2020-0045"", ""10.1080/17452007.2018.1502655"", ""10.5130/AJCEB.v20i3.7035"", ""10.3390/su10103406"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-2660-6_28"", ""10.1071/HE14039"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002250"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000327"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.12.013"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2016-0016"", ""10.1108/SASBE-06-2020-0089"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.210"", ""10.1080/00038628.2018.1485548""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-11-2018-0198,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Hybrid approach for solving the integrated planning and scheduling production problem,"PurposeThis paper aims to present a new model for solving the integrated production planning and scheduling. Usually, the two decision levels are treated sequentially because of their complexity. Scheduling depends on the lot sizes calculated at the tactical level and ignoring scheduling constraints generates unrealistic and inconsistent decisions. Therefore, integrating more detail scheduling constraint in production planning is important for managing efficiently operations. Therefore, an integrated model was developed, and two evolutionary optimization approaches were suggested for solving it, namely, genetic algorithm (GA) and the hybridization of simulated annealing (SA) with GA HSAGA. The proposed algorithms have some parameters that must be adjusted using Taguchi method. Therefore, to evaluate the proposed algorithm, the authors compared the results given by GA and the hybridization. The SA-based local search is embedded into a GA search mechanism to move the GA away from being closed within local optima. The analysis shows that the combination of simulated annealing with GA gives better solutions and minimizes the total production costs.Design/methodology/approachThe paper opted for an approached resolution method particularly GA and simulated annealing. The study represents a comparison between the results found using GA and the hybridization of simulated annealing and GA. A total of 45 instances were studied to evaluate job-shop problems of different sizes.FindingsThe results illustrate that for 36 instances of 45, the hybridization of simulated annealing and GA HSAGA has provided best production costs. The efficiency demonstrated by HSAGA approach is related to the combination between the exploration ability of GA and the capacity to escape local optimum of simulated annealing.Originality/valueThis study provides a new resolution approach to the integration of planning and scheduling while considering a new operational constrain. The model suggested aims to control the available capacity of the resources and guaranties that the resources to be consumed do not exceed the real availability to avoid the blocking that results from the unavailability of resources. Furthermore, to solve the MILP model, a GA is proposed and then it is combined to simulated annealing.","[{""name"": ""Zineb Ibn Majdoub Hassani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdellah El Barkany"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdelouahhab Jabri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ikram El Abbassi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdel Moumen Darcherif"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1504/ijpqm.2017.085845"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2018-0031"", ""10.1504/IJPQM.2017.082636"", ""10.1007/BF00940812"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(94)90085-X"", ""10.1111/1475-3995.00388"", ""10.1504/IJPQM.2016.078017"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/JERA.28.169"", ""10.1137/0206029"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/JERA.34.161"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/JERA.39.156"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2014-0012"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2004.09.050"", ""10.1002/nav.3800010110"", ""10.1126/science.220.4598.671"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/JERA.26.142"", ""10.1016/S0272-6963(02)00019-0"", ""10.1504/ijpqm.2016.076706"", ""10.1504/IJPQM.2009.025185"", ""10.1016/0305-0483(89)90059-5"", ""10.1016/S0098-1354(00)00508-1"", ""10.1287/opre.15.1.71"", ""10.1057/jors.1989.159"", ""10.1007/s00291-002-0107-1"", ""10.1504/IJMR.2010.031630"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2012.01.012"", ""10.23940/ijpe.18.06.p7.11611170""]",['Engineering'],['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)]]"

At the heart of this article is the notion of drifting, defined as those actions that move design from its original objective or question to sometimes unanticipated results. The article explicates four traditions of knowledge production as derived from a corpus based on PhD theses. These traditions relate knowledge production to methods, research programs, design experience, and to a dialectic between researchers and user communities.

10.1108/JEDT-11-2023-0490,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,High-strength geopolymer based engineered cementitious composites (ECC) for sustainable and resilient construction,"Purpose The development of high-strength engineered cementitious composite (ECC) gains a significant leap in structural engineering. Engineers have been looking for new formulations that combine outstanding compressive strength with increased flexural resistance. This research focuses on the main characteristics, techniques and prospective applications of high-strength ECC. The proposed work explores the composition of such concrete, emphasizing the use of novel additives, fiber reinforcements and optimal particle packing to produce excellent mechanical characteristics and demonstrating how high-strength ECC contributes to incorporate sustainability by potentially lowering the need for supplemental reinforcing and resulting in a lower environmental effect. Design/methodology/approach This research involves on studying the composition of high-strength ECC and geopolymer-based ECC, the use of novel additives, fiber reinforcements and optimal particle packing. It examines the capacity of high-strength ECC to sustain high loads with an allowable deformation without any catastrophic collapse. It discusses the sustainability aspects of high-strength ECC and its potential alternative as geopolymer-based ECC. Findings High-strength ECC offers an excellent compressive strength while also providing increased flexural capacity. Employment of copper slag (CS) as a filler material for the production of ECC results in 28.92% lower cost, when compared to the mix developed using conventional river sand. Whereas in the case of geopolymer-based ECC, the cost of production was found to be 31.92% lower than that of the conventional. Originality/value High-strength ECC is developed using conventional river sand and industrial by-product, CS as a filler material. The combination of achieving higher compressive strength with an increased use of industrial by-products leads to the development of sustainable high strength ECC. The potential use of high-strength ECC reduces the need for supplementary reinforcing and increases the structural lifetime, resulting in a lower environmental impact.","[{""name"": ""Balamurali Kanagaraj"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N.

Graduated scenarios have previously been used to model different levels of critical thinking and reflection and have been based on situations and experiences that can be related to by a wide range of people. Our development of them in a specific creative disciplinary context, for use by students within that context, represents an evolution of the process, but we also consider the possible reception of such models in the context of debates around academic literacies and the degree to which they may be seen and used as contributing to an orthodoxy of expression. We acknowledge that this experiment in writing and pedagogy may be perceived as providing ‘exemplars of standards’, but argue that it actually models differing depths of thinking, and also opens up discussion about orthodoxies of academic writing. Our four models of different levels of critical reflective writing are provided as appendices, and may be used or adapted as necessary. The production of such graduated accounts is ‘effortful work’, but the process can help us (academics) to better understand our own, as well as facilitating learners’, concepts of depth and ‘good practice’.","[{""name"": ""Mark Readman"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107284630 Bournemouth University""]}, {""name"": ""Jenny Moon"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107284630 Bournemouth University""]}]","[""10.1207/s15326985ep3901_4"", ""10.1016/0742-051X(94)00012-U"", ""10.1080/03075079812331380364"", ""10.1080/09500780308666848"", ""10.1386/adch.17.2.151_1"", ""10.1177/074171368103200101"", ""10.1386/adch.8.1.57_1"", ""10.1080/03626784.1977.11075533"", ""10.1386/adch_00021_1""]",['Social Sciences'],['Education'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)]]"

10.1111/jade.12377,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Form Development from 2D to 3D: The Basic Design Courses for Higher Education,"AbstractThe basic design course mainly focuses on training students in their form development ability, including two parts: graphic figure and three‐dimensional form. However, in terms of form development, it is not just to create a certain form arbitrarily, but to convey the creator’s intention based on this form. For students who are new to the field of design, it will be very difficult to convey their own ideas through creative forms. Therefore, this research combines abstract design with three‐dimensional composition to develop a new teaching method, which connects two parts of graphic figure and three‐dimensional form together, and divides them into three stages: abstract design, unit model and combined model. In addition to allowing students to learn comprehensively, they can also understand how to design a form that can convey their own views and lay a good foundation for future design courses. After the course, the three stages have a positive impact on students. Students will have a new understanding of design, have greater interest and confidence in design, and understand the entire process of design (data collection, analysis, ideation and production) and the importance of teamwork.","[{""name"": ""Ying‐Yi Hsieh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chun‐Ching Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wen‐Yin Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/jade.12223"", ""10.1080/03075079112331383081"", ""10.1386/adch.16.1.7_1"", ""10.1353/jae.2006.0015"", ""10.1016/j.jcps.2010.06.015"", ""10.1111/jade.12045"", ""10.1111/jade.12303"", ""10.1177/1071181381025001173"", ""10.18848/2325-128X/CGP/v13i01/37-58"", ""10.2298/SPAT1635022N"", ""10.1177/2158244016663285"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2005.00454.x""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

In 1969, Giancarlo De Carlo, one of its main advocates, presented a manifesto in which he asserted that ‘architecture is too important to be left to architects’, criticised architectural practice as a relationship of ‘the intrinsic aggressiveness of architecture and the forced passivity of the user’, and called for establishing ‘a condition of creative and decisional equivalence’ between the architect and the user, so that in fact both the architect and the user take on the architect’s role. He also argued for the ‘discovery of users’ needs’ and envisioned the process of designing as planning ‘with’ the users instead of planning ‘for’ the users.1 In the same year, De Carlo began working on a housing estate in Terni, Italy that involved future dwellers in design decisions. Among other participatory projects carried out around that time were Lucien Kroll’s medical faculty building for the University de Louvain (1970–6) and Ottaker Uhl‘s Fesstgasse Housing, a multi-storey apartment block in Vienna (1979).","[{""name"": ""Anna Myjak-Pycia"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Architecture', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Conservation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0813 建筑学', 0.7506), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7274)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-09-2019-0242,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Factors driving the career progression of construction project managers,"PurposeThis paper aims to examine the factors that drive the career progression of construction project managers (CPM) in the Ghanaian construction industry.Design/methodology/approachBased on the quantitative approach, the views of 80 CPMs working with D1 building construction firms were elicited using a structured questionnaire. Data was analysed using one-samplet-test, which was used to examine the relative significance of the variables. The mean scores, standard deviations and significance values (p-values) of each variable were used to examine the outcome of the survey.FindingsThe findings suggest that “existence of organizational support systems”, “ability to create identity”, “having an influential mentor and coach”, “accepting complicated and high visibility assignments” and “ability to gain managerial or leadership experience” are the key factors that drive the career progression of CPMs in Ghana.Research limitations/implicationsFindings from this study is limited to CPMs, specifically within the Ghanaian construction industry. This implies that with the fragmented nature of the construction industry, adopting these findings in construction settings within other countries may not yield the desired results, especially, if those countries do not share similar characteristics and context with Ghana.Practical implicationsPractically, this study highlights for the benefits of project managers (PM) (especially those in the construction industry) the key factors that drive their career progressions. Identification of these drivers offers the professionals with those factors to be prioritized when seeking to progress their careers in the construction industry.Originality/valueEmpirical research on the factors that drive the career progression of CPMs has not been fully examined in previous studies, though such studies in other sectors aside construction are prevalent. Hence, the identification of the drivers for career progression of construction PMs advances literature in the area and offers the professionals with those factors to be prioritized when seeking to progress their careers.","[{""name"": ""Kofi Agyekum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ernest Kissi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Cofie Danku"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Godslove Ampratwum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gideon Selorm Amegatsey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1473-6861.2006.00119.x"", ""10.18820/24150487/as25i2.2"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2008)134:8(618)"", ""10.1111/1467-6486.00305"", ""10.1080/10429247.2010.11431849"", ""10.1108/CDI-05-2014-0068"", ""10.1177/0149206308316059"", ""10.1108/01437731011056425"", ""10.12816/0017456"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.11.010"", ""10.5465/ame.1996.3145319"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.07.011"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2009.03.057"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2018.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.03.003"", ""10.1080/09585190210125921"", ""10.1002/pmj.20164"", ""10.1108/13683041111184071"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.02.002"", ""10.1177/0170840606064105"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2005.12.002"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(98)90075-8"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.10.010"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(99)00034-4"", ""10.4135/9781412976107.n24"", ""10.1177/8756972819832782"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2010.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2006.10.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1988)114:2(172)"", ""10.1002/pmj.20284"", ""10.1016/S0261-5177(01)00092-9"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2002)128:5(446)"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.07.010"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2011.09.001"", ""10.5130/opm.v1i1.3949"", ""10.1108/17538371211269040"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.10.002"", ""10.5296/ijhrs.v6i2.9720"", ""10.1016/S0090-2616(97)90033-4"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(95)90054-3"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.05.012"", ""10.1177/0950017015570726"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.01.004"", ""10.5465/ame.1996.3145321"", ""10.1006/jvbe.2000.1757"", ""10.1016/S0923-4748(01)00043-1"", ""10.1080/13678868.2013.825144"", ""10.20319/pijss.2018.33.14201431"", ""10.1016/j.jvb.2012.01.018"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

The primary purpose of this paper is threefold: to assess the extent of use of FM roles (strategic, tactical and operational); to examine user satisfaction of service quality performance; and to analyse the influence of FM roles on service quality performance using data from Nigeria’s banking sector. Design/methodology/approach Relying on exploratory cross-sectional survey, 350 copies of a structured questionnaire were purposively distributed to senior management staff, bank staff, FM supervisors and bank customers in Lagos, Nigeria. One hundred and forty valid responses were returned to give a response rate of 40%. Data collected were analysed using descriptive, Spearman rank correlation and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Findings It was discovered that strategic facilities planning, IT planning strategy and real estate decisions are the most important FM roles at the strategic level; resource management, data control and planning change at the tactical level; and implementations, building operations and emergencies at the operation level. Findings equally revealed that visual appealing of materials associated with services (tangibles), insisting on error-free records (reliability), willing to help (responsiveness), having the knowledge to answer questions (assurance) and giving individualised attention (empathy) were the most important service quality performance indicators. Furthermore, the study revealed that strategic FM roles significantly influenced tangibles, reliability and responsiveness of staff and the services. Besides, tactical FM roles significantly influenced all service quality indicators except assurance, while operational FM roles had significant influence on tangibles, responsiveness and empathy. Originality/value To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study has provided first ever insight into the extent of FM strategic roles in the banking sector and influence of FM roles on service quality performance.","[{""name"": ""Dubem Isaac Ikediashi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/F-12-2020-0125"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2003.10.004"", ""10.1108/02632771211235206"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2020-0369"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2020-0084"", ""10.1108/JFM-12-2021-0154"", ""10.4018/ij3dim.2012010104"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2021-0640"", ""10.1287/mnsc.32.10.1231"", ""10.1108/02632770010349655"", ""10.1108/02632770210423885"", ""10.1016/j.jretai.2008.05.002"", ""10.1108/14725961111170680"", ""10.1177/014920639101700109"", ""10.2307/1252256"", ""10.1108/F-02-2021-0009"", ""10.1108/02632771011031538"", ""10.1080/15623599.2018.1435235"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2019-0303"", ""10.1080/01446193.2014.961497"", ""10.1108/F-06-2012-0047"", ""10.1108/14725961111128443"", ""10.1016/j.im.2009.03.004"", ""10.1108/ECAM-01-2020-0042"", ""10.1108/F-12-2014-0102"", ""10.1002/smj.325"", ""10.1108/08876040210433248"", ""10.1108/F-12-2020-0134"", ""10.1108/02632779910293451"", ""10.1142/9789813225237_0011"", ""10.1108/02632779410062353"", ""10.1108/02632770810864998"", ""10.1108/02632770410563031""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2024-0012,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Exploring the barriers to digital twin adoption in the Nigerian construction industry: a structural equation modelling approach,"Purpose The adoption of emerging technologies is critical to enhance construction industry performance. Previous studies have shown that the Nigerian construction industry (NCI) is slow to adopt digital technologies and faces performance issues. As a result, this study aims to investigate and model the barriers to adopting digital twin (DT) technology in the NCI with the view to provide stakeholders with adequate information on the multifaceted nature of DT barriers and provide strategies to improve DT adoption. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a qualitative and quantitative approach to achieve the overall aim of the study. The qualitative approach included a scoping review used to identify barriers to DT adoption from the literature. A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was administered to 246 construction professionals in the NCI. This was followed by critical analysis using mean ranking and standard deviation, Kruskal–Wallis, factor analysis and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings The exploratory factor analysis revealed four categories of barriers to DT adoption in the NCI: “technological and investment”, “data management and government”, “project and human resources” and “digital transformation”. The PLS-SEM results revealed the causal relationships of four barriers categories and their concomitant effects on DT adoption in the NCI. The top three barrier categories that require critical attention in order of significance are: technological and investment (ß = 0.655), data management and government (ß = 0.313) and project and human resources (ß = 0.194). Digital transformation (ß = −0.046) has the least significance. Overall, all the barriers’ categories were accepted at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. Practical implications The practical implications include guiding policymakers and practitioners in making informed decisions to address the identified barriers to DT adoption in the NCI. The findings may also be applicable to other developing countries in Africa and beyond. By implementing effective policies and stakeholder guidelines, the NCI can advance technologically and enhance its competitiveness to execute advanced construction projects. Originality/value This research contributes to the construction industry by shedding light on the barriers to DT adoption and their intricate interconnections within the NCI context.

10.1111/jade.12359,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Expanding from the Small Screen - Arts Practice for Affective Digital Presence,"AbstractResponding to conditions of lockdown and social distancing since March 2020, the Centre for Arts and Learning (CAL) at Goldsmiths is researching how arts practice and creative processes can sustain an affective presence in digital learning environments. In this article I discuss our research into how artist educators and students have adapted to the necessity for online learning, including the difficulties of doing so. I refer to a posthumanist, Deleuzian theoretical map that connects with the different collaborative, practice research assemblages we are working with this year. In discussion is a project for engaging with artists and creatives and their learning developments since March 2020 called Finding Comfort within Discomfort. Participants speak for themselves from Instagram and Linktree. The CAL online recorded events with myself and Francis Gilbert; Heather Barnett and Sarah Christie; Jane Prophet; Kimberley Foster, Karl Foster and Victoria Mitchell are referred to as ‘cultural texts’ in hybrid digital/material/embodied arts practice. This research observes ways of expressing emotive release, expanding embodiment from the small screen, and making connections with others that can be adaptive to their different cultural, localised situations. The research seeks to further transferable, affective creative processes.","[{""name"": ""Miranda Matthews"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.6017/ital.v39i3.12619"", ""10.1215/9780822391623"", ""10.1086/669608"", ""10.3898/NewF:100-101.03.2020"", ""10.1215/9780822389606"", ""10.5040/9781350251984"", ""10.1080/00393541.2006.11650500"", ""10.1007/s10798-019-09524-6"", ""10.1177/1468794109348684"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816679669.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780748691555"", ""10.1111/jade.12330"", ""10.1177/1461444818822816"", ""10.22146/jsp.52325"", ""10.1177/1527476420918828"", ""10.1215/10757163-9435877"", ""10.1162/LEON_a_00177"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.019"", ""10.1215/10757163-9435877""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-02-2024-0127,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Examining the critical barriers to NZEBs' implementation in the Ghanaian construction industry,"Purpose Net zero energy buildings (NZEBs) are essential for reducing the environmental consequences of the construction industry. However, its uptake within the industry has been limited, and the inherent barriers remain not fully explored especially in developing countries. This paper aims to examine the critical barriers that hinder the implementation of NZEBs in the construction sector of developing economies like Ghana. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative data were collected from 80 construction professionals in the Ghanaian construction industry (GCI) using online survey questionnaires. The data set underwent analysis following a four-level analytical protocol comprising reliability test analysis, mean score ranking, exploratory factor analysis and fuzzy synthetic evaluation. Findings Market readiness barriers were considered the most crucial barriers to the implementation of NZEBs in the GCI with an index of 4.023. This was followed by awareness and policy barriers with an index of 4.007. Finally, resistance to change, then cost and capacity barriers were ranked third and fourth, based on their indices of 3.763 and 3.615, respectively. Originality/value The results of this research shed light on a relatively unexplored area within the construction sector, particularly in a developing country like Ghana. The findings of this study will provide valuable information to support policy reviews and formulation and buttress the drive towards sustainability and achieving NZEBs.","[{""name"": ""Hayford Pittri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samuel Oduro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Wireko Atibila"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oscar Kwame Kwasafo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aisha Abdallah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eunice Deedei Anteh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.egypro.2011.12.1097"", ""10.1108/ECAM-08-2021-0746"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111755"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018314"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2015.02.041"", ""10.1108/SASBE-04-2022-0073"", ""10.3390/en14133929"", ""10.1108/JFM-12-2022-0131"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.06.089"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111452"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.03.060"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.109303"", ""10.1016/j.clrc.2021.100043"", ""10.1080/09613218.2011.561948"", ""10.3390/buildings12122097"", ""10.1080/01446190500041537"", ""10.1080/01446190601001620"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.09.015"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.007"", ""10.3390/buildings11030095"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/640/1/012026"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112252"", ""10.1108/BIJ-07-2016-0111"", ""10.1108/JFM-08-2013-0042"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.110970"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2018.04.025"", ""10.1080/00963402.2019.1654255"", ""10.3390/en11030518"", ""10.3390/en15176421"", ""10.17348/era.5.0.147-158"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.10.055"", ""10.1108/ECAM-10-2019-0534"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000189"", ""10.1080/01446190701598673"", ""10.3390/buildings13020479""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Acknowledging the critical role of product evolution analysis in design phases, the study introduces the Environment-Based Design (EBD) methodology. EBD emphasizes environmental analysis before delving into product specifics, employing tools like Recursive Object Model (ROM) diagrams and questioning-and-answering analyses. The paper systematically unfolds with a literature review highlighting various design methodologies, followed by the EBD application in a braking system evolution analysis. Trends in environment components are dissected, emphasizing the increasing influence of the human environment. The discussion underlines the significance of analyzing environment components in product evolution and asserts EBD’s applicability. Despite limitations, such as the exclusive focus on braking systems, the study contributes to understanding product evolution dynamics and advocates for the continued exploration of EBD across diverse products and cultural contexts.","[{""name"": ""S.

10.1111/joid.12233,JOURNAL OF INTERIOR DESIGN,0813 Architecture; 1305 Design,Enhancing Design Activity and Review Experience Through Hybridizing Desktop and Virtual Environments,"Although virtual reality (VR) applications can provide immersive experiences, the design process is mainly executed in a desktop environment (DE). The omniscient point-of-view of the desktop allows the user to explore shapes and objects and their relationships with each other conveniently and efficiently. However, unlike a VR environment (VE), it is difficult for the user to perceive the space through their natural spatial perception from the first-person point-of-view in a DE. Although VEs and DEs have advantages and limitations, research exploring the design activity and review experience using these two mediums is limited. Thus, a method of integrating the characteristics and advantages of existing VEs and DEs is proposed as a hybrid design environment (HE). Empirical comparisons of the three environments (VE, DE, and HE) were performed according to the indicators of system usability, perceived workload, and satisfaction through a series of user experiments ( n = 12), showing that the HE was superior on all indicators to the VE. Specifically, participants evaluated the usability of the VE method as the worst and found no significant difference between the usability of the DE and the HE. Perceived workload demand was significantly greater in the VE, and satisfaction levels were also significantly lower than in the other environments. Although the HE allowed both desktop and VR use, participants spent most of their time in the DE and used the VE primarily for design review.","[{""name"": ""Hwan Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Hanyang University, Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Taeha Yi"", ""affiliation"": [""Hanyang University, Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Kyung Hoon Hyun"", ""affiliation"": [""Hanyang University, Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Hyoung-June Park"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, USA""]}]","[""10.1115/1.1486218"", ""10.1016/j.cad.2012.08.006"", ""10.14742/ajet.1306"", ""10.1177/1477153518825387"", ""10.1145/3139131.3139165"", ""10.1115/DETC2017-67878"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.03.009"", ""10.52842/conf.ecaade.2000.265"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0868-6_13"", ""10.1007/s12008-017-0413-0"", ""10.1016/S0166-4115(08)62386-9"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106409"", ""10.1017/dsi.2019.198"", ""10.1162/pres.18.2.125"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-52121-8"", ""10.1145/2818466.2818480"", ""10.3390/app11156802"", ""10.1111/joid.12209"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2019-0138"", ""10.1111/joid.12171"", ""10.3758/s13414-013-0503-4"", ""10.52842/conf.caadria.2022.1.059"", ""10.1145/3196709.3196725"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000856"", ""10.1061/9780784413616.100"", ""10.1016/j.cirp.2018.04.120"", ""10.1111/jcal.12482"", ""10.1145/2543581.2543590"", ""10.1109/3DUI.2017.7893339"", ""10.1115/1.4029750"", ""10.1145/3119881.3119892"", ""10.3390/app11167570"", ""10.1007/s00170-010-2575-9"", ""10.1145/1012551.1012558"", ""10.1109/VSMM.2017.8346288"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108134"", ""10.1111/j.1939-1668.2010.01041.x"", ""10.1145/2628257.2628261""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of innovative practices on the growth of quantity surveying firms (QSFs) in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted the quantitative correlational research design in which a well-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from QSFs in South-West, Nigeria. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis to investigate the effect of innovative practices on the growth of QSFs. Findings The study reveals that there is a significant increase in the growth indices used for assessing QSFs, while all the innovation variables were found to be reliable. Based on the result of multiple regression analysis, the relationships were identified as follows: quantity surveying (QS) software influenced the size growth of QSFs; QS software and services affected client growth and profit growth; and all innovation practices impacted asset growth of QSFs. Practical implications Although the use of software tools has been found to negatively affect the size of QSFs and other growth indices, there is need for them to embrace innovative software applications for more quality service delivery. In addition, QSFs should formulate strategic objectives that will guide them in taking informed decisions for diversification. Originality/value The outcome of this study provides information and direction for innovation practices required to bring about the growth of QSFs.","[{""name"": ""Ibukun Oluwadara Famakin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dorcas Titilayo Moyanga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ajoke Aminat Agboola"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1504/IJTLID.2013.060873"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120370"", ""10.3386/w18824"", ""10.7456/1060AGSE/085"", ""10.14716/ijtech.v9i7.2457"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2018-0181"", ""10.1108/13664381211274362"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2995422"", ""10.1080/13215906.2021.1944902"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2256511"", ""10.1016/j.iedee.2014.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2021.102803"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1378/2/022014"", ""10.18549/PharmPract.2018.03.1351"", ""10.1016/j.jbusvent.2014.10.001"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2014-0047"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0276"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2018-0080"", ""10.18820/24150487/as26i1.2"", ""10.22452/jscp.vol11no1.7"", ""10.5465/amr.2008.34425026"", ""10.1177/049206315610635"", ""10.4314/njt.v39i2.32"", ""10.1108/IJSHE-03-2019-0125"", ""10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0286"", ""10.1108/JEDT-11-2020-0471"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2014-0067"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2018-0057"", ""10.1111/radm.12069""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Decision Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Accurate evaluation of heat exchanger networks performance depends on detailed models of heat exchangers design. The simulations variables include nine design variables such as flow direction determination of each of the two fluids, number of tubes, number of tube passes, length of tubes, the arrangement of tubes, size and percentage of baffle cut, tube diameter and tube pitch. The optimal designing of the heat exchangers is based on geometrical and hydraulic modeling and using a hybrid genetic particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-GA) technique. In this paper, optimization and minimization of the total annual cost of heat exchanger networks are considered as the objective function. Findings In this study, a fast and reliable method is used to simulate, optimize design parameters and evaluate heat transfer enhancement. PSO-GA algorithms have been used to minimize the total annual cost, which includes investment costs of heat exchangers and pumps, operating costs (pumping) and energy costs for utilities. Three case studies of four, six and nine streams are selected to demonstrate the accuracy of the method. Reductions of 0.55%, 23.5% and 14.78% are obtained in total annual cost for the selected streams, respectively. Originality/value In the present study, a reliable method is used to simulate and optimize design parameters and the economic optimization of the heat exchanger networks. Taking into account the importance of shell and tube heat exchangers in industrial applications and the complexity in their geometry, the PSO-GA methodology is adopted to obtain an optimal geometric configuration. The total annual cost is chosen as the objective function. Applying this technique to case studies demonstrates its ability to accurately design heat exchangers to optimize the objective function of the heat exchanger networks by giving the detail of design.","[{""name"": ""Amin Farzin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mehrangiz Ghazi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amir Farhang Sotoodeh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammad Nikian"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ces.2007.03.039"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.03.170"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.035"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2012.12.047"", ""10.1016/j.amc.2015.11.001"", ""10.1007/s00231-014-1340-2"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2011.12.043"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.039"", ""10.1115/1.3231413"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2016.01.008"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2013.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.06.137"", ""10.1021/ie020965m"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2015.12.002"", ""10.1021/ie061575t"", ""10.1007/s12667-016-0221-9"", ""10.1016/j.compchemeng.2006.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.vacuum.2018.12.052"", ""10.1007/s42452-019-1798-0"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2017.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.cep.2005.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.ces.2004.03.016"", ""10.1205/cherd.03192"", ""10.1016/j.ces.2016.01.045"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.11.008"", ""10.1016/0098-1354(90)85010-8"", ""10.1016/S0098-1354(02)00149-7""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Control and Systems Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

According to previous studies, there is a sheer industrial need of an effective management information system for decision-making to prevent life-threatening accidents at oil and gas production sites based on innovative hazard controlling strategies from different production origins. Similarly, that safety and health management information system will also enhance the decision-making skills of oil and gas production crew through effective accident prevention strategies. Design/methodology/approach In this study, 100 drilling crew are randomly selected for quantitative research phase. Similarly, 3 safety experts are purposively selected for qualitative research from each drilling domain from Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Pakistan, whereas for the identification of hazard controlling measures, what-if analysis and thematic analysis approaches are adopted. Furthermore, the educational management information system (HAZ-PRO) for safety and health has been developed by using ADDIE Model based. Whereas, Visual Studio (2017) and MySQL software are used for the database and user interface development of the safety and health management information system for the safety and health of production crew. Findings This study proposes the research framework for the development and implementation of a new safety and health educational management information system (HAZ-PRO) based on identified effective hazard controls and mitigating measures in support of accident prevention and effective decision-making in hazardous events at Saudi Arabian and Pakistani onshore and offshore production domains. Whereas, this proposed safety and health management information system will assist and facilitate the safety professionals and production crew to prevent the injuries in hazardous work environments of onshore and offshore oil and gas industries according to international safety standards. Practical implications This safety and health management information system can be utilized by oil and gas industries (oil and gas production crew) in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Pakistan for accident prevention and suitable decision-making prior to the actual onshore and offshore operations. Also, the proposed system development framework will be useful as an effective source for the elimination of life-threatening drilling hazards associated with its activities in oil and gas industries.

A Pedagogical Model for Interactive Digital Narratives,"AbstractNarratives mirror shared interpretations of the world. Still, dominant narratives prevail, pushing non‐hegemonic narratives in the corner. A change in the creation, interaction and distribution of narratives can support the design of counter‐narratives able to feed social change. Interactive Digital Narrative (IDN) can be considered an emerging experimental context in which designers, researchers and practitioners from various domains operate to develop story‐based content addressing relevant social or societal issues. The IDN social constructivist role in encouraging or influencing individuals and collectivities towards social change is a relevant design issue especially from an educational perspective. Specifically, it features methodologies and praxis not yet systematised, in need of exploration and formalisation. Recognising the contribution of an approach combining transdisciplinary methods and tools, the article presents a pedagogical model for designing IDNs as complex interactive systems able to impact culture and society based on empirical study from a design course in the higher education context. Composed of theoretical and operational frameworks, the pedagogical model orients the multilayered design process for building engaging, interactive narrative artefacts systematising and operationalising knowledge from the domains of Communication for Social Change, storytelling and IDN in an iterative design process.","[{""name"": ""Ilaria Mariani"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Design Politecnico di Milano  Milan Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Mariana Ciancia"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Design Politecnico di Milano  Milan Italy""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv8xng0c"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1zkjz0m.3"", ""10.1086/448619"", ""10.2307/1511637"", ""10.2307/j.ctv8xng0c.6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04028-4_69"", ""10.1002/9781118796443.ch13"", ""10.1076/digc.12.3.167.3225"", ""10.1145/3458769"", ""10.1111/jcom.12093"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04028-4_16"", ""10.2307/463482"", ""10.1177/0004944113517830"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-3185-5_32"", ""10.5817/CP2015‐3‐5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-27036-4_5"", ""10.1145/2932206.2932428"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-04028-4_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-33894-7_3"", ""10.4324/9780203102329"", ""10.4324/9781315769189-15"", ""10.4324/9780429279713"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-49760-6_34"", ""10.21125/edulearn.2019.1643"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2009.01.004"", ""10.3102/0091732X20908501"", ""10.1080/13613324.2013.817772"", ""10.1515/9783110838626"", ""10.7560/783911"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.277"", ""10.1504/IJITM.2003.004233"", ""10.1177/0267323104040696"", ""10.1027/1864-1105/a000211"", ""10.4324/9780429279713-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-62516-0_23"", ""10.3406/comm.1966.1120"", ""10.1075/sin.14"", ""10.1002/9781118505328.ch12"", ""10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.10.003"", ""10.4324/9781315419930""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Health Professions', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Speech and Hearing', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This study proposes criteria for balancing design thinking processes and appropriate technology for social sustainability. In this study, we concretized five assumptions for design thinking processes: user-oriented design with mass productivity; reiterative nature through user satisfaction surveys; affordability for purchase, maintenance, and repair services; local appropriateness; and eco-friendliness with environmental sustainability. Next, we applied the criteria to 28 representative cases from the water, energy, health, shelter, and transportation fields. The cases were evaluated using qualitative content analysis. Findings show that the criteria are necessary for setting economic, social, and environmental development goals for underprivileged regions after considering local contexts. Cultural empathy and collaboration with locals are key for finding practical solutions and co-creating options iteratively. Further, the cases were compared quantitatively using radar diagrams, histograms, and graphs showing average values and standard deviations, providing an objective measure for appropriate technology. Notably, both qualitative and quantitative approaches can serve as useful guidelines for designers, developers, and local users when developing appropriate technology for social sustainability in underprivileged regions.","[{""name"": ""Hyun-Kyung Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sue-Yeon Chae"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Seung-Yeon Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Dong-Hwan Hong"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Creative & Technology Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sang-Gu Kang"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Gyomin Koo"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Seo-Hyeon Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sun-Woo Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Young-Seo Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Myung-Woo Oh"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Geena Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Information & Interaction Design, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Ji-Hyun Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sangha Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Division of Culture & Design Management, Underwood International College, Yonsei University, 03722 Seoul, Korea""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Engineering']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Business and International Management', 'Building and Construction']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.738), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7357)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2022-0281,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Delivering an inclusive built environment for physically disabled people in public universities (Jordan as a case study),"Purpose This study aims to determine the design factors that may affect the design of disabled students. Additionally, this study assesses and compares the reality between the public Jordanian universities’ built environment and international universities based on the Americans with Disabilities Act checklist – version 2.1 – to provide an accessible built environment for physically disabled people. Furthermore, this study examines the satisfaction degree of physically disabled people with the built environment in selected universities. Besides, this study examines the relationships/interrelationships between the students’ demographic factors, design factors and the degree of the disabled students’ satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach This research used different data collection methods to answer the research questions: literature review, observation and questionnaire. Additionally, this study used different analytical and statistical methods, such as comparative analysis between the local cases and the selected international case study based on the Americans with Disabilities Act checklist, version 2.1, descriptive analysis and Pearson r correlational statistics. Findings This research found that the Jordanian public universities did not apply all required design factors to achieve a high degree of the built environment of accessibility and provide all the requirements and needs of physically disabled students like international universities. Additionally, half of the physically disabled students respondents were satisfied with the availability and quality of pathways, ramps, doors and corridors, non-slippery materials, elevators, accessible entrances, entrances doors, methods of openings, adequate spaces for wheelchair students at the configuration of the entrance and the availability of railing. In contrast, they were unsatisfied with the availability of parking and bathrooms for each gender and signage systems. Moreover, this research found no significant differences between gender and educational level and all factors that may impact the students’ satisfaction with campus environmental design. Furthermore, this research found that there was a strong to very strong positive linear association and a significant correlation/intercorrelation between the availability and the design quality of parking, entrances, doors, lobbies and corridors, bathrooms, signage systems and information, ramps, elevators and stairs and the disabled students’ satisfaction degree. Practical implications This research tends to help disabled students participate entirely and independently in the built environment and all aspects of society, involve them within the community and facilitate their access to universities’ urban space. This research considers guidelines and checklists for architects and policymakers to apply through all design and retrofitting processes to meet disabled students’ requirements. This research provides a vital understanding of the needs of disabled students in educational spaces to create a barrier-free campus environment. Originality/value Inclusive design is a relatively new architectural concept. It provides means to ensure access and equal participation in the built environment, offers the opportunity to improve and design new equivalent solutions in architecture simultaneously and covers the way for a broad clarification of equality. Applying the concepts of inclusive design is a step toward eliminating the barriers imposed on the built environment in public universities and creating an accessible built environment. In addition, this research can guide future research in other institutions.","[{""name"": ""Ahmad A. Alhusban"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Salwa N.

Each archival discovery is perceived to increase the importance and contribution of the research work, but like any other discovery, it is assumed to happen only once. Should the document be encountered by the researcher a second time, elsewhere, in a different archive or collection, the encounter often does not acquire the same significance, and the document might be bypassed easily. Visual documents in particular, which at times have been perceived as too unreliable while in other cases treated as authoritative testimonies, present additional challenges of analysis when found in multiple contexts. However, what if re-encountering the same material in different archives is key to unfolding its meanings and histories? What if such archival re-encounters deserve to be sought after rather than avoided? These questions are especially worthy of exploration when the research concerns sites and histories of conflict, in which archival material is often destroyed, withheld, or heavily politicized. In light of research on photographs of the 1922 Smyrna Fire in Greek, Turkish, and American archives, this paper explores the potential of archival re-encounters to expand and enrich historiographical analysis.","[{""name"": ""Kalliopi Amygdalou"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121711467 National Technical University of Athens""]}]","[""10.1386/ijia_00016_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Space and Planetary Science', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7451), ('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.7369)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

More specifically, it draws on the experiences of students in a Foundation Art and Design programme in a Further Education college in the North of England as a case study. As a transitional year between Further Education (FE) and Higher Education (HE), this programme is designed to be transformative in terms of theoretical knowledge, practical skills and shaping student identities through ‘becoming’ creative practitioners. Concepts of liminality and liminal spaces provide a lens through which to offer an account of the nature and scope of these transformative experiences over the past year. As an accidental ethnography (Levitan et al. 2017), aspects discussed suggest that whilst COVID‐19 had a significant negative impact on the experiences and progression of this cohort of students, there have also been many positive outcomes suggesting that this particular programme has maintained its transformative ambitions.","[{""name"": ""Elaine Robertson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Judy Thomas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Bailey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/OHI‐03‐2006‐B0005"", ""10.2190/EM.29.1.b"", ""10.11120/plan.2006.00170004"", ""10.1080/03075070701685130"", ""10.51432/978-1-8381524-0-6_1"", ""10.1080/0729436970160202"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511815355"", ""10.1177/1476750317709078"", ""10.1016/S2215‐0366(20)30570‐8"", ""10.1177/2158244016663285"", ""10.1111/j.1476‐8070.2006.00479.x"", ""10.3102/0034654312457429"", ""10.1080/07294360903384269"", ""10.1177/135050840072002""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The objective is to provide empirical evidence on the performance of PDB delivery method. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was used by analyzing time and cost data collected on 75 PDB and 92 DB projects from the database of Design-Build Institute of America. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine statistical difference in time and cost performance between PDB and DB. Findings PDB projects have a comparatively better time performance than cost performance. When compared with DB projects, there was a statistically significant difference in time overrun with PDB performing better than DB (0.41 vs 8.0%). Additionally, about 80% of PDB projects had shorter or as scheduled duration compared to 74% for DB. There was no statistically significant difference of cost performance between PDB and DB. Research limitations/implications The main limitation is the sample size of 72 PDB projects. It is recommended that further research should be conducted using a larger sample size to confirm the findings of this study. Practical implications PDB will be more beneficial for projects with sensitive deadlines. For an owner deciding between PDB and DB, the advantage of using PDB is in its time performance, which may lead to the project being completed on or ahead of time. As such, PDB can serve as another “tool in the toolbox” for owners to help in reducing construction delays. Originality/value This paper is the first attempt to provide an empirical evidence of the cost and time performance of PDB based on analyzing multiple projects. Owners will be better informed when selecting PDB for their projects.","[{""name"": ""Simon Adamtey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0361198118822315"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1998)124:6(435)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000038"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2003.08.018"", ""10.2478/otmcj-2020-0006""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

While this study contextualizes the project within the broader history of global rural development projects in the post-Second-World-War era, it mainly frames the ADS’s activities within the regional context of Palestine, Jordan, and Israel and the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The discussion traces the alteration of the ADS’s mission after 1948 from a rural development project into a project that utilized its village modernization ethos to deal with the pressing problem of Palestinian refugee housing in the Jordan Valley. Drawing on archival research, the article scrutinizes ADS’s encounters with states, international bodies, and the refugee population. It shows that though the ADS was able to challenge the rule of experts on the specific case of the possibility of resettlement in the Jordan Valley, it generally consolidated the patronizing logic of expertise and failed to engage with the political visions of the refugee population. In shedding light on the widely-forgotten ADS experimental scheme, the article contributes to enriching the understanding of the overlapping nature of rural development and to the questions of resettlement and repatriation in Palestine in the aftermath of 1948.","[{""name"": ""Nadi Abusaada"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000121885934 University of Cambridge""]}]","[""10.1386/ijia_00048_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In particular, the obtained boxes are intended to be used for wine bottles. Design/methodology/approach A systematic procedure has been adopted, which underpins on a comprehensive analysis of the design requirements and the function modelling of the process. By considering well-known models of the engineering design process, the work focuses on the early design stages that precede the embodiment design of the whole components of the plant. Findings The followed design approach allowed to preliminarily evaluate different alternatives of the process from a functional point of view, thus allowing to identify the preferred conceptual process solution. Based on the identified functional sequence, a first evaluation of the potential productivity and the required human resources has been performed. Research limitations/implications The procedure shown in this work has been applied only for the considered case of compostable packaging, and other applications are needed to optimize it. Nevertheless, the adopted systematic approach can be adapted for any context where it is necessary to conceive a new production plant for artefacts made by innovative materials. Originality/value The work presented in this paper represents one of the few practical examples available in the literature where systematic conceptual design procedures are presented. More specifically, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the very first application of systematic design methods to compostable packaging production.","[{""name"": ""Lorenzo Fiorineschi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Leonardo Conti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Giuseppe Rossi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Federico Rotini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.protcy.2013.11.082"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2017.10.033"", ""10.1016/j.indcrop.2005.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120888"", ""10.3390/app10093259"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0254"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2021-0085"", ""10.3390/su9071098"", ""10.3390/su12051870"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.07.027"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.059"", ""10.1007/s11367-011-0261-2"", ""10.1016/0142-694X(91)90003-F"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.10.022"", ""10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.131193"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2021.112918"", ""10.1002/pts.899"", ""10.1007/978-1-84628-319-2"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112405"", ""10.1016/S0924-2244(99)00019-9"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(96)00023-3"", ""10.4081/jae.2020.1088"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2019.12.045"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2016.06.025"", ""10.1093/acprof""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Biomaterials', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7179), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7085)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The work of other architects, including Aalto Aalto, Kengo Kuma, Sverre Fehn, Peter Zumthor, Rudolf Schwarz and Karl Friedrich Schinkel, alongside the influence of Gottfried Semper’s writings, are placed within and alongside these sequences revealing common approaches and individual differences. Developed simultaneously through writing and drawing, the latter have been used to isolate elements of line within each architectural work, helping to understand their use and allowing a comparison to be made between McLaughlin’s work and the wider critical framework of other architect’s work.

10.1108/JEDT-08-2021-0424,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Challenges and benefits of LED retrofit projects: a case of SALIX financed secondary school in the UK,"Purpose The recent surge in light emitting diode (LED) lighting retrofitted into schools in the UK is as a result of the UK Government’s 2050 zero carbon pledge. However, the benefits and consequences of LED retrofit projects for staff and enablers and stakeholder knowledge gaps about LED lighting retrofitting have not been fully explored. The aim of this research is to determine the amount of savings in cost, carbon reduction and kilowatt usage and to confirm if repayment from energy and cost savings derived from LED retrofit school projects funded through the SALIX funding option in the UK would be enough to service the loan. Thus, it examines monetary and non-monetary benefits, internal project stakeholder knowledge gaps and the consequences of LED retrofit for the staff and enablers of a large community college in the UK which is funded through the SALIX funding option. Design/methodology/approach The methodology relied on a hybrid research approach of a case secondary school through the review of literature, analysis of secondary data, focus group and questionnaire survey. The focus group consists of six key project stakeholders. The secondary data was sourced from the Project IGP [Individual Grade Proposal] and the Positive Energy Report from Zenergi, and the closed online questionnaire survey was used to sample 150 teaching staff and school enablers. Findings The findings show that stakeholders lack project knowledge, trust and expertise/project comprehension. This is in terms of baseline information, LED technology/management, payback modalities, management of risks and ethical issues around environmental impact. The forecasted SALIX savings were not achieved in real-time, partly because it does not take into consideration the increase in energy costs over the payback period. However, the LED retrofit creates efficiencies; drives down energy costs and energy usage; and drives carbon reduction, helping pupils’ learning, improving productivity and performance, and finally leading to a better lighting environment for the school community. Originality/value The study will help schools in the UK that intend to access SALIX finance for LED retrofits to understand the challenges and mitigate the risks. It will also help the government to understand the importance of adjusting the payback modalities to the base price when the retrofit was carried out for real-time savings to be made. The research would be useful in ensuring the proactive involvement of all the identified stakeholders in understanding the challenges and what the function entails.","[{""name"": ""Paul James Dunn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adekunle Sabitu Oyegoke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saheed Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roshani Palliyaguru"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ganesh Devkar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/s41598-019-53269-0"", ""10.1080/01446193.2016.1237034"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2008)24:3(138)"", ""10.1049/iet-smc.2020.0061"", ""10.1108/JEDT-09-2018-0148"", ""10.1108/IJBPA-10-2019-0088"", ""10.2298/TSCI161209118J"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2017-0077"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2021-0230"", ""10.1007/s12053-011-9121-y"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2020-0400"", ""10.1007/s12053-019-09801-2""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Management of Technology and Innovation', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"

This article presents a critical examination of a pedagogical approach employed in several architecture and interior design studios to determine how best to develop student understanding of how to design for real users and users with abilities different from themselves. This authentic learning approach with spatial design students and teachers from the School of Design, Queensland University of Technology, Australia and with people with differing abilities, used qualitative and quantitative questionnaires, student journals and design studio projects to create a multimodal data set. While there are no simple conclusions, or easy answers to unravel the complexity in creating inclusive designs, our findings point towards enabling new engagements and knowledge processes and scaffolding these activities around authentic learning, so that design students and educators can begin to understand the differing ways of designing for/with people with disabilities. The significance of this research is that it opens up new approaches for teaching design students about inclusive design beyond fake personas, building codes and anthropometric data, and provides evidence of the need for a more holistic, authentic and scaffolded approach.","[{""name"": ""Janice Rieger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Annie Rolfe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/14606925.2017.1371949"", ""10.1080/13603116.2016.1155662"", ""10.4324/9781315777559"", ""10.4324/9781315724485-5"", ""10.1111/bjet.12505"", ""10.1177/1474022218802529"", ""10.7771/1541-5015.1527"", ""10.1177/0004944113517830"", ""10.3109/09638288.2014.936191"", ""10.1086/444136"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2013.811219"", ""10.1080/15710882.2018.1531134"", ""10.3390/soc6010006"", ""10.7202/1035392ar""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Demography', 'Human-Computer Interaction']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

The purpose of this study is to assess the benefits of construction data risks management (DRM) in the construction industry (CI). Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a quantitative method and collected data from various South African construction professionals with the aid of an e-questionnaire. These professionals involve electrical engineers, quantity surveyors, architects and mechanical, as well as civil engineers involved under a firm, or organisation within the province of Gauteng, South Africa. Standard deviation, mean item score, non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis H test and exploratory factor analysis were used to analyse the retrieved data. Findings The findings revealed that DRM enhances project and company data availability, promotes confidentiality and enhances integrity, which are the primary benefits of DRM that enable the success of project delivery. Research limitations/implications The research was carried out only in the province of Gauteng due to COVID-19 travel limitations. Practical implications The construction companies will have their data permanently in their possession and no interruption will be seen due to data unavailability, which, in turn, will allow long-term and overall pleasant project outcomes. Originality/value This study seeks to address the benefits of DRM in the CI to give additional knowledge on risk management within the built environment to promote success in every project.","[{""name"": ""Ornella Tanga Tambwe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clinton Ohis Aigbavboa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Opeoluwa Akinradewo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/su141811366"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-816203-3.00004-6"", ""10.1080/0976691X.2017.1317502"", ""10.1016/S2212-5671(15)01077-1"", ""10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106897"", ""10.1111/risa.13687"", ""10.1109/ICCSEE.2012.193"", ""10.14424/ijcscm301013-01-15"", ""10.1109/MTS.2011.940293"", ""10.33050/atm.v6i1.1527"", ""10.1504/IJPOM.2008.020031"", ""10.1108/13598540710826308"", ""10.1145/1629175.1629210"", ""10.1080/10911359.2011.588569"", ""10.1109/MSP.2015.107"", ""10.1080/15623599.2020.1728606"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01795"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0260341"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-5847-0_2"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/1107/1/012230"", ""10.3390/su141912793"", ""10.1080/15623599.2019.1606493"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.04.082"", ""10.1080/15623599.2023.2167303"", ""10.1080/15623599.2021.1970300"", ""10.1080/00396338.2011.555586"", ""10.1080/00963402.2016.1216502"", ""10.5604/01.3001.0012.7249"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.611.115"", ""10.1007/s10669-013-9470-5"", ""10.1109/ICOMITEE.2019.8921046""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Based on a thorough literature review on competency and project management best practices, a criterion for measuring best practices based on the competencies was identified. Using closed-ended questionnaires as a survey instrument, data was collected and analyzed using a one-sample t-test, Kendall’s concordance coefficient and simple regression. Findings The key finding reveals that in achieving project management best practices for the Ghanaian road infrastructure projects, project managers should straighten and strengthen their capability in terms of skills, personal characteristics and knowledge as ranked. An appropriate blend of these characteristics would be a necessary requirement for project managers. Through this, project managers and project-based road infrastructure organizations will be able to win the confidence of their stakeholders and attain improvements in cost-effectiveness, quality and time management. Research limitations/implications This study provides project managers in the road infrastructure sector with relevant information on which criteria and variables are critical and are frequently required to manage such projects. This will be helpful for training programs and professional development of project managers in the road infrastructure sector. Originality/value The study provides a new direction and focuses for project managers in the road infrastructure industry toward best project management practices in developing countries.

The goal is to analyse the process of conceptual appropriation and curricular development over four consecutive years of this experience, in relation to both the pair of teachers and the students. Using a hybrid methodology, which combines autoethnography, self-study and the narratives of the teachers and the students, writing emerges as the main focus of the research, as it is an essential work instrument of the classroom, of the teachers’ personal reflection, and at the same time a spring that provides sources and means for its own analysis. It is through writing that one explores the appropriation of concepts as diverse as pedagogy of the event, real learning, intra-relation and intra-action, which leads to the process in which the teachers end up becoming the teachers yet to come.","[{""name"": ""Ana Luísa Paz"", ""affiliation"": [""UIDEF, Instituto de Educação da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Ana Paula Caetano"", ""affiliation"": [""UIDEF, Instituto de Educação da Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal""]}]","[""10.1525/joae.2020.1.1.1"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2012.01724.x"", ""10.1057/sub.2014.22"", ""10.1386/jwcp.11.1.3_2"", ""10.17763/haer.83.1.a78q39699078ju20"", ""10.1080/17425960801976321"", ""10.1080/03075070902771952"", ""10.1080/03075079812331380364"", ""10.1386/jwcp.3.3.299_1"", ""10.1386/jwcp.2.2.133/2"", ""10.1386/jwcp.3.2.111_1"", ""10.1016/j.jeap.2011.11.007"", ""10.1386/adch_00022_1""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

10.3233/JID-220001,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED DESIGN & PROCESS SCIENCE,1305 Design,An active and passive upper limb rehabilitation training system based on a hybrid brain-computer interface,"Movement function rehabilitation of patients with craniocerebral injuries is an important issue facing neurorehabilitation science. The use of brain–computer interface technology in rehabilitation training systems can allow patients to actively participate in the rehabilitation training process and use the brain’s neuroplasticity to enhance the effects from rehabilitation training. At present, the brain–computer interface-based rehabilitation training system still has problems such as insufficient active participation of patients, resulting in slowed motor neural circuit repair or low action execution accuracy. In response to the above problems, this paper designed an active and passive upper limb rehabilitation training system based on a hybrid brain–computer interface of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs). The system includes six parts: task setting and training guidance module, EEG signal acquisition module, EEG signal preprocessing and recognition module, rehabilitation training module, training completion evaluation module, and communication module. The system drives the rehabilitation robot to complete the training actions by identifying the participant’s SSVEP and evaluates the completion of the rehabilitation training based on the patient’s movement intention recognition results. In this study, 12 participants were recruited. In the online test, the system achieved an average action execution accuracy of 99.3%. The movement intention detection based on MRCPs reached an average accuracy of 82.7%. The participants’ average completion rate was 0.91. The experimental results show that the system can achieve a high rate of execution accuracy. In addition, it can evaluate the active participation level of patients in rehabilitation training based on the movement intention detection results, accelerate the reconstruction of motor neural circuits, improve the effects of training, and provide more effective ways of thinking for the study of upper limb rehabilitation training systems for patients with craniocerebral injuries.","[{""name"": ""Tongda Shen"", ""affiliation"": [""Tandon School of Engineering of New York University, New York, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Lipeng Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Brain Science and Brain-Computer Interface Technology, Zhengzhou, China"", ""Institute of Neuroscience, Zhengzhou University, China""]}, {""name"": ""Shaoting Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Brain Science and Brain-Computer Interface Technology, Zhengzhou, China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuxia Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Brain Science and Brain-Computer Interface Technology, Zhengzhou, China"", ""Institute of Neuroscience, Zhengzhou University, China""]}]","[""10.3389/fnins.2016.00122"", ""10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.505313"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2021.656975"", ""10.1038/nrneurol.2016.113"", ""10.1088/1741-2560/10/6/066009"", ""10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512783"", ""10.1109/TBME.2020.2984003"", ""10.3389/fneur.2020.00948"", ""10.3390/brainsci10080512"", ""10.1177/1545968306298414"", ""10.1093/brain/awr039"", ""10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.04.019"", ""10.1109/TBME.2015.2467312"", ""10.1515/bmt.2010.044"", ""10.1088/1741-2552/aa5847"", ""10.1162/089892902760191072"", ""10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001399"", ""10.1055/s-0038-1649503"", ""10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103843"", ""10.1177/1545968307305457"", ""10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70150-4"", ""10.1161/01.STR.32.6.1279"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2018.00014"", ""10.1109/TBME.2006.886577"", ""10.1080/10749357.2019.1627716"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-63934-9.00003-2"", ""10.1016/j.pmrj.2017.04.016"", ""10.1016/S1388-2457(98)00038-8"", ""10.1088/1741-2560/8/6/066009"", ""10.1186/1743-0003-11-137"", ""10.1016/j.conb.2006.10.004"", ""10.3109/17483107.2011.556209"", ""10.3389/fneur.2021.683703"", ""10.3389/fnins.2020.591435"", ""10.1161/01.STR.0000226902.43357.fc"", ""10.1177/155005941104200410"", ""10.3389/fnins.2021.699428"", ""10.1016/S1474-4422(10)70247-7"", ""10.1016/S1474-4422(17)30283-1"", ""10.1007/s10548-009-0121-6"", ""10.1113/jphysiol.2006.125948"", ""10.1093/brain/aws017"", ""10.1016/S1388-2457(02)00057-3"", ""10.3390/electronics9010174"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2020.00367"", ""10.1142/S0129065714500130""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Neuroscience']","['Rehabilitation', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.72), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7194)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

As the cornerstone of design education, the design studio incorporates a hands‐on approach that stems from its materiality. This tactile character of the design studio has been challenged by the recent pandemic since many design schools and departments decided to proceed with their education online. Consequently, some fundamental pedagogical mechanisms that rely on the distinct habitat of the design studio were moved to the online context. Design critiques, a crucial activity in communicating design knowledge, were also carried to online channels. This shift from the physical to the online environment caused some changes in both the communication and understanding of design critiques. In the light of recent developments, this article reflects on students’ perceptions of design critiques in an online studio setting. In‐depth interviews were conducted with six industrial design students who started their semester in a physical studio environment but continued online. The study demonstrates that the students’ impressions of design critiques have been affected by several factors that can be grouped under three categories: crit actors, crit process and crit context.","[{""name"": ""Tuğçe Ecem Tüfek"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Design Istanbul Bilgi University Istanbul Turkey""]}]","[""10.1016/j.destud.2015.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.732"", ""10.1207/s15326985ep2603&4_8"", ""10.2307/1511851"", ""10.7771/1541-5015.1253"", ""10.5204/jld.v6i3.155"", ""10.1080/10464883.1987.10758461"", ""10.1177/1474022218758231"", ""10.2752/144871303X13965299302596"", ""10.1017/S089006041000020X"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-1785-9_5"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(00)00051-0"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2004.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2012.08.004"", ""10.1007/s10755-008-9079-7"", ""10.1177/1098214005283748"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(99)00002-2"", ""10.1007/s10111-012-0232-9""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1111/jade.12438,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,0401 Education; 1305 Design,An Online Art Project Based on the Affirmative Model of Disability in Japan,"AbstractIn recent years, disability has become a site for knowledge and artistic creation. In this study, local governments, universities, art museums and non‐profit organisations collaborated from 2019 to 2022 to implement an online art project for people with disabilities during the Covid‐19 era. The project's goal was to enhance the identity of people with disabilities, promote their interest in museums and artwork as local resources and engage them in society. The project was conducted in three phases with a sequence of connections using the affirmative model of disability by Swain and French (2000) as the theoretical framework. In Phase 1, we surveyed 370 people with disabilities and their supporters living in Hiroshima Prefecture to clarify the conditions promoting or hindering their appreciation of art exhibitions and the use of digital devices. In Phase 2, we conducted an online interactive appreciation workshop at a museum for seven people with disabilities based on the Phase 1 survey results. In Phase 3, an online exhibition was held using the artwork seen in Phase 2, and words and photographs were used as methods of expression. The interactive appreciation workshop and exhibition was built to provide the participants a safe and comfortable online alternative space, which led to individual empowerment and enhanced collaboration in the disability community. This study advocates the value of coexisting and co‐prosperous inclusion rather than inclusion that necessitates people gathering in the same place.","[{""name"": ""Satoshi Ikeda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hiroko Fukuda Siddiqi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mayuko Mori"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hiromitsu Kawajiri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Misa Hirasawa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Takashi Kawaguchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kaoru Yasuda"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-62639-0"", ""10.2307/1320684"", ""10.1016/j.edurev.2017.08.003"", ""10.1080/00393541.2011.11518827"", ""10.1080/00393541.2007.11518721"", ""10.3102/0013189X026006004"", ""10.1080/09687599.2019.1566889"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac25.2.0205"", ""10.1080/00393541.2013.11518894"", ""10.1386/eta_00013_2"", ""10.1111/jade.12330"", ""10.1080/09687599.2017.1337563"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-20895-1"", ""10.1111/jade.12052"", ""10.1386/eta_00014_1"", ""10.3998/mpub.309723"", ""10.1080/09687590050058189"", ""10.1080/00393541.2011.11518852"", ""10.2307/3350151""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Design/methodology/approach In this paper, an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy is used for the two tank level process plant and it is remotely monitored with the industrial internet of things technology. The disturbances in a primary and secondary loop of the cascade process, which are affecting the overall settling time (ts) of the process, are eliminated by using the proposed, ADRC-ADRC structure in the cascade loop. The stability of the proposed controller is presented with Hurwitz’s stability criteria for selecting gains of observers. The results of the proposed controller are compared with the existing active disturbance rejection control-proportional (ADRC-P) and proportional-integral derivative-proportional (PID-P)-based controller by experimental validation. Findings It is observed that the settling time (ts) in the case of the proposed controller is improved by 60% and 55% in comparison to PID-P and ADRC-P, respectively. The level process is interfaced with an industrial controller and real-time data acquired in matrix laboratory (MATLAB), which acted as a remote monitoring platform for the cascade process. Originality/value The proposed controller is designed to provide robustness against disturbance and parameter uncertainty. This paper provides an alternate way for researchers who are using MATLAB and ThingSpeak cloud server as a tool for the implementation.","[{""name"": ""Tushar Vikas Bhaskarwar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sumit Suhas Aole"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rajan Hari Chile"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/CDC.2008.4739341"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019027"", ""10.1109/TIE.2015.2478397"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.09.034"", ""10.1016/j.jprocont.2012.10.003"", ""10.3390/electronics2030246"", ""10.1109/CACS.2016.7973895"", ""10.23919/ACC.2004.1386801"", ""10.1109/ACC.2016.7525135"", ""10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322826"", ""10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228028"", ""10.1109/TIE.2012.2208434"", ""10.1016/j.isatra.2017.07.026"", ""10.1109/TLA.2017.7854611"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2015.10.022"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942516"", ""10.1109/INDIANCC.2018.8307966"", ""10.1016/j.eij.2016.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2017.12.014"", ""10.3390/pr2020392"", ""10.1109/TII.2018.2852491"", ""10.1109/RACE.2015.7097276"", ""10.1109/SICE.2015.7285548"", ""10.1109/TENCON.2000.888806"", ""10.1109/MIE.2017.2649104"", ""10.3969/j.issn.1004-4132.2011.01.012"", ""10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260896""]",['Engineering'],['Control and Systems Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-05-2021-0287,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A simulation-based decision support tool for integrating site layout and construction planning of tunneling projects,"Purpose Integrating construction and site layout planning in mechanized tunnel infrastructure projects is essential due to the mutual impacts of construction planning and site layout decisions. Simulation can incorporate site layout planning and construction planning of tunneling projects in a unified environment. However, simulation adoption by industry practitioners has remained relatively limited due to the special skills required for building and using simulation models. Therefore, this paper aims to create a simple-to-use simulation tool that supports site layout and construction operation planning of tunneling projects. This tool intends to promote the simulation application in site layout planning. Design/methodology/approach The current paper proposes simulation as a decision support tool (DST) to provide an integrated environment for modeling tunnel construction operations, site layout and capturing the mutual impacts. A special purpose simulation (SPS) tool was customized and developed for typical mechanized tunneling projects, by tunnel boring machines, to facilitate building the model and allow access to users with limited simulation knowledge. Findings The results show that the developed SPS tool is of great assistance to construction industry practitioners to analyze a variety of site layout and construction plan scenarios and make informed decisions based on its comprehensive and intuitive outputs. Originality/value The main contribution of this research is to promote simulation application in site layout planning of tunneling projects through the development of a simple-to-use tool, which has sufficient details for site layout planning and constraints. The developed DST enables planners to make decisions simultaneously on the site layout, other construction planning variables and identify the most efficient plan.","[{""name"": ""SeyedReza RazaviAlavi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simaan AbouRizk"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.103046"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000220"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.12.010"", ""10.1080/00207540050205154"", ""10.1080/01446193.2019.1600708"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1996)122:4(329)"", ""10.1057/jos.2012.18"", ""10.1108/09699981011074600"", ""10.1177/0037549710380992"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00215"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:4(534)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2005)131:11(1186)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2009)23:2(119)"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2019.01.017"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1998)124:5(390)"", ""10.1139/l98-016"", ""10.1007/s40996-018-0148-6"", ""10.1080/01446190600972870"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0702(2008)13:2(122)"", ""10.1139/l06-073"", ""10.1108/CI-05-2020-0068"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2018.01.016"", ""10.1016/S0925-5273(00)00140-7"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.09.006"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001213"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000653"", ""10.3390/logistics5040065"", ""10.1139/l00-101"", ""10.1109/WSC.2008.4736347"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000307"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000584"", ""10.1109/WSC.2008.4736065"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(1987)113:4(554)"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2008.09.011""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-04-2023-0131,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A platform sandbox for the assessment of municipal sustainable development goals,"Purpose This study aims to present an innovative sandbox platform that implements a decision support system (DSS) to assess the sustainable development goals (SDGs) addressed at the municipal level. It intends to determine the relative importance of each SDG in municipalities and explore the synergies that can be discovered among them. Design/methodology/approach Participatory action research is used to develop a DSS and an algorithm designated as discrete heavy fuzzy was also developed, which extends the Apriori algorithm to include discrete quantitative assessments of the level of SDG compliance by each project. A scenario consisting of three municipalities in Portugal (i.e. Porto, Loulé and Castelo de Vide) was chosen to demonstrate the implementation of the sandbox platform and to interpret the observed results. Findings The results reveal significant differences in the typology of SDGs addressed by each municipality. It was found that municipal sustainable projects are strongly influenced by the contextual factors of each municipality. Porto has projects that address the first five SDGs. Loulé appears projects that promote innovation, the fight against climate change and the development of sustainable cities. Castelo de Vida has initiatives related to innovation and infrastructure and decent work and economic growth. Research limitations/implications This study provides knowledge about the relative importance of the SDGs in Portuguese municipalities and explores the synergies among them. The proposed sandbox platform fills the gaps of the ODSlocal Webtool by proposing a dynamic and interactive approach for the exploration of quantitative indicators regarding the implementation status of the SDGs established in the 2030 Agenda. Originality/value This study provides knowledge about the relative importance of the SDGs and the various synergies that exist between them considering the Portuguese municipalities. The sandbox platform presented and developed within this study allows filling the gaps of the ODSlocal Webtool that gathers essentially qualitative information about each project and offers a dynamic and interactive exploration with quantitative indicators of the implementation status of the SDGs established in the 2030 Agenda.","[{""name"": ""Filipe Ferreira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pedro Briga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sérgio Ramos Teixeira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fernando Almeida"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.trpro.2020.08.261"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.367"", ""10.3390/su141912696"", ""10.1108/SBR-12-2021-0233"", ""10.1108/BFJ-01-2022-0072"", ""10.1007/s11356-023-26644-8"", ""10.1016/j.sftr.2023.100109"", ""10.3390/su142214995"", ""10.1007/s11356-022-20024-4"", ""10.1007/s10961-019-09753-w"", ""10.1080/26437015.2020.1714356"", ""10.1007/s10551-011-0908-8"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2021.113664"", ""10.1016/j.stae.2022.100016"", ""10.1016/j.cosust.2021.12.001"", ""10.1007/s10551-022-05189-9"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.12.006"", ""10.1108/OHI-03-2016-B0018"", ""10.1108/JPBAFM-02-2021-0031"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2021.102776"", ""10.1177/1087724X11429045"", ""10.1186/s40537-021-00538-3"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.199"", ""10.1093/jue/juac020"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30271-9"", ""10.1002/sd.2088"", ""10.1515/9783110689860"", ""10.3390/su14106070"", ""10.3390/ijerph19031345"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2021.107671"", ""10.5751/ES-10182-230322"", ""10.3390/su14074351"", ""10.1057/s41599-023-01610-4"", ""10.3390/su12093616"", ""10.1108/IJDRBE-07-2021-0076"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2022.103883"", ""10.1016/j.oneear.2020.08.006"", ""10.1086/586911"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1255/1/012057"", ""10.1016/j.fcij.2017.04.003"", ""10.1007/s11625-018-0627-5"", ""10.1007/s11205-022-02886-w"", ""10.1108/978-1-80043-888-020211004"", ""10.4103/2F0970-0218.58381"", ""10.1108/SRJ-06-2019-0210"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2018.10.010"", ""10.3390/land12030609"", ""10.1038/s41746-020-0221-y"", ""10.1108/F-09-2019-0099"", ""10.1080/02646811.2018.1450895"", ""10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110236"", ""10.3390/socsci6040117"", ""10.4236/jss.2021.94034"", ""10.1016/j.accre.2018.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120404""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Building and Construction', 'Media Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-07-2021-0370,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A novel heritage BIM (HBIM) framework development for heritage buildings refurbishment based on an investigative study of microorganisms,"Purpose This study aims to demonstrate the possibility of showing the functionality of complex microbial groups, within ancient structures within a process of refurbishment on a heritage building information modelling (BIM) platform. Design/methodology/approach Both a qualitative and qualitative research method will be used throughout, as observational and scientific results will be obtained and collated. This path being; phenomena – acquisition tools – storage – analysis tools – literature. Using this methodology, one pilot study within the scope of demolition and refurbishment, using suitable methods of collecting and managing data (structural or otherwise), will be used and generated by various software and applications. The principle methods used for the identification of such micro-organisms will incorporate a polymerase chain reaction method (PCR), to amplify DNA and to identify any or all spores present. The BIM/historical BIM (HBIM) process will be used to create a remotely-based survey to obtain and collate data using a laser scanner to produce a three-dimensional point cloud model to evaluate and deduce the condition, make-up and stature of the monument. A documentation management system will be devised to enable the development of plain language questions and an exchange information requirement, to identify such documentation required to enable safe refurbishment and to give health and safety guidance. Four data sampling extractions will be conducted, two for each site, within the research, for each of the periods being assessed, that being the Norman and Tudor areas of the monument. Findings From laboratory PCR analysis, results show a conclusive presence of micro-organism groups and will be represented within a hierarchical classification, from kingdom to species. Originality/value The BIM/HBIM process will highlight results in a graphical form to show data collected, particularly within the PCR application. It will also create standardisation and availability for such data from ancient monuments to make available all data stored, as such analysis becomes substantially important to enable the production of data sets for comparison, from within the framework of this research.","[{""name"": ""John Peter Cooney"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Oloke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Louis Gyoh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1051/matecconf/20141501030"", ""10.1108/02632770810885742"", ""10.1109/MCG.2003.1242380"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2012.11.007"", ""10.1108/SS-03-2015-0018"", ""10.1108/CI-01-2014-0002"", ""10.1108/0263080081088 7108"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2007.02.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000127"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2019-0217"", ""10.1179/003962611X13117748891912"", ""10.1016/S0964-8305(02)00172-5"", ""10.1109/34.121791"", ""10.1007/ 978-3-319-99441-3_52"", ""10.1080/01446193.2012.700405"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.08.012"", ""10.14311/gi.6.21"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.12.005"", ""10.1046/j.1462-2920.2003.00422.x"", ""10.4018/ij3dim.2013040101"", ""10.1126/science.284.5418.1318"", ""10.1007/s11157-012-9264-0"", ""10.1017/S0003598X0007294X"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0284"", ""10.1007/BF01949869"", ""10.1016/S0964-8305(00)00107-4"", ""10.1080/014461998372349"", ""10.1016/j.jdmm.2014.08.002"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0063"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2011.04.016"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.09.002"", ""10.1038/381684a0"", ""10.1126/science.286.5447.2144"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.06.024"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000148"", ""10.1016/j.annpat.2014.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.10.007"", ""10.1186/s13040-015-0072-2"", ""10.1128/jb.174.14.4525-4529.1992"", ""10.1099/mic.0.032508-0"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2013.09.003"", ""10.5194/isprsarchives-XXXVIII-5-W16-429-2011"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2019-0048"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2011-0067"", ""10.1128/AEM.71.12.7806-7818.2005"", ""10.1108/02630800910985108"", ""10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2012.11.006"", ""10.1016/S0964-8305(00)00102-5"", ""10.1126/science.291.5504.595C"", ""10.1038/20859"", ""10.1126/science.286.5447.2141"", ""10.5194/isprsarchives-XLII-2-W15-945-2019"", ""10.1108/02630800110412480"", ""10.1016/j.ygyno.2012.03.002"", ""10.1016/0048-9697(95)04588-R"", ""10.18848/2154-8587/CGP/v01i03/37480"", ""10.1128/AEM.66.8.3214-3220.2000"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.06.007"", ""10.1073/pnas.0605347103"", ""10.1351/pac199870122327"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.10.023"", ""10.1016/S0964-8305(00)00109-8"", ""10.1016/j.tim.2005.12.006"", ""10.1128/mr.51.2.221-271.1987"", ""10.1016/S1296-2074(99)00120-X"", ""10.1016/j.semerg.2010.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.culher.2009.02.007"", ""10.1016/S1369-5274(99)80055-1"", ""10.1021/es035299a"", ""10.30958/aja.4-2-4"", ""10.1016/S0167-7012(01)00227-5"", ""10.1016/0092-8674(84)90436-7"", ""10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W5-679-2017""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Earth-Surface Processes', 'Geology', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0709 地质学', 0.7376), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7361)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-01-2021-0030,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A multi-objective opposition-based barnacles mating optimization for image super resolution using hyper-Spectral images,"Purpose The problems of Super resolution are broadly discussed in diverse fields. Rather than the progression toward the super resolution models for real-time images, operating hyperspectral images still remains a challenging problem. Design/methodology/approach This paper aims to develop the enhanced image super-resolution model using “optimized Non-negative Structured Sparse Representation (NSSR), Adaptive Discrete Wavelet Transform (ADWT), and Optimized Deep Convolutional Neural Network”. Once after converting the HR images into LR images, the NSSR images are generated by the optimized NSSR. Then the ADWT is used for generating the subbands of both NSSR and HRSB images. The residual image with this information is obtained by the optimized Deep CNN. All the improvements on the algorithms are done by the Opposition-based Barnacles Mating Optimization (O-BMO), with the objective of attaining the multi-objective function concerning the “Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural similarity (SSIM) index”. Extensive analysis on benchmark hyperspectral image datasets shows that the proposed model achieves superior performance over typical other existing super-resolution models. Findings From the analysis, the overall analysis of the suggested and the conventional super resolution models relies that the PSNR of the improved O-BMO-(NSSR+DWT+CNN) was 38.8% better than bicubic, 11% better than NSSR, 16.7% better than DWT+CNN, 1.3% better than NSSR+DWT+CNN, and 0.5% better than NSSR+FF-SHO-(DWT+CNN). Hence, it has been confirmed that the developed O-BMO-(NSSR+DWT+CNN) is performing well in converting LR images to HR images. Originality/value This paper adopts a latest optimization algorithm called O-BMO with optimized Non-negative Structured Sparse Representation (NSSR), Adaptive Discrete Wavelet Transform (ADWT) and Optimized Deep Convolutional Neural Network for developing the enhanced image super-resolution model. This is the first work that uses O-BMO-based Deep CNN for image super-resolution model enhancement.","[{""name"": ""A. Valli Bhasha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""B.D.

10.1108/JEDT-02-2022-0090,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,A framework for enhancing building maintainability through facilitating early suppliers' involvement in the design process,"Purpose The aim of this paper is to develop a framework to enhance building maintainability through facilitating early suppliers’ involvement (ESI) in the design process. Design/methodology/approach A research methodology consisting of literature review, case studies and survey questionnaire was designed to achieve the above-mentioned aim. Firstly, literature review was used to examine the concepts of building maintenance, maintainability, the design process and ESI. Secondly, three case studies were presented and analysed to investigate the role of ESI towards enhancing building maintainability during the design process. Thirdly, a survey questionnaire was carried out with a representative sample of architectural design firms (ADFs) in Egypt to investigate their perception and application of ESI towards enhancing building maintainability during the design process. Finally, the research developed a framework to facilitate ESI in the design process in ADFs in Egypt. Findings Through literature review, the research highlighted the relationship between ESI and enhancing building maintainability and identified the roles, benefits, challenges and that encounter ESI in ADFs, factors for suppliers selection and levels of involvement. Results of the data analysis showed that “Difficulty of trusting external parties and sharing information with transparency” was ranked the highest challenge of ESI in ADFs in Egypt, followed by “Legal competitive advantage restrictions”. Moreover, “Better estimation for operation and maintenance costs” was ranked the highest contributions of ESI towards enhancing building maintainability, followed by “Reduce the number of operation and maintenance problems or reworks”. Finally, respondents stated that “Innovation, technical expertise, and competence” was ranked the highest supplier’s selection criteria, while “paying consultation fees for offering advice and recommendations to the design team” was ranked the highest form of supplier’s remuneration. Research limitations/implications The proposed framework contributes to the body of knowledge through proposing five functions that aimed to facilitate ESI in the design process, a research area that received scant attention in construction research. In addition, because of the conceptual nature of the framework, it has to be validated to ensure its capability to overcome the challenges of ESI as an approach for enhancing building maintainability during the design process. Practical implications This research presents a practical solution that bridges the gap between theory and practice through overcoming the challenges that obstruct suppliers from being involved in the design process as an approach for enhancing building maintainability. Originality/value This research discussed the relationship between ESI and enhancing building maintainability as well as the roles, benefits and challenges that encounter ESI in ADFs. In addition, the research investigated the levels of suppliers’ involvement, selection criteria and forms of payment. Moreover, it investigated the perception and application of ESI in ADFs in Egypt towards improving building maintainability. The research proposed a framework to facilitate the integration of suppliers in the early stages of the project life cycle. It represents a synthesis that is novel and creative in thought and adds value to the knowledge in a manner that has not previously occurred.","[{""name"": ""Ayman Ahmed Ezzat Othman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Ramadan Kamal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.15641/jcbm.1.1.57"", ""10.9790/1684-0333751"", ""10.1108/13664381211274353"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2000)126:6(440)"", ""10.1016/j.pursup.2009.03.008"", ""10.1111/j.1745-493X.2002.tb00139.x"", ""10.5923/j.arch.20130304.04"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(1997)13:2(77)"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2006.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2003.09.005"", ""10.1108/13673270010350002"", ""10.1080/17452007.2007.9684638"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2021-0566"", ""10.1108/JEDT-02-2020-0047"", ""10.1108/09699980410547603"", ""10.1111/1540-5885.00028"", ""10.1080/01446199300000004"", ""10.1108/13673270010372279"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2019.02.317"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.06.006""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1386/adch_00030_1,ART DESIGN & COMMUNICATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION,1305 Design,'Opening the door': An authentic approach to decolonizing arts education in Aotearoa/New Zealand,"Educators in universities in Aotearoa/New Zealand have the responsibility to ‘live and model’ the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. However, tertiary education has often treated the principles in an inauthentic way. There are few courses in art, design and communication in New Zealand that integrate the principles authentically. This article showcases features of a course – Mahitahi | Collaborative Practices – that engages with Te Tiriti principles by teaching collaboration from te ao Māori (the Māori world). Our findings draw from a focus group we conducted with academic staff who taught into a pilot iteration of the course. Three central themes emerged from the focus group relating to the issue of decolonizing arts education. First, that regardless of the educators’ intentions to design a course that privileges te ao Māori, the features of Aotearoa/New Zealand’s colonial reality are still present. Second, the students’ primary learning activity was principled reflection, where they successfully engaged with te ao Māori in an authentic way. Third, students’ connection to te ao Māori was jeopardized by designing part of the assessment that took on a Pākehā (non-Māori) world-view. Consequently, students may have missed the opportunity to engage more fully with educative experiences relating to lifelong learning. We argue that to maintain an authentic connection to te ao Māori, the curriculum should be consistently designed around principles embedded in Te Tiriti o Waitangi.","[{""name"": ""Luke Feast"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107057067 Auckland University of Technology""]}, {""name"": ""Christina Vogels"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000107057067 Auckland University of Technology""]}]","[""10.15663/wje.v24i1.666"", ""10.1386/adch.8.2.123/1"", ""10.1080/713695728"", ""10.1080/07294360.2011.598451"", ""10.1080/17482620600858399"", ""10.2304/pfie.2005.3.2.9"", ""10.1080/03098770802395561"", ""10.1080/02680939.2016.1159339"", ""10.1111/j.1440-172X.2006.00543.x"", ""10.3102/0013189X12441244"", ""10.24135/teacherswork.v7i2.530"", ""10.1386/adch_00030_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Human Factors and Ergonomics', 'Education', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7507), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7424)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Open to arts and humanities undergraduate students interested in creative research, our course used world building as a central approach to imagining alternatives. We found that explicitly centring Black and Indigenous perspectives helped support non-dominant students in their striving to realize possibilities beyond settler colonial visions of the future. We share our position in relation to decolonization and decolonizing pedagogies before describing the course at a high level and through an in-depth case study of an author’s research project. Our analysis of the course is presented via three axiological allegiances and three performative pragmatics. By discussing our political stance and a conceptual innovation that we term, ‘transcosmic potentials’, we conclude with insights for fellow educators. This pluriversal learning community opened a multiplicity of ‘portals’ to heterogeneous worlds, each with the power to fundamentally and forever alter all who pass through.","[{""name"": ""Nathanael Elias Mengist"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122986657 University of Washington""]}, {""name"": ""Mariama Sidibe"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122986657 University of Washington""]}, {""name"": ""Heidi Biggs"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000120974281 The Pennsylvania State University""]}, {""name"": ""Tyler Fox"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122986657 University of Washington""]}, {""name"": ""Phillip Thurtle"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122986657 University of Washington""]}, {""name"": ""Audrey Desjardins"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000122986657 University of Washington""]}]","[""10.1080/00043125.2020.1717910"", ""10.22439/jba.v7i2.5607"", ""10.1353/aq.2014.0047"", ""10.1386/adch_00028_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Education', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

All the four factors have a positively correlated impact on the government’s trust decision-making. The structural equation path analysis shows that the most important factor affecting the government’s trust decision-making is the trustee’s (private sector) trustworthy characteristics, and the path coefficient is 0.92. The path coefficients of risk perception and the trustor’s trust tendency are 0.83 and 0.74, respectively. The influence of the legal system environment on government trust decision-making is moderate, with a path coefficient of 0.68. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature in two aspects. First, the factors influencing decision-making to government trust in the private sector in PPP projects have been identified. Second, a comprehensive view of the mechanism of government trust in the private sector in PPP projects has been theorized by the SEM method.","[{""name"": ""Huimin Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chenchen Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yongchao Cao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chengyi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/JEDT-05-2020-0189"", ""10.7441/joc.2020.02.01"", ""10.1007/s10964-019-01080-5"", ""10.1080/10967494.2018.1457107"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.06.002"", ""10.1080/0144929X.2010.528029"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000152"", ""10.1111/abac.12080"", ""10.17053/jcc.2007.10.2.003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000558"", ""10.1177/0954405414558730"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2020-0070"", ""10.3846/1648715X.2012.688774"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2012.04.009"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6281.2010.00320.x"", ""10.1016/j.clsr.2012.07.004"", ""10.3390/su11184872"", ""10.1016/j.cptl.2015.08.001"", ""10.1080/0015198X.2019.1575160"", ""10.1515/commun-2012-0005"", ""10.1080/03003930.2012.683864"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000495"", ""10.21581/jts.2018.05.30.2.109"", ""10.1108/JEDT-10-2019-0260"", ""10.15855/swp.2014.41.2.109"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.021"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.212"", ""10.1002/jid.2899"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2015.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.irfa.2016.09.011"", ""10.1108/JEDT-06-2020-0255"", ""10.1108/JEDT-12-2017-0137"", ""10.1177/0149206310373948"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.06.041"", ""10.1037/dev0000069"", ""10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.10.008"", ""10.3846/13923730.2015.1051104"", ""10.2112/SI98-083.1"", ""10.3390/su10082692"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.067"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-12-2017-0132"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000538"", ""10.1089/tmj.2018.0296"", ""10.1108/ECAM-09-2019-0472""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Public Administration']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1204 公共管理学', 0.7465), ('0308 纪检监察学', 0.7083)]]"

Disposing of waste creates problems to environment and increases disposal values. To reduce environmental pollutions and solving disposal problems, several authors in worldwide are carried out research work by partial and complete replacing of natural sand with WFS in concrete mixtures. It is found that WFS can be used for production of structural grade concrete. The mechanical characteristics and flexural properties of RC beams has been reviewed in this paper. From this literature review, it has been noticed that there are improvements in concrete strength properties with WFS. Design/methodology/approach The results of various properties of concrete have been discussed in this review articles such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, SEM micro-structures and flexural strength properties of RC beams. Findings From the literature review, it is found that there is gap of research on flexural behavior of reinforced concrete beam with WFS.

This research was carried out with the idea of ""how to design urban squares as a qualified urban service area?"". For the squares to fulfill their functions and be well-functioning urban services, they should be evaluated in the light of various design criteria. In this study, using AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process), 40 different design criteria were brought together and examined in Kadıköy square in Istanbul. In this context, a multi-criteria design approach has been developed that will enable citizens to spend more of their free time in the squares and to adopt positive feelings in these spaces. By evaluating the research criteria, it was found that 21 criteria were not included in the design process in Kadıköy Square. For this reason, Kadıköy Square is in a low suitability class. The study is seen as a mechanism that shows the unique features of urban squares in the design process and how the squares should be developed in the process of becoming a qualified service area. While studies are emphasizing that the squares in the cities are important open spaces, there are no studies that include concrete criteria that can ensure that the squares are qualified spaces. Bringing together all the criteria related to squares and creating a basis for a multi-criteria design process reveals the value of the study.","[{""name"": ""Elvan Ender Altay"", ""affiliation"": [""Bursa Uludag University, Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Zeynep Pirselimoğlu Batman"", ""affiliation"": [""Bursa Uludag University, Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Sevil Canbolat Acaray"", ""affiliation"": [""Bursa Uludag University, Turkey""]}]","[""10.29048/makufebed.792151"", ""10.24011/barofd.595758"", ""10.24011/barofd.978210"", ""10.47886/9781934874011.ch34"", ""10.1002/col.22348"", ""10.4324/9781315158457"", ""10.1016/s0169-2046(03)00114-2"", ""10.1177/0885412210364502"", ""10.3828/tpr.51.1.f3714335ku0x98r2"", ""10.20488/sanattasarim.970784"", ""10.33439/ergonomi.479502"", ""10.1007/s10457-018-0191-0"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126969"", ""10.1108/ohi-04-2019-b0010"", ""10.1108/978-1-80071-737-420221003"", ""10.1177/0013916515626546"", ""10.1057/s41289-020-00147-1"", ""10.1057/s41289-020-00113-x"", ""10.1287/mnsc.32.7.841"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.250-253.3328"", ""10.1080/01944360008976106"", ""10.1016/s0272-4944(05)80219-1"", ""10.4324/9780203469521_chapter_8"", ""10.5505/megaron.2016.42650"", ""10.1016/b978-044450159-2/50002-0"", ""10.1063/1.5041129"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.357-360.2134"", ""10.1016/s0304-3800(00)00209-x"", ""10.3329/bjb.v50i2.54083"", ""10.2112/si103-219.1""]","['Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Gender Studies', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

Further to a pilot iteration, a cohort of undergraduate art students engaged with an immersive, inclusive arts curriculum informed by critical disability studies. Students’ perceptions and attitudes about disability were recorded at the outset and conclusion of the pedagogical project, through a qualitative questionnaire. Thematic analysis was employed to surface patterns in the cohort’s responses at both points in their learning journey. While the findings evidenced the anticipated shift from individualized perspectives about disability to an increasingly social, interactional perspective, the full extent of the medicalized gaze and internalized ableism at the outset of the study was unanticipated. This realization has been influential in developing the pedagogical approach and the framing of the content taught, and has exemplified both the potential and the need to learn about disability, disablement and diversity through art education.","[{""name"": ""Beth Pickard"", ""affiliation"": [""ISNI: 0000000419369035 University of South Wales""]}]","[""10.1177/0741932510362200"", ""10.1080/15017419.2013.835278"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1080/09687599.2018.1455627"", ""10.1080/00393541.2016.1133191"", ""10.1080/02674649266780261"", ""10.1086/423352"", ""10.1080/09687599.2019.1566889"", ""10.1016/j.aip.2013.05.007"", ""10.1080/00393541.2018.1476954"", ""10.3102/00346543070001025"", ""10.1177/0255761417703782"", ""10.1386/eta.11.3.421_1"", ""10.1111/jade.12052"", ""10.1386/eta_00014_1"", ""10.4135/9781412976251.n24"", ""10.1386/jaac.1.1.69_1"", ""10.1080/09687599.2017.1392929"", ""10.1386/jaah.7.3.347_1"", ""10.1080/13562510600874169"", ""10.1080/00043125.2015.11519309"", ""10.1017/S0265052506060043"", ""10.1386/adch_00036_1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Shifting from monocultural planting blocks to naturalistic plant communities,"The field of landscape architecture is currently undergoing a notable transformation in planting design styles, driven by the imperative to create resilient and sustainable landscapes capable of adapting to climate change. New approaches to planting design have become a fundamental element in the regeneration of urban spaces, as evidenced by prominent projects such as the High Line in New York and the Lurie Garden in Chicago. To investigate this phenomenon, this paper conducts a review of the literature, aiming to analyse the historical evolution of planting styles. Furthermore, this paper presents a series of compelling case studies that exemplify the successful regeneration of public urban spaces through the implementation of carefully designed plant communities. These case studies illustrate noteworthy projects carried out in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Russia, highlighting the positive impact of designed plant communities on urban landscapes. Drawing upon the findings from the literature review and case studies, this paper concludes by discussing future directions and current issues in planting design.","[{""name"": ""Alessio Russo"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Environmental Science'],"['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)]]"

A case study shows how visually‐rich GFVs were developed in a practice‐based design studio subject where learners were required to work in teams and independently calibrate an ability to form judgements on the qualities of their own work. Breaking away from traditional models of individual written feedback, students were instead provided with holistic reviews of project outcomes in a GFV format. Assessment examples were presented from across the cohort with the goal of encouraging open discussion and self‐reflection on studio practice. GFVs supported learning processes through three key characteristics: information richness, group learning and sharing, and formative engagement. What differentiated this approach from previous studies was the focus on audio‐visual group delivery to enhance feedback's richness. By replicating an in‐class group critique session, GFVs allowed commonly summative assessment stages to be seen as formative. This study contributes to existing literature through an application framework that may be used by design educators who are seeking to implement GFV methods within their own studio teaching practice.","[{""name"": ""Kylie Brown"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ilya Fridman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/15512169.2015.1063433"", ""10.1007/s11423-015-9367-8"", ""10.1111/tct.12345"", ""10.1080/02602930801895786"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.08.025"", ""10.1111/1468-5949.00109"", ""10.1287/mnsc.32.5.554"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17727-4_124-1"", ""10.1080/02602930600896498"", ""10.3102/003465430298487"", ""10.14742/ajet.1878"", ""10.1007/s10734-012-9514-7"", ""10.1080/08923647.2012.689166"", ""10.1080/02602931003786559"", ""10.1080/08923647.2016.1187472"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2729.2005.00117.x""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Education', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0401 教育学', 0.765), ('0705 地理学', 0.7447)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

This article explores the role of boundaries: (1) through the transformation of the lilong form in Shanghai by means of a case study of the Guizhou lilong block and (2) through the extension of the methodology of morphological study. In the urbanization of China, the lilong form tracks successive organizational shifts in society. Over one hundred years, the micro-scale changes of boundaries transformed the morphology of the Guizhou lilong block from a single-family residence to a mass housing block. Accordingly, the morphological study of the boundaries in Guizhou lilong block shows how its form was changed by changing regulations applied to it as well as its changing communities. This article uses two-dimensional drawings to investigate the change of boundaries over time extending the Conzen tradition and the understanding of how the social system defines the urban form. Consequently, this article makes an argument for understanding the effect on boundaries of both the conflict and the cooperation between the authorities and the inhabitants in a morphological study following the Conzen School.","[{""name"": ""Yuqi Zhai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ming Tong"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.51347/jum.v2i2.3881"", ""10.2307/621094"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9493.2007.00288.x"", ""10.51347/jum.v18i1.3993"", ""10.51347/jum.v13i2.3949"", ""10.51347/jum.v15i1.3958"", ""10.51347/jum.v1i1.4047"", ""10.51347/jum.v5i2.3896"", ""10.51347/jum.v20i2.4060"", ""10.1191/0309132506ph611oa"", ""10.1068/b39097"", ""10.1080/10464883.1992.10734533"", ""10.1080/026730303042000331754"", ""10.1177/0042098011427188""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Building and Construction', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

Design/methodology/approach Data for the study was collected through a Web-based, semistructured questionnaire. The responses of 62 construction practitioners were analyzed using a hierarchical linear regression model. The model consists of 16 independent variables, three control variables (organization size, organization type and project size), one moderator (adoption level of emerging technologies) and three dependent variables (project time, project cost and project quality). Findings The study confirms the negative significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of construction projects. It also identifies the significant moderating effects of emerging technologies in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on construction projects. Further, it shows a significant increase in the application of emerging technologies in construction projects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the findings related to the moderating impact of the technology, this study provides a clear set of recommendations for construction firms, public sector and research community in combating the unavoidable situation similar to the COVID-19 pandemic in the future. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to identify the moderating role of technology on the impact of COVID-19 on the performance of the construction sector in Pakistan. The findings can also be used for the construction sectors of other developing countries.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Ayat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sheheryar Mohsin Qureshi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Malikah Malikah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Changwook Kang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/jedt-11-2020-0476"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.09.006"", ""10.3390/ijerph18041559"", ""10.1108/jfm-08-2020-0061"", ""10.9734/sajsse/2020/v8i430222"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002314"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-11-2020-0349"", ""10.1073/pnas.2006991117"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2007.12.001"", ""10.1177/875697280403500407"", ""10.37624/IJERT/13.5.2020.828-830"", ""10.21315/mjms2018.25.6.9"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001353"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102182"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2021"", ""10.3390/buildings12040489"", ""10.25046/aj0505119"", ""10.1051/shsconf/20184400033"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.01.004"", ""10.36941/mjss-2020-0047"", ""10.3846/1648715X.2005.9637528"", ""10.1207/s15327906mbr2603_7"", ""10.1002/pmj.20137"", ""10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.032"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0229345"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.08.027"", ""10.1177/875697280503600403"", ""10.1007/s12205-020-0188-x"", ""10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.008"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107777"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.119962"", ""10.6106/JCEPM.2016.12.4.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2021.108075"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0236562"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2013.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.04.018"", ""10.1108/ijlss-09-2020-0149"", ""10.3390/economies6010016"", ""10.1177/1525822X10379795"", ""10.1061/9780784483541.039"", ""10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102192"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000562"", ""10.1108/IJMPB-09-2017-0107"", ""10.1063/1.4965067"", ""10.1177/1087724x20969164"", ""10.1108/jedt-12-2020-0481"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/202021002005"", ""10.1080/1540496X.2020.1785863"", ""10.1108/ecam-09-2020-0719"", ""10.1002/hfm.20882"", ""10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00123-9"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001719"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2008.03.004"", ""10.20982/tqmp.08.1.p052""]","['Engineering', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Decision Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

The premise of the revalidation activity and the historical context of the course are briefly encapsulated, before engaging with theoretical frameworks at the forefront of contemporary Participatory Arts practice. This includes an initial focus on the relevance of Critical Disability Studies to Participatory Arts education, followed by exploration of the contrasting approaches of Socially Engaged Art practice, Inclusive Arts practice, Participatory Arts practice, Arts in Health and Arts Therapies. The challenge of defining a diverse practice which draws from such contrasting perspectives is further explored in relation to the challenge of working on the boundary between artistic and therapeutic practice. Geographical context is considered, drawing from the Welsh evidence base to inform culturally relevant provision. Curriculum design is reviewed in relation to experiential learning and inclusive practice literature, as well as relevant higher education policies. Upon briefly summarising the revalidated curriculum, a critical discussion around the future of the training and the discipline more broadly is developed, considering the contribution of the critical review and focus groups facilitated as part of this revalidation activity. It is hoped that this discussion will further nurture and challenge educators, students and practitioners in this exciting area of evolving, contemporary practice.","[{""name"": ""Beth Pickard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2011.01671.x"", ""10.1080/01944366908977225"", ""10.1080/08856257.2012.742748"", ""10.1002/dhe.30435"", ""10.1080/14714787.2013.827486"", ""10.18848/978-1-61229-566-4/CGP"", ""10.1111/jade.12047"", ""10.5040/9781474258395.ch-005"", ""10.18061/dsq.v34i1.3288"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198792079.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1474022214552197"", ""10.1111/opn.12186"", ""10.4324/9781315732558"", ""10.1080/14606925.2017.1352721"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2014.01778.x"", ""10.1007/978-94-6209-551-9"", ""10.1080/09687590025766"", ""10.1177/0255761417703782"", ""10.1177/107429561602500105"", ""10.1080/01596306.2010.504368"", ""10.1177/1474022214561759"", ""10.1108/HESWBL-07-2016-0052"", ""10.1136/jmh.2009.001792"", ""10.1080/0305764X.2014.936825"", ""10.1111/jade.12052"", ""10.1386/ijcm.3.3.331_1"", ""10.1080/03075079.2014.966069"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.141"", ""10.1386/jaah.7.3.347_1"", ""10.1386/adch.13.2.189_1"", ""10.1177/0022487101052002003"", ""10.1002/dys.211""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

This project uses qualitative narrative analysis to deconstruct the life stories of university‐level art students, to examine formative processes underlying selective artistic self‐identification, and to discern how dispositions developed in earlier experiences impact student engagement, performance and motivation at the university level. Research findings indicate students‐as‐artist identities develop along two distinct dramaturgical positions and emphasise the importance of mentor relationships, student‐choice, open exploration, and environmental support to the development of emerging student‐as‐art identities. The researcher reviews literature broadly supporting an examination of selective self‐identification, outlines methods used to deconstruct the life stories of university‐level art students, examines evidence of emerging patterns in the data, and concludes with a short discussion of how findings of this project impact the teacher’s role in corroborating selective artistic self‐identification in students.","[{""name"": ""Justin Makemson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1319791"", ""10.1080/00043125.2010.11519078"", ""10.1177/0950017005051280"", ""10.1080/00043125.2010.11519061"", ""10.1007/s10964-006-9110-1"", ""10.1037/e533602009-029"", ""10.4135/9781412984584"", ""10.1207/s15327884mca0503_3"", ""10.22555/joeed.v5i1.2046"", ""10.1111/j.1476-8070.2004.00390.x"", ""10.1086/493816"", ""10.4324/9780203961407"", ""10.2190/HD0A-N15L-RTFH-2DU8"", ""10.1207/s1532706xid0501_5"", ""10.3102/00346543052001123"", ""10.1080/00043125.2013.11519218"", ""10.1177/003172171409500606"", ""10.1023/B:EDPR.0000034022.16470.f3"", ""10.1080/00043125.2011.11519106"", ""10.1075/jnlh.7.17int"", ""10.1111/jade.12167"", ""10.1080/15283488.2018.1523730"", ""10.1075/jnlh.7.49som"", ""10.1075/jnlh.7.02nar"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2014.01.001"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224"", ""10.1037/0022-0663.88.3.461"", ""10.1353/een.2003.0013"", ""10.1207/S1532706XID0204_03"", ""10.3102/00346543046003407"", ""10.1016/S0740-8188(03)00051-3"", ""10.1007/0-306-47511-1_9""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Design/methodology/approach A case study was performed using multiple data gathering approaches. The project cultures of three projects not applying the Last-Planner-System were compared with three projects that apply the Last-Planner-System. In total, 30 participants were involved in the study. Semi-structured interviews were held and analysed by applying qualitative content analysis. Also, the “organizational culture assessment instrument”, which belongs to the “competing values framework”, was used by means of an online survey. Findings The Last-Planner-System leads to increased levels of mutual understanding and control about the tasks and issues of the other parties. This detailed overview leads towards a more distinguished evaluation of the trustworthiness of individuals. This does not necessarily lead to a partnering project culture. Originality/value The contribution to research is that higher levels of transparency and mutual understanding do not necessarily lead to a high level of trust. Rather, transparency could be seen as a controlling mechanism that leads to better-founded estimations about the trustworthiness of others in the project.","[{""name"": ""Gunnar Jürgen Lühr"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marian Bosch-Rekveldt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mladen Radujković"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.04.001"", ""10.1108/ECAM-07-2015-0109"", ""10.1108/JEDT-08-2010-0057"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000606"", ""10.1057/kmrp.2012.62"", ""10.1177/1077800405284363"", ""10.1080/15710880412331289926"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2019.12.199"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(03)00031-0"", ""10.2307/258792"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(01)00025-4"", ""10.1080/01446190500040026"", ""10.1108/JEDT-03-2019-0052"", ""10.1002/pmj.21289""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Communication']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7528), ('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7451)]]"

With a rather limited scope of sources available for reliable images of “real,” vernacular home environments, I advocate for the use of forensic photography and files in interior design historical research to broaden our image and understanding of such modes of living. As a case study, I examine, by close inspection and visual analysis, 40 crime cases from the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and East–Flanders, recorded between 1929 and 1937, containing interior photographs, floor plans, and judicial reports. The sample spans different social strata and building types, living circumstances, and locations—urban, suburban, and rural, demonstrating how many of the people in that era lived in old(er) houses, deprived of the newest sanitary, heating, and lighting amenities. It attests to the passing down over generations of rugs, furniture, utensils and decorative objects, and the randomness of their presence, with traces of gradual modernization, from washing machines to radios, club seats, and fashionable wallpapers. Forensic photographs offer a nonstaged representation of reality. Thus, they provide a reality check, showing how mainstream interiors were really used and how they evolved over a period of time.","[{""name"": ""Marjan Sterckx"", ""affiliation"": [""Ghent University, Belgium""]}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Architecture', 'Finance', 'Conservation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0813 建筑学', 0.7506), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7274)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

They represent a source of innovation to design alternative configurations and rethink established norms of urban and social standards. This article looks at the urban landscape of the city of Singapore through infrastructural systems instead of individual design masterpieces, focusing on the urban corridor defined by the connection of Changi Airport, East Coast Parkway (ECP), and Marina Bay as a single urban entity, unified by a visual and experiential choreography. At a time of intense global competition in the aviation industry, Changi has deployed new strategies to sustain its reputation as an innovative transportation hub. The leg between Changi Airport and Marina Bay is an integral part of Singapore, experienced by the majority of its annual visitors arriving in the city-state. The 19-kilometre route, a major infrastructural project begun in the 1970s and still in progress, is a highly landscaped and scenic artery of the island, through which the airport has injected its hyper-urbanism into the city. While conveying the history of the developments of the Corridor, we consider the soft power strategies used by the city state to develop a form of transnational elite urbanism based on leisure and recreation, where urban planning, design, and green infrastructure play a key role. We reflect on the global and local dimension of Singapore, discussing how the ECP corridor reveals only one side of the city’s double character.On the one hand, this article critically analyses the rhetorical use of landscaping ingrained in the Corridor to attract foreign investment and tourism, where the artificialisation of green interventions has overwritten the presence of the native vegetation and morphology. On the other hand, we reflect on the less evident but nonetheless split that the Corridor has generated between the city’s southern residential areas and foreshore. While cutting through the urban tissue of part of the island seamlessly and without interruption, the Corridor does in fact separate out substantial residential areas, turning Singapore successful green strategies into a form of urban injustice. The twofold nature of the corridor – at the same time, that of the ‘connector’ and ‘divider’ – thus reflects Singapore’s intrinsic ambiguity: its manifestation of global ambitions set against its local realities. This article unpacks the planning mechanisms used to design this development, including the land reclamation powers of the state and the government land sales programme. It also discusses the strategies and choices underpinning the urban sequence of the ECP’s infrastructural nodes, from the Jewel (2019) to the Conservatories (2012). Drawing on official documentation from Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), field research, and using a multidisciplinary lens, this article interpolates architectural and planning studies with insights gleaned by onsite investigation.","[{""name"": ""Silvia Micheli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Johanna Brugman"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1111/jade.12471,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION,1305 Design; 0401 Education,Teachers Curating Virtual Exhibitions for Learning Visual Arts: A Study of Impact and Effectiveness,"AbstractAlthough visual arts teachers have free access to high quality online artwork images offering them immense teaching resources, making meaningful use of them remains a pedagogical challenge. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, the transition from face‐to‐face to online teaching caused an immediate need for teachers to enhance their digital competencies and technological capability for planning and delivering a blended art curriculum. Herein, I propose a ‘teacher‐curator pedagogy’ via a study in six primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong to assess its effectiveness. The study took place in the academic year of 2021‐22 with 331 student participants. The proposed pedagogy puts visual arts teachers in the role of ‘digital curators’ who create virtual exhibitions for teaching art appreciation and artmaking. This paper addresses the theoretical framework, implementation strategies, and the results of the study highlighting its effectiveness, impact and limitations on teaching when using teacher‐curated virtual exhibitions in both physical and virtual learning contexts. It was found that the technological capacity and confidence of the teacher participants was enhanced through the use of online resources and virtual exhibition tools. Making use of the 3D presentation of exhibits in themes and context through digital content curation, the teachers engaged students with deep interaction through the blending of online and face‐to‐face teaching. However, the proposed pedagogy was limited by the high demand of training and preparation work, hardware and software support, and difficulties in assessing and monitoring learning beyond class.","[{""name"": ""Cheung‐On Tam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Claire Ka‐Yan Hui"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-981-15-9861-6_7"", ""10.1111/bjet.12771"", ""10.1386/vi.6.1.23_1"", ""10.1080/02763877.2020.1776191"", ""10.1080/17439760.2016.1262613"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-8271-9.ch009"", ""10.46504/10201501de"", ""10.12948/issn14531305/18.1.2014.09"", ""10.24059/olj.v21i3.1232"", ""10.4324/9780429319501-8"", ""10.1080/15391523.2019.1586601"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-8271-9.ch004"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00900.x"", ""10.1111/bjet.13106"", ""10.1080/10598650.2013.11510759"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-65291-3_26"", ""10.1080/14606925.2020.1806580"", ""10.4018/978-1-4666-8271-9.ch010"", ""10.4324/9781315105642"", ""10.3167/armw.2020.080110"", ""10.1111/jade.12380"", ""10.1080/00393541.2009.11518774"", ""10.3138/seminar.57.3.forum001"", ""10.3390/educsci12060410"", ""10.1386/eta.14.3.293_1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

The analysis shows that designers have materialized care on different levels. One level concerns the combination of top-down and bottom-up stakeholder input—in other words, the representation of voices that are not equally equipped with power. By evidence of our research we argue that designers’ main cultural achievement lies in an illustration of a currently changing medical practice with shifting roles for “modern” patients and clinicians. Thus the main outcome of the design process is a re-organization of the relationship between patients and clinicians.","[{""name"": ""Kathrina Dankl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Canan Akoglu"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science']","['Mechanical Engineering', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Museology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Sus escritos han sido casi totalmente ignorados en la literatura académica, quizá porque no encajan dentro de los tópicos habituales en la crítica artística española de la época. Según veremos, este “pensar fuera del marco” no solo tiene que ver con la singularidad de la trayectoria de Campo Alange, sino también con la fragilidad de su posición como mujer intelectual en el contexto del régimen franquista, que proscribía la participación de las mujeres en la esfera pública. Mantenerse alejada de los “grandes debates” de su tiempo era una forma de labrarse un espacio de libertad, así como de iluminar un punto ciego que los críticos hegemónicos no fueron capaces de abordar: el lugar de las mujeres dentro del arte moderno.","[{""name"": ""Patricia Mayayo"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['History'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Por ello, un acercamiento a la vivienda de bajos recursos de estos países permite analizar alternativas a la vivienda actual, que surgen desde la informalidad como respuesta a aquellas preguntas que nos hacemos hoy todos. El siguiente documento describe parte de la investigación llevada a cabo desde la Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil, que analiza las transformaciones físicas y sociales en la vivienda informal consolidada del centro de la ciudad. Las técnicas que se utilizan incluyen el levantamiento planimétrico de casos de estudio, entrevistas a los usuarios y el mapeo del uso de las viviendas a lo largo del día. El análisis se centra en la interacción que se ejerce entre los diferentes núcleos familiares de la casa y sus objetos, llegando así a describir un sistema de transformación y producción de hábitat ligado a los objetos, en donde la vivienda es entendida como un sistema social de objetos y personas en continua interacción y transformación.","[{""name"": ""Ignacio De Teresa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Enrique Mora-Alvarado"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Filiberto Viteri-Chávez"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

10.1108/JEDT-07-2021-0357,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Supporting management of new product development via a novel conceptual model: an interview driven approach,"Purpose This study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the industry practice to guide the formation of support tools with a rigorous theoretical backing. Cross-functional teams are an essential component in new product development (NPD) of complex products to promote comprehensive coverage of product design, marketing, sales, support as well as many other activities of business. Efficient use of teams can allow for greater technical competency coverage, increased creativity, reduced development times and greater consideration of ideas from a variety of stakeholders. While academics continually aspire to propose methods for improved team composition, there exists a gap between research directions and applications found within industry practice. Design/methodology/approach Through interviewing product development managers working across a variety of industries, this paper investigates the common practices of team utilization in an organizational setting. Following these interviews, this paper proposes a conceptual two-dimensional management support model aggregating the primary drivers of team success and providing direction to systematically address features of team management and composition. Findings Based on this work, product managers are recommended to continually address the positioning of members throughout the entire NPD process. In the early stages, individuals are to be placed to work on project components with explicit consideration toward the perceived complexity of tasks and individual competency. Throughout the development process, individuals’ positions vary based on new information while continued emphasis is placed on maintaining a shared understanding. Originality/value Bridging the gap between theory and application within product development teams is a necessary step toward improved product develop. Industrial settings require practical solutions that can be applied economically and efficiently within their organization. Theoretical reflections postulated by academia support improved team design; however, to achieve true success, they must be applicable when considering product development.","[{""name"": ""Zachary Ball"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonathan Cagan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kenneth Kotovsky"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/17260530710746579"", ""10.1080/09544820600752740"", ""10.1016/S0142-694X(99)00017-4"", ""10.1017/dsj.2017.26"", ""10.2753/MIS0742-1222310106"", ""10.1108/JEDT-07-2019-0170"", ""10.1177/0149206318818718"", ""10.1080/09544828.2018.1520971"", ""10.1109/17.946528"", ""10.1108/17260530810918289"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2009.02.019"", ""10.1037/apl0000159"", ""10.1016/0007-6813(90)90040-I"", ""10.5437/08956308X5606963"", ""10.1080/08956308.2017.1255057"", ""10.1111/1540-5885.320071"", ""10.1111/1540-5885.430169"", ""10.1016/0019-8501(87)90029-0"", ""10.1016/0019-8501(88)90008-9"", ""10.1111/1540-5885.1250374"", ""10.1111/jpim.12314"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2004.10.003"", ""10.1115/1.1711818"", ""10.1111/1468-2370.00075"", ""10.1002/j.2334-5837.1991.tb01484.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9310.1995.tb00919.x"", ""10.1108/17260530810918243"", ""10.1002/hfm.20004"", ""10.1080/22054952.2010.11464039"", ""10.1037/0021-9010.85.2.273"", ""10.1177/0149206309356804"", ""10.1108/JEDT-04-2016-0028"", ""10.1002/per.588"", ""10.1016/S0923-4748(01)00045-5"", ""10.1016/j.destud.2004.09.004"", ""10.1111/j.1540-5885.2012.00940.x"", ""10.1109/TEM.1981.6448589"", ""10.1037/h0022100"", ""10.1080/09544828.2010.524886"", ""10.1080/13594320143000573"", ""10.1016/S1047-8310(01)00049-9"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2012.12.015"", ""10.1287/mnsc.36.7.867""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Strategy and Management', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1108/JEDT-06-2022-0290,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Strategies to promote the acceptance of sandbag building technology for sustainable and affordable housing delivery: the South African case,"Purpose Sandbag building technologies (SBTs) have been offered as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative building technology (ABT) capable of accelerating house construction in South Africa, but its acceptance remains low. However, knowledge about how to effectively improve SBT social acceptance is limited. This study aims to develop and prioritise SBT social acceptability strategies towards providing a comprehensive framework for the successful deployment and widespread adoption of sandbag technology. Design/methodology/approach This study used a quantitative research strategy that included a literature review and a structured questionnaire survey of 228 ABT professionals and stakeholders in the South African housing industry. The study statistically analysed 13 strategies for the social acceptance of SBT. Findings The analysis showed that the top three strategies include the availability of sandbag demonstration projects in all provinces, the approval of a sandbag building code and the availability of standard design methods for earthbags. A factor analysis clustered the 13 strategies into Stakeholders integration and policy formation, Effective education and knowledge sharing and Grassroots advocacy and incentives. Practical implications The current study’s findings provide a broad framework for the effective implementation and wide acceptance of sandbag technology in housing projects. It offered certain best practices that policymakers and practitioners might use to promote ABT and SBT societal acceptability.

10.1108/JEDT-12-2019-0345,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY,1305 Design,Status of lean construction implementation among small and medium building contractors (SMBCs) in Ghana,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to ascertain the extent to which the practices of small and medium building contractors (SMBCs) conform to lean construction (LC) principles. Ultimately, practical results encourage a discourse on the true potentials and challenges to the holistic uptake of LC principles in the Ghanaian construction industry.Design/methodology/approachThis research is based on a qualitative case study approach. The data was obtained through face-to-face structured interviews.FindingsAcross the cases, it was realized that there is a low-level application of LC principles among SMBCs. There was no indication that lean concepts were used on a company-wide basis in the Ghanaian construction industry. Furthermore, the study revealed that the traditional wasteful approach to managing construction projects was still prevalent among the firms.Practical implicationsThis paper uses the 4P model as a foundation for assessing the extent to which the practices of SMBCs conform to LC principles. Practically, the study also created a certain level of awareness among the SMBCs about LC, LC principles and the benefits of the application of these principles within organizations.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the body of knowledge as it uncovers the status of LC implementation among SMBCs in the Ghanaian construction industry. The findings that are presented in this paper can be used as a starting point to disseminate the research and practice of LC among SMBCs.","[{""name"": ""Emmanuel Nsiah Ankomah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joshua Ayarkwa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kofi Agyekum"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1108/17410380610662889"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163505"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001654"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2009.09.001"", ""10.1080/15623599.2013.10773207"", ""10.1080/15623599.2015.1012139"", ""10.1108/ci-11-2015-0065"", ""10.1108/01443570410558049"", ""10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0000218"", ""10.1080/09613210500491480"", ""10.1108/17410391011019750"", ""10.1080/00207543.2019.1566659"", ""10.1016/S0263-7863(01)00059-X"", ""10.21315/jcdc2019.24.1.3"", ""10.1108/CI-08-2012-0045"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0742-597X(2006)22:4(168)"", ""10.1108/ECAM-03-2018-0136"", ""10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.019"", ""10.1016/j.ijproman.2017.10.004"", ""10.1108/BEPAM-06-2015-0023""]","['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
