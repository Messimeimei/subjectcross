As radiofrequency EMFs at sufficiently high power levels can adversely affect health, ICNIRP published Guidelines in 1998 for human exposure to time-varying EMFs up to 300 GHz, which included the radiofrequency EMF spectrum. Since that time, there has been a considerable body of science further addressing the relation between radiofrequency EMFs and adverse health outcomes, as well as significant developments in the technologies that use radiofrequency EMFs. Accordingly, ICNIRP has updated the radiofrequency EMF part of the 1998 Guidelines. This document presents these revised Guidelines, which provide protection for humans from exposure to EMFs from 100 kHz to 300 GHz.",[],"[""10.1097/AJP.0b013e31802b4f80"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/58/15/5153"", ""10.1016/j.autneu.2016.01.001"", ""10.1097/01.ajp.0000154048.68273.d8"", ""10.1080/0265673031000119006"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a006539"", ""10.1080/0265673021000039628"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/59/13/3297"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000671"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000571"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883733"", ""10.1088/1361-6560/aa5f21"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/58/4/903"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181aff9db"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181f06c86"", ""10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.v38.i3.20"", ""10.1002/bem.20652"", ""10.1093/rpd/nct311"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2878149"", ""10.1002/bem.20597"", ""10.1088/1361-6560/aa81fe"", ""10.1007/978-1-59745-194-9_1"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2605.1995.tb00408.x"", ""10.1088/1361-6560/aa5251"", ""10.1016/0022-4375(83)90021-X"", ""10.1080/07420520701420709"", ""10.1088/1361-6560/aa81fc"", ""10.1097/01.HP.0000257856.83294.3e"", ""10.1115/1.4002360"", ""10.1186/s12938-018-0434-3"", ""10.1242/jeb.004481"", ""10.1007/s00421-017-3592-2"", ""10.1007/s00330-013-2825-y"", ""10.1097/00004032-200003000-00003"", ""10.3109/02656736.2010.534527""]","['Engineering', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Health Professions']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Speech and Hearing', 'Biophysics']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7179), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7089)]]"

Their property of providing semantically structured information has brought important possible solutions for many tasks including question answering, recommendation and information retrieval, and is considered to offer great promise for building more intelligent machines by many researchers. Although knowledge graphs have already supported multiple “Big Data” applications in all sorts of commercial and scientific domains since Google coined this term in 2012, there was no previous study give a systemically review of the application of knowledge graphs. Therefore, unlike other related work which focuses on the construction techniques of knowledge graphs, this present paper aims at providing a first survey on these applications stemming from different domains. This paper also points out that while important advancements of applying knowledge graphs’ great ability of providing semantically structured information into specific domains have been made in recent years, several aspects still remain to be explored.","[{""name"": ""Xiaohan Zou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2009.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2008.06.001"", ""10.1609/aimag.v31i3.2303"", ""10.1145/3269206.3271739"", ""10.1007/s10791-015-9267-x"", ""10.18653/v1/P18-1223"", ""10.1155/2017/2858423"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-05778-z"", ""10.1016/j.eng.2018.01.004"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2019.153"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2015.12.004"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0128193"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2839607"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912627"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12048"", ""10.1155/2017/5072427"", ""10.1016/j.websem.2018.07.001""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

The emission of gases and fuel efficiency of vehicles are two important issues. The best way to improve the fuel efficiency is to decrease the weight of vehicle parts. Research and development played an important role in lightweight materials for decreasing cost, increasing ability to be recycled, enabling their integration into vehicles, and maximizing their fuel economy efficacy. There arises a need for developing a novel generation of materials that will combine both weight reduction and safety issues. The application of carbon fibre reinforced plastic material offers the best lightweight potential to realize lightweight concepts. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic has outstanding specific stiffness, specific strength, and fatigue properties compared to commonly used metals. In automotive industry, the advantages of carbon fibre reinforced plastic are reduction in weight, part integration and reduction, crashworthiness, durability, toughness, and aesthetic appealing. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic is a composite material that has been used extensively in various applications such as aerospace industry, sports equipment, oil and gas industry, and automotive industry. Keeping in view the aforementioned advantages of carbon fibre reinforced plastic, the authors have presented a brief review on carbon fibre for automotive industrial applications.","[{""name"": ""H Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A A Markina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M V Porotnikov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.21272/jes.2017.4(2).f8"", ""10.13005/msri/140109"", ""10.1002/app.20336"", ""10.1140/epjp/i2015-15022-8"", ""10.1016/S0034-3617(03)00715-X"", ""10.1016/j.tws.2013.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.addma.2019.100962"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.10.067"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.10.038"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.06.028"", ""10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2019.105115"", ""10.4271/2012-01-0730"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.1015"", ""10.1016/S0034-3617(10)70173-9""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

A good classification not only gives generally accepted and understandable names to similar rocks but also links the bulk chemical composition to the stoichiometry of the constituent minerals and, potentially, also to the likely source, magmatic evolution and tectonic setting. The ‘ideal’ granitoid classification should be based on chemical criteria amenable to an objective treatment. Statistical analysis helps to identify the most discriminant variables. The key properties are (1) acidity/maficity, (2) alkalinity (balance of Na + K v. Ca), (3) aluminosity (balance of Al v. Ca, Na and K), (4) Fe/Mg balance and (5) Na/K balance and K contents at the given SiO 2 level. These are used by successful classifications, e.g. the I/S dichotomy is based mainly on aluminosity, while the Frost et al. (2001; ‘A geochemical classification for granitic rocks', Journal of Petrology , 42 , 2033–2048, https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033 ) classification includes all but Na/K. Even though it is commonplace to use weight percentages of oxides, we suggest that a better strategy is to employ simple atomic parameters (e.g. millications-based) that can be directly linked to modal proportions and compositions/crystal structure of individual rock-forming minerals. This facilitates a petrological interpretation, which, in turn, can be related to petrogenesis and, ultimately, to likely tectonic setting(s).","[{""name"": ""Bernard Bonin"", ""affiliation"": [""UMR

Moreover, according to the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death, the method of radiation-induced cell death, usually classified as interphase and proliferative death, undergoes more detailed classifications oriented by its molecular mechanism. Elaborating its mode and molecular mechanism is crucial for the protection and treatment of radiation injury, as well as the radiotherapy and recovery of tumors. Varying with the changes of the radiation dose and the environment, the diverse targets and pathways of ionizing radiation result in various cell deaths. This review focuses on classifications of radiation-induced cell death and its molecular mechanism. We also examine the main characteristics of ionizing radiation-induced cell death. The modes of radiation-induced cell death can be classified as apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy-dependent cell death, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, immunogenic cell death, and non-lethal processes. Once the dose is high enough, radiation effects mostly appear as destructiveness (“destructiveness” is used to describe a situation in which cells do not have the opportunity to undergo a routine death process, in which case high-dose radiation works like a physical attack). This breaks up or even shatters cells, making it difficult to find responses of the cell itself. Due to diversities concerning cell phenotypes, phases of cell cycle, radiation dose, and even cellular subregions, various methods of cell death occur, which are difficult to identify and classify. Additionally, the existence of common initial activation and signaling molecules among all kinds of cell deaths, as well as sophisticated crossways in cellular molecules, makes it more laborious to distinguish and classify various cell deaths.","[{""name"": ""Yunfei Jiao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fangyu Cao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hu Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Radiation Medicine, Faculty of Naval Medicine, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.""]}]","[""10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110134"", ""10.1038/sj.embor.7400962"", ""10.1002/jcb.24694"", ""10.3109/10715762.2015.1129534"", ""10.1016/j.det.2007.06.010"", ""10.1007/s13277-015-4621-6"", ""10.1038/s41418-018-0252-y"", ""10.4161/cc.6.3.3834"", ""10.1080/01926230701320337"", ""10.1007/s00259-003-1177-2"", ""10.1007/s13277-010-0042-8"", ""10.1038/s41418-017-0012-4"", ""10.1016/j.semcdb.2014.02.006"", ""10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-16-0197"", ""10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-13-0115"", ""10.1016/j.semradonc.2014.07.005"", ""10.1002/path.2591"", ""10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.09.043"", ""10.1080/15384101.2015.1068479"", ""10.1016/j.envpol.2019.05.026"", ""10.1038/bjc.1972.33"", ""10.1667/RR1585.1"", ""10.1038/onc.2010.74"", ""10.1016/j.ccr.2013.09.014"", ""10.3390/ijms20040905"", ""10.1080/15384101.2015.1068479"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-0602-4_2"", ""10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.08.165"", ""10.1038/cddis.2016.460"", ""10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81589-5"", ""10.1182/blood-2017-07-746396"", ""10.1038/ncomms7823"", ""10.1023/A:1015289521275"", ""10.1038/ncb1909"", ""10.1054/drup.2001.0213"", ""10.1016/j.gene.2019.144323"", ""10.1016/j.tibs.2016.10.004"", ""10.1038/ncomms15618"", ""10.1038/nrm3115"", ""10.1038/sj.onc.1207232"", ""10.1080/09553002.2016.1254833"", ""10.1021/acschembio.9b00939"", ""10.1016/j.febslet.2012.12.027"", ""10.1007/s00018-016-2202-5"", ""10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105299""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Medicine']","['Epidemiology', 'Molecular Biology']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)]]"

Previous investigations showed that the underprediction was primarily related to nonlinear hydrodynamic loading, so two new validation campaigns were performed to separately examine the different hydrodynamic load components. In this paper, we validate a variety of tools against this new test data, focusing on the ability to accurately model the low-frequency loads on a semisubmersible floater when held fixed under wave excitation and when forced to oscillate in the surge direction. However, it is observed that models providing better load predictions in these two scenarios do not necessarily produce a more accurate motion response in a moored configuration.","[{""name"": ""A N Robertson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Gueydon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E Bachynski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Jonkman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Alarcón"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E Amet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Beardsell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Bonnet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""B Boudet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Brun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Z Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Féron"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Forbush"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Galinos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Galvan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Gilbert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Gómez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""V Harnois"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Haudin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Z Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Le Dreff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Leimeister"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Lemmer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""H Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Mckinnon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""I Mendikoa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Moghtadaei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Netzband"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Oh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Pegalajar-Jurado"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Q Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K Ruehl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Schünemann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""H Shin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Y Si"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Surmont"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Trubat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Qwist"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Wohlfahrt-Laymann"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.10.333"", ""10.1002/we.2377"", ""10.1016/j.marstruc.2019.02.008"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.09.059"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.106605""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"
10.1002/er.6943,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Resilience and sustainable supply chain network design by considering renewable energy,"SummaryNowadays, using renewable energy (RE) is faster growing by each country. The managerial and designer of supply chain network design (SCND) have to plan to apply RE in pillars of supply chain (SC). This research indicates resilience and sustainable SCND by considering RE (RSSCNDRE) for the first time. A two‐stage new robust stochastic optimization is embedded for RSSCNDRE. The first stage locates facility location and RE and the second stage defines flow quantity between SC components. We solve the model by GAMS‐CPLEX solver to locate components of SC and RE. Effects of changing conservative coefficient and demand are investigated and by increasing 20% for conservative coefficient, the cost function increase by 0.5%. Also, when demand is high, activating RE is economically feasible and we cannot buy and supply energy by the government power network and have to supply energy by RE. After activating RE, by increasing 20% for demand, the cost function increases by 6%. We contribute fix‐and‐optimize strategy to define the upper bound for a large‐scale problem. The proposed upper bound for the main model is less than 10% and appropriate for estimating the cost of large‐scale problems. This research suggested to equip SC by RE that SC becomes resilient against demand fluctuation and sustainable energy resource compatible with sustainable development goal (SGD7).","[{""name"": ""Reza Lotfi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Engineering Yazd University  Yazd Iran"", ""Department of Industrial Engineering Behineh Gostar Sanaye Arman  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Bahareh Kargar"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Industrial Engineering Iran University of Science and Technology  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Seyed Hosein Hoseini"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Project and Construction  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Sima Nazari"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Business Management, Zanjan Branch Islamic Azad University  Zanjan Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Soroush Safavi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Engineering Dalhousie University  Halifax Nova Scotia Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Gerhard‐Wilhelm Weber"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Engineering Management Poznan University of Technology  Poznan Poland"", ""Institute of Applied Mathematics (UME), METU  Ankara Turkey""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.033"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-08-2020-0568"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2020.03.011"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.265"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2007.06.056"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2016.02.007"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2017.04.009"", ""10.1080/00207543.2018.1461950"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.130"", ""10.1007/s10479-019-03182-6"", ""10.1504/IJAOM.2019.098525"", ""10.1007/s10479-016-2374-2"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2018.09.052"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04260-3"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115921"", ""10.1080/00207543.2020.1779369"", ""10.3934/naco.2020023"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123199"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125141"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123060"", ""10.1007/s10479-020-03640-6"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2021.107098"", ""10.1002/er.2970"", ""10.1287/mnsc.22.4.455"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2009.08.022"", ""10.4018/IJAL.2017010104"", ""10.1007/s10957-011-9968-2"", ""10.1007/s10100-017-0508-5"", ""10.1002/er.6332""]","['Business, Management and Accounting']","['Strategy and Management', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"

The sequence of S- to I- to A-type granite is repeated at least three times. All the granites are syn-extensional, formed in a dominantly back-arc setting behind a single, stepwise-retreating arc system between 530 and 230 Ma. Peralkaline granites are rare. Systematic S–I–A progressions indicate the progressive dilution of an old crustal component as magmatism evolved from arc (S-type) to proximal back-arc (I-type) to distal back-arc (A-type) magmatism. The alkaline and peralkaline A-type Younger granites of Nigeria were generally hotter and drier than the Lachlan A-type granites and were emplaced into an anhydrous Precambrian basement during intermittent intracontinental rifting. This geodynamic environment contrasts with the distal back-arc setting of the Lachlan A-type granites, where magmatism migrated rapidly across the orogen. Tectonic discrimination diagrams are inappropriate for the Lachlan granites, placing them in the wrong settings. Only the peralkaline Narraburra suite of the Lachlan Orogen fits the genuine ‘within-plate’ setting of the Nigerian A-type granites. Such discrimination diagrams require re-evaluation in the light of an improved modern understanding of tectonic processes, particularly the role of extensional tectonism and its geodynamic drivers.","[{""name"": ""William J.

Here, we review the main developments after the first public release of the AMPT source code in 2004 and the corresponding publication that described the physics details of the model at that time. We also discuss possible directions for future developments of the AMPT model to better study the properties of the dense matter created in relativistic collisions of small or large

The primary physics codes of ExaWind are Nalu-Wind and OpenFAST. Nalu-Wind is a wind-focused computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code that is coupled to the whole-turbine simulation code OpenFAST. The ExaWind environment was created under U.S. Department of Energy funding to achieve the highest-fidelity simulations of wind turbines and wind farms to date, with the goal of enabling disruptive changes to turbine and plant design and operation. Innovation will be gleaned through better understanding of the complex flow dynamics in wind farms, including wake evolution and the impact of wakes on downstream turbines and turbulent flow from complex terrain. High-fidelity predictive simulations employ hybrid turbulence models, geometry/boundary-layer-resolving CFD meshes, atmospheric turbulence, nonlinear structural dynamics, and fluid-structure interaction. While there is an emphasis on very high-fidelity simulations (e.g., blade resolved with full fluid-structure coupling), the ExaWind environment supports lower-fidelity modeling capabilities including actuator-line and -disk methods. Important in the development of ExaWind codes is that the codes scale well on today’s largest petascale supercomputers and on the next-generation platforms that will enable exascale computing.","[{""name"": ""M A Sprague"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Ananthan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Vijayakumar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Robinson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/1089014.1089021"", ""10.1142/S0129626414420055"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2018.01.007"", ""10.1175/1520-0469(1984)041<2052:ALESMF>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1002/we.2101"", ""10.5194/wes-2-443-2017"", ""10.2514/2.7555"", ""10.1115/1.1436090"", ""10.1002/we.64"", ""10.1115/1.1624088"", ""10.1002/we.529""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

The first model is an extension of the Park model, which explicitly incorporates turbulence, both the ambient atmospheric turbulence and the turbulence generated in the wake itself. This Turbulence Optimized Park model is better equipped to describe wake recovery over long distances such as between wind farms, where the wake expansion slows down as the turbine-generated turbulence decays. The second model is a first version of a full engineering wind farm blockage model. In the same vein as the wake model it adds blockage contributions from the individual wind turbines to form an aggregated wind farm scale blockage effect that can be incorporated directly into the park power curve and annual energy calculations. The wake model and the blockage model describe downstream and upstream turbine interaction effects, respectively. They are coupled as the outputs of one model are the inputs to the other model and vice versa. We describe how this coupling is achieved through an iterative process. We give early stage examples of the validation of the two models and discuss how they might be further validated and improved in the future.","[{""name"": ""Nicolai Gayle Nygaard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Søren Trads Steen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lina Poulsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesper Grønnegaard Pedersen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/en8065413"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-20389-y"", ""10.5194/wes-5-29-2020"", ""10.3390/rs12030462"", ""10.1002/we.2484"", ""10.3390/en11061609"", ""10.1002/we.2413"", ""10.3390/en10122164"", ""10.1002/we.408"", ""10.1007/s10546-019-00473-0"", ""10.1002/we.1863"", ""10.1002/we.512"", ""10.5194/wes-4-287-2019"", ""10.1016/0167-6105(88)90037-2"", ""10.1002/we.2257""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

We re-examine the prevailing model inferred from this classification that magma-rich margins have excess decompression melting at lithospheric breakup compared with steady-state seafloor spreading, while magma-poor margins have inhibited melting. We investigate the magmatic budget related to lithospheric breakup along two high-resolution long-offset deep reflection seismic profiles across the SE Indian (magma-poor) and Uruguayan (magma-rich) rifted margins. Resolving the magmatic budget is difficult and several interpretations can explain our seismic observations, implying different mechanisms to achieve lithospheric breakup and melt production for each archetype. We show that the Uruguayan and other magma-rich margins may indeed involve excess decompression melting compared with steady-state seafloor spreading but could also be explained by a gradual increase with an early onset relative to crustal breakup. A late onset of decompression melting relative to crustal breakup enables mantle exhumation characteristic of magma-poor margin archetypes (e.g. SE India). Despite different volumes of magmatism, the mechanisms suggested at lithospheric breakup are comparable between both archetypes. Considerations on the timing of decompression melting onset relative to crustal thinning may be more important than the magmatic budget to understand the evolution and variability of rifted margins.","[{""name"": ""Julie Tugend"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg, CNRS-UMR 7516, Université de Strasbourg, 1 rue Blessig, F-67084 Strasbourg Cedex, France"",

The study was conducted taking measurements of deformation features such as fractures and deformation bands on multiple 1D scanlines along fault walls. The resulting datasets are used to plot the frequency distribution of deformation features and to constrain the geometrical width of the damage zone for the studied faults. The damage-zone width of a single fault is constrained by identifying the changes in the slope of cumulative plots made on the frequency data. The cumulative plot further shows high deformation frequency by a steep slope (inner damage zone) and less deformation as a gentle slope (outer damage zone). Statistical distributions of displacement and damage-zone width and their relationship are improved, and show two-slope power-law distributions with a break point at c. 100 m displacement. Bleached sandstones in the studied siliciclastic rocks of Utah are associated with a higher frequency of deformation bands and a wider damage zone compared to the unbleached zone of similar lithology. Fault damage zones in the carbonate rocks of Majella are often host to open fractures (karst), demonstrating that they can also be conductive to fluid flow.","[{""name"": ""A.

10.1088/1361-6498/ac1611,JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 1010 Medical Technology; 1009 Special Medicine; 1004 Public Health and Preventive Medicine; 0830 Environmental Science and Engineering,Keeping the ICRP recommendations fit for purpose,"Abstract The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has embarked on a review and revision of the system of Radiological Protection that will update the 2007 general recommendations in ICRP Publication 103. This is the beginning of a process that will take several years, involving open and transparent engagement with organisations and individuals around the world. While the system is robust and has performed well, it must adapt to address changes in science and society to remain fit for purpose. The aim of this paper is to encourage discussions on which areas of the system might gain the greatest benefit from review, and to initiate collaborative efforts. Increased clarity and consistency are high priorities. The better the system is understood, the more effectively it can be applied, resulting in improved protection and increased harmonisation. Many areas are identified for potential review including: classification of effects, with particular focus on tissue reactions; reformulation of detriment, potentially including non-cancer diseases; re-evaluation of the relationship between detriment and effective dose, and the possibility of defining detriments for males and females of different ages; individual variation in the response to radiation exposure; heritable effects; and effects and risks in non-human biota and ecosystems. Some of the basic concepts are also being considered, including the framework for bringing together protection of people and the environment, incremental improvements to the fundamental principles of justification and optimisation, a broader approach to protection of individuals, and clarification of the exposure situations introduced in 2007. In addition, ICRP is considering identifying where explicit incorporation of the ethical basis of the system would be beneficial, how to better reflect the importance of communications and stakeholder involvement, and further advice on education and training. ICRP invites responses on these and other areas relating to the review of the System of Radiological Protection.","[{""name"": ""C Clement"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W Rühm"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Harrison"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K Applegate"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Cool"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C-M Larsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Cousins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Lochard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Bouffler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K Cho"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Kai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Laurier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Romanov"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0146645314560693"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.03.021"", ""10.1007/s00411-020-00861-y"", ""10.1093/jncimonographs/lgaa010"", ""10.1016/S0074-27402880010-9"", ""10.1177/028418513101200608"", ""10.1016/S0074-27402880013-4"", ""10.1016/S0074-27402880014-6"", ""10.1016/S0074-27402880015-8"", ""10.1016/S0074-27402880017-1"", ""10.1177/ANIA_OS_6_1"", ""10.1177/ANIA_OS_9_1"", ""10.1177/ANIB_1_3"", ""10.1177/ANIB_21_1-3"", ""10.1177/ANIB_33_1-2"", ""10.1177/ANIB_35_4"", ""10.1177/ANIB_36_3"", ""10.1177/ANIB_37_2-4"", ""10.1177/ANIB_38_4-6"", ""10.1177/ANIB_39_2"", ""10.1177/ANIB_39_3"", ""10.1177/ANIB_39_5"", ""10.1177/ANIB_39_6"", ""10.1177/ANIB_41_1-2"", ""10.1177/ANIB_43_1"", ""10.1177/ANIB_43_3"", ""10.1177/ANIB_44_3-4"", ""10.1177/ANIB_45_1"", ""10.1177/ANIB_46_2"", ""10.1177/ANIB_47_1"", ""10.1177/ANIB_48_4"", ""10.1177/ANIB_49_1"", ""10.1177/ANIB_49_4"", ""10.1177/ANIB_50_1"", ""10.1177/ANIB_50_2"", ""10.1016/S0074-27402880011-0"", ""10.1016/S0074-27402880012-2"", ""10.1289/ehp.1204982"", ""10.1016/S2352-3026(18)30092-9"", ""10.1210/jc.2016-3529"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/ab1826"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/aad348"", ""10.1097/hp.0000000000001011"", ""10.1787/6da7e177-en"", ""10.1177/0146645316629336"", ""10.1088/0952-4746/35/4/763"", ""10.1080/09553002.2017.1319090"", ""10.1016/j.envint.2020.106235"", ""10.1177/0146645318756831""]","['Environmental Science', 'Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"

10.2298/NTRP2001042A,NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,A COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN NANO-CADMIUM OXIDE AND LEAD OXIDE REINFORCED IN HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE AS GAMMA RAYS SHIELDING COMPOSITES,"In this work, polymer composites of high density polyethylene reinforced by micro-sized and nanosized cadmium oxide, lead oxide, and a mixture of both with filler weight fraction of 30% were prepared by compression molding technique and characterized by scanning electron microscope. This investigation aims to present a comparative study between cadmium oxide and lead oxide according to their sizes as fillers in high density polyethylene polymeric matrix for gamma-radiation shielding applications. The mass and linear attenuation coefficients of the investigated composites were measured as a function of g-ray energies ranging from 59.53 keV to 1408.01 keV using standard radioactive point sources (241Am, 133Ba, 137Cs, 60Co, and 152Eu). The measurements were made with a narrow beam geometry setup using a well calibrated hyper pure germanium cylindrical detector. The theoretical values of the mass attenuation coefficients were evaluated using the XCOM program database. The experimental results demonstrated that, according to the filler size, cadmium oxide composite is better as a gamma absorber in the energy region less than 81 keV, while lead oxide composite is better in the energy region greater than 81 keV. Moreover, for the same chemical structure and weight fraction of the composite, nano fillers show better attenuation performance than micro fillers in high density polyethylene based radiation shielding material.","[{""name"": ""Gharam Alharshan"", ""affiliation"": [""Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahaman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Dalal Aloraini"", ""affiliation"": [""Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahaman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Elzaher"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Basic and Applied Science, Faculty of Engineering, Arab Academy for Science and Technology, Alexandria, Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Badawi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Mahmoud Alabsy"", ""affiliation"": [""Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Mahmoud Abbas"", ""affiliation"": [""Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmed El-Khatib"", ""affiliation"": [""Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt""]}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)]]"

It utilizes proven HTR-PM reactor and steam generator modules with a thermal power of 250 MWth and power generation of approximately 100 MWe per module. Six modules in parallel, connected to a steam turbine, form a 600-MWe nuclear power plant. In addition, its system configuration in the nuclear island is identical to that of the HTR-PM in which the technical risks are minimized. Under this principle, the HTR-PM600 achieves the same level of inherent safety as the HTR-PM. The concept of a ventilated low-pressure containment (VLPC) is unchanged; however, a large circular VLPC accommodating all six reactor modules is adopted rather than the previous small-cavity-type VLPC, which contains only one module, as defined for the HTR-PM. The layout of the nuclear island and its associated systems refer to single-unit pressurized water reactor (PWR) practices. With this layout, the HTR-PM600 achieves a volume size of the nuclear island that is comparable to a domestic PWR of the same power level. This will be a Generation IV nuclear energy technology that is economically competitive.","[{""name"": ""Zuo-Yi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu-Jie Dong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Qi Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fu Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hai-Tao Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0029-5493(84)90298-X"", ""10.1016/S0029-5493(02)00182-6"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2009.02.023"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00936-5"", ""10.1016/J.ENG.2016.01.020"", ""10.2172/859029"", ""10.1007/s41365-018-0472-3"", ""10.1007/s41365-019-0692-1"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2007.04.001""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

To address this challenge, a national centre of excellence, the HADES Facility, has been established to support research and innovation in High Activity Decommissioning Engineering &amp; Science, as part of the wider network of UK National Nuclear User Facilities. Herein, we describe the development of this user facility, the current status of its capability, and functional equipment specifications. The unique capabilities of the HADES Facility, in the UK academic landscape, are emphasised, including: handling of weighable quantities of 99Tc and transuranics; quantitative electron probe microanalysis of radioactive materials; hot isostatic pressing of radioactive materials; and laboratory-based X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. An example case study of the application of the HADES capability is described, involving thermal treatment of a real radioactive ion exchange resin waste to produce a conceptual vitrified waste form.","[{""name"": ""N C Hyatt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C L Corkhill"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M C Stennett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R J Hand"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L J Gardner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C L Thorpe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1557/adv.2020.44"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2014.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2013.08.019""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemistry']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Inorganic Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0703 化学', 0.7396), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7296)]]"

Archean granites define a continuum of compositions between several end members: (i) magmas that originated by partial melting of a range of crustal sources, from amphibolites to metasediments (‘C-type’ granitoids); and (ii) magmas that formed by partial melting of an enriched mantle source, the most common agent of enrichment being felsic (TTG) melts. Differences in the degree of metasomatism results in different primitive liquids for these ‘M-type’ granitoids. Mixed sources, differentiation and interactions between different melts resulted in a continuous range of compositions, defined by variable proportions of each end member. During the Archean, evolved crustal sources (sediments or felsic crust) and metasomatized mantle sources become increasingly more important, mirroring the progressive maturation of crustal segments and the stabilization of the global tectonic system.","[{""name"": ""Jean-François Moyen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.lithos.2010.07.026"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00103-0"",

Cretaceous third- and fourth-order hothouse sea-level changes, the sequence-stratigraphic framework, are linked to Milankovitch-type climate cycles, especially the longer-period sequence-building bands of 405 kyr and 1.2 myr. In the absence of continental ice sheets during Cretaceous hothouse phases (e.g. Cenomanian–Turonian), growing evidence indicates groundwater-related sea-level cycles: (1) the existence of Milankovitch-type humid-arid climate oscillations, proven via intense humid weathering records during times of regression and sea-level lowstands; (2) missing or inverse relationships of sea-level and the marine δ 18 O archives, i.e. the lack of a pronounced positive excursion, cooling signal during sea-level lowstands; and (3) the anti-phase relationship of sea and lake levels, attesting to high groundwater levels and charged continental aquifers during sea-level lowstands. This substantiates the aquifer-eustasy hypothesis. Rates of aquifer-eustatic sea-level change remain hard to decipher; however, reconstructions range from a very conservative minimum estimate of 0.04 mm a −1 (longer time intervals) to 0.7 mm a −1 (shorter, probably asymmetric cycles). Remarkably, aquifer-eustasy is recognized as a significant component for the Anthropocene sea-level budget.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Sames"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Geodynamics and Sedimentology, University of Vienna, UZA 2, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria"", ""Sam Noble Museum, University of Oklahoma, 2401 Chautauqua Ave, Norman, OK 73072, USA""]}, {""name"": ""M.

10.1002/er.6253,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Review of vibration-based electromagnetic-piezoelectric hybrid energy harvesters,"SummaryThese days the health monitoring of machines and structures is performed using wireless sensor nodes (WSNs). The disadvantage of short life span of batteries in WSN is overcome by using energy harvesting techniques and the required power is extracted from the environment for operating WSNs. The energy available in environment is in the form of thermal, solar, wind, vibration, RF and acoustic energy. The Piezoelectric (PE), electromagnetic (EM), electrostatic and triboelectric transduction may be utilized to harvest power from vibration energy available on structure which otherwise may be going waste. Moreover, for enhancing power generation hybrid vibration energy harvesters are developed by combining two of such transduction mechanisms. The piezoelectric and electromagnetic based hybrid harvesters are discussed in this work for vibration energy harvesting. The hybrid vibration energy harvesters are classified here as resonant, frequency tuned, nonlinear, non‐resonant, multi‐mode and frequency up conversion harvesters. The architecture, input excitation levels and performance of the reported hybrid harvesters is discussed and compared to know the advantage of harvester's configuration. Moreover, all the reported harvesters are compared on the basis of input vibration to which these harvesters are subjected, their resonant frequencies, size, output voltage, power levels and power density. Most of the developed hybrid energy harvesters are resonant harvesters. The multi‐mode hybrid energy harvesters are generating comparatively higher power levels of up to 250.25 mW and power density 2669.3 µW/cm3 in the reported literature.

The use of animal fur (goat) in synthesis could assist in turning waste to wealth. Thus, potentials of animal fur in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AF-AgNPs), its biological activities and safety through cytogenotoxicity were investigated. Animal fur (1 g) was hydrolyzed with 100 ml of 0.1 M NaOH at 90 °C for 1 h, cooled and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min. The extract (1 ml) was added to 1 mM AgNO3 (40 ml) to reduce Ag+ to its nanoparticles. The AF-AgNPs was characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Larvicidal, antioxidant, anticoagulant and thrombolytic potentials of AF-AgNPs were studied. Onion bulbs (20) were exposed to 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 μg/ml of AF-AgNPs solution for its cytogenotoxicity study with AgNO3 solution and distilled water as controls. Microscopic (24, 48 and 72 h) assessment of the onion cells and macroscopic (72 h) evaluation of the roots were also studied. The AF-AgNPs solution was brownish with surface plasmon resonance at 419 nm. Evaluation of FTIR spectra showed that protein molecules were used as capping and stabilization agents. The AF-AgNPs had size range of 11.67-31.47 nm, caused 60-100% mortality of exposed Anopheles mosquito larvae in 12 h, and scavenged DPPH (40-59%) and hydrogen peroxide (75-94%). The nanoparticles also exhibited anticoagulant and thrombolytic potentials on human blood with 25% lysis compared to 13% observed for only extract. Various chromosomal aberrations and growth inhibition were induced by AF-AgNPs especially at 72 h of 100 μg/ml. Extract from animal fur was explored in biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles and found to have high potentials as antioxidant, anticoagulant, thrombolytic agents. Inhibition of cell growth observed especially at highest concentration can be explored in anticancer drugs though with caution due to AF-AgNPs potential to induce chromosomal aberrations.","[{""name"": ""G O Akintayo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Lateef"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M A Azeez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T B Asafa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""I C Oladipo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J A Badmus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S A Ojo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J A Elegbede"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E B Gueguim-Kana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L S Beukes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T A Yekeen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/occmed/kql051"", ""10.1007/s00436-015-4800-9"", ""10.1016/j.cocis.2007.10.001"", ""10.15835/nsb929938"", ""10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.06.003"", ""10.1049/iet-nbt.2017.0299"", ""10.1007/s12649-018-0540-2"", ""10.1002/btpr.2829"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b00022"", ""10.1109/TNB.2016.2559161"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1146-0"", ""10.1515/gps-2018-0038"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0492-9"", ""10.1007/s00449-019-02193-8"", ""10.1155/2017/5919836"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2013.04.076"", ""10.1002/btpr.511"", ""10.1007/s40089-014-0133-4"", ""10.1088/0957-4484/16/10/059"", ""10.1016/S0023-6438(95)80008-5"", ""10.1016/j.lwt.2007.04.003"", ""10.4330/wjc.v7.i8.434"", ""10.1016/j.jtusci.2017.06.005"", ""10.1080/00087114.2017.1370260"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2011.06.025"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2008.06.051"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2014.08.122"", ""10.1007/s13204-012-0125-5"", ""10.1007/s12247-014-9190-5"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0477-8"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2012.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2015.03.033"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1055-2"", ""10.1080/10826068.2018.1479864"", ""10.1055/s-0030-1254046"", ""10.1007/s00281-011-0290-8"", ""10.1016/S0049-3848(07)70143-3"", ""10.2217/nnm.13.49"", ""10.1021/nn900277t"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.06.069"", ""10.1016/S1995-7645(11)60197-1"", ""10.1007/s00436-012-2924-8"", ""10.1515/biolog-2015-0164"", ""10.33640/2405-609X.1018"", ""10.5897/AJB2013.12802"", ""10.1016/0014-4827(71)90630-6"", ""10.1508/cytologia.66.235""]",['Materials Science'],['Materials Chemistry'],"[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

Primary I-type granites represent fractionated liquids from intermediate magma systems of broadly andesitic composition. Fluid-fluxed melting of igneous rocks that resided in the continental crust generates secondary I-type granites. The former are directly related to subduction, with Cordilleran batholiths as the most characteristic examples. Experiments with lower crust granulite sources, in the presence of water, show that amphibole is formed by a water-fluxed peritectic rehydration melting reaction . Entrainment of only 10% of restites composed of amphibole, pyroxene, plagioclase and magnetite, is sufficient to account for discrepancies in aluminium saturation index and maficity in secondary I-type granites. Lower crust granulite xenoliths, attached to a sanukitoid containing 6 wt% water, have been used in two-layer capsules to test fluid-fluxed melting reactions as the origin of secondary I-type granites. It is proposed that sanukitoid magmas act as water donors that trigger extensive melting of the lower crust, giving rise to granodioritic liquids. Because primary granites are related to coeval subduction, and secondary ones are crustal melts from older subduction-related rocks, the distinction between both I-types is essential in tectonic reconstructions of ancient orogenic belts.","[{""name"": ""Antonio Castro"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/286335a0"", ""10.1007/s00410-008-0351-8"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2003.08.003"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00929-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/egi084"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2014.07.004"", ""10.1093/petrology/egh019"", ""10.1130/G33455.1"", ""10.1086/314356"", ""10.1093/petrology/33.5.1039"", ""10.1007/BF00306477"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.S7-XV.3-4.209"", ""10.1144/sjg40010049"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2007.09.012"", ""10.1007/s004100050511"", ""10.1093/petrology/44.7.1309"", ""10.1093/petrology/egq019"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2011.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2011.03.011"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2013.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.08.011"", ""10.1017/S0263593300014139"", ""10.1046/j.1440-0952.2000.00766.x"", ""10.1017/S0263593300000973"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2012.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2011.07.004"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-05313-2"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2003.09.003"", ""10.1086/314363"", ""10.1139/e05-022"", ""10.1130/G39956.1"", ""10.1029/GL004i010p00465"", ""10.1093/petrology/egp010"", ""10.1093/petrology/egq078"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2018.09.004"", ""10.1007/s004100050244"", ""10.1130/G33371.1"", ""10.1144/jgs.158.3.521"", ""10.1093/petrology/42.11.2033"", ""10.1093/petrology/egl030"", ""10.1130/G20018.1"", ""10.1130/MEM28"", ""10.1007/s004100050276"", ""10.1038/nature05191"", ""10.1144/1467-787302-010"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2007.01.007"", ""10.1007/BF00372365"", ""10.1016/S0016-7037(03)00416-2"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2011.10.022"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-61049-3"", ""10.1007/s00531-016-1434-9"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.06.017"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(01)00165-2"", ""10.1007/s00410-005-0056-1"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2007.09.025"", ""10.2138/am-2015-5121"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511535581"", ""10.1007/BF00402106"", ""10.1093/petrology/egm084"", ""10.2138/am-2001-11-1208"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2004.04.055"", ""10.1007/BF00457293"", ""10.1007/s00410-016-1281-5"", ""10.1017/S1755691009016120"", ""10.1038/ngeo1781"", ""10.2475/ajs.274.4.321"", ""10.1007/s00410-008-0371-4"", ""10.1007/BF00287111"", ""10.1016/S1464-1895(01)00059-X"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.02.002"", ""10.1007/s00410-016-1278-0"", ""10.2475/ajs.283.10.993"", ""10.1007/s004100050495"", ""10.1016/j.jsames.2008.11.007"", ""10.1144/gsjgs.156.4.0673"", ""10.1016/S0024-4937(98)00080-2"", ""10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.06.024"", ""10.1029/94JB03376"", ""10.1093/petrology/egh071"", ""10.1086/623788"", ""10.1007/BF00384745"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2014.02.006"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(01)00481-2"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-5832-9"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2012.11.044"", ""10.1007/s00410-013-0854-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/36.4.891"", ""10.1007/s00410-005-0677-4"", ""10.1080/11035895709447195"", ""10.1038/nature08510"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.12.017"", ""10.1130/B32028.1"", ""10.1086/662033"", ""10.1029/95RG01302"", ""10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/03016-4"", ""10.1038/310222a0"", ""10.1007/BF00283225"", ""10.1007/s00410-004-0632-9"", ""10.1093/petrology/43.2.291"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1988.038.01.23"", ""10.1046/j.1440-0952.2001.00880.x"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0078:ROSEIT>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1007/BF00307341"", ""10.1139/e89-145"", ""10.1093/petrology/egy017"", ""10.1093/petrology/37.6.1579"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2014.08.021"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(77)90003-8"", ""10.2138/am.2010.3371"", ""10.1093/petrology/27.5.1095"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2005.12.001""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"
10.1002/er.6245,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,"A comprehensive review of distribution generation integrated DC microgrid protection: issues, strategies, and future direction","SummaryThe evolution of small‐scaled distributed generators and emerging power electronic devices opens up a new arena of power generation, distribution, and consumption. Operationally, the DC microgrid has attracted significant attention as it offers considerable safety benefits, cost‐effectiveness, energy efficiency, and reliability as compared to traditional AC microgrid systems. Looking at the protection aspects, the DC microgrid has some serious issues both for low‐voltage and mid‐voltage DC system. It needs to be focused on bidirectional power flow, non‐zero crossing point, detection and mitigation of grounding faults, high value of fault current, etc., for an adequate solution. In recent times, these issues are considered by various researchers to arrive at a robust and reliable approach toward protecting the DC microgrid. But certain important areas are still out of sight for researchers. In a blend of conventional and modern approaches, there are many hindrances in developing a flexible universal protective scheme. This work focuses on the protection aspects parallel with the challenges and tried to unearth the loopholes which open up a wider area of research to develop a more robust protective architecture. An extensive review has been done systematically and chronologically keeping in mind the DC microgrid architecture, standards, protection hurdles, traditional as well as latest protective measures, and suggested some reliable improvements. In addition, the futuristic possibility to invent a novel comprehensive approach based on the best technology and techniques is presented in a more secure, reliable, and efficient protection system to combat the power system faults, keeping in view the different modes of operation and configuration of the microgrid.","[{""name"": ""Swetalina Sarangi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical

Tectonism started with the formation of a Tonian passive margin on a Baltica-derived ribbon dispersed into the Mirovoi Ocean. Obduction of an oceanic terrane onto the ribbon produced olistostromes, deformation and metamorphism before 750 Ma. Obduction was followed by a Tonian (750–730 Ma) arc on the created composite crust. A pause in magmatism between 730 and 700 Ma is the next event. Subsequently, a Cyrogenian (700–670 Ma) arc was formed, which may have collided with Baltica or another buoyant element nearby. Thereafter, a long-lasting (640–565 Ma) continental arc was erected which, combined with the late Ediacaran–Early Paleozoic sedimentary cover, represents the hallmark of West Avalonia. A Caribbean-style incursion of the Ediacaran arc into the widening Tornquist gap between Amazonia and Baltica led to a diachronous collision with the Ganderian arc. Strike-slip slivering produced a complex transfer of terranes to both: Carolinia and smaller terranes to Ganderia, and East Avalonia to West Avalonia. The Rheic Ocean opened diachronously at c. 500 Ma, following a plate reorganization and re-establishment of an oblique subduction zone beneath Amazonia. As a result, Avalonia and Ganderia became progressively separated and dispersed into the Iapetus Ocean.","[{""name"": ""C.

10.1002/er.8307,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,A strong tracking adaptive fading-extended Kalman filter for the state of charge estimation of lithium-ion batteries,"SummaryLithium‐ion batteries are widely used as rechargeable energy and power storage system in smart devices and electric vehicles because of their high specific energy, high power densities, etc. The state of charge (SOC) serves as a vital feature that is monitored by the battery management system to optimize the performance, safety, and lifespan of lithium‐ion batteries. In this paper, a strong tracking adaptive fading‐extended Kalman filter (STAF‐EKF) based on the second‐order resistor–capacitor equivalent circuit model (2RC‐ECM) is proposed for accurate SOC estimation of lithium‐ion batteries under different working conditions and ambient temperatures. The characteristic parameters of the established 2RC‐ECM for the lithium‐ion battery are identified offline using the least‐squares curve fitting method with an average R‐squared value of 0.99881. Experimental data from the hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) is used for the estimation and verification of the proposed STAF‐EKF method under the complex Beijing bus dynamic stress test (BBDST) and the dynamic stress test (DST) working conditions at varying ambient temperatures. The results show that the established 2RC‐ECM tracks the actual voltage of the battery with a maximum error of 28.44 mV under the BBDST working condition. For the SOC estimation, the results show that the proposed STAF‐EKF has a maximum mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 1.7159% and 1.8507%, while the EKF has 6.7358% and 7.2564%, respectively, at an ambient temperature of −10°C under the BBDST working condition. The proposed STAF‐EKF delivers optimal performance improvement compared to the EKF under different working conditions and ambient temperatures, serving as a basis for an accurate and robust SOC estimation method with quick convergence for the real‐time applications of lithium‐ion batteries.","[{""name"": ""Paul Takyi‐Aninakwa"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Shunli Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongying Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Emmanuel Appiah"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Etse Dablu Bobobee"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Carlos Fernandez"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Pharmacy and Life Sciences Robert Gordon University  Aberdeen UK""]}]","[""10.1109/TVT.2019.2952970"", ""10.3390/en14113284"", ""10.1088/1742‐6596/1633/1/012141"", ""10.1016/j.est.2021.103070"", ""10.3390/en14133733"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2021.111913"", ""10.3390/en13184968"", ""10.3390/su13095046"", ""10.3390/en14041054"", ""10.1016/j.joule.2019.11.018"", ""10.3390/app112411797"", ""10.1002/er.5758"", ""10.1002/ente.202100235"", ""10.3390/en13236366"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.120630"", ""10.3390/s21175698"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.101085"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2021.10.023"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.101106"", ""10.3390/en14175265"", ""10.1016/j.est.2021.102587"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229505"", ""10.3389/fmech.2021.719718"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2967563"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229513"", ""10.3390/en13071785"", ""10.1049/iet‐cds.2018.5406"", ""10.1002/cta.3166"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.119025"", ""10.1109/CIEEC50170.2021.9510942"", ""10.3390/electronics9091425"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.122627"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228450"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.119603"", ""10.1038/s41598‐021‐84729‐1"", ""10.3390/electronics10020122"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.102093"", ""10.1155/2021/6758679"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2022.123423"", ""10.3390/fractalfract5030091"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140241"", ""10.1016/j.est.2022.104904"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2865664"", ""10.1016/j.est.2022.104538"", ""10.1109/JESTPE.2021.3112754"", ""10.1109/TTE.2021.3117841"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2022.123178"", ""10.1002/er.7505"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228051"", ""10.1007/s11431‐019‐1467‐9"", ""10.1016/j.est.2022.104124"", ""10.1016/j.apor.2021.102802"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113615"", ""10.3390/en140717""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

All wires or devices carrying or using electricity generate extremely low frequency (ELF) electric fields (EFs) and magnetic fields (MFs), but they decline rapidly with distance to the source. High magnetic flux densities are usually found in the vicinity of power lines and close to equipment using strong electrical currents, but can also be found in buildings with unbalanced return currents, or indoor transformer stations. For decades, epidemiological as well as experimental studies have addressed possible health effects of exposure to ELF-MFs. The main goal of ICNIRP is to protect people and the environment from detrimental exposure to all forms of non-ionizing radiation (NIR). To this end, ICNIRP provides advice and guidance by developing and disseminating exposure guidelines based on the available scientific research. Research in the low-frequency range began more than 40 years ago, and there is now a large body of literature available on which ICNIRP set its protection guidelines. A review of the literature has been carried out to identify possible relevant knowledge gaps, and the aim of this statement is to describe data gaps in research that would, if addressed, assist ICNIRP in further developing guidelines and setting revised recommendations on limiting exposure to electric and magnetic fields. It is articulated in two parts: the main document, which reviews the science related to LF data gaps, and the annex, which explains the methodology used to identify the data gaps.",[],"[""10.1054/bjoc.2000.1376"", ""10.1038/s41416-018-0097-7"", ""10.1080/00207454.2017.1411353"", ""10.1269/jrr.08019"", ""10.1080/15368378.2018.1471700"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2018.02.036"", ""10.1088/0952-4746/36/3/437"", ""10.1038/bjc.2016.142"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2019.01.022"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/50/6/002"", ""10.1098/rsbl.2017.0142"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/54/16/002"", ""10.3390/ijerph16030337"", ""10.1109/10.942590"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncp251"", ""10.1016/j.neuro.2016.02.012"", ""10.1002/bem.22104"", ""10.3109/21678421.2014.954588"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181f06c86"", ""10.1016/j.arcmed.2013.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.neuro.2017.12.005"", ""10.1080/09553000600577839"", ""10.1039/C5CP06731F"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000351"", ""10.1093/rpd/nct311"", ""10.1093/aje/kwq181"", ""10.1136/oemed-2016-103780"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/56/19/001"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/57/4/N25"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/57/19/6147"", ""10.1007/s00421-011-2130-x"", ""10.1038/srep08585"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0126963"", ""10.1038/nature06834"", ""10.1007/s00204-016-1769-9"", ""10.1038/nature03077"", ""10.1038/484320a"", ""10.1093/aje/kwy287"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/61/12/4346"", ""10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.048"", ""10.3109/09553002.2016.1144942"", ""10.1002/ajim.22598"", ""10.1051/radiopro/2013088"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(200004)21:3<167::AID-BEM3>3.0.CO;2-1"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/ab0586"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/61/12/4376"", ""10.1038/jes.2014.39"", ""10.1002/bem.20412"", ""10.3109/09553002.2014.954058"", ""10.7150/ijms.28411""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Health Professions']","['Speech and Hearing', 'Biophysics']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.6903), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6859)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7179), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7089)]]"

The recently determined Bajocian age for salt deposition (using 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopes) is integrated by modifying the plate kinematic framework with a new Equatorial Atlantic reconstruction that expands the gap between the Americas by 180 km over many kinematic frameworks. NW–SE synrift lithospheric extension along western Florida–Bahamas is estimated at 40%, implying thinned continental crust beneath Great Bank, Bahamas, the conjugate for the Guianas Basin margin. In cordilleran Mexico (excluding the Yucatán Block), we propose two new means by which continental crust migrated into the ‘Colombian overlap position’ of Pangaean reconstructions. The first involved Jurassic–earliest Cretaceous sinistral displacement of the Oaxaca Block along a NW–SE ‘North Oaxaca Transfer’ through or adjacent to the Cuicateco Belt. The second applies to the continental crust in eastern Mexico to the north of Cuicateco, a region we refer to as ‘peninsular Mexico’. There, most Mesozoic basement faults trend NW–SE, and the common occurrence of Permian mid-crustal anatectic basement directly beneath Mesozoic red beds, salt and marine strata suggests extreme extension prior to the onset of sedimentation. Because these Mesozoic sedimentary sections typically sum to 3–8 km in thickness, the post-rift crust of peninsular Mexico probably averaged about 25 km in thickness before later orogenesis. Our reconstructions suggest that this Triassic–Middle Jurassic extension approached 100%, beginning with overthickened Alleghanian (Permian) crust about 50 km in thickness in palaeo-northern Mexico, and was accompanied by a significant sinistral component broadly distributed across the rift array. The updated model provides an exploration and kinematic framework for the entire region.","[{""name"": ""James Pindell"", ""affiliation"": [""Tectonic Analysis Ltd, Chestnut House, Burton Park,

A multitude of investigations have been published during the years regarding solvolysis of newly produced composite laminates and known thermoset composition (epoxy, polyester, and vinyl ester). However, a real wind turbine blade is more complex and constitutes of thermosets, thermoplastics, and other materials such as balsa wood. It is a very challenging task to separate these materials from each other within the wind turbine blade structure, so the premise for recycling is a mixed waste stream where little is known about the chemical composition. In the present study, the solvolysis process for GFRPs based on sub/supercritical water at 250-370 °C and 100-170 bar process conditions with catalyst (acid and base) and additives (alcohols and glycols) was studied and optimized. The samples used are representative for End-of-Life wind turbine blades. The aim is therefore to investigate if it is possible to develop a general process that can accept all material constituents in a real wind turbine blade, resulting in recycled glass fibers and a hydrocarbon fraction that can be used as a refinery feedstock.","[{""name"": ""C Mattsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A André"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Juntikka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T Tränkle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Sott"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.04.013"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.08.041"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.01.004"", ""10.1007/s42452-020-2195-4"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2017.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2008.02.008"", ""10.1177/0731684414555745"", ""10.3390/pr7010022"", ""10.1016/S0032-3861(03)00324-0"", ""10.1016/j.polymer.2004.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2005.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2014.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.10.014"", ""10.1177/0731684412453512"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.013"", ""10.1039/C5GC01048A"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.063"", ""10.1021/ie990690j"", ""10.1080/02773810902961104""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Its first criticality experiment is scheduled for the latter half of 2021. Before performing the first criticality experiment, a prediction calculation was performed using PANGU code. This paper presents the calculation details for predicting the HTR-PM first criticality using PANGU, including the input model and parameters, numerical results, and uncertainty analysis. The accuracy of the PANGU code was demonstrated by comparing it with the high-fidelity Monte Carlo solution, using the same input configurations. It should be noted that keff can be significantly affected by uncertainties in nuclear data and certain input parameters, making the criticality calculation challenge. Finally, the PANGU is used to predict the critical loading height of the HTR-PM first criticality under design conditions, which will be evaluated in the upcoming experiment later this year.","[{""name"": ""Ding She"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bing Xia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jiong Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chun-Lin Wei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jian Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fu Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lei Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zuo-Yi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2005.11.024"", ""10.1016/S0029-5493(02)00182-6"", ""10.1016/S0029-5493(02)00184-X"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2018.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2021.108531"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2014.08.048"", ""10.1080/00295639.2016.1272363"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2019.103041"", ""10.1016/j.nds.2018.02.001"", ""10.2172/1173079"", ""10.2172/1649145"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2020.107458"", ""10.3389/fenrg.2021.704116""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"
10.1002/er.6215,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Thermal performance of phase change material-based heat sink for passive cooling of electronic components: An experimental study,"SummaryPresent paper reports the thermal performance of various phase change material (PCM)‐based heat sinks during melting process for cooling of portable electronic devices through experimental investigations. Heat sink configurations include unfinned with pure PCM, finned with pure PCM, unfinned with metallic foam (MF)–PCM composite, and finned with MF–PCM composite. Paraffin wax is used as PCM, and tests have been carried out for various input heat flux values (1.3, 2.0, and 2.7 kW/m2) at different volume fractions of PCM (0, 0.50, 0.86, and 1). The effect of various parameters such as PCM volume fraction, heat sink type, and heat flux on the stretching of operating time to achieve a set point temperature (SPT) is studied. Results obtained from the current experimental investigation are compared with the existing test results. Also, unfinned heat sink without and with PCM is used for baseline comparison. The evolution and propagation of melt front inside the heat sink are studied through photographic observation. The enhancement in operating time is found to vary with the SPT and heat flux values. MF–PCM‐based heat sinks are more advantageous for higher value of input heat flux (2.0 and 2.7 kW/m2). For q″ = 1.3 and 2.0 kW/m2, four‐finned MF–PCM‐based heat sink exhibits better performance; while three‐finned MF–PCM‐based heat sink shows best performance at q″ = 2.7 kW/m2. The highest enhancement ratio of ~2.97 is obtained at 1.3 and 2.7 kW/m2 for four‐finned MF–PCM heat sink and three‐finned MF–PCM heat sink, respectively. Also, three‐finned heat sink provides higher heat transfer rate and highest thermal conductance at q″ = 2.7 kW/m2.","[{""name"": ""Rohit Kothari"", ""affiliation"": [""Discipline of Mechanical Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Indore  Indore India""]}, {""name"": ""Santosh K.

Their generation is intimately related to crustal thickening and the active deformation and metamorphism of metapelites. Data from Proterozoic to present day orogenic belts show that collisional leucogranites (CLGs) are peraluminous, with muscovite, biotite and tourmaline as characteristic minerals. Isotopic ratios uniquely identify the metapelitic sequences in which CLGs occur as sources. Organic material in pelitic sources results in f O 2 in CLGs that is usually below the fayalite–magnetite–quartz buffer. Most CLGs form under vapour-poor conditions with melting involving a peritectic breakdown of muscovite. The low concentrations of Mg, Fe and Ti that characterize CLGs are largely related to biotite–melt equilibria in the source rocks. Concentrations of Zr, Th and rare earth elements are lower than expected from zircon and monazite saturation models because these minerals often remain enclosed in residual biotite during melting. Melting involving muscovite may limit the temperatures achieved in the source regions. A lack of nearby mantle heat sources in thick collisional orogens has led to thermal models for the generation of CLGs that involve flux melting, or large amounts of radiogenic heat generation, or decompression melting or shear heating, the last one emphasizing the link of leucogranites and their sources to crustal-scale shear zone systems.","[{""name"": ""Peter I.

It was developed as one of the 16 beamline stations in the Phase II Project of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The slant-scattering mode is for the first time systematically employed in laser Compton scattering at SLEGS to produce energy-tunable quasi-monoenergetic gamma-ray beams. The SLEGS officially completed its commissioning from July to December 2021. Gamma rays in the energy range of 0.25–21.7 MeV with a flux of 2.1 × 104–1.2 × 107 photons/s and an energy spread of 2–15% were produced during the test.

Those materials are also recognized as Thermal Protection System Materials (TPSMs). The structural materials used during the high-temperature oxidizing environment are mainly limited to SiC, oxide ceramics, and composites. In addition to that, silicon-based ceramic has a maximum-use at 1700 °C approximately; as it is an active oxidation process over low temperature and water vapor environment condition. However, a great emphasis is required for developing structural materials in oxidation and rapid heating environment where the temperature is greater than 1700 °C. This review covers briefly all main types of Thermal Protection Systems (TPSs) and all the materials are used to fabricate them with the maximum operational temperatures. Also, it covers the promised UHTMs (SiC, ZrB2, HfB2, SiB6 and B4C) which are currently using for several aerospace applications, especially for TPS. Besides, it discusses the oxidation of SiC, B4C, SiB6, ZrB2 and HfB2. Therefore, the carbides and borides of the transition metals, Zr and Hf have a high-melting temperature and good stability in forming high-melting temperature oxides.","[{""name"": ""H K M Al-Jothery"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T M B Albarody"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P S M Yusoff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M A Abdullah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A R Hussein"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.actaastro.2004.05.034"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2016.08.003"", ""10.1134/S0036023613140039"", ""10.1007/s10697-005-0106-4"", ""10.1016/S0921-5093(02)00520-8"", ""10.1016/S0955-2219(02)00140-1"", ""10.1063/1.5075607"", ""10.1016/S0094-5765(01)00150-3"", ""10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.01.035"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2004.09.106"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.01170.x"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2017.07.012"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2016.02.015"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2015.08.015"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2016.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.08.017"", ""10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.08.018"", ""10.2320/matertrans.44.401"", ""10.1016/S0920-3796(99)00007-1"", ""10.1016/0955-2219(90)90048-K"", ""10.1111/j.1151-2916.2000.tb01647.x"", ""10.1007/s11661-999-0230-6"", ""10.1016/S0955-2219(98)00071-5"", ""10.1006/jssc.1997.7316"", ""10.1007/BF00240800"", ""10.1111/j.1151-2916.2002.tb00260.x"", ""10.1111/j.1151-2916.2001.tb00714.x"", ""10.1063/1.347524"", ""10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03498.x"", ""10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.02.025"", ""10.2497/jjspm.41.1299"", ""10.1016/S0025-5408(01)00560-8"", ""10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00129-6"", ""10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.01.026"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01583.x"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01329.x"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00599.x""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Ceramics and Composites', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0806 冶金工程', 0.701), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6991)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

On the one hand there is the need for finding a balance between the preservation of the aesthetic appearance and the historical values, but on the other hand, finding the space where to effectively integrate the systems might be quite challenging. The solar systems can be divided in photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal (ST) systems. Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) and Building Integrated Solar Thermal (BIST) are PV or ST panels integrated into the building envelope, combining the energy generation with other functions, such as noise, weather protection, thermal insulation, sun shadow, and other aspects. Nowadays, the dynamism of the market allows to design highly compatible products which look like traditional architecture materials. This situation fosters the integration of these products in the BIPV and BIST systems within the heritage sites, especially thanks to the use of advanced customisation processes, special and low-reflecting glasses, and innovative cost-competitive coatings. There is a limited number of studies on the application of these technologies in heritage contexts, due to the presence of architectonic, conservative, and cultural barriers. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the available literature on the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in heritage sites and buildings, which would foster the preservation of their cultural and natural values as well as reducing primary energy consumption, increasing comfort levels, minimizing environmental impacts, and improving technical quality and economical outlays. A common framework will thus defined to support restorers, historic conservators, and energy experts and to facilitate the diffusion and application of RES in heritage contexts. This conceptual framework will provide industries and academics with operative strategies and will encourage their diffusion and application in sensible contexts.","[{""name"": ""E Lucchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C S Polo Lopez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Franco"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.08.085"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.07.058""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Building and Construction', 'Conservation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

The main advantage of deep network is that it can express very complex functions. It can learn features from different levels of abstraction, such as edge features at lower levels and complex features at higher levels.However, the use of deep networks is not always effective, because there is a very big obstacle - the disappearance of gradients: in very deep networks, gradient signals tend to approach zero very quickly, which makes the gradient descent process extremely slow.Specifically, in the process of gradient descent, the weight matrix product operation must be carried out in every step of back propagation from the last layer to the first layer, so that the gradient will drop exponentially to 0.(in rare cases, there is the problem of gradient explosion, that is, the gradient grows exponentially to the overflow in the process of propagation). Therefore, in the process of training, it will be found that with the increase of the number of layers, the rate of gradient decrease increases.Therefore, by deepening the network, although it can express any complex function, but in fact, with the increase of network layers, we are more and more difficult to train the network, until the proposal of residual network, which makes it possible to train deeper network[1].","[{""name"": ""Jiazhi Liang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.bspc.2017.08.026""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Neuroscience']","['Neurology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7465), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7432)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)]]"

The primary mission objective is to demonstrate the DWL technique for measuring wind profiles from space, intended for assimilation in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. The wind observations will also be used to advance atmospheric dynamics research and for evaluation of climate models. Mission spin-off products are profiles of cloud and aerosol optical properties. Aeolus was launched on 22 August 2018, and the Atmospheric LAser Doppler INstrument (Aladin) instrument switch-on was completed with first high energy output in wind mode on 4 September 2018 [1], [2]. The on-ground data processing facility worked excellent, allowing L2 product output in near-real-time from the start of the mission. First results from the wind profile product (L2B) assessment show that the winds are of very high quality, with random errors in the free Troposphere within (cloud/aerosol backscatter winds: 2.1 m/s) and larger (molecular backscatter winds: 4.3 m/s) than the requirements (2.5 m/s), but still allowing significant positive impact in first preliminary NWP impact experiments. The higher than expected random errors at the time of writing are amongst others due to a lower instrument out-and input photon budget than designed. The instrument calibration is working well, and some of the data processing steps are currently being refined to allow to fully correct instrument alignment related drifts and elevated detector dark currents causing biases in the first data product version. The optical properties spin-off product (L2A) is being compared e.g. to NWP model clouds, air quality model forecasts, and collocated ground-based observations. Features including optically thick and thin particle and hydrometeor layers are clearly identified and are being validated.","[{""name"": ""A.G. Straume"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M.

10.1002/er.8427,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Catalytic characteristics of titanium-(IV)-isopropoxide (TTIP) on de/re-hydrogenation of wet ball-milled MgH2/Mg,"SummaryMagnesium hydride (MgH2) has received much attention as a solid‐state hydrogen storage material worldwide due to its high hydrogen storage capacity, good reversibility, and low cost. However, its practical application has been limited due to its high thermodynamic stability and slow kinetics. In the present work, we have employed a new type of catalyst, Titanium‐tetra‐isopropoxide (TTIP) (Ti(OC3H7)4), to catalyze MgH2. To disperse the catalyst evenly over the MgH2, the milling operation was conducted using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a process control agent. Here, using THF as the process control agent during the wet ball milling along with TTIP of MgH2 itself used to improve the de/re‐hydrogenation behavior of MgH2. A de/re‐hydrogenation investigation demonstrates that MgH2 catalyzed by TTIP has better hydrogen storage properties (onset dehydrogenation temperature 210°C) than as‐cast MgH2 (onset dehydrogenation temperature ~400°C). Furthermore, a remarkable catalytic behavior of TTIP on MgH2 was observed during de‐/re‐hydrogenation kinetics (absorb the hydrogen ~4.6 wt% within the 1.5 minutes at a temperature of 300°C under a hydrogen pressure of 20 atm and release the hydrogen of ∼4.98 wt% within 5 minutes at ∼300°C) due to formation of intermediate compound Mg1−xTixO, and it retains nearly constant hydrogen storage capacity (from 5.25 to 5.20 wt% in rehydrogenation and from 4.95 wt % to 4.95 wt% in dehydrogenation) up to 60 cycles of de/re‐hydrogenation. The estimated desorption activation energy for MgH2‐TTIP using Arrhenius equation is 77.67 kJ/mol. The reason for de/re‐hydrogenation kinetics improvement of MgH2‐TTIP can be seen in the mechanism.","[{""name"": ""Sunita Kumari Pandey"", ""affiliation"": [""Hydrogen Energy Centre, Department of Physics Banaras Hindu University  Varanasi Uttar Pradesh India""]}, {""name"": ""Satish Kumar Verma"", ""affiliation"": [""Hydrogen Energy Centre, Department of Physics Banaras Hindu University  Varanasi Uttar Pradesh India""]}, {""name"": ""Ashish Bhatnagar"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics and Materials Science and Engineering Jaypee Institute of Information Technology  Noida Uttar Pradesh India""]}, {""name"": ""Thakur Prasad Yadav"", ""affiliation"": [""Hydrogen Energy Centre, Department of Physics Banaras Hindu University  Varanasi Uttar Pradesh India""]}]","[""10.16943/ptinsa/2015/v81i4/48303"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.210"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.05.107"", ""10.1039/d0dt03627g"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c10714"", ""10.1002/adma.201704303"", ""10.1039/C2CP23776H"", ""10.1002/est2.333"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.12.269"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2021.130101"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.091"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.184"", ""10.1002/ente.201700517"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.014"", ""10.1039/C6CP07852D"", ""10.1002/tcr.201700067"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.12.212"", ""10.1039/C8TA02969E"", ""10.1039/C2JM34730J"", ""10.1166/jnn.2013.7516"", ""10.1007/s00339‐016‐9602‐0"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.031"", ""10.1039/C4NR00474D"", ""10.3390/met9070768"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b07640"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.068"", ""10.1016/j.jmst.2020.11.052"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.090"", ""10.1039/c8ra07279e"", ""10.1039/C2DT32266H"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b05483"", ""10.1590/1980‐5373‐MR‐2016‐0179"", ""10.1016/S0925‐8388(98)01037‐8"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.12.217"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.083"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.019"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.192"", ""10.1021/jp044576c"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.02.047"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.189"", ""10.1039/C6TA05998H"", ""10.3390/reactions2030022"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162206"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2022.135050"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.10.216"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.06.238"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.05.097"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.163"", ""10.1021/am502755s"", ""10.2478/s13536‐014‐0218‐9"", ""10.1039/c2nr33347c"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.040"", ""10.3390/mi12101190"", ""10.3390/en14196400"", ""10.5923/j.nn.20120203.01"", ""10.3389/fmats.2020.00125"", ""10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00313"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.10.161"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.065"", ""10.1016/0039‐6028(95)00825‐x"", ""10.1016/0955‐2219(95)00021‐L"", ""10.1088/0031‐8949/2/1‐2/014"", ""10.1111/j.1151‐2916.1991.tb04131.x"", ""10.1515/znb‐1978‐0211"", ""10.1116/1.580764"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.204"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.12.269"", ""10.1039/D1MA00012H"", ""10.1016/j.molliq.2018.10.048"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.133"", ""10.1039/C8RA05429K"", ""10.1021/ed061p494"", ""10.1039/C5CC08801A"", ""10.1002/er.7046"", ""10.1021/jp0574495""]","['Materials Science', 'Energy', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Catalysis']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7169), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7168)]]"

To detect the illegal behaviors of workers without masks in workplaces and densely populated areas, an improved convolutional neural network VGG-19 algorithm is proposed under the framework of tensorflow, and more than 3000 images are collected for model training and testing. Using VGG-19 network model, three FC layers are optimized into one flat layer and two FC layers with reduced parameters.

10.1002/er.6206,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Advanced modification of scandia-stabilized zirconia electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells application-A review,"SummarySolid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are recognized as an energy generation device with high power density and energy conversion efficiency, low noise, low greenhouse gas emissions, positive environmental effect, and high fuel consumption versatility. Nevertheless, the high operating temperature of SOFCs has restricted the development in various applications due to challenges in material compatibility and working process. To address these issues, scandia‐stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) electrolytes are commonly utilized to explore its potentials as a solid electrolyte toward lowering the operating temperature due to high conductivity properties at low‐to‐intermediate temperature conditions. Thus, this paper provides an advanced modification of ScSZ electrolytes in SOFCs toward lowering the operating temperature. This review presents the potential properties and the progress modification of ScSZ electrolyte including challenges, and advances, summary, and future perspectives in the low‐to‐intermediate operating temperature of SOFCs. This review can serve as a first reference for identifying specific parameters and prospective studies to enhance the properties of ScSZ electrolytes for the application of SOFCs. Based on the literature review, there are no previous review works that have been published on the modification of ScSZ electrolytes.","[{""name"": ""Zulfirdaus Zakaria"", ""affiliation"": [""Fuel Cell Institute Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia  Bangi Malaysia""]}, {""name"": ""Siti Kartom Kamarudin"", ""affiliation"": [""Fuel Cell Institute Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia  Bangi Malaysia"", ""Research Center of Sustainable Process Technology (CESPRO) Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia  Bangi Malaysia""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.027"", ""10.1002/er.4513"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.099"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.05014.x"", ""10.1002/er.4944"", ""10.1002/er.5518"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.139-141.141"", ""10.17576/jkukm-2020-32(1)-18"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.077"", ""10.1002/er.4210"", ""10.1002/er.4707"", ""10.1002/wene.23"", ""10.1039/C6EE01915C"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.06.082"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.09.085"", ""10.1002/er.4907"", ""10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00356-8"", ""10.1002/er.1718"", ""10.1002/er.5547"", ""10.1126/science.1204090"", ""10.1002/er.1600"", ""10.1002/er.1943"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.019"", ""10.1002/wene.23"", ""10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00330-3"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.097"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.02.026"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.09.083"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.019"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.008"", ""10.1149/1.2729336"", ""10.1016/j.actamat.2003.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.09.068"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2010.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2012.02.022"", ""10.1016/0167-2738(95)00044-7"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2006.05.052"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2003.10.026"", ""10.1002/9780470640845.ch25"", ""10.1002/er.2958"", ""10.1021/jp906204c"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2010.06.010"", ""10.1149/1.2729337"", ""10.1149/1.2729334"", ""10.1149/1.2729157"", ""10.1149/1.3157938"", ""10.1149/1.2712131"", ""10.1149/1.2839618"", ""10.1149/1.3205788"", ""10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2011.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2013.05.076"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2013.05.019"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.140"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2010.12.050"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.12.092"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2010.09.023"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.077"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.139"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2010.10.012"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2011.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.092"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.046"", ""10.1016/j.pnsc.2013.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.06.061"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2011.05.059"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.04.021"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2012.04.008"", ""10.1002/er.1921"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.265"", ""10.1002/er.3639"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2007.09.038"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.02.035"", ""10.1007/s40436-013-0049-7"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.085"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.054"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2015.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.surfcoat.2011.03.077"", ""10.1111/jace.14595"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.015"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2010.01.024"", ""10.1680/nme.12.00015"", ""10.1111/jace.14545"", ""10.1149/2.0231514jes"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.074"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.06.146"", ""10.1134/S1023193518060101"", ""10.1088/1361-6528/aac132"", ""10.3390/coatings10010009"", ""10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2016.02.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.09.124"", ""10.1016/S1002-0721(16)60012-1"", ""10.1016/S1002-0721(14)60480-4"", ""10.1149/2.1031514jes"", ""10.1016/j.jre.2018.11.006"", ""10.7567/JJAP.50.01BE09"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115218"", ""10.1016/j.jmat.2019.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.scriptamat.2016.04.023"", ""10.1002/9780470640845"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2019.06.076"", ""10.1007/s11666-019-00970-1"", ""10.1002/adem.200700347"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.050"", ""10.1149/1.2729339"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.083"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.08.067"", ""10.1002/er.3090"", ""10.1002/er.3000"", ""10.1002/er.5036""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Catalysis']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7169), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7168)]]"

These machines need to achieve high power densities while reducing electrical heat losses to minimize the required cryogenic power and subsequent additional weight. Hydrogen powered all-electric planes provide a design space where ac losses are manageable. However, the high electrical frequencies in high-speed fully superconducting machines pose a significant challenge to reducing armature ac losses. In high-speed applications, coupling loss in the SC armature coils dominates and becomes a barrier for practical application of these machines. In this paper a fully superconducting machine is proposed for a hydrogen powered regional all-electric plane. An air core design is considered utilizing low ac loss MgB2 wires. The design is targeted to achieve 50 kW/kg specific power while requiring ac losses to be less than 3 kW. This study explores the possibility of replacing a passive iron shield with active shielding coils to contain the magnetic flux inside the machine while reducing weight and increasing power density. The study focuses on minimizing weight as well as ac losses in the armature coils. An optimization algorithm is used to determine the trade-offs between iron shield and active shield coil designs. Results show that optimal designs for electric propulsion eliminate the passive shield in favor of active shielding coils - increasing the power density of the machine while maintaining the outside flux density below standard safety limits.","[{""name"": ""T Balachandran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N Salk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K S Haran"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ESARS-ITEC.2018.8607734"", ""10.2514/6.2018-5000"", ""10.1109/TASC.2019.2906655"", ""10.1109/TASC.2018.2823503"", ""10.1109/PECI.2015.7064939"", ""10.1109/IEMDC.2015.7409294"", ""10.1109/TASC.2017.2651118""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Engineering']","['Condensed Matter Physics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0702 物理学', 0.731), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7181)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

Nevertheless, they face great challenges in the design of optimum electrode materials for practical applications. Herein, we prepared a unique two‐dimensional structured composite consisting of N‐doped carbon‐coated CoSe2 nanocrystals and MXene nanosheets (CoSe2@NC/MX) for efficient electrochemical Na‐ and K‐ion storage. In this strategy, a Co‐based zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF‐67) was deposited on the surface of MXene nanosheets, and the subsequent selenization process resulted in the transformation of the ZIF‐67 into CoSe2@NCs. The unique structure can shorten the transport pathways for electrons/ions and provide sufficient space to accommodate the volume change of the active materials. Furthermore, the N‐doped carbon matrix and MXene can enhance the robustness of the electrode materials. Accordingly, the composites exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of cycle stability (317 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1) and rate capability (343 mA h g−1 at 7.0 A g−1) for SIBs. For KIBs, they exhibited a high reversible capacity of 358 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 100 cycles and 276 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 2.0 A g−1.","[{""name"": ""Hong Geun Oh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Advanced Materials Engineering Chung‐Ang University  Anseong‐si South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Su Hyun Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Korea University  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yun Chan Kang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Korea University  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Seung‐Keun Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Advanced Materials Engineering Chung‐Ang University  Anseong‐si South Korea""]}]","[""10.1007/s40820-018-0224-2"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b09223"", ""10.1002/ange.201803511"", ""10.1002/batt.201900165"", ""10.1021/acsnano.9b05599"", ""10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.03.039"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b10790"", ""10.1039/D0NR04111D"", ""10.1002/smll.201703419"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.152566"", ""10.1038/srep35189"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2020.04.071"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.01.185"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2017.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227481"", ""10.1039/C3CS60472A"", ""10.1002/smll.201702648"", ""10.1039/C8NR05239E"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2017.07.079"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b22606"", ""10.1016/j.enchem.2019.100001"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b02847"", ""10.1039/C9NH00571D"", ""10.1002/adem.201901241"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.117047"", ""10.1016/j.mseb.2014.10.009"", ""10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b02469"", ""10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b03682"", ""10.1002/smll.202002345"", ""10.1007/s40820-020-00539-6"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.03.263"", ""10.1039/C8NR08461K"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b01888"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2017.05.046"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2019.05.008"", ""10.1021/acsami.0c06296"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.142"", ""10.1039/C8TA02342E"", ""10.1002/aenm.201801477"", ""10.1002/adfm.201909486""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1002/er.6004,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Performance analysis of hybrid solar chimney-power plant for power production and seawater desalination: A sustainable approach,"SummaryThis study presents a novel design that combines cooling tower (CT) and traditional solar chimney power plant (SCPP) technologies for electricity generation and seawater desalination. The proposed hybrid solar chimney power plant (HSCPP) shares the operation of the chimney part and the bi‐directional turbine between the SCPP and CT, allowing alternative operation of the CT during the nighttime and the SCPP during the daytime, and achieving continuous system utilization. The performance of the HSCPP design was validated against baseline models using 1 year of weather data from the city of Aqaba in Jordan. Results revealed that the HSCPP has the potential to produce ~50% electricity (528 MWh/year) higher than the traditional SCPP (365 MWh/year). The annual seawater desalination capacity of the HSCPP was estimated at 138300 m3, which is 1.5 folds higher than the traditional SCPP. The HSCPP reduced the annual CO2 emissions by 40% (~500 tons) compared to traditional SCPP with annual revenue of US$190 000. Furthermore, the results show that the HSCPP is 1.4 times more efficient than the traditional SCPP. The HSCPP achieved a system utilization factor of 0.73% compared to 0.52% for the traditional SCPP.

10.1002/er.8350,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,KOH mediated hydrothermally synthesized hexagonal-CoMn2O4 for energy storage supercapacitor applications,"SummaryIn recent years, there has been much focus on how the structure and morphology of CoMn2O4 materials influence their electrochemical performance. Herein we introduce a KOH‐surfactant agent to form a hexagonal like‐CoMn2O4 via hydrothermal. The X‐ray Rietveld refinement evidenced that spinel CoMn2O4 with the tetragonal structured I 41/amd phase. Further, the chemical environment of this phase is identified using various techniques. Surface morphology studies revealed hexagonal‐like features. Owing to its features, the material delivers an excellent capacitance of 638.8 F/g. CoMn2O4 also shows attained columbic efficiency of 81% and retains a capacitance of 85% after 4000 charge‐discharge cycles. The excellent cyclic stability and high performance are achieved due to the more active sites and convenient electronic transference route for the ions through an electrochemical process. The symmetrical two‐electrode assembly has also been fabricated. Hence, we believed that the surfactant‐KOH mediated hexagonal‐like‐CoMn2O4 material should enhance the supercapacitor properties.","[{""name"": ""Tholkappiyan Ramachandran"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, College of Engineering United Arab Emirates University  Al‐Ain United Arab Emirates"", ""National Water and Energy Center United Arab Emirates University  Al Ain United Arab Emirates""]}, {""name"": ""Abdel‐Hamid I.

The observations suggest that these salt basins shared a common evolution. Crustal faulting gradually shifted basinward. Consequent thermal/loading subsidence plus lower-crustal thinning generated basinward-shifting accommodation for sag sequences, but slow sedimentation relative to subsidence resulted in deep depressions. A switch to symmetrical boudinage of thinned crust created the troughs and possible reactive mantle diapirs. Evaporites formed during this stage, with deposition near sea-level in proximal positions but 2–3 km deep in basin centres.

10.1002/er.6198,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Optimal energy management strategy for a renewable-based microgrid considering sizing of battery energy storage with control policies,"SummaryMicrogrids (MGs) are known as suitable options to accommodatethe high penetration of renewable energies, like solar and wind. MGs have provided the requirements of controlling and adjusting these sources. In addition, batteries are becoming indispensable components of MGs because of their capabilities in addressing the renewable energies' power output intermittency. In MGs, the problem of smart energymanagement along with battery sizing has been introduced as the necessity to ensure the efficient use of renewable sources and decrease traditional fossil‐fuel‐based generation technology penetration level in power systems. Accordingly, a novel method is presented in this paper to effectively address the above‐mentioned requirements, utilizing the modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MSFLA), applied to different case studies. The results, obtained from the numerical simulation, are compared to several well‐established optimization approaches to verify the performance of MSFLA. In terms of computational efficiency and quality of the obtained solution, the MSFLA has demonstrated promising outcomes, together with superior performance in comparison with other algorithms. The results show that the presented framework, including the battery sizing, would be very beneficial to minimize the operating cost of MGs.","[{""name"": ""Nguyen Vu Quynh"", ""affiliation"": [""Electrical and Electronics Department Lac Hong University  Dong Nai Vietnam""]}, {""name"": ""Ziad M.

A discussion on the selection of parameters for optimizing EPD electrode performance, such as light‐directed EPD, co‐deposition of active materials such as metal oxides and materials manufactured with high porosity and fibrous properties is highlighted. Additionally, means for overcoming obstacles in the improvement of the mechanical properties, conductivity and surface area of EES materials are discussed. The exceptional benefits of EPD such as low cost, small processing time, simple apparatus requirements, homogeneous coatings, binder‐free deposits and selective modification associated with thickness and mass loadings leading to effective EES electrode materials are highlighted. Finally, EPD processes have evolved as modern manufacturing tools to produce technologically improved solid electrolytes and separators for lithium‐ion and/or sodium‐ion batteries, and further research and development programmes are encouraged towards industrialisation.","[{""name"": ""Barun Kumar Chakrabarti"", ""affiliation"": [""WMG, Warwick Electrochemical Engineering Group, Energy

The accumulation of biogenic amines in foods is mainly due to the presence of bacteria able to decarboxylate certain amino acids. Biogenic amines are formed when the alpha carboxvl group breaks away from free amino acid precursors. They are colled after the amino acid they originated from. The main biogenic amines producers in foods are Gram positive bacteria and cheese is among the most commonly implicated foods associated with biogenic amines poisoning. The consumption of foods containing high concentrations of biogenic amines has been associated with health hazards and they are used as a quality indicator that shows the degree of spoilage, use of non-hygienic raw material and poor manufacturing practice. Biogenic amines may also be considered as carcinogens because they are able to react with nitrites to form potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines. Generally, biogenic amines in foods can be controlled by strict use of good hygiene in both raw material and manufacturing environments with corresponding inhibition of spoiling microorganisms. The aim of this review was to give some information about biogenic amines in foods.","[{""name"": ""Kamil Ekici"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdullah Khalid Omer"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.fm.2014.06.001"", ""10.3390/foods8010023"", ""10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.04.061"", ""10.1016/0168-1605(95)00032-1"", ""10.3390/foods8020085"", ""10.1016/j.aca.2016.07.045"", ""10.1016/S0963-9969(96)00066-X"", ""10.1016/0924-2244(94)90070-1"", ""10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(85)81176-0"", ""10.1016/S0168-1605(97)00129-3"", ""10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.08.028"", ""10.1016/S0168-1605(03)00080-1"", ""10.1016/0309-1740(95)80003-4"", ""10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01774.x"", ""10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.03.020"", ""10.3389/fmicb.2012.00188"", ""10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2393"", ""10.1007/s00011-017-1086-7"", ""10.3390/foods8020062"", ""10.1080/10408690490489341"", ""10.4315/0362-028X-54.6.460"", ""10.1016/S0309-1740(01)00176-0"", ""10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.11.007"", ""10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(02)74329-4"", ""10.1159/000108341"", ""10.1016/S0309-1740(01)00079-1"", ""10.5740/jaoacint.16-0006"", ""10.3390/foods7090132"", ""10.1016/0168-1605(90)90040-C"", ""10.1080/19440049.2015.1036322""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']",['Molecular Biology'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)]]"
10.1002/er.6181,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Sequential biofuel production from seaweeds enhances the energy recovery: A case study for biodiesel and bioethanol production,"SummaryIn the present study, eight seaweeds (five red, two brown and one green) were collected and evaluated for dual biodiesel and/or bioethanol production. The highest significant lipid and carbohydrate contents were recorded in the brown seaweed Dilophus fasciola (4.92 and 37.97%dw, respectively). Three routes were investigated, namely R1 and R2 for direct production of biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively, from the whole biomass, in addition to R3 representing the sequential biodiesel and bioethanol production. D. fasciola showed a biodiesel yield of 35.04 mg g−1 dw, composed mainly of C16‐C18 fatty acids with a high saturation degree. All biodiesel characteristics complied with the recommended values of international standards. The maximum reducing sugar content (37.2 g L−1) and bioethanol productivity at 72 hours (0.165 g L−1 h−1) were recorded in the lipid‐free biomass (R3), which were 16.3% and 27.9%, respectively, higher than that of R2.

10.1002/er.8175,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Ni-doped TiO2/TiO2 homojunction photoanodes for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells,"SummaryThe development of novel bilayer photoanodes plays an essential role in dye‐sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications to fabricate efficient devices. Herein, a novel homojunction photoanode consisting of undoped and Ni‐doped TiO2 layers with trace amounts of Ni dopant (0.5% at.) was prepared. After a systematic study on photoconversion efficiency that changes with tuning the location of the doped layer, an in‐depth understanding was obtained regarding the physical mechanism of the coupling of structural, optical and electrical properties. We demonstrated that the doped layer can be utilized for high‐performance DSSCs by employing a homojunction photoanode consisting of an upper‐layer of Ni‐doped TiO2 and a lower‐layer of undoped TiO2 to dramatically increase the photoconversion efficiency. We monitored that the light absorption ability of the dye‐loaded photoanodes strongly improved with the bilayer (Ni‐doped TiO2/TiO2), leading to a higher short circuit current. From impedance spectroscopy (Mott‐Schottky plots), compared to both undoped and the doped single‐layer analogues, a greater shift to more negative flat band potential was noticed for the bilayer and, therefore, a higher open‐circuit voltage was achieved. From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis, it was found that chemical capacitance decreases, while recombination resistance increases after Ni incorporation in the photoanode. They were associated with a reduction in the number of immobile electrons trapped by defect states. A relatively longer electron lifetime of 10.18 ms and diffusion length of 63.2 μm were obtained for the device assembled with the homojunction (Ni‐doped TiO2/TiO2). The PCE (6.08%) of the device assembled with the bilayer was superior to its single‐layer analogue (4.13%), owing to its enhanced light harvesting capability, proper band alignment, improved injection ability, fast electron transport and better collection efficiency. Our results shed light on important characteristics of a homojunction photoanode, which can be considered for future studies and applications.","[{""name"": ""Abdullah Atilgan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University  Ankara Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Abdullah Yildiz"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University  Ankara Turkey"", ""Central Research Laboratory Application and Research Center Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University  Ankara Turkey""]}]","[""10.1038/nphoton.2012.22"", ""10.1021/nn200133g"", ""10.1039/C4CP00034J"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2017.60"", ""10.1063/1.2906370"", ""10.1021/acsaem.1c01194"", ""10.1021/acsaem.1c01628"", ""10.1039/c2nr30347g"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.172"", ""10.1038/srep11922"", ""10.1039/C2DT31775C"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.03.064"", ""10.1039/b805091k"", ""10.1002/adfm.200901292"", ""10.1039/C3NR05456J"", ""10.1100/2012/127326"", ""10.1039/b005921h"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2020.03.108"", ""10.1016/j.cplett.2019.137070"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-64653-6"", ""10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102425"", ""10.1002/er.7590"", ""10.1002/er.4538"", ""10.1002/er.7677"", ""10.1016/j.physb.2022.413704"", ""10.1039/D1TA03544D"", ""10.1016/j.polymer.2021.124092"", ""10.1016/j.jphotochem.2021.113760"", ""10.1002/adsu.202100025"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c01882"", ""10.1016/j.tsf.2007.05.090"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.07.117"", ""10.1039/c3ra43643h"", ""10.1063/1.4757007"", ""10.1088/0031-8949/84/06/065703"", ""10.1039/c2ra20962d"", ""10.1021/jp2122196"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.156628"", ""10.12693/APhysPolA.113.731"", ""10.1016/j.tsf.2015.06.058"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.08.027"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.10.106"", ""10.1557/jmr.2017.357"", ""10.1021/acs.iecr.8b03882"", ""10.1016/j.jpcs.2010.08.021"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.087"", ""10.1021/am3018493"", ""10.1039/C4RA11881B"", ""10.1016/j.optmat.2021.111610"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.125177"", ""10.1016/j.jphotochem.2020.112514"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.12.043"", ""10.1063/1.3645616"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.06.015"", ""10.1021/acsomega.0c01614"", ""10.1021/jp212517k"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2016.05.007"", ""10.1039/b310907k"", ""10.1039/c0cp02249g"", ""10.1021/jp3096727"", ""10.1016/j.egyr.2018.01.007"", ""10.1021/nl101198b"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b02543""]","['Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Polymers and Plastics']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)]]"

Considerable efforts have been made to increase the Voc of DSSCs by suppressing charge carrier recombination dynamics, co‐sensitization, and other strategies. Herein, we report an enhancement of the Voc by the incorporation of Cu into TiO2 microstructure via microwave‐assisted hydrothermal synthesis. The prepared nanoparticles and the photoanodes were tested for their efficacy with various structural, optical, and electrical characterization tools. It was found that the incorporation of Cu2+ into TiO2 lattice raises its conduction band (CB) edge and shifted the Fermi level upwards, which contribute towards enhanced Voc. A significant enhancement in Voc from 0.714 to 0.781 V was observed by the Cu incorporation. An optimized 1 wt% Cu modified TiO2 DSSC has shown an efficiency of 6.94% with a high Voc of 0.762 V.","[{""name"": ""Kirti Sahu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics S.N.G.P.G.

If the operation of a battery pack is controlled and monitored thoroughly, the safety in the battery system of an electrified aircraft can be guaranteed. The battery model has many applications in battery management systems such as battery performance analysis and fault detection. To achieve an accurate fault diagnosis for electric aircraft, an intelligent fault detection scheme within an accurate battery cell model is required. In this study, an adaptive lithium‐ion battery model is proposed in which models' parameters are estimated by a supervised machine learning paradigm. This adaptive battery model is developed based on a second order equivalent circuit model, which has a good representation of lithium‐ion batteries dynamics. Comparative verification experiments show good accuracy and robustness of the machine learning‐based parameter estimator lead to an accurate battery model with an average error less than 0.4%. Moreover, to see the effectiveness of this machine learning‐based model in fault detection applications, a model‐based fault diagnosis scheme is developed. Finally, the analysis of fault diagnosis tests under different test conditions proves that the proposed adaptive battery model can significantly improve the fault diagnosis accuracy of batteries.","[{""name"": ""Seyed Reza Hashemi"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Energy &amp; Sensor Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Akron  Akron Ohio USA""]}, {""name"": ""Afsoon Bahadoran Baghbadorani"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Energy &amp; Sensor Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Akron  Akron Ohio USA""]}, {""name"": ""Roja Esmaeeli"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Energy &amp; Sensor Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Akron  Akron Ohio USA""]}, {""name"": ""Ajay Mahajan"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Energy &amp; Sensor Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Akron  Akron Ohio USA""]}, {""name"": ""Siamak Farhad"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Energy &amp; Sensor Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering The University of Akron  Akron Ohio USA""]}]","[""10.1002/er.5211"", ""10.1002/est2.158"", ""10.1002/9781119682035.ch10"", ""10.1002/htj.21740"", ""10.1016/j.egyai.2020.100007"", ""10.1002/cpe.5073"", ""10.1038/s41560-019-0356-8"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.154"", ""10.1016/j.est.2018.04.020"", ""10.1002/jnm.2541"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2020.3012964"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2018.09.007"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817655"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2017.11.031"", ""10.1016/j.isatra.2019.08.004"", ""10.1109/TIE.2014.2336599"", ""10.1002/er.5500"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.07.348"", ""10.1002/er.3954"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.02.032"", ""10.3390/en11061358"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.12.083"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.134"", ""10.1002/er.5159"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-61464-7"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2019.01.783"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.104"", ""10.3390/en6105231"", ""10.1016/j.est.2017.08.004"", ""10.1115/POWER2018-7476"", ""10.1177/0037549714534301"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2015.05.002"", ""10.1002/er.5784"", ""10.1109/IGESSC47875.2019.9042399"", ""10.3390/en12040660"", ""10.1007/BF00994018"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2018.11.053"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2764869"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2016.03.015""]",['Engineering'],"['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

Although the 5G engineering standard may be deployed for operating networks currently using frequencies extending from 100s to 1,000s of MHz, it can also operate in the 10s of GHz where the wavelengths are 10 mm or less, the so-called millimeter wave (MMW) band. Until now, such fields were found in a limited number of applications (e.g., airport scanners, automotive collision avoidance systems, perimeter surveillance radar), but the rapid expansion of 5G will produce a more ubiquitous presence of MMW in the environment. While some 5G signals will originate from small antennas placed on existing base stations, most will be deployed with some key differences relative to typical transmissions from 2-4G base stations. Because MMW do not penetrate foliage and building materials as well as signals at lower frequencies, the networks will require “densification,” the installation of many lower power transmitters (often called “small cells” located mainly on buildings and utility poles) to provide for effective indoor coverage. Also, “beamforming” antennas on some 5G systems will transmit one or more signals directed to individual users as they move about, thus limiting exposures to non-users. In this paper, COMAR notes the following perspectives to address concerns expressed about possible health effects of RF field exposure from 5G technology. First, unlike lower frequency fields, MMW do not penetrate beyond the outer skin layers and thus do not expose inner tissues to MMW. Second, current research indicates that overall levels of exposure to RF are unlikely to be significantly altered by 5G, and exposure will continue to originate mostly from the “uplink” signals from one’s own device (as they do now). Third, exposure levels in publicly accessible spaces will remain well below exposure limits established by international guideline and standard setting organizations, including ICNIRP and IEEE. Finally, so long as exposures remain below established guidelines, the research results to date do not support a determination that adverse health effects are associated with RF exposures, including those from 5G systems. While it is acknowledged that the scientific literature on MMW biological effect research is more limited than that for lower frequencies, we also note that it is of mixed quality and stress that future research should use appropriate precautions to enhance validity.

Developing cross-section-scale understanding of these systems necessitates structural interpretation. However, over the past several decades a false distinction has arisen between some forms of so-called fault-related folding and buckle folding. We investigate the origins of this confusion and seek to develop unified approaches for interpreting fold–thrust belts that incorporate deformation arising both from the amplification of buckling instabilities and from localized shear failures (thrust faults). Discussions are illustrated using short case studies from the Bolivian Subandean chain (Incahuasi anticline), the Canadian Cordillera (Livingstone anticlinorium) and Subalpine chains of France and Switzerland. Only fault–bend folding is purely fault-related and other forms, such as fault-propagation and detachment folds, all involve components of buckling. Better integration of understanding of buckling processes, the geometries and structural evolutions that they generate may help to understand how deformation is distributed within fold–thrust belts. It may also reduce the current biases engendered by adopting a narrow range of idealized geometries when constructing cross-sections and evaluating structural evolution in these systems.","[{""name"": ""Robert W.

In the current study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by green approach from methanolic leaf extract ofBlighia sapida. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging assay, determination of total reductive potential, total phenolics content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) of the synthesized AgNPs. SEM analysis revealed that the size of the synthesized silver nanoparticles ranged from 50-70 nm with maximum UV-vis absorbance at 413 nm. DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of the synthesized AgNPs increased in a dose dependent manner as compared to ascorbic acid the standard reference used. This result confirmed thatBlighia sapidais a potential biomaterial for synthesizing AgNPs which can be exploited for its antioxidant activity.","[{""name"": ""AO Akintola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""BD Kehinde"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""PB Ayoola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""AG Adewoyin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""OT Adedosu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JF Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SB Ogunsona"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb27444.x"", ""10.26719/1998.4.2.350"", ""10.1136/jcp.54.3.176"", ""10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.001"", ""10.1073/pnas.91.23.10771"", ""10.1007/BF02253564"", ""10.1113/expphysiol.1997.sp004024"", ""10.1096/fasebj.6.9.1612291"", ""10.1093/jn/122.suppl_3.636"", ""10.1021/jf0303924"", ""10.1002/jsfa.2740310705"", ""10.14720/aas.2006.87.2.15105"", ""10.1016/j.addr.2009.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2007.05.009"", ""10.1021/nn300652p"", ""10.1002/jbm.b.31615"", ""10.1021/nn3008383"", ""10.1016/j.addr.2011.10.007"", ""10.7897/2230-8407.080457"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0473-z"", ""10.1016/j.foodres.2004.05.003"", ""10.1080/15563650600584410"", ""10.1016/S0021-9673(99)01281-9"", ""10.1186/1746-4269-6-12"", ""10.5530/pj.2018.2.63"", ""10.1007/s12668-015-0181-x"", ""10.1155/2011/650979"", ""10.1002/ptr.687"", ""10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00355.x"", ""10.1080/13102818.2017.1282836"", ""10.1016/S0378-8741(03)00036-9"", ""10.1016/j.sjbs.2013.02.003"", ""10.1021/jf0307595"", ""10.1006/abbi.2001.2692"", ""10.1021/np9904509""]","['Materials Science', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Plant Science', 'Pharmacology']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('1007 药学', 0.7158), ('1008 中药学', 0.7084), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7039), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.6954), ('1001 基础医学', 0.6922)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('1007 药学', 0.768), ('1008 中药学', 0.754)]]"

During the coprecipitation, a stable NaxMnyAlzO2 polynary metal oxide with Mn and Al molar ratio to 3:1 shows a special micromorphology similar to that of reed leaves, which makes it have a more ideal electrochemical specific surface area and ample mass transfer channels for rapid sodium‐ion insertion and desorption. Electrochemical test indicates that reed‐leaves like NaxMnyAlzO2 polynary metal oxides as active material for sodium‐ion capacitor exhibit a very excellent reversibility and low electrochemical (Rct = 434 Ω) and concentration polarization (DNa+ = 2.2728 × 10−11 cm2 s−1). Specific discharge capacity can achieve to 73.76 F g−1 at 100 mA g−1 current density corresponding to 368.8 m2 g−1 electrochemical specific surface area. After 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate can be maintained at 81.81%. In addition, reed‐leaves like NaxMnyAlzO2 polynary metal oxide playing a good depolarization role combined with Na3V2(PO4)3 active materials in the mass ratio to 7:3 can bring about the most excellent electrochemical performances.","[{""name"": ""Kedi Cai"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Chemistry and Materials Engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China"", ""Liaoning Engineering Technology Research Center of Supercapacitor Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Xueqin Jing"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Chemistry and Materials Engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuting Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Chemistry and Materials Engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Lan Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Experiment Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoshi Lang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Chemistry and Materials Engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China"", ""Liaoning Engineering Technology Research Center of Supercapacitor Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}]","[""10.1038/s41467-020-15244-6"", ""10.1002/er.5374"", ""10.1002/er.4722"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2020.100947"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.11.040"", ""10.1002/er.7150"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139723"", ""10.1002/er.4486"", ""10.1016/j.matt.2021.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.086"", ""10.1021/acsami.0c22616"", ""10.1002/er.6294"", ""10.1038/s41467-020-15938-x"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.07.354"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.126"", ""10.1002/er.5239"", ""10.1039/C7TA08970H"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b21257"", ""10.1002/smll.201702864"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c03461"", ""10.1016/j.est.2017.07.009"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135868"", ""10.1002/er.7169"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2018.10.016"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.018"", ""10.1039/C8NR09391A""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

Its main purpose is to study the behavior of materials properties under irradiation in a neutron flux able to simulate the same effects in terms of relevant nuclear responses as those expected in the first wall of the DEMO reactor which is envisaged to follow ITER. It is thus a key facility to support the design, licensing and safe operation of DEMO as well as of the fusion power plants that will be developed afterwards.

10.1002/er.8334,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,State of charge estimation of supercapacitors based on multi-innovation unscented Kalman filter under a wide temperature range,"SummarySupercapacitors are characterized by a long service lifetime and high power density, which can meet the instantaneous high‐power demand during the acceleration of electric vehicles. In this study, a fractional‐order model is developed to simulate the polarization effect and charging/discharging characteristics of supercapacitors, considering the precision of the electrochemical model and the amount of calculation of the equivalent circuit model and using the adaptive genetic algorithm to identify the parameters. The accurate prediction of the state of charge (SOC) can improve efficiency, prolong the service lifetime, and ensure the safety of supercapacitors. This study proposes a multi‐innovation unscented Kalman filter algorithm based on the fractional‐order model to improve the SOC estimation accuracy. The proposed algorithm is compared with other algorithms and analyzed under different temperatures and operating conditions to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating the SOC and tracking the terminal voltage. Experimental results show that the root mean squared error and mean absolute error of the proposed algorithm are less than those of the other algorithms. The proposed algorithm accurately estimates the SOC and tracks the terminal voltage. The maximum root mean squared error and mean absolute error of SOC estimation error are 1.8% and 1.78%, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Yonghong Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of MOE, Beijing Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion, Faculty of Environment and Life Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongguang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of MOE, Beijing Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion, Faculty of Environment and Life Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Fubin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of MOE, Beijing Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion, Faculty of Environment and Life Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Liang Tong"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Beijing Information Science and Technology University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Dong Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of MOE, Beijing Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion, Faculty of Environment and Life Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yifan Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of MOE, Beijing Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion, Faculty of Environment and Life Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jing Ren"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of MOE, Beijing Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion, Faculty of Environment and Life Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Lili Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of MOE, Beijing Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion, Faculty of Environment and Life Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yan Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Enhanced Heat Transfer and Energy Conservation of MOE, Beijing Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer and Energy Conversion, Faculty of Environment and Life Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.seps.2021.101215"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113949"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.110048"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101603"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2912501"", ""10.1002/er.7121"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.054"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121075"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.033"", ""10.1109/TIA.2019.2947235"", ""10.1016/j.mejo.2019.02.006"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912221"", ""10.1007/s00034-018-0968-4"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.04.033"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.01.066"", ""10.1016/j.aeue.2017.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.aeue.2017.03.027"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.10.024"", ""10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.02.021"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.226696"", ""10.1109/TEC.2016.2521324"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2021.3059561"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228677"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101889"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2016.2629440"", ""10.1109/TIE.2019.2941151"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227149"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2767550"", ""10.1038/s41598-021-91241-z"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229824"", ""10.1155/2021/6670873"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.02.051"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116541"", ""10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100537"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114169"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2022.123773"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2021.111408"", ""10.1002/er.7360"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.05.059"", ""10.3390/en10050679""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

These systems optimize power production at a single location by harnessing both the wind and the waves. Wave energy is currently at an earlier development stage than offshore wind. Research in this area is focused in wave energy converters being used for platform motion suppression of floating offshore wind turbines. Wave energy converters can passively shelter offshore wind turbines from waves and can also be actively controlled to reduce the system loads. Additionally, a small amount of supplemental power may be generated, which can be used for offshore wind turbine local power needs. There may be future benefits to these hybrid systems, but at this stage wave energy may increase the project cost and risk of offshore wind turbines. Hybrid wind wave system research and development is discussed, with a focus on floating offshore wind turbines. Additionally, two ocean demonstration scale hybrid wind and wave systems are discussed as case studies: the Poseidon Wave and Wind system and the W2Power system. Hybrid wind wave systems show potential to be part of the future of offshore wind energy.","[{""name"": ""Kaylie L.

10.1002/er.8137,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Multiple structural defects in poor crystalline nickel-doped tungsten disulfide nanorods remarkably enhance supercapacitive performance,"SummaryTailoring the multiple structure defects of nanomaterials by developing efficient construction is a captivating approach to designing unique electroactive materials for supercapacitors with performance improvement. Here, we in situ synthesize Ni‐doped tungsten disulfide nanorod arrays on nickel foam (Ni‐doped WS2/NF NRs) by a hydrothermal technique procedure. These multiple structural defects in poor crystalline Ni‐doped WS2/NF NRs construction configuration by abundant interconnected nanorods would reveal plentiful oxidational/redox‐active states that supply porous/conductive skeletons for quick electrolyte/ion electrons transportations. Favoring its doped conductive effect and synergetic structure of multiple‐like Ni‐doped on WS2, the as‐designed Ni‐doped WS2/NF NRs electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 242.9 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, outstanding cycling stability of 6000 long cycles with capacity retention79.8% at 20 A g−1, which is higher than that of binary WS2 electrode. This outstanding performance arises from enhanced conductivity and richer active sites in the multiple structural electroactive materials. This research offers an efficient treatment to explore multiple structural morphologies and architectures of energy storage applications.","[{""name"": ""Yedluri Anil Kumar"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Seoul National University of Science and Technology  Seoul Republic of Korea"", ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Center for Nanofibres and Nanotechnology National University of Singapore  Singapore Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Bandar Ali Al‐Asbahi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics and Astronomy, College of Science King Saud University  Riyadh Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Mohan Reddy Pallavolu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering Yeungnam University  Gyeongsan Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sunkara Srinivasa Rao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechatronics Engineering Kyungsung University  Busan South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Ramesh Reddy Nallapureddy"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering Yeungnam University  Gyeongsan Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Seeram Ramakrishna"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Center for Nanofibres and Nanotechnology National University of Singapore  Singapore Singapore""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.12.166"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.03.079"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2017.09.113"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.09.259"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230333"", ""10.1039/C9NJ05529K"", ""10.1063/1.5090310"", ""10.1039/D0DT00268B"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.038"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2018.11.116"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101619"", ""10.1016/j.est.2018.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2015.05.105"", ""10.1039/C4EE03229B"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2019.135261"", ""10.1039/C5CS00580A"", ""10.1002/adma.201200197"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151734"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101623"", ""10.1016/j.synthmet.2015.06.010"", ""10.1039/c3cc41048j"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.05.211"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.086"", ""10.1039/C8NJ05401K"", ""10.1039/c3nr33927k"", ""10.1016/j.mattod.2021.10.019"", ""10.1039/C4TA01245C"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.159234"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161234"", ""10.1016/j.mattod.2016.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.03.340"", ""10.1016/j.mssp.2019.03.030"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.162"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2018.08.019"", ""10.1007/s10854-019-01593-6"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.127"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.073"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.102091"", ""10.1016/j.mtadv.2019.100053"", ""10.1007/s42452-020-2515-8"", ""10.1016/j.microc.2021.106583"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.04.002"", ""10.1007/s10008-017-3813-y"", ""10.1039/c4ra00448e"", ""10.1039/C6TA02249A"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2019.2896208"", ""10.1002/er.6690"", ""10.1021/nl400258t"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b00808"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.154745"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.03.069"", ""10.1098/rsos.180953"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.122305"", ""10.1002/aenm.201601234"", ""10.1039/C6TA03111K"", ""10.1039/D0QI01460E"", ""10.1039/c2jm35307e"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2020.124175"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124253""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

The effect of its hypothesized amalgamation is generally ignored in mantle convection models claiming the transition from Rodinia to Pangaea represents a single supercontinent cycle. We apply three geodynamic scenarios to Pannotia amalgamation that are tested using regional geology. Scenarios involving quasi-stationary mantle convection patterns are not supported by the geological record. A scenario involving feedback between the supercontinent cycle and global mantle convection patterns predicts upwellings beneath the Gondwanan portion of Pannotia and the arrival of plumes along the entire Gondwanan (but not Laurentian) margin beginning at c. 0.6 Ga. Such a scenario is compatible with regional geology, but the candidates for plume magmatism we propose require testing by detailed geochemical and isotopic studies. If verified, this scenario could provide geodynamic explanations for the origins of the late Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic Iapetus and Rheic oceans and the terranes that were repeatedly detached from their margins.","[{""name"": ""J.

In our previous study, the Bounded Information Bottleneck Autoencoder (BIB-AE) architecture for generating photon showers in a high-granularity calorimeter showed a high accuracy modeling of various global differential shower distributions. In this work, we investigate how the BIB-AE encodes this physics information in its latent space. Our understanding of this encoding allows us to propose methods to optimize the generation performance further, for example, by altering latent space sampling or by suggesting specific changes to hyperparameters. In particular, we improve the modeling of the shower shape along the particle incident axis.","[{""name"": ""Erik Buhmann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sascha Diefenbacher"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Engin Eren"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Gaede"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gregor Kasieczka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anatolii Korol"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katja Krüger"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1088/1742-6596/664/7/072024"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.042003"", ""10.1007/s41781-017-0004-6"", ""10.1103/PhysRevD.97.014021"", ""10.1007/s41781-018-0008-x"", ""10.1007/s41781-018-0019-7"", ""10.21468/SciPostPhys.10.6.139"", ""10.1007/s41781-021-00056-0"", ""10.1007/JHEP04(2021)280"", ""10.1016/S0168-9002(03)01368-8"", ""10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177704472""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Medicine']","['Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)]]"

To determine this, it is necessary to find the distance between the location where the driver is located and which Temporary Shelter is available. This study aims to find the distance between the location of drivers and Temporary Shelters using the Haversine formula that can produce a distance between two points on the surface of the globe. The study was conducted by taking the location of drivers and Temporary Shelters in the form of coordinate points, calculating the distance between the points where drivers and Temporary Shelters are located, and comparing the results of distances obtained. The results of the study are a list of drivers and Temporary Shelters’ distances from the smallest order. With the selection of visits from the closest distance first, it is expected that drivers can save costs and travel time taken to visit all Temporary Shelters and end up at Waste End Processing Sites.","[{""name"": ""Rezania Agramanisti Azdy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Febriyanti Darnis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.24003/emitter.v5i2.220"", ""10.1109/SKIMA.2014.7083518"", ""10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016251"", ""10.1109/CITSM.2016.7577575"", ""10.1088/0031-9120/48/6/731""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Mechanical Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Computer Science Applications']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.8068), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7887)]]"
10.2298/NTRP2002138M,NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,EXTENS THEORETICAL STUDY OF GAMMA-RAY SHIELDING PARAMETERS USING EPDXY RESIN-METAL CHLORIDE MIXTURES,"Gamma-ray detection and studying its interactions with matter is very important and serves in many fields of research. Besides, investigation of new shielding materials against gamma-ray will provide a lot of solutions for several problems accompanied by the presence of radiation sources in wide areas of applications, such as industry, medicine, agriculture, research laboratories, and nuclear power plants. In the present work, different gamma-ray attenuation parameters will be calculated theoretically using different metal chlorides mixed with epoxy resin polymers at different weight ratios. These attenuation parameters were calculated in a wide energy range started from 0.05 up to 3 MeV. This wide energy range covers almost the most known radionuclide gamma-ray energies. The obtained results were compared with pure epoxy resin polymer to show how well the modification of polymer properties was when mixed with other materials. Also, all mixture's attenuation parameters results were compared with lead metal results to check its validity as a gamma-ray shielding material. The obtained results found to be promising and the presented materials can be used instead of lead metal as an effective material in radiation protection.","[{""name"": ""Chaitali More"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad, India""]}, {""name"": ""Pravina Pawar"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad, India""]}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Badawi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon + Physics Department, Faculty of Sciences, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Abouzeid Thabet"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Medical Equipment Technology, Faculty of Allied Medical Sciences, Pharos University in Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt""]}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)]]"

These include remains of organisms within the size range of pollen grains ( c. 10–250 µm), resistant to laboratory treatments used for the preparation of palynological samples. NPPs are a large and taxonomically heterogeneous group of remains of organisms living in diverse environments. Taxonomically, they belong to a wide variety of groups such as cyanobacteria, algae, vascular plants, invertebrates and fungi. The aim of this chapter is to provide a general overview of NPP groups observed in palynology slides. It includes more than 40 of the most common groups starting with acritarcha, cyanobacteria and algae, moving through transitional groups to animals and fungi and finishing with human-made objects such as textile fibres. Although far from complete, it provides an updated overview of taxonomical diversity of NPPs and their indicator values. Further works on NPP identifications are of great importance to improve our current knowledge. Since NPPs occur in all kinds of sediments, their analysis is a powerful tool for reconstructing environmental changes over time. Further detailed studies of specific NPP groups and their indicator values will open the way for new fields of study.","[{""name"": ""Lyudmila Shumilovskikh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Palynology and Climate Dynamics, Georg-August-University Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany"", ""Research Laboratory ‘Herbarium’, National Research Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia""]}, {""name"": ""Jennifer M.

The rheological study is performed to expose the mechanical property of metallogel. The flake‐like morphological patterns are found through FESEM microstructural investigations. The formation strategy, crystalline nature, and thermal behavior of the Cu‐TA metallogel are also studied. The optical and electrical properties of Cu‐TA metallogel are exhaustively scrutinized, and the measured data show that Cu‐TA metallogel is semiconducting in nature. The electrical analysis indicates that the conductivity of Cu‐TA metallogel increased up to ~four times under illumination (7.49 × 10−5 S m−1) rather than the nonirradiation condition (1.83 × 10−5 S m−1). The measured I‐V characteristics of Cu‐TA metallogel‐based thin‐film metal‐semiconductor (MS) junction devices under irradiation and nonirradiation conditions show a nonlinear rectifying behavior, typical of a Schottky diode (SD).","[{""name"": ""Subhendu Dhibar"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry Visva‐Bharati University  Santiniketan West Bengal India""]}, {""name"": ""Arka Dey"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Jadavpur University  Kolkata West Bengal India"", ""Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Material Sciences S.

10.1002/er.8406,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Investigation of copper/cobalt MOFs nanocomposite as an electrode material in supercapacitors,"SummaryMOFs (Metal‐organic frameworks) emerging as newest materials with porous structure and ease to synthesize results in new material growth with enhanced surface area. Nanocrystalline copper‐metal organic framework (Cu‐MOF), cobalt‐metal organic framework (Co‐MOF), and copper/cobalt metal organic framework (Cu/Co MOF) nanocomposite have been synthesized via superficial cost‐effective hydrothermal method by using trimesic acid in order to restrict nano‐particle growth. X‐ray powder diffraction of the synthesized material indicates a reduction in the c‐lattice parameter for Cu/Co nanocomposite to value 8.062 Å. Existence of oxygen, copper, chromium, and cobalt inside the Cu/Co MOF nanocomposite is indicative of successful nanocomposite synthesis whereas surface morphology gives a fall in particle growth resulting value 3.53 nm. PL (Photoluminescence) spectra showing reduction in peaks whereas Raman spectra demonstrate the presence of both copper and cobalt peaks inside the nanocomposite. Electrochemical studies were analyzed using IM KOH as an electrolyte resulting in enhanced specific capacitance of 228 Fg−1 for Cu‐MOF, 280 Fg−1 for Co‐MOF, and 935.8 Fg−1 for Cu/Co MOF nanocomposite respectively. Galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) analysis reveals power density value increment from 1092 Wkg−1 to 2495.5 Wkg−1 for Cu/Co MOF nanocomposite with energy density value decreases to 45.2 WhKg−1 allowing rapid ions transport at electrode/electrolyte interface suggesting Cu/Co MOF nanocomposite as a high performance electrode material with maximum storage capacity in supercapacitors.","[{""name"": ""Zeerak Maliha"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics The Women University  Multan Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Malika Rani"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics The Women University  Multan Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""R.

In the present work, lead‐free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 compound has been used as an absorber in the layered structure of PSC. This compound has been studied in details for its physical properties (electronic and optical) using the first principle calculation. Additionally, a lead‐free PSC is designed in SACPS‐1D simulation software with cell configuration of FTO/TiO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/Spiro‐OMeTAD/Au and studied for its various parameters useful for its applications in PSCs. Initially, the device is optimized under experimental counterpart to validate the simulation study and further various other material parameters such as band‐gap, defect density, thickness of absorber, series resistance and operating temperature are optimized to deliver improved performance. The final optimized lead‐free double PSCs exhibited power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.68%, open‐circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.90 V, current density (JSC) of 11.09 mA/cm2 and fill factor (FF) of 66.61%.

The primary objectives of wind farm control include increasing power production, reducing turbine loads, and providing electricity grid support services. Additional objectives include improving reliability or reducing external impacts to the environment and communities. In 2019, a European research project (FarmConners) was started with the main goal of providing an overview of the state-of-the-art in wind farm control, identifying consensus of research findings, data sets, and best practices, providing a summary of the main research challenges, and establishing a roadmap on how to address these challenges. Complementary to the FarmConners project, an IEA Wind Topical Expert Meeting (TEM) and two rounds of surveys among experts were performed. From these events we can clearly identify an interest in more public validation campaigns. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the mechanical loads and the uncertainties concerning the effectiveness of wind farm control are considered two major research gaps.","[{""name"": ""J.

Its practical application is limited because of difficulty in storage due to low energy density and safety issues. Solid‐state electrochemical hydrogen storage is a promising method among several approaches of hydrogen storage to meet the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) targets. Till 2020, no hydrogen storage material has achieved targets due to lack of proper strategies. In view of meeting targets decided by U.S. DOE, a detailed review of whole progress made in electrochemical hydrogen storage approaches and materials is presented. The reported hydrogen storage capacities of Graphene (1.21 wt.%), reduced Graphene Oxide (2.7 wt.%), Mg‐based alloys (up to 7.6 wt.%), hydrogen clathrates (up to 4.2 wt.%), Pervoskite oxides (up to 4 wt.%), and Nd2Sn2O7 (up to 14.86 wt.%) are consolidated at one place and disclosed. The shortcomings hindering current hydrogen storage technologies are summarized and the scope of future improvement in hydrogen storage is outlined. Emerging materials and technologies are mentioned which can progress towards achieving U.S. DOE targets. This review can assist researchers in choosing an appropriate strategy or potential material for electrochemical hydrogen storage.Highlights Achievements in electrochemical hydrogen storage are reviewed.

10.1002/er.6186,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,State of charge estimation framework for lithium-ion batteries based on square root cubature Kalman filter under wide operation temperature range,"SummaryDue to the significant influence of temperature on battery charging and discharging performance, exact evaluation of state of charge (SOC) under complex temperature environment becomes increasingly important. This paper develops an advanced framework to estimate the SOC for lithium‐ion batteries with consideration of temperature variation. First, an accurate electrical model with wide temperature compensation is established, and a series of experiments are carried out under wide range time‐varying temperature from −20°C to 60°C. Then, the genetic algorithm is leveraged to identify the temperature‐dependent model parameters. On this basis, the battery SOC is accurately estimated based on the square root cubature Kalman filter algorithm. Finally, the availability of the proposed method at different temperatures is validated through a complicated mixed working cycle test, and the experimental results manifest that the devised framework can accurately evaluate SOC under wide time‐varying temperature range with the maximum error of less than 2%.","[{""name"": ""Jiangwei Shen"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Transportation Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Jian Xiong"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Transportation Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Xing Shu"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Transportation Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Guang Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering and Materials Science Queen Mary University of London London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Yuanjian Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Queen's University Belfast Belfast UK""]}, {""name"": ""Zheng Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Transportation Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming China"", ""School of Engineering and Materials Science Queen Mary University of London London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Yonggang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmissions &amp; School of Automotive Engineering Chongqing University Chongqing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.109"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.117957"", ""10.1002/er.4433"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.109334"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2019.2919709"", ""10.3390/app8122494"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.118262"", ""10.1109/TCST.2017.2664726"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.110015"", ""10.1109/ECCE.2018.8557414"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2736480"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228132"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780258"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.082"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.057"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2833858"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.026"", ""10.1002/er.5002"", ""10.3390/en6105088"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2018.09.204"", ""10.1109/TAC.2009.2019800"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113520"", ""10.1016/j.amc.2014.12.036"", ""10.1002/er.5784"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2721880"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2860050"", ""10.1002/er.4560"", ""10.1002/er.5435"", ""10.1002/er.5450"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.034"", ""10.1002/er.5687"", ""10.1063/1.4996713"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.099"", ""10.1007/s40314-017-0537-7""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

We propose that this body greatly conditioned the structural domains of the Cantabrian–Pyrenean fold-and-thrust belt during their evolution from hyperextension in Early Cretaceous times to shortening and inversion during the Cenozoic. This may be seen as a new line for cross-section construction and balancing, because previous cross-sections do not incorporate comparable volumes of exhumed mantle. Five structural cross-sections, constrained by the results of 3D gravity inversion, feed our discussion of the complexities of the doubly vergent Pyrenean orogen in view of the inversion of a precursor hyperextended rifted margin. In all sections, crustal rocks underthrust the lithospheric mantle in the hyperextended region, supporting that the near-surface exhumed mantle lithosphere acts as a more rigid buttress, allowing weaker continental material to be expelled outwards and upwards by thrusting during the Alpine collision; thus giving rise to two uplifted crustal triangular zones at the boundaries with the exhumed mantle. Contractional slip is localized in lithospheric-scale thrusts, which in turn reactivate parts of the extensional system. The NE–SW transfer zones that offset the rift therefore behave as compartmental faults during the orogenic phase. The amount of shortening increases from 34 km in the Cantabrian Cordillera, where the Basque–Cantabrian Basin partially preserves its original extensional geometry, to 135 km in the nappe stack of the central Pyrenees.","[{""name"": ""Jesús García-Senz"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Antonio Pedrera"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Conxi Ayala"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain"", ""Present address: Institute of Earth Sciences Jaume Almera (IJCJA-CSIC), Carrer Lluís Solé i Sabaris s/n, 08028 Barcelona, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Ana Ruiz-Constán"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Alejandro Robador"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Luis Roberto Rodríguez-Fernández"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), c/Ríos Rosas, 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511524851.031"", ""10.1002/2017TC004670"", ""10.1080/17445647.2015.1126538"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.S7-XVIII.6.1725"", ""10.1002/2015TC004019"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0675:MMFSCT>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1029/1999JB900390"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.251"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(86)90254-4"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(80)90166-1"", ""10.1306/M46497C23"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2004.02.013"", ""10.1111/bre.12187"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00019-7"", ""10.3989/egeol.85415-6720"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2012.04.018"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.07.009"", ""10.1007/s00531-015-1177-z"", ""10.1016/S0012-821X(97)00087-3"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(96)00123-9"", ""10.1130/GES01363.1"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-27889-x"", ""10.1146/annurev.ea.20.050192.001043"", ""10.1029/TC008i001p00023"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(73)90041-1"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2003.208.01.11"", ""10.1002/2013TC003471"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0715:LBACOS>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1029/TC008i005p01051"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-78849-9_15"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.273"", ""10.2113/gssgfbull.VI.2.287"", ""10.1002/2014TC003816"", ""10.1038/331508a0"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029<1023:SOSSPI>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1029/1999JB900321"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2010.06.020"", ""10.1016/B978-044452748-6/00097-3"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2015.10.020"", ""10.1029/2008TC002406"", ""10.1029/2010GC003218"", ""10.1306/12090909116"", ""10.1111/ter.12087"", ""10.1029/2009TC002588"", ""10.1144/jgs2016-002"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111<1808:COTGOF>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.06.017"", ""10.1007/s00531-002-0283-x"", ""10.1007/s00531-014-1023-8"", ""10.1130/G20565.1"", ""10.1111/ter.12104"", ""10.2973/dsdp.proc.48.154.1979"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_21"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(86)90058-1"", ""10.1111/ter.12240"", ""10.1029/2001JB000549"", ""10.1029/2001JB001667"", ""10.1029/2007JB005021"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2015.04.018"", ""10.1002/2017TC004716"", ""10.1029/2018TC005222"", ""10.1111/j.1365-246X.1995.tb06436.x"", ""10.1080/17445647.2015.1084545"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-3066-0_22"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(96)00114-X"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2015.08.046"", ""10.1038/nature09520"", ""10.1029/2010TC002735"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2015.12.005"", ""10.1029/TC008i001p00041"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2017.07.008"", ""10.1029/2003JB002514"", ""10.1029/2005JB003856"", ""10.1144/0016-76492010-072"", ""10.1029/JZ064i001p00049"", ""10.1002/tect.20019"", ""10.1144/gsjgs.153.2.0301"", ""10.1029/98TC00561"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2015.10.010"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2018.01.009"", ""10.1016/0031-9201(90)90082-9"", ""10.1002/2014TC003529"", ""10.1046/j.0956-540x.2001.01393.x"", ""10.1016/0264-8172(95)98854-X"", ""10.1306/M46497C9"", ""10.4095/208180"", ""10.1130/G37812.1"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(75)90151-X"", ""10.1190/1.1442298"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-809417-4.00017-3""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"
10.1002/er.6138,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Insights about sustainable biodiesel production from microalgae biomass: A review,"SummaryProduction of biodiesel from microalgae can be categorized as a symbiotic engineering solution focusing on energy and environmental problems. This review presents a collection of recent methods adopted for the production of biodiesel from microalgae. Microalgae are tiny cell factories which yield a large quantity of biomass by employing different methods of cultivation and using different types of harvesting techniques. Different strategies like nutrient starvation and micronutrient supplementation for hyper lipid accumulation to produce biodiesel for competing with the high market demand for fossil fuel are discussed. The use of different cultivation techniques for increasing the algal biomass in the recent scenario is focused. Also, improvement in the design strategies of bioreactors like the open pond, photobioreactors, and hybrid systems is included in the review. Further, diverse technologies for lipid improvement, including manipulating the bioprocess parameters and genetic engineering, are addressed. Also, microalgae for biorefinery approaches solve pollution problems, and its biomass can be used for biodiesel production which is elaborated in detail. The possibility of production of biodiesel from microalgae at a larger scale by overcoming the main bottlenecks in different steps of algal growth like high biomass cultivation, investment factor, and implementation of biorefinery approaches to address the current energy demand is also proposed.","[{""name"": ""Michael Rahul S"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biotechnology Kamaraj College of

10.2298/NTRP210110001A,NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,GAMMA ATTENUATION THROUGH NANO LEAD - NANO COPPER PVC COMPOSITES,"Polymer composites of polyvinyl chloride, PVC, were loaded up with micro and nano PbO/CuO particles. The added percentage of each by mass was 10 wt.%, 20 wt.%, 30 wt.%, and 40 wt.%, plus 40 wt.% of mixed composite (20 wt.% CuO + 20 wt.% PbO). The mass and linear attenuation coefficients of the investigated composites were measured as a function of gamma-ray energies going from 59.53 keV to 1408.01 keV utilizing standard radioactive point sources. To confirm the validity of these results the attenuation coefficients for bulk composites (PVC + PbO and PVC + CuO) were calculated by using the XCOM software. The results were in good agreement with the values obtained from the experimental work. By comparing the attenuation coefficients of the different composites it was found that those loaded with either nano PbO or CuO have higher values than those loaded with bulk sizes with the same percentage. Also, samples loaded with nano PbO have the highest attenuation coefficients even by comparing them with (20 wt.% CuO + 20 wt.% PbO), especially in the energy region below 1 MeV, but for greater energies, the values become very closed. The investigation of the mechanical properties of such composites due to the injection of bulk and nano metals reveals that tensile strength and Young's modulus of PVC nanocomposite sheets were notably increased with the increasing concentration of CuO and PbO nanoparticles. The CuO nanocomposite showed the highest values of flexural strength, toughness, and tensile strength among all the fabricated nanocomposite sheets.","[{""name"": ""Yehia Abbas"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmed El-Khatib"", ""affiliation"": [""Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Badawi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Mahmoud Alabsy"", ""affiliation"": [""Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Osama Hagag"", ""affiliation"": [""Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Port Said University, Port Said, Egypt""]}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Non-planarity of faults can be caused by variations in failure modes, which in turn are dictated by mechanical stratigraphy interacting with the ambient stress field, as well as by linkage of fault segments. Different portions of a fault or fault zone may experience volume gain, volume conservation and volume loss simultaneously depending on the position along a fault's surface, the stresses resolved on the fault and the associated deformation mechanisms. This variation in deformation style and associated volume change has a profound effect on the ability of a fault to transmit (or impede) fluid both along and across the fault. In this paper we explore interrelated concepts of failure mode and resolved stress analysis, and provide examples of fault geometry in normal faulting and reverse faulting stress regimes that illustrate the effects of fault geometry on failure behaviour and related importance to fluid transmission.

Though effective, the legacy controller for the 5-MW wind turbine uses a simple algorithm that is not up to date with many industry standards. Additionally, as the research community has advanced into fast-paced development cycles, as systems engineering tools such as Wind-Plant Integrated System Design &amp; Engineering Model (WISDEM ®) [1] are employed, and as a greater focus on controls co-design practices is encouraged, demand for a generic wind turbine controller has arisen. This work presents updates for the NREL 5-MW controller to a more modern control architecture, and establishes a generic tuning framework that can be easily adapted to various wind turbines. Based on initial results, the updated generic controller eases the automatic tuning process while maintaining or improving the performance of the legacy NREL 5-MW controller.","[{""name"": ""Nikhar J.

XRD results showed that the addition of MoO3 in the virgin PVP/PEO blend increases the amorphous domains of polymer nanocomposite (PNC) films. The DFT/FT‐IR results have established the miscibility and the interaction between PVP and PEO polymers via hydrogen bonds. Also, FTIR studies showed a coordination interaction between MoO3 nanoplates and the C=O group of PVP and/or the C‐O‐C group of PEO of the PVP/PEO blend. The optical band gap values of PNC films of PVP/PEO/MoO3 decreased with increasing MoO3 content. The relaxation processes and dielectric dispersion of the prepared PNC films were examined and discussed. The electrical conductivity was enhanced via the addition of MoO3 nanoplates because of an increase in the number density of the charge carriers. The dominated conduction mechanism of PNC films reveals the correlated barrier hopping model, while the type of relaxation process follows the non‐Debye one. These observations illustrate the applicability and potential uses of these PNC films as a nanodielectric material in ceramic capacitors and electrochemical applications such as devices of energy storage and separators in batteries.","[{""name"": ""A.A.

The skin model distinguishes the stratum corneum (SC) and the viable epidermis as the outermost layers of the skin. The analysis identifies the tissue layer structures that minimize reflection and maximize the temperature increase induced by the electromagnetic field. The maximum observed temperature increase is 0.4°C for exposure at the present power density limit for the general population of 10 W m −2 . This result is more than twice as high as the findings reported in a previous study. The reasons for this difference are identified as impedance matching effects in the SC and less conservative thermal parameters.

The stable center-of-mass energy ($$E_\mathrm{cms}$$ E cms ) is essential for the data taking. Online monitoring the $$E_\mathrm{cms}$$ E cms can help find the beam energy shift in time. Purpose The purpose is to monitor the $$E_\mathrm{cms}$$ E cms in DQM system in real time. Methods The $$E_\mathrm{cms}$$ E cms is measured using Bhabha scattering process in DQM system, due to its large cross section and low background level. The $$E_\mathrm{cms}$$ E cms is calculated from the invariant mass of $$e^{+}e^{-}$$ e + e - , and the correction value from radiation effect and momentum calibration. Result The $$E_\mathrm{cms}$$ E cms calculated with DQM system shows a good consistency with that from offline reconstruction within error. The results are validated with data taken in 2013. The overall systematic uncertainty includes 0.39 MeV/c$$^2$$ 2 from signal extraction and 2.54 MeV/c$$^2$$ 2 from calibration and radiation correction. Conclusions The $$E_\mathrm{cms}$$ E cms calculated from Bhabha scattering process is now available on DQM system in real time, which can be used as references for researchers to operate BESIII experiment.","[{""name"": ""Jiada Lu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yanjia Xiao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaobin Ji"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1142/S0217751X09046801"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2009.12.050"", ""10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2016-TUYA01"", ""10.1088/1674-1137/36/7/010"", ""10.1088/1674-1137/36/1/010"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2011.08.050"", ""10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2006.09.022"", ""10.1016/S0168-9002(03)01368-8"", ""10.1088/1674-1137/40/6/063001""]",['Physics and Astronomy'],"['Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Radiation']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)]]"

The coral‐like structured AB provides huge micropores and vast specific surface area for bonding sulfur, and supplies a 3D conductive matrix for enhancing the conductivity of composite. A plenty of ion channels served by PPY layer can promote the Li+ migration and alleviate the electrode polarization. In addition, the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte can be restrained by PPY coating. The volume variation of cathode in the charge‐discharge process can be relieved by the high elastic PPY layer combined with the 3D matrix of AB. The Li‐sulfur battery (LSB) with the AB/S@PPY cathode exhibits an extraordinary cycle stability and rate adaptability with the specific capacities of 1207.1 mAh g−1 at the initial discharge process and 884.4 mAh g−1 even after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.

With the increasing demand for precise management of lithium‐ion battery systems, the performance of the traditional CC method is no longer suitable for more complex working conditions. First, the battery aging, extreme temperature, and high‐rate discharging were considered as the main influencing factors which limit the SOC estimation accuracy of the CC method, and the performance degradation mechanism of the traditional CC method under the influence of the above factors are experimentally analyzed, especially the change of battery total dischargeable capacity after aging, and the change rules of key parameters in the CC equation are analyzed. Then the initial SOC and the total dischargeable capacity of the CC method are modified and estimated respectively to realize the accurate estimation of SOC under complex working conditions, especially the accurate SOC estimation during the whole life cycle of lithium‐ion batteries. The experimental results show that the improved CC method can effectively deal with complex working conditions, and the comprehensive estimation accuracy of SOC is within 3.6%.","[{""name"": ""Shun‐Li Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China"", ""Department of Energy Technology Aalborg University  Aalborg Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Xiong"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Chuan‐Yun Zou"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Lei Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Cong Jiang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Yan‐Xin Xie"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel‐Ioan Stroe"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy Technology Aalborg University  Aalborg Denmark""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.01.012"", ""10.1002/er.5690"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.195"", ""10.3390/en11010019"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.08.054"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.096"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.094"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2016.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.096"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.057"", ""10.1109/TCST.2014.2317781"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.07.065"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.034"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780258"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.11.057"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.099"", ""10.1177/0020294018770930"", ""10.6113/JPE.2016.16.1.27"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.236"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2798606"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2019.02.046"", ""10.3390/en11010059"", ""10.3390/en12071366"", ""10.1002/er.3530"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2017.2670081"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2795578"", ""10.1007/s11581-018-2444-3"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.09.016"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2017.2675920"", ""10.3901/JME.2011.18.115"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.10.153"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2018.04.015"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.02.031""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1515/ract-2023-0140,RADIOCHIMICA ACTA,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0703 Chemistry,"A closer inspection of the structural, mechanical, optical and radiation shielding properties of GeO2-doped magnesium-telluroborate glasses","Abstract GeO2-doped magnesium-telluroborate transparent glasses were synthesized in the current investigation using the traditional melt-quench procedure. XRD and FT-IR were used to examine the glasses’ structural properties. Following the measurement of the density, various physical parameters (including oxygen molar volume, oxygen packing density, etc.) were estimated and examined. From the FTIR results, one can deduce that clear structural alterations are seen which support the presence and conversion of BO3 and BO4 units. This is a result of the glass network forming more GeO4, TeO4, and BO4 units, which means that decreased NBO is forming, and more stiff networks are forming as a result. The increase in the overall stretching force constant of the glasses may also have an impact on the elastic moduli. The optical parameters were studied as optical energy band gap, Urbach energy and refractive index of the fabricated glass. According to the HVL data, the current glasses have a significant ability to lessen the intensity of gamma rays with lower energy. The glass with a small amount of GeO2 has a high HVL, whereas the glass with a higher amount of GeO2 has a lower HVL, as shown by the HVL data. The G5 glass demonstrated its superiority as a shielding glass over the other glass samples (G1–G4).","[{""name"": ""Khamis S.

Therefore, understanding landslide magnitude and distribution is central to marine and coastal hazard planning. We present the first submarine landslide database for the eastern margin of New Zealand comprising &gt;2200 landslides occurring in water depths from c. 300–4000 m. Landslides are more prevalent and, on average, larger on the active margin compared with the passive margin. We attribute higher concentrations of landslides on the active margin to tectonic processes including uplift and oversteepening, faulting and seamount subduction. Submarine landslide scars are concentrated around canyon systems and close to canyon thalwegs. This suggests that not only does mass wasting play a major role in canyon evolution, but also that canyon-forming processes may provide preconditioning factors for slope failure. Results of this study offer unique insights into the spatial distribution, magnitude and morphology of submarine landslides across different geological settings, providing a better understanding of the causative factors for mass wasting in New Zealand and around the world.","[{""name"": ""S.

10.1002/er.6150,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Role of SEI layer growth in fracture probability in lithium-ion battery electrodes,"SummaryUnderstanding of degradation mechanisms in batteries is essential for the widespread use of eco‐friendly vehicles. Degradation mechanisms affect battery performance not only individually but also in a coupled manner. Solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation deteriorates battery capacity through consuming available lithium ions. On the other hand, as the SEI layer grows over multiple cycles, the level of mechanical constraints is changed, which can affect the fracture behavior of the active particles. We investigate the effect of the SEI layer growth on the fracture probability of the electrode particles. The simulations show that as the SEI layer grows, tensile stress inside the active particles turns into compressive stress, reducing the probability of particle fracture. Once the SEI layer is fractured, the particle fracture is sequentially more likely to happen because the SEI constraint is removed. The study emphasizes that the stability of SEI layers is important because it helps in alleviating electrochemical performance fade as well as mechanical failure probability. In addition, the SEI layer on small particles tends to be more fractured than that on large particles, suggesting that the particle size uniformity is essential for reducing the fracture probability of the SEI layers at the electrode.","[{""name"": ""Yasir Ali"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical, Robotics and Energy Engineering Dongguk University  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Noman Iqbal"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical, Robotics and Energy Engineering Dongguk University  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Seungjun Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical, Robotics and Energy Engineering Dongguk University  Seoul South Korea""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2014.11.006"", ""10.1002/er.4397"", ""10.1002/er.3378"", ""10.1002/advs.201500213"", ""10.1002/anie.201710806"", ""10.1149/2.1441707jes"", ""10.1002/er.5196"", ""10.1149/2.0841702jes"", ""10.1007/s10853-016-0575-3"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.033"", ""10.1002/er.3459"", ""10.3389/fchem.2018.00517"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228019"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2010.05.072"", ""10.1038/s41524-018-0064-0"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.074"", ""10.1149/2.0391714jes"", ""10.1149/2.1331810jes"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.06.074"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(00)00427-4"", ""10.1021/acsaem.8b00344"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2016.12.014"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2012.01.058"", ""10.1002/er.5253"", ""10.1039/c4cp01968g"", ""10.1021/jp5018696"", ""10.1002/sia.6586"", ""10.1002/er.3496"", ""10.1149/1.1838511"", ""10.1039/c7ta02706k"", ""10.1021/nl300570d"", ""10.1149/1.1837858"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00277-5"", ""10.1149/2.1161412jes"", ""10.1021/ja017073i"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b05096"", ""10.1002/er.4410"", ""10.1002/er.3132"", ""10.1002/er.5096"", ""10.1002/er.3762"", ""10.1002/er.5022"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227501"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2019.02.007"", ""10.1149/1.1634273"", ""10.1002/er.4022"", ""10.1149/2.040310jes"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2008.05.032"", ""10.1149/2.0621805jes"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.010"", ""10.1149/2.0111810jes"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.021"", ""10.1149/2.082405jes"", ""10.1149/1945-7111/ab8479"", ""10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2016.12.020"", ""10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2018.05.014""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

10.1515/ract-2020-0008,RADIOCHIMICA ACTA,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0703 Chemistry,Production of Cf-252 and other transplutonium isotopes at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Abstract In 1957 Glenn T. Seaborg conceived and advocated for the construction of the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and the Transuranium Processing Plant (since then renamed the Radiochemical Engineering Development Center, or REDC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Heavily shielded hot cells, glove boxes, and laboratories allow recovery of transuranium elements produced in substantial quantities. Seaborg’s vision of HFIR and REDC producing milligram quantities of berkelium, californium, and einsteinium has been fulfilled beginning in 1966 through May 2019 with 78 production campaigns yielding a cumulative totals of 1.2 g of 249Bk, 10.2 g of 252Cf, 39 mg of 253Es, and 15 pg of 257Fm. Notably, 252Cf is a neutron source used in many industrial applications including oil exploration; process control systems for the cement industry, coal analysis, and power production; sources to start nuclear reactors and perform nondestructive materials analyses; homeland security and national defense detection devices; and medical research. Isotopes made available through transplutonium production at HFIR/REDC have enabled scientists to study the nuclear properties and reactions, chemical properties, optical properties, and solid-state properties of transplutonium elements. Long-lived isotopes have served as targets in heavy ion accelerators to produce heavier elements leading to the discovery of 104Rf, 105Db, 106Sg, 113Nh, 114Fl, 115Mc, 116Lv, 117Ts, and 118Og. This paper reviews the evolution of the processing flowsheets to produce, separate, and purify transplutonium isotopes, which have evolved over 50 years of operation at HFIR and REDC, and summarizes directions of future work to improve the efficiency of the production operations.","[{""name"": ""Sharon M.

This study reports the development of gold (Au) coated Fe3O4 (Au-Fe3O4 NPs) for photothermal therapy to eradicate breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The spherical shape of monodisperse Au-Fe3O4 NPs with an average size of 20.8 nm was confirmed by TEM. The cell viability evaluation of Au-Fe3O4 NPs showed negligible toxicity toward MCF-7 cells after 24 h. Significant cell reduction was observed for MCF-7 (73.9%) cells following photothermal therapy at highest concentration of NPs (50 μgFe/ml) for 10 minutes illumination when compared with other intervention groups. It can be concluded that, the synthesized Au-Fe3O4 NPs is an effective and promising photothermal therapy agent for breast cancer treatment.","[{""name"": ""M A Dheyab"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A A Aziz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M S Jameel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P M Khaniabadi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""B Mehrdel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""B M Khaniabadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b01961"", ""10.1049/mnl.2018.5557"", ""10.1016/j.jare.2010.02.002"", ""10.1021/acs.iecr.8b04708"", ""10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.022"", ""10.1080/09276440.2018.1511217"", ""10.1134/S0036023617060225"", ""10.1016/j.jmmm.2012.06.045""]",['Materials Science'],"['Materials Chemistry', 'Biomaterials', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7179), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7085)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

This alloy, formed applying the sol‐gel technique, was employed as anode in Ni‐MH accumulators. X‐ray diffractogram analysis showed the appearance of the compound spinel with cubic structure. In fact, the crystallite size, specified by the TEM technique, was equal to 30 nm. The hydrogen storage properties of zinc ferrite spinel alloy were examined applying various electromechanical methods (chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, and chronoamperometry) at the C/10 rate and at room temperature. The maximum discharge capacity value was almost equal to 145 mAh/g. After 100 cycles, a good cycling stability was attained and correlation between the (DH/a2) ratio and the discharge capacity as noticed. The electrolyte/ZnFe2O4 anode interface prior to and following activation was studied utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.","[{""name"": ""Wissem Zayani"", ""affiliation"": [""ENSIT, Laboratory of Mechanics, Materials and Processes (LR99ES05) University of Tunis  Tunis Tunisia""]}, {""name"": ""Samir Azizi"", ""affiliation"": [""ENSIT, Laboratory of Mechanics, Materials and Processes (LR99ES05) University of Tunis  Tunis Tunisia""]}, {""name"": ""Karam S.

The calculated HOMO‐LUMO energy (Eg) values of these designed molecules are less than alkoxy‐substituted benzothiadiazole and a rhodamine end group reference (R, Eg = 2.55 eV), whereas X8 shows the lowest (Eg = 2.17 eV) suggesting a greater charge transfer rate upon blending with donor polymer PTB7‐Th. The values of open‐circuit voltages for designed molecules are 2.30, 2.52, 2.23, 2.52, 2.37, 2.19, 2.53, and 2.18 V for X1‐X8, respectively, where X3, X6, and X8 shown lower voltages than the reference R (2.30 V). Similarly, the 0.13 eV difference of reorganization energy value of X1 compared to reference R, demonstrates higher charge transfer by X1 due to its lower hole mobility. The findings suggest potentially superior performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) fabricated with the designed molecules (X1‐X8).","[{""name"": ""Sabir Ali Siddique"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Organic Chemistry, School of Chemistry University of the Punjab  Lahore Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Sadia Altaf"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry University of Sialkot  Sialkot Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Ejaz Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Organic Chemistry, School of Chemistry University of the Punjab  Lahore Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Sabiha Naveed"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Organic Chemistry, School of Chemistry University of the Punjab  Lahore Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Bilal Ahmed Siddique"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Shandong University  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Riaz Hussain"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry University of Okara  Okara Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Department of Chemistry Dalian University of Technology  Dalian People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Abdul Rauf"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Chemistry The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Baghdad‐ul‐Jadeed Campus  Bahawalpur Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Arshad"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Chemistry The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Baghdad‐ul‐Jadeed Campus  Bahawalpur Pakistan""]}]","[""10.1007/s11708‐017‐0464‐8"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3444809"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.039"", ""10.1126/science.aal2324"", ""10.1007/s11082‐020‐02672‐3"", ""10.11648/j.ajop.20150305.17"", ""10.1021/accountsmr.1c00169"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2022.135182"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07626"", ""10.1002/poc.4119"", ""10.1016/j.comptc.2021.113454"", ""10.1016/j.comptc.2022.113606"", ""10.1515/zpch‐2016‐0790"", ""10.1002/aenm.202103977"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2016.06.018"", ""10.11648/j.ijrse.20140303.12"", ""10.1016/j.comptc.2021.113242"", ""10.1039/c6ta06987h"", ""10.1002/er.7751"", ""10.1002/chem.202104453"", ""10.1021/acsomega.1c05715"", ""10.1002/admi.201800882"", ""10.1038/s41598‐018‐20"", ""10.1002/aenm.201600637"", ""10.1002/aenm.201502109"", ""10.1002/adma.201602570"", ""10.1016/j.molliq.2019.111902"", ""10.1007/s11082‐020‐02482‐7"", ""10.1039/d0ee00714e"", ""10.1039/c5ee02871j"", ""10.1039/c9tc06238f"", ""10.1039/c8ee01150h"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.02.021"", ""10.1039/d1ra04529f"", ""10.1002/SLCT.202000096"", ""10.1002/QUA.26821"", ""10.1002/POC.4204"", ""10.1002/aenm.201701209"", ""10.1021/ct049977a"", ""10.1006/ffta.1997.0202"", ""10.1021/jo070827c"", ""10.1021/jo701740n"", ""10.1016/j.jmgm.2019.107480"", ""10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2007.06.037"", ""10.1002/ADMA.200501717"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b09256""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

The International Energy Agency (IEA) Wind Technology Collaboration Platform (TCP) Task 37 has recently developed a new RWT geared towards offshore floating-foundation applications: the IEA Wind 15 MW. The model has been implemented in two aeroelastic codes, OpenFAST and HAWC2, based on an underlying common ontology. However, these toolchains result in slightly different structural parameters, and the two codes utilise different structural models. Thus, to increase the utility of the model, it is necessary to compare the aeroelastic responses. This paper compares aeroelastic loads calculated using different fidelities of the blade model in OpenFAST (ElastoDyn and BeamDyn) and HAWC2 (prismatic Timoshenko without torsion and Timoshenko with fully populated stiffness matrix), where both codes use the DTU Basic controller and the same turbulence boxes to reduce discrepancies. The aeroelastic responses to steady wind, step wind and turbulent wind (per IEC 61400-1 wind class IB) are considered. The results indicate a generally good agreement between the loads dominated by aerodynamic thrust and force, especially for the no-torsion blade models. Discrepancies were observed in other load channels, partially due to differences in the asymmetric loading of the rotor and partially due to differing closed-loop dynamics, and they will be the subject of future investigations.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Rinker"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Evan Gaertner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frederik Zahle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Witold Skrzypiński"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nikhar Abbas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henrik Bredmose"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Garrett Barter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Katherine Dykes"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.10.333""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

The need for a reproducible method of thermal maturity assessment by means of Raman spectroscopic analyses on the organic matter is essential for the development of this technique as a robust support in organic petrographical analyses. The new method was tested on concentrated kerogen derived from a set of 33 samples that originated from cuttings from a 5000 m-thick section drilled in offshore Angola. The proposed method can be applied separately in the D and G bands regions of the Raman spectra, and uses a fitting approach based on asymmetrical Gaussian deconvolution and on the measurement of the integrated area. Results from this work demonstrate that Raman parameters carried out by the new methods reflect the increase in aromaticity in kerogen in diagenesis. Finally, two parametric equations have been proposed to correlate Raman parameters and thermal maturity: the first is for the thermal maturity interval between 0.3 and 1.5% R o ; and the second has a higher precision of between 1.0 and 1.5% R o . The two equations are the result of a multi-linear regression based on robust correlations between Raman parameters and vitrinite reflectance (R o %).","[{""name"": ""Andrea Schito"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sveva Corrado"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1046/j.1525-1314.2002.00408.x"", ""10.1016/S1386-1425(03)00070-2"", ""10.1016/j.vibspec.2016.08.014"", ""10.1098/rsta.2004.1448"", ""10.1016/j.chemphys.2004.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2016.07.039"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.61.14095"", ""10.1016/0016-2361(72)90079-8"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2010.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2018.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2014.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.saa.2008.09.006"", ""10.1111/j.1365-3121.2010.00956.x"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2007.01.008"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2015.11.010"", ""10.3389/fenrg.2017.00024"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2008.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2016.05.002"", ""10.1021/jp0128473"", ""10.1063/1.1710853"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.20.392"", ""10.1039/B613962K"", ""10.1002/jrs.2636"", ""10.1016/S0022-3093(98)00349-4"", ""10.1016/j.saa.2005.02.015"", ""10.1039/C5CP06519D"", ""10.1098/rsta.2004.1454"", ""10.1016/0146-6380(93)90042-A"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2005.02.018"", ""10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00221-5"", ""10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2016.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2017.02.003"", ""10.1295/polymj.4.460"", ""10.1016/0146-6380(86)90055-0"", ""10.1063/1.1674108"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2014.03.006"", ""10.1046/j.1525-1314.1996.05792.x"", ""10.1016/j.coal.2013.10.013""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Catalysis']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7169), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7168)]]"

The test cell consists in a 50 mm aluminum foam cube filled with a paraffin wax, heated and cooled on the same face. The heat flux is measured by two miniaturized sensors, while the temperature is measured in three different locations along the cube edge. Finally, one side is equipped with a Zinc Selenide window which is transparent to the long wave InfraRed. This system allows to track the paraffin melting front evolution together with the temporal trend of the whole temperature distribution simplifying the comparison with the numerical outputs at different time steps. The numerical model is then set with the same boundary conditions (heat flux) to predict the experimental temperature fields, considering both conduction in the solid domain and natural convection in the liquid domain. The preliminary validation shows that the numerical results match the experimental data with good agreement. Results are also presented for different gravity levels. This study can be a starting point for all those applications where gravity has a major role.","[{""name"": ""M Iasiello"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Mameli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Filippeschi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N Bianco"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2007.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.08.049"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.04.039"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2014.11.023"", ""10.1063/1.2802183"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.06.088"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.08.088"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/796/1/012032"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2011.07.019"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2011.11.001"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(75)90222-7"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(88)90096-8"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2018.12.002""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Computational Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

One model states that I-type granites form by partial melting of older crustal lithologies (amphibolites or intermediate igneous rocks). In another view, granites are trapped rhyolitic liquids occurring at the end of fractionation trends defining a basalt–andesite–dacite–rhyolite series. This paper explores the thermal implications of both scenarios, using a heat balance model that abstracts the heat production and consumption during crustal melting. Heat is consumed by melting and by losses through the surface (conductive or advective, as a result of eruption). It is supplied as a basal conductive heat flux, as internal heat production or as advective heat carried by an influx of hot basalt into the crust. Using this abstract approach, it is possible to explore the role different parameters play in the balance of granites formed by differentiation of basalts or by crustal melting. Two end-member situations appear equally favourable to generating large volumes of granites: (1) short-lived environments dominated by high basaltic flux, where granites result mostly from basalt differentiation; and (2) long-lived systems with no or minimal basalt flux, with granites resulting chiefly from crustal melting.","[{""name"": ""Jean-François Moyen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1029/94JB00112"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2016.02.037"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(78)90123-1"", ""10.1007/s00410-008-0351-8"", ""10.1144/0016-76492007-166"", ""10.1130/MEM174"", ""10.1093/petrology/egl004"", ""10.1093/petrology/egi084"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2012.06.032"", ""10.2113/GSELEMENTS.4.1.17"", ""10.1016/S0024-4937(98)00085-1"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2012.01.017"", ""10.1016/j.gca.2005.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2006.12.007"", ""10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00665.x"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2013.06.006"", ""10.1007/s004100050511"", ""10.1098/rsta.1984.0015"", ""10.1093/petrology/28.6.1111"", ""10.1016/j.tecto.2009.03.008"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.1995.095.01.05"", ""10.2113/gselements.7.4.235"", ""10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00107-1"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2011.07.004"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0535:HOTSAC>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/S0191-8141(98)00073-X"", ""10.1130/G37398.1"", ""10.1029/2009GC002540"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2016.09.033"", ""10.1093/petrology/27.1.219"", ""10.1093/petrology/25.4.894"", ""10.1002/gj.3350250307"", ""10.1029/2011JB008692"", ""10.1111/jmg.12211"", ""10.2465/jmps.160128"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2010.01.022"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-63901-1.00007-1"", ""10.1007/s00410-009-0482-6"", ""10.1111/ter.12010"", ""10.2475/01.2018.03"", ""10.1007/s00410-009-0408-3"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2010.12.017"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46792-3"", ""10.1093/petrology/egs046"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2015.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.gsf.2014.09.006"", ""10.1029/164GM03"", ""10.1111/j.1525-1314.2010.00906.x"", ""10.1093/petrology/egu074"", ""10.1130/0091-7613(2003)031<0529:HACGIO>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2010.09.015"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2016.09.018"", ""10.1007/s00410-014-1015-5"", ""10.1093/petrology/egp022"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2015.12.015"", ""10.1093/petrology/37.6.1491"", ""10.1007/978-1-4684-7335-3_11"", ""10.1080/08120098708729391"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2009.06.006"", ""10.1016/B0-08-043751-6/03016-4"", ""10.1130/G40246.1"", ""10.1016/0016-7037(70)90009-8"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2009.05.028"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2015.10.005"", ""10.1038/267315a0"", ""10.1016/S0024-4937(00)00058-X"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511807442"", ""10.1111/j.1365-3121.2010.00952.x"", ""10.1016/0040-1951(89)90169-8"", ""10.1016/0016-7037(95)00038-2"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2014.08.021"", ""10.1016/0191-8141(82)90021-9"", ""10.1029/JB094iB06p07685"", ""10.1038/nature07818""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

A numerical model of an onshore wind turbine was created with FAST software developed by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The structural and mechanical properties of the structure were calculated from the geometric properties of the tower and blades. The aerodynamic properties of different sections of the blades were computed with 2D models created with ANSYS Fluent. Having the wind turbine fully characterised, the control mechanisms were calibrated using data from the manufacturer catalogues. Numerous time series of wind excitation for different operation conditions were generated, and the structural response computed. Additionally, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) operating in parallel with a series of extensometers and accelerometers located in strategic points along a real wind turbine tower and blades provided a full description of the internal forces in both locations and the estimation of the modal properties for different operating conditions. Both measured and simulated response allowed the identification and validation of structural dynamic properties and static and dynamic internal loads. In spite of several approximations and simplifications, the results obtained with the numerical model were in good agreement with the ones measured in the field.","[{""name"": ""F Pimenta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Pacheco"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C M Branco"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C M Teixeira"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Magalhães"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Available geochemical and isotopic systematics of these granitoids suggest variations in the source and petrogenetic mechanisms. By compiling the available geochemical data, these granitoids can be classified into four groups, namely: TTGs (tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite); sanukitoids; biotite and two-mica granites; and hybrid granites. This classification scheme is in line with the global classification of Neoarchean granites, and enables the sources and petrogenetic mechanisms of these variants to be distinguished. Available geochemical, isotopic and geochronological datasets of these granitoids are integrated and the existing tectonic models for the Neoarchean EDC are reviewed. The variability of the EDC granitoids is ascribed to crustal reworking associated with the collision of two continental blocks. The tectonomagmatic evolution of the EDC is analogous to the development of the Himalayan Orogeny. Based on the evolutionary history of the Dharwar Craton, it can be concluded that convergent margin tectonics were operational in the Indian Shield from at least c. 3.3 Ga and continued into the Phanerozoic. However, the nature and style of plate tectonics could be different with time.","[{""name"": ""M.

In this study, a hybrid‐phase change material (PCM)‐liquid cooling system is designed for a battery module with eight prismatic cells under high charging current rates. Temperature rise, temperature distribution, and energy consumption of the cooling system are measured in experiments under 3C, 2.5C, and 2C fast charging. The results indicate that the highest coolant flow rate and the largest PCM thickness cannot achieve the optimal thermal performance. Therefore, appropriate coolant flow rate and PCM thickness selection ensure the cooling performance and reduce energy mass and volume consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the maximum temperature of the module can be decreased from 43°C to 35.6°C, 34.5°C, and 34.8°C by pure PCM, pure liquid cooling, and the hybrid PCM‐liquid cooling system under 3C fast charging; and temperature standard deviation (TSD) can be controlled within 0.9°C, 1.5°C, and 0.96°C, respectively. When the PCM thickness and coolant flow rate are set as 0.65 mm and 54 mL/min, respectively, the hybrid cooling system achieves the optimal thermal performance (maximum temperature: 34.8°C, TSD: 1°C) under 3C fast charging, and the energy consumption (459 J) can be controlled within the acceptable range.","[{""name"": ""Siqi Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Automotive Engineering Center Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""School of Automotive Studies Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Akhil Garg"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment &amp; Technology, School of Mechanical Science and Engineering Huazhong University of Science and Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Liang Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment &amp; Technology, School of Mechanical Science and Engineering Huazhong University of Science and Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Xuezhe Wei"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Automotive Engineering Center Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""School of Automotive Studies Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}]","[""10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00474-3"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.10.060"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.04.089"", ""10.1115/1.4048538"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.07.009"", ""10.1016/j.eng.2020.06.016"", ""10.1149/2.0171502jes"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.083"", ""10.1115/1.4045324"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.12.064"", ""10.1016/j.csite.2019.100543"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.100986"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120434"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.11.075"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115305"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.11.064"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.135"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.03.080"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.050"", ""10.1002/er.5132"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.024"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.143"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.12.157""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

10.1002/er.8375,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,3D two-phase and non-isothermal modeling for PEM water electrolyzer: Heat and mass transfer characteristic investigation,"SummaryA three‐dimensional, two‐phase, non‐isothermal proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer model was developed, aiming to reveal water and heat distribution characteristics and to explore the effects of various parameters on heat and mass transfer and performance of the electrolyzer. The results show that the electrolyzer performance depends on the combined effect of heat and mass, especially at high voltages. Although increasing the inlet velocity can accelerate the discharge of bubbles, it causes a larger temperature drop which degrades the performance. Increasing the inlet temperature can effectively improve the kinetic reaction rate of the catalyst layer and reduce the ohmic resistance of the membrane, which promotes the performance improvement. Decreasing the contact angle of anode gas diffusion layer (A‐GDL) and increasing its porosity is beneficial to the transport of liquid water and improves the performance, but excessive porosity leads to a rapid increase in the ohmic resistance of A‐GDL, and the optimal porosity range is 0.5 to 0.6. In addition, changes in A‐GDL porosity and contact angle have little effect on temperature. Decreasing the thickness of the membrane can significantly improve the performance, but accelerate the increase of the membrane temperature at high voltage.","[{""name"": ""Haoran Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""School of Automotive Engineering Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Kai Meng"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""School of Automotive Engineering Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Wenshang Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""School of Automotive Engineering Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Ben Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""School of Automotive Engineering Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}]","[""10.1002/er.6739"", ""10.1002/er.2942"", ""10.1002/er.7182"", ""10.1002/er.7953"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.09.140"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.05.027"", ""10.1007/s10800-009-0031-z"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.211"", ""10.1007/s11431-022-2026-6"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.026"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.01.095"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.06.103"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.02.096"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.09.153"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.045"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.07.129"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.118468"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.148"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.106"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.078"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.102"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.10.008"", ""10.1080/15435075.2020.1854270"", ""10.1007/s11431-021-1810-9"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.02.170"", ""10.1002/er.4472"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.065"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.048"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.12.178"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.069"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.12.103"", ""10.1002/er.4319"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.111"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117357"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120311"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.123045""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)]]"

ICRP 50, 2021) on the use of dose quantities in radiological protection, under the same authorship as this Memorandum. Here, we present a brief summary of the main elements of the report. ICRP Publication 147 consolidates and clarifies the explanations provided in the 2007 ICRP Recommendations (Publication 103) but reaches conclusions that go beyond those presented in Publication 103. Further guidance is provided on the scientific basis for the control of radiation risks using dose quantities in occupational, public and medical applications. It is emphasised that best estimates of risk to individuals will use organ/tissue absorbed doses, appropriate relative biological effectiveness factors and dose–risk models for specific health effects. However, bearing in mind uncertainties including those associated with risk projection to low doses or low dose rates, it is concluded that in the context of radiological protection, effective dose may be considered as an approximate indicator of possible risk of stochastic health effects following low-level exposure to ionising radiation. In this respect, it should also be recognised that lifetime cancer risks vary with age at exposure, sex and population group. The ICRP report also concludes that equivalent dose is not needed as a protection quantity. Dose limits for the avoidance of tissue reactions for the skin, hands and feet, and lens of the eye will be more appropriately set in terms of absorbed dose rather than equivalent dose.","[{""name"": ""J D Harrison"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Balonov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Bochud"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C J Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""H-G Menzel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Smith-Bindman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Ortiz-López"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J R Simmonds"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Wakeford"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.mrrev.2016.07.008"", ""10.1259/bjr/25922439"", ""10.1177/0146645318759620"", ""10.1667/RR3049"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/aa6a68""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"

This article presents an overview of results on effects of exposure to low linear-energy-transfer radiation in radiobiology and epidemiology accumulated over the last decade and discusses their impact on the use of the LNT model in the assessment of radiation-related cancer risks at low doses. The knowledge acquired over the past 10 years, both in radiobiology and epidemiology, has reinforced scientific knowledge about cancer risks at low doses. In radiobiology, although certain mechanisms do not support linearity, the early stages of carcinogenesis comprised of mutational events, which are assumed to play a key role in carcinogenesis, show linear responses to doses from as low as 10 mGy. The impact of non-mutational mechanisms on the risk of radiation-related cancer at low doses is currently difficult to assess. In epidemiology, the results show excess cancer risks at dose levels of 100 mGy or less. While some recent results indicate non-linear dose relationships for some cancers, overall, the LNT model does not substantially overestimate the risks at low doses. Recent results, in radiobiology or in epidemiology, suggest that a dose threshold, if any, could not be greater than a few tens of mGy. The scientific knowledge currently available does not contradict the use of the LNT model for the assessment of radiation-related cancer risks within the radiological protection system, and no other dose-risk relationship seems more appropriate for radiological protection purposes.","[{""name"": ""Dominique Laurier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yann Billarand"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dmitry Klokov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Klervi Leuraud"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s00247-020-04803-0"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181b08a20"", ""10.1016/j.mrrev.2018.04.001"", ""10.1186/1471-2407-9-89"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/ac670d"", ""10.1038/nrc3536"", ""10.1289/ehp.931009"", ""10.3390/ijms19040970"", ""10.1093/jncimonographs/lgaa009"", ""10.1007/s00018-003-2226-5"", ""10.2174/138920111794295701"", ""10.1667/RR15015.1"", ""10.1667/RADE-21-00059.1"", ""10.1007/s10654-019-00599-y"", ""10.1073/pnas.2235592100"", ""10.1007/s00411-006-0029-4"", ""10.1667/RR14583.1"", ""10.1007/s00204-009-0412-4"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2016.03.040"", ""10.1016/j.cbi.2018.11.020"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2022.112973"", ""10.1080/09553002.2021.2020363"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/ac1611"", ""10.1007/s00411-021-00938-2"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/ab294a"", ""10.1667/RR15127.1"", ""10.1177/1559325820949066"", ""10.1177/15593258211059317"", ""10.1007/s00411-017-0728-z"", ""10.2967/jnumed.118.217182"", ""10.1002/ijc.32887"", ""10.1007/s00432-013-1455-8"", ""10.1002/ijc.27749"", ""10.1667/RR14492.1"", ""10.1667/RADE-20-00158.1"", ""10.1007/s00018-018-2987-5"", ""10.1111/j.1349-7006.2007.00641.x"", ""10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-1059"", ""10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/acbda7"", ""10.1093/jncimonographs/lgaa010"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000001157"", ""10.1007/BF00620887"", ""10.1667/RR2892.1"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2005.11.002"", ""10.1177/0146645321994213"", ""10.1007/s00411-021-00947-1"", ""10.1016/S2352-3026(15)00094-0"", ""10.1007/s00411-020-00890-7"", ""10.1016/S2352-3026(18)30092-9"", ""10.1016/j.envint.2021.106983"", ""10.1148/radiol.2511081686"", ""10.1007/s00411-022-00996-0"", ""10.1007/s00586-020-06573-7"", ""10.1210/jc.2016-3529"", ""10.1667/RR15481.1"", ""10.1098/rsob.150011"", ""10.1126/science.abg2538"", ""10.1126/science.66.1699.84"", ""10.17226/26434"", ""10.18632/oncotarget.4739"", ""10.1667/RR2629.1"", ""10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00610-2"", ""10.1136/bmj.h5359"", ""10.1097/EDE.0000000000000761"", ""10.1006/bcmd.1999.0225"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-407703-4.00003-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.07.017"", ""10.1007/s00411-015-0613-6"", ""10.1080/09553002.2017.1310405"", ""10.1016/j.mrgentox.2021.503436"", ""10.1667/RR15386.1"", ""10.1093/jncimonographs/lgaa008"", ""10.1016/j.cbi.2019.01.013"", ""10.1177/1559325818777326"", ""10.1667/RR1946.1"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/aad348"", ""10.1080/09553002.2017.1319090"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0045394"", ""10.1002/ijc.32275"", ""10.1016/j.cbi.2018.11.013"", ""10.1007/s00411-017-0707-4"", ""10.1093/carcin/bgab042"", ""10.18632/oncotarget.19203"", ""10.1007/s00411-006-0032-9"", ""10.1148/radiol.2511080671"", ""10.1051/radiopro:2007007"", ""10.1667/RADE-20-00170.1"", ""10.1002/ijc.32014"", ""10.1038/35056049"", ""10.1002/bies.201100022"", ""10.1093/carcin/bgq087"", ""10.1016/j.mednuc.2019.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2006.01.002"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/ac591c"", ""10.1667/RADE-21-00158.1"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000416"", ""10.1080/09553002.2020.1708499"", ""10.7150/jca.72628""]",['Medicine'],"['Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7106), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7025)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)]]"

Spain is one of the countries experiencing severe consequences from the COVID‐19 pandemic outbreak. In such a situation, when the population is quarantined, hospitals are crowded, and industries are shutting down; energy supply becomes a critical and “hard to predict” service. In this way, the study of the impact of COVID‐19 on the selling price of electricity in Spain is highlighted more comprehensively. Given the high level of uncertainty in global energy markets, there is a research gap that needs to be filled, that is, the creation of new decision support mechanisms that can reduce risks and ensure more significant forecasting for investments and energy management to deal with seemingly unprecedented effects experienced through the current pandemic. This study examines and develops econometric models to determine the impact of COVID‐19 on the Spanish electricity market. This article's main result is a framework that predicts the dynamic electricity market's behavior during shifting periods, that is, the COVID‐19 pandemic period. Noteworthy that the result of this article is useful in electricity market management and strategic developments.","[{""name"": ""Nima Norouzi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy Engineering and Physics Amirkabir University of Technology  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Gerardo Z.

A highly stable rhombohedral phase of LAZP is noticed at room temperature, with a discharge capacity of 909 mAh.g−1, which is 1.6 times higher than that of LZP. Further, the highly stable charge storage performance is observed up to 3000 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99%. For the first time, we investigated the in‐situ temperature effect on the discharge capacity of the assembled anode material, found a strong effect on the discharge capacity, and achieved ~120 and 149 mAh.g−1 at 65°C for LZP and LAZP anodes. Furthermore, the real‐time charge holding effect of LAZP cell is performed with the computer, the cell worked well in the CMOS battery slot without a CMOS battery error during CPU turn‐on condition for 1536 h. In brief, an optimized electrode material of LAZP showed greater stability and capacity with high efficiency compared with LZP even at elevated temperatures. Hence, LAZP may be utilized to fabricate a coin cell for real time applications.","[{""name"": ""Bhargav Akkinepally"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Yeungnam University  Gyeongsan Republic of Korea"", ""School of General Education Yeungnam University  Gyeongsan Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""I.

In this study, fly ashes and bottom ash were characterized from technical and radiological aspects. Health effect due to the activity of radionuclides 226Ra, 232Th and 40K was estimated via radium equivalent activity (Raeq), external hazards index (Hex), the external absorbed dose rate (D) and annual effective dose rate (EDR). The specific surface area (40.25 m2 g−1), particle density (1.88 g cm−3) and LOI (23.49%) were typical for bottom ash. Siliceous fly ash contained 32% reactive silica. The annual effective dose rate for all ashes is ≤ 0.2 mSv y−1.

Sophisticated predictions of lithology and porosity are being made from seismic data in reservoirs with good borehole log and core calibration for detailed integration with structural, palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic interpretations. Geologists can now characterize entire carbonate platform systems and their large-scale evolution in time and space, including systems with few outcrop analogues such as the Lower Cretaceous Central Atlantic ‘pre-salt’ carbonates. The papers introduced in this review illustrate opportunities, workflows and potential pitfalls of modern carbonate seismic interpretation. They demonstrate advances in knowledge of carbonate systems achieved when geologists and geophysicists collaborate and innovate to maximize the value of seismic data from acquisition, through processing to interpretation. Future trends and developments, including machine learning and the significance of the energy transition, are briefly discussed.","[{""name"": ""James Hendry"", ""affiliation"": [""Iapetus Geoscience Ltd, Unit 7, Watson &amp; Johnson Centre, Mill Road, Greystones, Co.

The leg-out PBI models were developed in female and male WAG/RijCmcr rats at doses of 12.5–14.5 Gy. Rats received supportive care consisting of fluids and antibiotics. Gastrointestinal ARS (GI-ARS) was assessed by lethality to d 7 and diarrhea scoring to d 10. Differential blood counts were analyzed between d 1–42 for the natural history of hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS). Lethality and breathing intervals (BI) were measured between d 28–110 to assess delayed injury to the lung (L-DEARE). Kidney injury (K-DEARE) was evaluated by measuring elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) between d 90–180. The LD50/30, including both lethality from GI-ARS and H-ARS, for female and male rats are 14.0 Gy and 13.5 Gy, respectively, while the LD50/7 for only GI-ARS are 14.3 Gy and 13.6 Gy, respectively. The all-cause mortalities, including ARS and L-DEARE, through 120 d (LD50/120) are 13.5 Gy and 12.9 Gy, respectively. Secondary end points confirmed occurrence of four distinct sequelae representing GI, hematopoietic, lung, and kidney toxicities after leg-out PBI. Adult rat models of leg-out PBI showed the acute and long-term sequelae of radiation damage that has been reported in human radiation exposure case studies. Sex-specific differences were observed in the DRR between females and males. These rat models are among the most useful for the development and approval of countermeasures for mitigation of radiation injuries under the FDA animal rule.","[{""name"": ""Brian L.

This work aims to accurately measure the unexplored cross section 70Zn(p,x)67Cu in the energy range 45–70 MeV and to evaluate its potential advantages in the case of high-intensity proton beams provided by compact cyclotrons. Thin target foils of enriched 70Zn were manufactured by lamination at the INFN-LNL and irradiated at the ARRONAX facility using the stacked-foils method. A radiochemical procedure for the separation of Cu, Ga and Zn contaminants and the isolation of 67Cu from the irradiated material was developed. The efficiency of the chemical processing was determined for each foil by monitoring the activity of selected tracer radionuclides (61Cu, 66Ga and 69mZn) through γ-spectrometry. Experimental data of the 70Zn(p,x)67Cu, 64Cu, 67Ga, 66Ga, 69mZn, 65Zn cross sections were measured for the first time in the energy range 45–70 MeV and compared with the theoretical results obtained by using the TALYS code.

10.1002/er.6949,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Phase-change composites silicone rubber/paraffin@SiO2 microcapsules with different core/shell ratio for thermal management,"SummaryA series of paraffin (Pa)@silicon dioxide (SiO2) microcapsules with different core/shell ratios were constructed by interfacial‐polycondensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and γ‐Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS), and then were embedded in addition‐cure liquid silicone rubber (ALSR) to fabricate ALSR/Pa@SiO2 phase‐change composites. The SiO2 shell can avoid the leakage of Pa. Meanwhile, the in‐situ modification of the SiO2 shell by MPS can enhance the interface bonding between Pa@SiO2 and ALSR, because the C═C bond introduced by MPS on the SiO2 shell can participate in the curing reaction of ALSR. The study explored the effects of the core/shell ratio on the Pa@SiO2 microcapsules and ALSR/Pa@SiO2 composites. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis demonstrated that ALSR/Pa@SiO2 composites have dependable thermal energy storage capability which can reach to 90.7 J g−1 and phase‐change enthalpy of the composites increase with the core/shell ratio. The ALSR/Pa@SiO2 composites were found as form‐stable phase‐change materials with low leakage rate, which is attributed to the protection of both SiO2 shell and ALSR matrix. Due to the chemical interfacial interaction, the composites displayed improved mechanical strength. The composites can be used for thermal management and temperature regulation as an electronic packaging material.","[{""name"": ""Hao Deng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Environmental‐Friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Wenbin Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Environmental‐Friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Tianyu Cai"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Environmental‐Friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Fangfang He"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Environmental‐Friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Yongsheng Li"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Environmental‐Friendly Energy Materials, School of Materials Science and Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Kai Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of System Engineering China Academy of Engineering Physics  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Ren He"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of System Engineering China Academy of Engineering Physics  Mianyang China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.mattod.2014.04.003"", ""10.1080/09506608.2017.1301014"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2018.08.010"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2011.10.046"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.12.056"", ""10.3390/app9050902"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.04.041"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2018.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2015.12.009"", ""10.1039/C6TA06189C"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113830"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02200"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2018.01.025"", ""10.1007/s10973-015-5151-6"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2018.05.190"", ""10.1002/adfm.201203728"", ""10.1039/C4TA05448B"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.122831"", ""10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2006.12.019"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.103"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2010.05.020"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.06.061"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2015.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2010.06.012"", ""10.1039/C9SE00019D"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.043"", ""10.1039/D0RA04093B"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.01.042"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2013.09.035"", ""10.1039/C7TA06980D"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2019.110204"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2015.02.035"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.075"", ""10.1021/acsnano.0c03706"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2020.125317"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b04834"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.10.029"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2018.08.021"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b00321"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.01.045"", ""10.1002/er.3603"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2019.03.034"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.07.016"", ""10.1002/er.5498"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2014.07.013"", ""10.1016/S0032-3861(00)00652-2"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.10.024"", ""10.1021/acs.iecr.0c03194"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2009.05.008"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2012.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2015.08.048"", ""10.1021/ar400116c"", ""10.1016/j.physrep.2015.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2008.04.012""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1002/er.5304,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Performance characteristics of divergent chimney solar updraft tower plant,"SummaryA 3D computational model was developed to investigate the influence of divergence angle of chimney (θch) on the flow and performance characteristics of solar updraft tower (SUT) plant. The diameters of the chimney (Dch)i and air entrance gap (e) selected for numerical simulations were 0.6 m and 0.1 m, respectively. Parametric study was carried out by varying θch from 1° to 5° for different solar fluxes (600‐1200 Wm−2) and the outcomes were compared with cylindrical chimney (θch = 0°) SUT (CC‐SUT) plant. The effect of ambient temperature on the performance was also studied. A turbulent model (renormalization group k‐ɛ) was incorporated for considering the turbulence effect. Discrete ordinates model was used for estimation of radiation heat transfer inside the setup. It was found that the velocity of air at the chimney base was enhanced by 59.4% compared to a CC‐SUT plant. From the parametric study, it was observed that θch = 2° gives superior performance to the system than any other angle. Also, maximum performance was achieved at higher solar flux (I). The average absorber plate temperature increased from 313.3 to 350.3 K with increase in solar flux from 600 to 1200 Wm−2. The overall efficiency, and theoretical and actual power outputs of the divergent chimney‐SUT system were estimated and they were 0.0278%, 4.01 and 2.68 W, respectively. The net exergy efficiency (ψnet) of the system increased from 0.98% to 19.41% with increase in I from 600 to 1200 Wm−2 at θch = 2°. There was 55.2% increase in ψnet when θch increased from 1° to 2° and at I = 1200 Wm−2. Correlations were developed for the prediction of ψnet for different θch and at different I.","[{""name"": ""Pritam Das"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department National Institute of Technology Warangal  Warangal India""]}, {""name"": ""Chandramohan V.P."", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department National Institute of Technology Warangal  Warangal India""]}]","[""10.1080/01425918308909911"", ""10.1080/01425918408909921"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.01.091"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2010.08.014"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.08.043"", ""10.1002/er.2986"", ""10.1002/er.4007"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2013.05.022"", ""10.1080/15567036.2018.1477881"", ""10.1002/er.1191"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2012.03.018"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.04.215"", ""10.1002/er.1910"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2012.12.051"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.07.062"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.04.086"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.01.049"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.166"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2016.12.098"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.09.056"", ""10.3390/en9121077"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2015.11.005"", ""10.1051/meca/2016034"", ""10.1002/er.3510"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.100"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.041"", ""10.1007/s10973-018-7749-y"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2008.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.128""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

A four degree-of-freedom frequency-domain model is used for the dynamic response of the floating wind turbine subjected to wind and wave loads. The framework allows for integrated design optimization involving the geometrical properties of the floater and the mooring system and inclusion of long realizations of multiple load cases in the analysis. Analytical design sensitivities of the governing frequency-domain equations and the design requirements are developed. This ensures that modern numerical optimization methods can efficiently be used to solve the design problem. The framework is applied to sizing optimization of a spar-buoy floater including the mooring system. The inclusion of dynamic constraints in the design optimization is demonstrated. The optimization provides designs accurately satisfying optimality conditions in minutes.,"[{""name"": ""Suguang Dou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Antonio Pegalajar-Jurado"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shaofeng Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henrik Bredmose"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathias Stolpe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.egypro.2016.09.206"", ""10.5194/wes-3-693-2018"", ""10.5194/wes-4-527-2019"", ""10.1017/S0962492900002518"", ""10.1080/17445302.2016.1241365"", ""10.3390/jmse6040118"", ""10.1016/j.marstruc.2018.10.015"", ""10.1007/s40722-019-00134-x"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2013.12.035"", ""10.1080/0305215X.2018.1519559"", ""10.1016/j.marstruc.2020.102771"", ""10.2118/950149-G"", ""10.1080/17445302.2015.1089052"", ""10.1007/s40722-016-0072-4"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2014.01.017""]",['Engineering'],"['Aerospace Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

Herein, a literature review of published studies showing the evolution of lethal lung injury characteristic of the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure between the two significantly different exposure protocols, whole thorax lung irradiation and partial-body irradiation with bone marrow sparing in the nonhuman primate, is provided. The selection of published data was made from the open literature. The primary studies conducted at two research sites benefitted from the similarity of major variables; namely, both sites used rhesus macaques of approximate age and body weight and radiation exposure by LINAC-derived 6 MV photons at dose rates of 0.80 Gy min−1 and 1.00 Gy min−1 delivered to the midline tissue via bilateral, anterior/posterior, posterior/anterior geometry. An advantage relative to sex difference resulted from the use of male and female macaques by the Maryland and the Washington sites, respectively. Subject-based medical management was used for all macaques. The primary studies (6) provided adequate data to establish dose response relationships within 180 d for the radiation-induced lung injury consequent to whole thorax lung irradiation (male vs. female) and partial-body irradiation with bone marrow sparing exposure protocols (male). The dose response relationships established by probit analyses vs. linear dose relationships were characterized by two main parameters or dependent variables, a slope and LD50/180. Respective LD50/180 values for the primary studies that used whole thorax lung irradiation for respective male and female nonhuman primates were 10.24 Gy [9.87, 10.52] (n = 76, male) and 10.28 Gy [9.68, 10.92] (n = 40, female) at two different research sites. The respective slopes were steep at 1.73 [0.841, 2.604] and 1.15 [0.65, 1.65] probits per linear dose. The LD50/180 value and slope derived from the dose response relationships for the partial-body irradiation with bone marrow sparing exposure was 9.94 Gy [9.35, 10.29] (n = 87) and 1.21 [0.70, 1.73] probits per linear dose. A secondary study (1) provided data on limited control cohort of nonhuman primates exposed to whole thorax lung irradiation. The data supported the incidence of clinical, radiographic, and histological indices of the dose-dependent lung injury in the nonhuman primates. Tertiary studies (6) provided data derived from collaboration with the noted primary and secondary studies on control cohorts of nonhuman primates exposed to whole thorax lung irradiation and partial-body irradiation with bone marrow sparing exposure. These studies provided a summary of histological evidence of fibrosis, inflammation and reactive/proliferative changes in pneumonocytes characteristic of lung injury and data on biomarkers for radiation-induced lung injury based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging and gene expression approaches. The available database in young rhesus macaques exposed to whole thorax lung irradiation or partial-body irradiation with bone marrow sparing using 6 MV LINAC-derived radiation with medical management showed that the dose response relationships were equivalent relative to the primary endpoint all-cause mortality. Additionally, the latency, incidence, severity, and progression of the clinical, radiographic, and histological indices of lung injury were comparable. However, the differences between the exposure protocols are remarkable relative to the demonstrated time course between the multiple organ injury of the acute radiation syndrome and that of the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Thomas J.

Electric Vehicles (EVs) offers best efficient and cost effective solution for the above said issue, if the battery charging done by renewable energy conversion base routes when compared to conventional based route. EVs are using lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and it have many challenges like low efficiency at low and high temperatures, decline of electrode’s life at high temperature and safety concerns related to thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries are the directly impact on performance, reliability, cost and safety of the vehicle. Overheating caused by electron’s movements during chemical reactions during the charging and discharging process in elevated temperatures can lead to fatal destruction of the batteries. Hence an efficient battery thermal management system (BTMS) is one of the most necessary technologies for success of the electric vehicles in the long term. Hence, in this review paper, various types of battery thermal management system along with opportunities for advancement are reviewed. It is concluded that there is a lot of scope for future research in the BTMS for electric vehicles.","[{""name"": ""Sourav Singh Katoch"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Eswaramoorthy"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2011.07.096"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.11.010"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.09.001"", ""10.1149/1.3515880"", ""10.3390/en10101677"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00200-8"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.083"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.11.048"", ""10.1016/S0894-1777(03)00047-5"", ""10.1289/ehp.113-a246""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Similar activities have also been instituted worldwide, as the global threat of a radiological or nuclear incident continues to be a concern. Much of the USG’s efforts to plan for the unthinkable have centred on establishing clear lines of communication between agencies with responsibility for triage and medical response, and external stakeholders. There have also been strong connections made between those parts of the government that establish policies, fund research, oversee regulatory approval, and purchase and stockpile necessary medical supplies. Progress made in advancing preparedness has involved a number of subject matter meetings and tabletop exercises, publication of guidance documents, assessment of available resources, clear establishment of anticipated concepts of operation for multiple radiation and nuclear scenarios, and identification/mobilization of resources. From a scientific perspective, there were clear research gaps that needed to be addressed, which included the need to identify accurate biomarkers and design biodosimetry devices to triage large numbers of civilians, develop decorporation agents that are more amenable for mass casualty use, and advance candidate products to address injuries caused by radiation exposure and thereby improve survival. Central to all these activities was the development of several different animal constructs, since efficacy testing of these approaches requires extensive work in research models that accurately simulate what would be expected in humans. Recent experiences with COVID-19 have provided an opportunity to revisit aspects of radiation preparedness, and leverage those lessons learned to enhance readiness for a possible future radiation public health emergency.","[{""name"": ""Andrea L DiCarlo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mary J Homer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Norman Coleman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1667/RR3021"", ""10.1093/cid/cix097"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000249"", ""10.1002/ajim.22130"", ""10.1080/10903120701710595"", ""10.1017/S1049023X00006774"", ""10.1097/hp.0000000000000439"", ""10.1017/dmp.2017.86"", ""10.1001/dmp.2011.17"", ""10.1017/dmp.2018.163"", ""10.1089/hs.2017.0013"", ""10.1667/RR14619.1"", ""10.1182/blood-2008-04-150243"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncy141"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181c64f90"", ""10.1097/00004032-200411002-00008"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-140-12-200406150-00015"", ""10.1002/ddr.21163"", ""10.1097/hp.0000000000000318"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3182667309"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e31825f75a7"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e31826525f0"", ""10.1667/RADE-20-00120.1"", ""10.1080/095530000138538"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3182a32ccf"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3182a32b3f"", ""10.1042/CS20150778"", ""10.1016/S1040-8428(01)00227-X"", ""10.1093/neurosurgery/46.1.138"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181a6ee32"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncw226"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncw155"", ""10.1667/rr1880.1"", ""10.1667/RADE-20-00259.1"", ""10.1097/hp.0000000000000920"", ""10.1667/RR1295.1"", ""10.1667/RADE-21-00048.1"", ""10.1667/rr15137.1"", ""10.1197/j.aem.2006.03.567"", ""10.1001/dmp.2012.46a"", ""10.1111/nyas.13126"", ""10.1080/14740338.2018.1518429"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e318261175a"", ""10.1080/09553002.2019.1668981"", ""10.1080/09553002.2020.1820605"", ""10.1667/RR1485.1"", ""10.1208/s12248-016-9916-z"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000199"", ""10.1002/ddr.21165"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181c21273"", ""10.1007/s00411-020-00868-5"", ""10.1038/srep03689"", ""10.1093/rpd/nct218"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a081084"", ""10.1667/RADE-20-00188.1""]","['Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Health Professions']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Political Science and International Relations', 'Emergency Medical Services']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.6843), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.6838)]]"

We use physical models to investigate the impact of base-salt relief on deformation patterns. First, we investigate early-stage gravity gliding across base-salt relief. Salt flowing onto structural high blocks forms a zone of thickened salt and associated shortening owing to a flux mismatch. On the downdip edge of the basement high another flux mismatch generates a topographic monocline (ramp-syncline basin) with associated extensional and contractional hinges. With multiple base-salt high blocks, this structural pattern was repeated down the entire slope. Laterally discontinuous base-salt relief generated additional complexities such as major rotations of raft blocks and intervening diapirs as salt is channelled around and between base-salt relief. At the allochthonous level, regional dip, salt budget and base-salt relief influence flow patterns. Individual salt sheets spread sub-radially with streamlines skewed down the regional slope. As the canopy coalesced along allosutures, inward flow from the canopy peripheries dominated, driven by more vigorous flow from outer feeders owing to less competition for source-layer salt. Subsequent shortening returned flow patterns to grossly dip-parallel. However, salt flows fastest where it is thickest and thus chains of feeders channel rapid intracanopy flow.","[{""name"": ""Tim P.

10.1002/er.8374,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Facile synthesis of platelet-like zirconium tungstate nanostructures for high-performance supercapacitors,"SummaryIncreasing demand for electronic devices has sparked quantum of research work on energy storage systems. In the present work, we report the facile synthesis of platelet‐like Zirconium tungstate (ZrW2O8 NPs) binary metal oxide via co‐precipitation method. The ZrW2O8 NPs was confirmed by several physicochemical techniques. Furthermore, FESEM images proved the platelet‐like morphology of ZrW2O8 NPs. The as‐prepared ZrW2O8 NPs was used as electrode material in the fabrication of supercapacitors. ZrW2O8 NPs @ Ni foil shows the specific capacitance (Csp) maximum of 508 F g−1 at 5 mV/s and showed 91.3% of cyclic stability after 4000 GCD cycles. As a result, ZrW2O8 NPs was utilized as an anode electrode material to construct an asymmetric device, ZrW2O8 NPs || Activated carbon (AC). The as‐fabricated device showed the energy density of 9.65 Wh kg−1 related to the power density of 299.48 W kg−1. The effective supercapacitive behavior might be due to the unique morphological features, occurrence of multiple redox sites, and enhanced electrical conductivity of ZrW2O8 NPs. Thus, all these findings account for the applicability of ZrW2O8 NPs as electrode material in high‐performance supercapacitors.","[{""name"": ""Elaiyappillai Elanthamilan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials and Mineral Resources Engineering National Taipei University of Technology  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Srinivasan Rajkumar"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry Periyar Maniammai Institute of Science and Technology  Thanjavur India""]}, {""name"": ""Sea‐Fue Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials and Mineral Resources Engineering National Taipei University of Technology  Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Johnson Princy Merlin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry, Bishop Heber College (Autonomous) Affiliated to Bharathidasan University|  Tiruchirappalli India""]}]","[""10.1039/C6EE00158K"", ""10.1007/s11581-020-03681-8"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.05.007"", ""10.1039/C5TA05523G"", ""10.1007/s11581-020-03494-9"", ""10.1039/C8NJ01927D"", ""10.1039/C6CS00012F"", ""10.1039/C4RA05151C"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2019.113382"", ""10.1039/C9CP02536G"", ""10.1016/j.ica.2019.119393"", ""10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01373"", ""10.1021/acsenergylett.1c01855"", ""10.1039/D2NJ01041K"", ""10.1039/C8RA09081E"", ""10.1039/D1NJ03831A"", ""10.1039/C7NR08239H"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.157939"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2018.02.084"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.159876"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.04.090"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113972"", ""10.1016/j.ultsonch.2018.09.029"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136953"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2022.126188"", ""10.1002/er.7434"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.10.036"", ""10.1080/15685551.2016.1273436"", ""10.1098/rsos.172214"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2008.09.032"", ""10.1007/s10854-020-03624-z"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2019.07.005"", ""10.1039/D1NJ03410C"", ""10.1016/j.ijleo.2011.11.094"", ""10.1016/j.est.2021.103312"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.10.047"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.11.251"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.021"", ""10.1039/C8NJ00515J"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.11.041"", ""10.1007/s12034-016-1196-9"", ""10.1039/C6TA00078A"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.01.117"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2021.109384"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.146"", ""10.1039/C5CC08857G"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2020.07.017"", ""10.1002/smll.202104507""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

Further, WAAM geometry was modeled using simplified rectangular bead shape with five layers and three strings. The thermo-mechanical numerical simulation is conducted under consideration of non-linear isotropic hardening modeled by using general purposed FEM software MSC Marc/Mentat. In this simulation, different heat source models (Goldak’s double-ellipsoid and rectangular) are implemented and compared, whereby the later model was to be developed by using subroutine provided in the software. For analyzing the residual stress, separation technique between wall and substrate was introduced after the cooling down period. The outcome of this research is to develop an effective procedure to analyze the distortion and residual stress of wire arc additive manufacturing of stainless steel.","[{""name"": ""Siti Nursyahirah Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yupiter HP Manurung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muhd Faiz Mat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zaidi Minggu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Jaffar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Pruller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Leitner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.150"", ""10.1179/1743284715Y.0000000073"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2016.06.124"", ""10.1007/s40194-018-0556-z"", ""10.1007/s11665-014-0958-z"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2017.08.007"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201926905003"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.04.080"", ""10.1016/j.commatsci.2011.06.023"", ""10.12691/ajme-2-4-4"", ""10.1007/BF02667333"", ""10.1016/S0017-9310(99)00271-9"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2013.04.012""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

10.1002/er.8169,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Diffusion control and surface control mechanism in hierarchical nanostructured porous zinc-based MOF material for supercapattery,"SummaryIn this paper, we are reporting the zinc‐based metal‐organic framework nanomaterials for their application as a supercapattery device. The facile hydrothermal technique had been utilized to synthesize the MOF material. The surface morphology, crystallinity, and porosity were investigated with X‐ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, and energy dispersive X‐ray analysis. To study the ability of the synthesized material for the storage of charges, electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The specific capacity has been calculated from GCD curves and the material delivers 200 C/g at a current density of 0.7 A/g. This material revealed excellent performance in three‐electrode assembly and therefore coupled with activated carbon (Zn‐MOF//AC) to analyze the real energy and power density. This asymmetric assembly (supercapattery) had been tested with CV, GCD, and EIS. From all these characterizations, it was founded that the device was able to store charges of 172 C/g along with the excellent energy density and power density of 38.05 Wh/kg and 240 W/kg, respectively. The supercapattery revealed exceptional cyclic stability of 93.6% even after 2500 GCD cycles along with 100% of columbic efficiency. Furthermore, the diffusion‐controlled and surface‐controlled contributions were investigated for the assembled supercapattery, and it is found that the device stores energy through both the contributions. The maximum diffusive contribution by the device was 70.13% at the scan rate of 10 mV/s, which reaches to 42.75% at 100 mV/s scan rate. Likewise, the surface control contribution of the device was 29.86% at 10 mV/s, which rises up to 57.24% at 100 mV/s scan rate. These variations are attributed to the scan rates, which allow the ions to interact fast/slow with electrodes. Our analysis indicates that the synthesized material can be utilized as an interesting high‐performance electrode material for supercapattery devices.","[{""name"": ""Syeda Ramsha Ali"", ""affiliation"": [""Facultad de Ciencias Químicas Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, UANL  Av.

Detrital zircon dating is a technique that is increasingly applied to sedimentary provenance studies. However, sand routing information using zircon analysis alone may be obscured by repeated sedimentary reworking cycles and mineral fertility variations. These biases are illustrated by two clear case studies from the Triassic–Jurassic of the Barents Shelf where the use of U–Pb geochronology on apatite and rutile and Pb–Pb isotopic data from K-feldspar is highly beneficial for provenance interpretations. In the first case study, U–Pb apatite ages from the (Induan – Norian) Havert, Kobbe and Snadd formations indicate an evolving provenance and identify possible episodes of storage within foreland basins prior to delivery onto the Barents Shelf. In the second case study, U–Pb rutile and Pb isotopic analyses of K-feldspar from the Norian–Pliensbachian Realgrunnen Subgroup provide a clear distinction between north Norwegian Caledonides and Fennoscandian Shield sources and suggest that a similar approach may be used to test competing models for sand dispersal for this Subgroup in regions farther north than this study.","[{""name"": ""Michael J.

The methods comprise the vortex cylinder model, vortex dipole model, self-similar model, and wake projection model. The majority of the models presented account for yaw misalignments and ground effect. Actuator disk simulations are used to verify the individual models. The performance of each model is evaluated both in terms of precision and computational time. The induction models are coupled to wake models within the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State framework to provide the full velocity field within a wind farm. Sample wind farm computations are presented, and the impact of including induction effects into wind farm performance predictions is reported. The different codes are publicly available online.","[{""name"": ""Emmanuel Branlard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eliot Quon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander R.

As the technology is still in a pre-industrial state several questions remain to be addressed where little field data is available. This study uses physical modelling at a reduced scale to investigate the unsteady behaviour and the development of the wake in a simplified FOWT model. A porous disc model is placed in an atmospheric wind tunnel and subjected to a range of different motions. The effects of induced sinusoidal surge motion on the characteristics of the model’s wake at a fixed downstream distance of 4.6D are studied. First results show unchanged mean velocity values but modified turbulence intensity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles. Spectra taken in the wake show shifts to higher frequencies in the longitudinal flow component while the opposite is true for the vertical flow component. Further research into spatial characteristics of the wake are necessary to confirm these results.,"[{""name"": ""Benyamin Schliffke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sandrine Aubrun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Boris Conan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0376-0421(03)00078-2"", ""10.1002/we.515"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2011.10.011"", ""10.1007/s10546-009-9380-8"", ""10.1002/we.1805"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.06.030"", ""10.1002/we.545"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.10.375"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113605"", ""10.1002/we.2485"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2013.06.007"", ""10.1002/we.267""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

VCTs are based on computer simulations of human anatomy, imaging modalities and image interpretation. OpenVCT is an open-source framework for conducting VCTs of medical imaging, with a particular focus on breast imaging. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the OpenVCT framework in two tasks involving digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). First, VCTs were used to perform a detailed comparison of virtual and clinical reading studies for the detection of lesions in digital mammography and DBT. Then, the framework was expanded to include mechanical imaging (MI) and was used to optimise the novel combination of simultaneous DBT and MI. The first experiments showed close agreement between the clinical and the virtual study, confirming that VCTs can predict changes in performance of DBT accurately. Work in simultaneous DBT and MI system has demonstrated that the system can be optimised in terms of the DBT image quality. We are currently working to expand the OpenVCT software to simulate MI acquisition more accurately and to include models of tumour growth. Based on our experience to date, we envision a future in which VCTs have an important role in medical imaging, including support for more imaging modalities, use with rare diseases and a role in training and testing artificial intelligence (AI) systems.","[{""name"": ""Bruno Barufaldi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce Str., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Andrew D A Maidment"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce Str., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA""]}, {""name"": ""Magnus Dustler"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Carl-Bertil Laurells gata 9, Malmö 20502, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Rebecca Axelsson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Carl-Bertil Laurells gata 9, Malmö 20502, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Hanna Tomic"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Carl-Bertil Laurells gata 9, Malmö 20502, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Sophia Zackrisson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Carl-Bertil Laurells gata 9, Malmö 20502, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Anders Tingberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Carl-Bertil Laurells gata 9, Malmö 20502, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Predrag R Bakic"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce Str., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA"", ""Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Carl-Bertil Laurells gata 9, Malmö 20502, Sweden""]}]","[""10.1118/1.3697523"", ""10.1093/rpd/nch517"", ""10.1093/rpd/nch519"", ""10.1093/rpd/nch510"", ""10.1109/TMI.2005.862204"", ""10.1118/1.4815218"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41546-8_60"", ""10.1118/1.4800501"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/60/3/1259"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.5474"", ""10.1088/1361-6560/aa5dd9"", ""10.1117/1.JMI.7.4.042804"", ""10.2214/AJR.20.23429"", ""10.1118/1.4948502"", ""10.1109/JDT.2008.2001164"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31271-7_38"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2005.11.030"", ""10.1115/1.4005694"", ""10.1258/ar.2012.120238"", ""10.1007/s10549-013-2674-z"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncv417"", ""10.1007/s00330-014-3256-0"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.1965""]","['Computer Science', 'Medicine']","['Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7106), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7025)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1002/er.5806,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,UV-aided graphene oxide reduction byTiO2towardsTiO2/reduced graphene oxide composites for dye-sensitized solar cells,"SummaryElectron transport layer is one of the important layer in the dye‐sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) which is responsible for the transport of photo‐generated electrons by the dye to the outer circuit. TiO2 has been widely used as electron transport material in DSSCs. However, improving the electrical conductivity of TiO2 without sacrificing the surface area is one of the important strategies to improve the efficiency of the DSSCs. Here graphene oxide (GO) is added as an additive into the TiO2 network towards the preparation of TiO2/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composites by UV assisted photocatalytic reduction method. The RGO/TiO2 composites with different compositions of RGO were characterized and the performance of DSSCs using the prepared material as photoanode was studied. Furthermore, through the D and G band Raman peaks, the reduction of GO to RGO was confirmed. The optical properties of the prepared material were analyzed using UV‐visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence analysis, respectively. The carrier lifetime of the TiO2 and TiO2/RGO composites was studied using time resolved photoluminescence studies. The high‐resolution transmission electron microscope images of prepared TiO2/RGO composites were found to have sheet‐like structure surrounding the near spherical nanoparticles, which could be attributed to that of RGO and TiO2, respectively. The binding energy states of the prepared material were studied using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. The incorporation of RGO in TiO2 was found to improve the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of TiO2 and distribution of pores in TiO2 and TiO2/RGO composites was found to be uniform. The DSSCs were fabricated using the prepared TiO2 and TiO2/RGO composites as photoanodes and their power conversion efficiencies were analyzed.","[{""name"": ""Venkatraman Madurai Ramakrishnan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Coimbatore Institute of Technology  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu India"", ""Department of Engineering and Sciences Western Norway University of Applied Sciences  Bergen Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Muthukumarasamy N."", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Coimbatore Institute of Technology  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu India""]}, {""name"": ""Selvakumar Pitchaiya"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Coimbatore Institute of Technology  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu India"", ""Department of Engineering and Sciences Western Norway University of Applied Sciences  Bergen Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Agilan S."", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Coimbatore Institute of Technology  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu India""]}, {""name"": ""Arivalagan Pugazhendhi"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Research and Development Duy Tan University  Da Nang Vietnam""]}, {""name"": ""Dhayalan Velauthapillai"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Engineering and Sciences Western Norway University of Applied Sciences  Bergen Norway""]}]","[""10.1002/er.3764"", ""10.1021/acsaem.8b01345"", ""10.3390/chemosensors7040056"", ""10.1007/s10971-016-4178-x"", ""10.1016/0927-0248(96)00063-3"", ""10.1007/BF03183627"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.04.032"", ""10.1126/science.1102896"", ""10.1039/C5RA09620K"", ""10.1038/nmat1849"", ""10.1002/cssc.201601070"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.06.008"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-43726-1"", ""10.1039/C8NJ04559C"", ""10.1021/la900905h"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2016.06.104"", ""10.1039/C7RA00392G"", ""10.1016/j.jtice.2018.10.028"", ""10.1039/C3CS60303B"", ""10.1016/B978-0-32-346240-2.00002-9"", ""10.1016/j.jpcs.2016.11.024"", ""10.1039/C7NR02943H"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2011.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2017.09.017"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.08.020"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2010.08.030"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b14985"", ""10.1016/j.jwpe.2019.100966"", ""10.1016/j.jece.2018.08.028"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.10.127"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.mssp.2018.06.006"", ""10.1002/slct.201701132"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.09.051"", ""10.1007/s40820-019-0339-0"", ""10.1016/j.eng.2018.06.001"", ""10.1007/s11814-016-0021-x"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b20767"", ""10.1039/c2jm35128e"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2019.03.019""]","['Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

It formed between the northern leading edge of the Taurides platform and the Kırşehir block since Late Cretaceous time. We have constructed five regional cross-sections supported by field data and 2D seismic to constrain the structure of the basin and its evolution. The area is divided into three tectonic domains from south to north: (1) a Maastrichtian to Eocene north-verging fold-and-thrust belt, which terminates by a regional Eocene evaporitic level; (2) an Oligo-Miocene salt domain which contains two generations of minibasins separated by a salt canopy, forming a salt-and-thrust belt; and (3) a late Miocene to present day foreland basin. The cross-sections show the along-strike variations and the increasing shortening in the fold-and-thrust belt from west ( c. 15 km) to east ( c. 25 km). The thick salt allows for the intracutaneous propagation of the fold-and-thrust belt below a domain of salt withdrawal minibasins, decoupled as the initial salt thickness increases. In that case, the salt domain is thrusted both frontward and backward. Efficient exhumation followed by erosion of the fold-and-thrust resulted in synorogenic salt tectonics in the foreland and thus increased the mechanical resistance between them.","[{""name"": ""Etienne Legeay"", ""affiliation"": [""E2S UPPA CNRS/TOTAL/Univ Pau &amp;

It is crucial to fully understand the influence of operation parameters and types of gasifier on the performance of biomass gasification. It also can provide useful information for a better design and operation of gasification process. The general overview on each types of gasifier are discussed where it can be classified into fixed bed and fluidized bed gasifiers. Most of the review from literature focuses more on the effects of temperature and equivalence ratio rather than gasifying agent. However, the review on the effect of gasifying agent is still limited whereas the effect of gasifying agent is also important as it influences the yield and composition of product gas. In the present work, the effects of gasifying agent, temperature and equivalence ratio on the gasification process were reviewed. Firstly, this article highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each gasifiers which consists of fixed bed and fluidized bed. Based on review, a detailed comparison was made in terms of syngas composition obtained by using steam, air, oxygen and carbon dioxide as gasifying agents in order to provide basic knowledge regarding the selection of gasifying agents. The effects of temperature and equivalence ratio (ER) on the gas composition, tar content and reaction rate were discussed and analyzed. Finally, guidelines on the operation parameters in terms of gasifying agent, temperature and equivalence ratio are suggested in the summary review.","[{""name"": ""F N Sidek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N A F Abdul Samad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Saleh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b03489"", ""10.1080/15567036.2013.783657"", ""10.1039/C6EE00935B"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2010.09.101"", ""10.1016/j.ces.2017.04.050"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201713103008"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2013.07.068"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.11.007"", ""10.1016/J.ENG.2017.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.08.022"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2010.02.025"", ""10.1063/1.5117101"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.130"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.05.003""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

In this study, the oil palm frond-derived NCQDs/TiO2 was adopted for the first time in the photodegradation of Methylene Blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. TiO2 photocatalyst and NCQDs/TiO2 nanocomposites with different NCQDs contents were successfully synthesised through a facile in-situ hydrothermal method. The surface morphology and crystalline structure of NCQDs-decorated semiconductor photocatalyst were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) were utilized to prove the successful attachment and the uniform dispersion of NCQDs on TiO2 surface, respectively. The best-performed photocatalyst with the optimum amount of NCQDs (NCQDs/TiO2-1) displayed a degradation efficiency of 40.9% within 60 minutes, which is 2.6 times faster than that of pure TiO2 (15.6%). The improved photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the better charge separation since NCQDs act as an electron reservoir which impeded the recombination of electron-hole pairs. The present work proposed a simple synthetic route for the preparation of NCQDs/TiO2 nanocomposites and the use of biomass as a natural precursor which contributed to green and sustainable fabrication of photocatalyst in environmental application.","[{""name"": ""Z W Heng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W C Chong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Y L Pang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L C Sim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jece.2019.103248"", ""10.1016/j.cis.2018.02.003"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-34349-z"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2019.06.034"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2016.04.016"", ""10.1016/j.jphotochem.2016.04.012"", ""10.3390/nano6090157"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.184"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.04.019""]","['Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1002/er.8125,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Novel synthesis of layered MoS2/TiO2/CNT nanocomposite as a potential electrode for high performance supercapacitor applications,"SummaryThis work is aimed to synthesize hybrid nanocomposite electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are incorporated into MoS2 as well as TiO2 to form different hybrid electrode materials such as MoS2/CNTs, TiO2/CNTs, and MoS2/TiO2/CNTs in an effort to improve the electrochemical performance. The resulting hybrid electrode materials are examined by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman studies. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge‐discharge tests are used to evaluate the specific capacitance and charge‐discharge stability of the synthesized MoS2/TiO2/CNTs. Among the hybrid electrode materials investigated, the MoS2/TiO2/CNTs exhibits superior electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 1252.57 mA h/g at a scan rate 20 mV/s as compared with MoS2/CNTs (810.53 mA h/g), TiO2/CNTs (607.10 mA h/g), and CNTs (204.35 mA h/g). All electrochemical tests were carried out in a solution of 1 M KOH. The Rct and Rf for the MoS2/TiO2/CNTs electrode were found to be 1.7 Ω.cm2 and 2.1 Ω.cm2, respectively, which were significantly lower than the corresponding Rct (40.2 Ω.cm2) and Rf (51.1 Ω.cm2) for the CNTs electrode, indicating that the MoS2/TiO2/CNTs has a significantly lower overall impedance, which could be one of the key factors responsible for the improved electrochemical performance of the MoS2/TiO2/CNTs. Moreover, this MoS2/TiO2/CNTs hybrid electrode displays good cycling stability with the capacitance retention of 98.83% after 10 000 cycles of charge‐discharge at 1 A/g. The energy density and power density of MoS2/TiO2/CNTs composites are found to be 757.80 Wh/kg and 4546.80 W/kg respectively.","[{""name"": ""S.P.

10.1038/s41598-020-58857-z,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,Imaging Special Nuclear Material using a Handheld Dual Particle Imager,"AbstractA compact radiation imaging system capable of detecting, localizing, and characterizing special nuclear material (e.g. highly-enriched uranium, plutonium…) would be useful for national security missions involving inspection, emergency response, or war-fighters. Previously-designed radiation imaging systems have been large and bulky with significant portions of volume occupied by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The prototype imaging system presented here uses silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) in place of PMTs because SiPMs are much more compact and operate at low power and voltage. The SiPMs are coupled to the ends of eight stilbene organic scintillators, which have an overall volume of 5.74 × 5.74 × 7.11 cm3. The prototype dual-particle imager’s capabilities were evaluated by performing measurements with a 252Cf source, a sphere of 4.5 kg of alpha-phase weapons-grade plutonium known as the BeRP ball, a 6 kg sphere of neptunium, and a canister of 3.4 kg of plutonium oxide (7% 240Pu and 93% 239Pu). These measurements demonstrate neutron spectroscopic capabilities, a neutron image resolution for a Watt spectrum of 9.65 ± 0.94° in the azimuthal direction and 22.59 ± 5.81° in the altitude direction, imaging of gamma rays using organic scintillators, and imaging of multiple sources in the same field of view.","[{""name"": ""William M.

Water harvesting is considered one of means to grantee the sustainability of water for use in domestic, irrigation and even industry. The current study carried out on Haqlan valley basin in western part of Iraq. The selection of suitable location for rainwater harvesting is based on different key determinates such as environment, hydrology, socio-economic, and topography as well as the estimation of the storage volume and the surface area. This study aims to identify the suitable location for rainwater harvesting using Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing with multi-criteria decision techniques in the study area. Many thematic maps were extracted such as soil map, vegetation cover, land use/land cover, slope, and digital elevation model. The drainage network and the contour line map were used to suggest six sites in the study area. The result shows that the total suitable area for water harvesting was 28% of the study area, while 21% indicated moderate suitability. The proposed method is relatively supportive in analyzing geospatial data to determine and select the optimal site for rainwater harvesting and minimize evaporation losses.","[{""name"": ""K N Sayl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A S Mohammed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A D Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/sl2524-009-0009-7"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.09.024"", ""10.1016/j.pce.2007.07.009"", ""10.1007/s11269-012-0031-3"", ""10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.04.006"", ""10.1007/s12665-017-6699-1"", ""10.1007/s12517"", ""10.1016/j.iswcr.2018.07.003"", ""10.1007/s11269-009-9422-5"", ""10.1080/15324982.2012.709214"", ""10.1016/j.pce.2013.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.progress.2003.09.002."", ""10.1016/0022-2496(77)90033-5"", ""10.1016/j.pce.2008.06.047"", ""10.1016/j.pce.2007.07.014"", ""10.1016/S0168-1699(02)00111-4""]","['Environmental Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Management Science and Operations Research', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

We present new U–Pb laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ages of detrital and magmatic zircon from the Saghro, M'Gouna, and Ouarzazate Groups. The siliciclastic deposits of the Saghro Group were deposited in a back-arc setting developed on stretched continental crust of the West African margin. Collision with the Atlas–Meseta domain led to the closure of the back-arc basin before 600 Ma. Time of exhumation and surface exposure of the newly formed Pan-African basement is bracketed to c. 30 Ma owing to the maximum depositional age of 571 ± 4 Ma of the overlying M'Gouna Group. The U–Pb age of 567 ± 4 Ma for the lowermost ignimbrite of the Ouarzazate Group limits the time for the deposition of the M'Gouna Group to less than 4 Ma. The Pan-African orogeny was finished at c. 600 Ma whereas the onset of transtension related to Cadomian back-arc formation was very much younger from c. 570 Ma onwards.","[{""name"": ""Ezzoura Errami"", ""affiliation"": [""Université Cadi Ayyad, Faculté Polydisciplinaire de Safi, B.P. 4162, 46 000 Safi, Morocco""]}, {""name"": ""Ulf Linnemann"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Mandy Hofmann"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Andreas Gärtner"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Johannes Zieger"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Jessica Gärtner"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Katja Mende"", ""affiliation"": [""Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden, Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie, GeoPlasmaLab, Königsbücker Landstraße 159, D-01109 Dresden, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Jamal El Kabouri"", ""affiliation"": [""Université Chouaïb Doukkali, Faculté des Sciences, EGGPG, B.P. 20, 24000 El Jadida, Morocco""]}, {""name"": ""Dominique Gasquet"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratoire EDYTEM, Université Savoie Mont Blanc, CNRS-UMR5204, Campus scientifique, 73376, Le Bourget du Lac, France""]}, {""name"": ""Nasser Ennih"", ""affiliation"": [""Université Chouaïb Doukkali, Faculté des Sciences, EGGPG, B.P. 20, 24000 El Jadida, Morocco""]}]","[""10.1016/j.precamres.2010.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2012.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2020.103946"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.04.026"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2011.06.005"", ""10.1016/0899-5362(90)90105-N"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2016.08.016"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.10.008"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.044"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2016.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.04.021"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2020.03.011"", ""10.1007/s00126-002-0317-0"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2009.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2006.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2007.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2012.07.022"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2010.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103669"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2019.103669"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.12.039"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(01)00195-4"", ""10.1144/SP297.1"", ""10.1016/S0899-5362(02)00048-9"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2012.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2009.02.006"", ""10.2113/0530277"", ""10.1016/S0899-5362(03)00049-6"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00065-6"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2008.07.025"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2005.06.009"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77076-3_2"", ""10.1130/L121.1"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2006.06.039"", ""10.1016/S0040-1951(03)00023-4"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00078-4"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00109-2"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2014.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2020.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.041"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2004.06.017"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2015.03.003"", ""10.1086/319979"", ""10.1139/e80-012"", ""10.1016/0301-9268(94)90019-1"", ""10.1139/cjes-2017-0086"", ""10.1029/JB088iS02p0A887"", ""10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.179.01.10"", ""10.1007/s00531-004-0413-8"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2013.08.007"", ""10.1007/s00531-017-1520-7"", ""10.1139/e05-062"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2011.09.056"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-77076-3_1"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2017.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2017.11.030"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.07.007"", ""10.1016/0899-5362(96)00002-4"", ""10.1016/j.gr.2012.03.010"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2004.08.003"", ""10.1007/BF00310745"", ""10.1016/j.cageo.2003.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.chemgeo.2007.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.lithos.2013.04.003"", ""10.2113/174.1.83"", ""10.1016/j.crte.2018.07.002"", ""10.1016/0012-821X(75)90088-6"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2009.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.059"", ""10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00075-X"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2004.07.046"", ""10.1130/RF.L001.1"", ""10.1007/s00710-012-0245-3"", ""10.1016/j.jog.2015.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2017.10.022"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2020.105610"", ""10.3390/min8120592"", ""10.1016/0301-9268(94)90094-9"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2012.06.010"", ""10.1007/BF00372872"", ""10.1016/j.precamres.2013.07.003""]",['Earth and Planetary Sciences'],['Geophysics'],"[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)]]"

These large-scale incidents are infrequent but affect large numbers of people. Smaller-scale R/N incidents occur more often, affecting smaller numbers of people. There is more awareness of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in the medical community; however, ionising radiation-induced injuries to the skin are much less understood. This article will provide an overview of radiation-induced injuries to the skin, deeper tissues, and organs. The history and nomenclature; types and causes of injuries; pathophysiology; evaluation and diagnosis; current medical management; and current research of the evaluation and management are presented. Cutaneous radiation injuries (CRI) or local radiation injuries (LRI) may lead to cutaneous radiation syndrome, a sub-syndrome of ARS. These injuries may occur from exposure to radioactive particles suspended in the environment (air, soil, water) after a nuclear detonation or an improvised nuclear detonation (IND), a nuclear power plant incident, or an encounter with a radioactive dispersal or exposure device. These incidents may also result in a radiation-combined injury; a chemical, thermal, or traumatic injury, with radiation exposure. Skin injuries from medical diagnostic and therapeutic imaging, medical misadministration of nuclear medicine or radiotherapy, occupational exposures (including research) to radioactive sources are more common but are not the focus of this manuscript. Diagnosis and evaluation of injuries are based on the scenario, clinical picture, and dosimetry, and may be assisted through advanced imaging techniques. Research-based multidisciplinary therapies, both in the laboratory and clinical trial environments, hold promise for future medical management. Great progress is being made in recognising the extent of injuries, understanding their pathophysiology, as well as diagnosis and management; however, research gaps still exist.","[{""name"": ""Carol J Iddins"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea L DiCarlo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark D Ervin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eduardo Herrera-Reyes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ronald E Goans"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/s0013-9351(05)80224-5"", ""10.1148/21.2.156"", ""10.1126/science.3.67.562"", ""10.1259/dmfr/73488299"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181c9f79a"", ""10.1667/0033-7587(2001)155[0409:toolri]2.0.co;2"", ""10.1667/RR1295.1"", ""10.1097/01.HP.0000218431.06620.ef"", ""10.1017/dmp.2018.74"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0118709"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2012.02.001"", ""10.1667/RR14292.1"", ""10.1016/j.radonc.2007.05.007"", ""10.1097/01.HP.0000345070.33576.f9"", ""10.6061/clinics/2018/e557s"", ""10.3389/fimmu.2017.00431"", ""10.1007/s00432-015-1974-6"", ""10.1177/1559325817705019"", ""10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.09.014"", ""10.1016/j.it.2009.12.001"", ""10.1007/s00270-017-1674-5"", ""10.1007/s00411-014-0553-6"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000110"", ""10.1097/00004032-199810000-00003"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e31824758c2"", ""10.1016/S0190-9622(00)90218-4"", ""10.1093/milmed/167.suppl_1.110"", ""10.1016/j.burns.2012.03.014"", ""10.1117/1.JBO.18.6.061204"", ""10.1097/BCR.0000000000000059"", ""10.1109/TBME.2006.886607"", ""10.1097/BCR.0000000000000330"", ""10.1111/wrr.12786"", ""10.1016/j.burns.2020.02.017"", ""10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.01.108"", ""10.1097/SAP.0000000000001363"", ""10.1118/1.594376"", ""10.1121/1.388086"", ""10.1097/00004630-200021040-00008"", ""10.1016/0305-4179(89)90071-5"", ""10.1097/00004424-198608000-00008"", ""10.1097/PRS.0000000000002654"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-62674-9"", ""10.1016/j.burns.2010.05.018"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000301)39:3<179::AID-CYTO2>3.0.CO;2-I"", ""10.2214/AJR.18.20624"", ""10.3390/diagnostics10050258"", ""10.1016/j.jmgm.2020.107603"", ""10.1007/s00259-016-3427-0"", ""10.1259/bjr.20160642"", ""10.1016/j.rbmo.2019.02.010"", ""10.31887/DCNS.2004.6.2/amaterka"", ""10.1055/a-1047-3146"", ""10.3906/sag-1702-44"", ""10.5152/eurjrheumatol.2014.036"", ""10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.12.002"", ""10.2214/ajr.177.1.1770003"", ""10.2214/ajr.177.1.1770013"", ""10.1016/S0887-2171(02)90014-4"", ""10.1148/radiol.2252011414"", ""10.2214/AJR.13.12029"", ""10.1007/s00270-020-02703-2"", ""10.1016/j.jvir.2010.12.008"", ""10.1148/radiol.10091269"", ""10.1148/radiol.2542082312"", ""10.1097/00003072-198710000-00011"", ""10.1097/00003072-199208000-00008"", ""10.1111/j.1524-475X.2009.00562.x"", ""10.2217/17460751.2.5.785"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncs176"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000483"", ""10.1200/JCO.1999.17.10.3283"", ""10.1385/mo:23:2:185"", ""10.7556/jaoa.2014.170"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncs160"", ""10.1001/dmp.2011.68"", ""10.3390/pharmaceutics9030033"", ""10.1089/wound.2013.0473"", ""10.1667/RR3237.1"", ""10.1111/wrr.12691"", ""10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.01.031"", ""10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.03.025"", ""10.1186/2045-3701-2-20"", ""10.1038/jid.2012.326"", ""10.1159/000128106"", ""10.1073/pnas.92.13.5982"", ""10.1080/09553002.2016.1186302"", ""10.1016/j.lssr.2014.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.exphem.2010.06.008"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0031694"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000099"", ""10.1016/s0305-4179(03)00205-5"", ""10.1177/0300985811402846"", ""10.2307/3578214"", ""10.1016/j.radonc.2007.03.012"", ""10.1007/s10295-006-0139-7"", ""10.1667/rr14283.1"", ""10.1667/RADE-20-00120.1"", ""10.1097/00006534-199104000-00020"", ""10.1126/scitranslmed.3010302"", ""10.1007/s00330-021-07885-y"", ""10.1016/0360-3016(89)90376-3"", ""10.1364/BOE.387400"", ""10.1002/jbio.201700337"", ""10.1667/RR3255.1"", ""10.1007/s00520-019-05166-5"", ""10.1208/s12248-016-0043-7"", ""10.4172/2161-0444.1000299""]",['Medicine'],"['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Epidemiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7618), ('1001 基础医学', 0.732)]]"
10.1007/s10894-020-00263-4,JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,CPS Based Liquid Metal Divertor Target for EU-DEMO,"AbstractPower exhaust is a key mission in the roadmap to the realization of a future fusion reactor. Among the different solutions, the use of liquid metals as plasma facing materials are of interest due to their potential increased lifetime. Several liquid metal limiters have been successfully tested in the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade over the last 10 years. Liquid materials such as lithium and tin have been investigated using capillary porous systems (CPSs), and their impact on plasma performance has been explored. From such experience, a liquid metal divertor (LMD) concept design, CPS-based, is here proposed. Tin has been preferred as plasma facing material. The proposed LMD would operate, in low evaporative regime, with matching heat exhausting capabilities to those of the baseline ITER-like divertor. Continuous refilling of the CPS is guaranteed with a reservoir at the back of the unit, where the metal is kept liquid through a gas heating circuit. The study has been carried out using ANSYS and the thermal results will be shown. All the design choices are compatible with the current materials and the constraints adopted for the DEMO W divertor. Using such configuration, thermal loads up to 20 MW/m2 are exhausted while keeping the surface temperature below 1250 °C. The design foresees values of pressure, temperature and flow rate of the water coolant in the same range expected for the W DEMO divertor, thus facilitating the integration of such solution in the current cassette design. Technological and practical aspects are addressed, i.e. tin corrosion and CPS wettability. Possible solutions to prevent tin corrosion, and its compatibility with structural materials, will be outlined.","[{""name"": ""S. Roccella"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G.

Splitting of water by electrolysis is catching up to be a productive method to produce pure hydrogen with low cost and high efficiency using highly active non‐noble metal electrocatalysts. MoS2 has been widely studied for energy conservation devices for its 2D layered structure, excellent electronic conductivity, and high specific surface area. Incorporating transition metals (Co or Ni) will alter the intrinsic characteristic of MoS2 by enhancing its electrocatalytic property for hydrogen evolution reaction. Hence MoS2, CoMoS2, Co0.5MoS2 and a composite of Co0.5MoS2 with nitrogen sulfur doped graphene oxide were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Better performance was observed for the composite of Co0.5MoS2 with N, S‐rGO compared to other prepared catalysts with a low onset potential of 85 mV, overpotential (at 10 mA/cm2) of 178 mV and Tafel slope of 63.8 mV/dec. Further, the stability of the catalyst evaluated by chronoamperometric analysis demonstrated steady electrochemical performance for 12 hours.","[{""name"": ""Yamini Kumaran"", ""affiliation"": [""Electrochemical Energy Laboratory, Department of Chemistry SRM Institute of Science and Technology  Kattankulathur India""]}, {""name"": ""Thandavarayan Maiyalagan"", ""affiliation"": [""Electrochemical Energy Laboratory, Department of Chemistry SRM Institute of Science and Technology  Kattankulathur India""]}, {""name"": ""Sung Chul Yi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering Hanyang University  Seoul Republic of Korea"", ""Department of Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Hanyang University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1002/9783527803873"", ""10.1021/acsaem.9b00629"", ""10.1039/c2ee03309g"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.02.236"", ""10.1002/9783527803873.ch7"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.02.042"", ""10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.013"", ""10.1126/science.1141483"", ""10.1039/c7sc02545a"", ""10.3390/catal7100285"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.285"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.02.125"", ""10.1016/s0360-3199(97)00091-8"", ""10.1039/c2sc20539d"", ""10.1021/acsami.5b08420"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.12.173"", ""10.1021/acsomega.7b00848"", ""10.1038/nchem.2740"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.11.114"", ""10.1039/c6ta05863a"", ""10.1002/anie.201410050"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-08677-5"", ""10.1039/c6nr08139h"", ""10.1038/nenergy.2016.130"", ""10.1021/acscatal.7b00555"", ""10.1021/acsaem.8b01659"", ""10.1039/c8ta01552j"", ""10.1002/aenm.201800031"", ""10.1021/acscatal.5b00154"", ""10.1007/s12274-019-2563-9"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.09.057"", ""10.1186/1467-4866-9-8"", ""10.1021/nn1003937"", ""10.1063/1.5095451"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.60.2883"", ""10.1088/0953-8984/28/35/353002"", ""10.1016/J.MSEB.2016.07.014"", ""10.1063/1.4756995"", ""10.1021/nn203393d"", ""10.1002/adfm.201403863"", ""10.1039/c7ta05440h"", ""10.1039/C6RA23412G"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-12332-4"", ""10.1002/aenm.201802615"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.03.159"", ""10.1021/acsaem.7b00040"", ""10.1038/srep45030"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2004.12.021"", ""10.1016/j.jcat.2012.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.cattod.2005.08.022"", ""10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.136"", ""10.1021/j100154a028"", ""10.1016/0926-860X(93)85133-A"", ""10.1126/science.1168049"", ""10.1002/adma.201302753"", ""10.1039/c4cs00141a"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-15622-z"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-802993-0.00004-6""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1002/er.6212,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,A review on passive methods for thermal performance enhancement in parabolic trough solar collectors,"SummaryAmong the diverse renewable energy sources available, solar energy harnessing has become very common in most countries. Various collectors were developed, built and checked to work in various temperature ranges. The parabolic trough solar collector is found to be the most common among the other collectors in applications such as the distribution of process heat and the production of steam. The heat collector part known as receiver tube is one of the key practical devices of parabolic trough solar collector. Numerous research studies have centered on receiver tube to raise its thermal potential. The usage of passive techniques such as provision of inserts in the receiver tube and geometrical changes of receiver tube are efficient strategies for increasing thermal performance. Detailed review of the numerical and experimental studies conducted on heat transfer enhancement strategies that rely on the use of inserts with the use of different working fluids in a parabolic trough solar collector's receiver tube is described in this article. Additionally heat transfer enhancement due to geometrical modification of receiver tube is also presented. Further, on the basis of literature survey, a comparison among various strategies is outlined. These studies show that future work in this area, that is, usage of passive techniques in parabolic trough solar collector will offer further growth.","[{""name"": ""Mridul Sharma"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Lovely Professional University  Phagwara India"", ""Department of Mechanical Engineering Jawaharlal Nehru Government Engineering College  Sundernagar India""]}, {""name"": ""Ravindra Jilte"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Lovely Professional University  Phagwara India""]}]","[""10.1002/er.5143"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.014"", ""10.1002/er.4252"", ""10.1002/er.4165"", ""10.1002/er.4554"", ""10.1016/j.molliq.2016.06.091"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.048"", ""10.1002/er.5271"", ""10.1080/01457630802125757"", ""10.1002/er.3010"", ""10.1002/er.4137"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.093"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2018.11.001"", ""10.1002/er.3856"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.04.037"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.051"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114224"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.03.021"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2014.12.016"", ""10.1007/s11431-016-0373-x"", ""10.1021/ie50324a027"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2009.10.038"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.07.026"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115511"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.112"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2008.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2006.03.020"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.03.106"", ""10.1016/S0017-9310(98)00243-9"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.08.067"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.141"", ""10.2172/211613"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2020.06.070"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.01.020"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.021"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.067"", ""10.1080/19942060.2008.11015219"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.02.046"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.030"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2015.08.015"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2015.03.036"", ""10.3390/en11010204"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.03.040"", ""10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2009.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2014.09.049"", ""10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2006.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.057"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2014.08.042"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.10.010"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.037"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.12.018"", ""10.13189/ujme.2015.030305"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2020.100696"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2010.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2016.11.213"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.014"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(94)90176-7"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.10.012"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.04.026"", ""10.1016/j.appthermaleng.2020.114948"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.056"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.062"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.127"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2016.08.013"", ""10.1007/s10973-018-7183-1"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.119541"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020114909"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.08.042"", ""10.3390/en13112946"", ""10.1088/1742.6596/953/1/012030"", ""10.1016/j.gee.2017.12.002"", ""10.1007/s11630-016-0878-3"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.01.060"", ""10.1016/j.tsep.2020.100538"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.160"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.027"", ""10.1007/s10973-020-09371-x"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.10.008"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.116564"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.02.118"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.10.059"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.051"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.01.094"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.080"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.11.062"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.11.079"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.02.069"", ""10.1016/j.tscp.2017.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2017.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.08.044"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.131"", ""10.1115/1.4037092"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.02.064"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.075"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020117880"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.057"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2013.04.018"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.07.035"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.08.043"", ""10.1257/aer.101.3.238"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2012.01.1179"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.041"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(82)90136-3"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2009.03.014"", ""10.1016/S0360-5442(02)00018-X"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2012.11.038"", ""10.1016/0306-2619(95)00036-R"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2011.08.009"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.08.065""]","['Computer Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of radiological monitoring of the main constituents of urban landfill waste. The present contribution reports on an investigation plan carried out to evaluate the possible radiological contamination in the municipal landfill Lo Uttaro, district of Caserta (Italy). The investigation focused primarily on the perimeter area of the landfill in order to assess the possible impact on the surrounding population. The results of measurements of the equivalent dose rate along the perimeter of the landfill show average values lower than the population dose limit due to natural background radiation. Several samples of soil, groundwater and leachate representative of the subsoil of the study area were collected and the radionuclides were measured by gamma spectrometry. The results of these measurements show the absence of artificial radionuclides, except for small amounts of 137Cs due to nuclear disasters occurring in the last 50 years on Earth, and the mere presence of 40K and other natural radionuclides belonging to natural radioactive chains of 238U, 235U and 232Th.","[{""name"": ""F Ambrosino"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L Stellato"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Sabbarese"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/00004032-200005000-00013"", ""10.1016/j.atmosenv.2005.07.050"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncx159"", ""10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2017.02.029"", ""10.1088/0952-4746/25/3/007"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.373"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2017.01.042"", ""10.1016/j.geog.2019.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2020.109090"", ""10.1007/s10967-006-0237-z"", ""10.1016/S1350-4487(03)00202-6"", ""10.1097/00004032-200206000-00016"", ""10.1007/s00254-004-1121-1"", ""10.1007/s10967-015-4417-6"", ""10.1007/s10967-013-2475-1"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.06.008""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"

Here we integrate gravity, bathymetry and 2D seismic datasets to investigate the structural and stratigraphic variation in the southern part of the Hikurangi subduction wedge, onshore and offshore North Island, New Zealand. Three morphostructural portions are recognized: The inner portion demonstrates reactivation of inherited structures, producing thick-skinned deformation. Pre-subduction rocks are represented by kilometres of acoustically chaotic seismofacies. Thick-skinned deformation and readily deformable substrate lead to the development of wide trench-slope sub-basins, infilled with &gt;5 km of syn-subduction sediments. The mid portion typically demonstrates thrust faults with connections to deeper structures, leading to the development of an imbricate system with asymmetrical sub-basins typically &lt;5 km thick developed on the back-limb of thrust related folds. An antiformal stack marks the transition from the thick-skinned interior of the basin to the thin-skinned accretionary prism. Beyond this, the relatively non-deformed outer portion demonstrates frontal folds, propagating thrusts and up to 3 km thickness of syn-subduction strata. Structural variation across the subduction wedge controls the generation of accommodation with implications for sediment distribution within fold and thrust belts and for petroleum system development.","[{""name"": ""A.

10.1002/er.6208,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Techno-economic planning of local energy systems through optimization models: a survey of current methods,"SummaryEnergy system planning is a difficult task, since it involves long‐term decision‐makings with multiple dimensions: technical, economic, social, ecological, and political. The rise of distributed and multi‐energy systems including new technologies has further increased this complexity. Techno‐economic studies based on optimization models have recently received much attention in the literature. They are essential to grasp energy systems complexity and provide decision support. This work targets methodological issues related to local systems while comparing them with methods used at larger scales. First, a new framework providing a comprehensive vision of added values and limits of optimization models is presented. Then, the main methodological trends as well as several undertaken research paths are identified based on the analysis of more than 60 research papers. The review results are summarized in a complete and concise table. Finally, future research topics are discussed including the operational facets of investment optimization models in case of high intermittent energy shares, flexibility issues and long‐term operational decisions. The results provide useful information to modellers or researchers that look for appropriate and state‐of‐the‐art optimization methods, or aim to deepen current research paths.

The structural and optical properties of the samples were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-visible spectroscopy. XRD results show that the samples are crystallized in the pure perovskite structure when calcined at relatively low temperature (800 °C) for 3 h, without the presence of secondary phases. Both Bi doping (1%, 2%) decrease the lattice parameters, tetragonality and the crystallite size. The decrease of their sizes can be explained by the replacement of large ionic radii of Ba2+ (1.35Å) ion by smaller ionic radii Bi3+ (1.03 Å) ion. A close investigation of the results shows that BT is a tetragonal-phase ferroelectric. The band gap of the Bi-doped BaTiO3 nanopowders is lower compared to that of pure BaTiO3, as determined from the analysis of UV absorbance spectra.","[{""name"": ""M Tihtih"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J F M Ibrahim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E Kurovics"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Abdelfattah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1088/1757-899X/47/1/012042"", ""10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2019.33"", ""10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2018.34"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/47/1/012018"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/175/1/012013"", ""10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2019.21"", ""10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2019.22"", ""10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2019.20"", ""10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2019.23"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/613/1/012005"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/613/1/012025"", ""10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2008.16"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/613/1/012051"", ""10.14382/epitoanyag-jsbcm.2010.18"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/18/8/082001"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/175/1/012001"", ""10.1016/j.mee.2009.11.126"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2013.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.tsf.2015.04.087"", ""10.1002/adma.200802849"", ""10.1016/j.partic.2010.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2004.12.012"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.264-268.1161"", ""10.1016/j.physb.2017.11.069"", ""10.1007/s11837-014-1266-7"", ""10.4314/star.v3i1.7"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2011.12.113"", ""10.1038/nnano.2011.145"", ""10.1016/0001-6160(53)90006-6"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.5.3144""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"
10.1002/er.8018,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Recent development of aqueous zinc-ion battery cathodes and future challenges: Review,"SummaryDue to the increasing energy demand and to help integrate renewable energy into the energy mix, large‐scale energy storage has become essential. Among the different large‐scale secondary battery technologies, zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs) have attracted huge attention due to their lower cost, better safety, and environmental positivity. The aqueous electrolyte in ZIBs allows the batteries to be constructed under normal atmospheric conditions and substantially reduces the assembling complexity. However, due to its low working voltage, cathode materials are often restricted, and rectifying voltage is a crucial function. Increasing the cathode voltage necessitates an increase in the electrolyte's thermodynamic stability. Additionally, the process of zinc‐ion storage should be studied in greater depth and new variants of characterization can be used to precisely understand the storage mechanism. In this regard, this article has reviewed with recent research findings addressing these issues and possible advancements made in the ZIB technology, highlighting future possibilities.","[{""name"": ""Umesh Fegade"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry Bhusawal Arts Science and P.

One way to reach a more sustainable world is to start re-using end-of-life structures and waste and give them a ‘Second Life” with a new function in the society. As composite structures are lightweight, strong, stiff and durable materials, there is great potential to re-use decommissioned composite for new resource-efficient solutions in the building and infrastructure sector. The present paper investigates innovative solutions in re-using wind turbine blades as elements in new bicycle and pedestrian bridge designs. Several conceptual bridge designs where wind blades utilized as load bearing elements were developed and studied. The main design requirements for pedestrian bridges were considered and assumptions regarding wind blades quality and their mechanical properties addressed based on interviews with industries working with wind turbine blades repair and recycling. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a sustainable use of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) waste and at the same time provide a more cost-effective FRP bridges. In a larger perspective, the authors would like to highlight the economically profitable potential of recovering and reusing / re-manufacturing end-of-life glass FRP composites.","[{""name"": ""A André"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Kullberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Nygren"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Mattsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Nedev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Haghani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.04.013"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.09.036"", ""10.3390/recycling3010003""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Pollution', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The most important improvement is the development of ‘white’ LEDs that can be used as general lighting sources, which are more efficient than traditional lighting sources. LEDs emitting in the ultraviolet wavelength region have also become available and have made their way into consumer products. All these changes have led to a rise in concern for the safety of the optical radiation emissions from LEDs. Several in vitro and animal studies have been conducted, which indicate that blue and white LEDs can potentially cause retinal cell damage under high irradiance and lengthy exposure conditions. However, these studies cannot be directly extrapolated to normal exposure conditions for humans, and equivalent effects can also be caused by the optical radiation from other light sources under extreme exposure conditions. Acute damage to the human retina from typical exposure to blue or white LEDs has not been demonstrated. Concern for potential long-term effects, e.g. age-related macular degeneration (AMD), remains based on epidemiological studies indicating a link between high levels of exposure to sunlight and AMD. When evaluating the optical radiation safety of LEDs, it has now been established that published safety standards for lamps, not lasers, should be applied. Thus far, the only clear, acute adverse health effects from LEDs are those due to temporal light modulation (including flicker). Glare can also create visual disturbances when LED light fixtures are not properly designed. Further research is needed on potential health effects from short- and long-term exposure to new and emerging lighting technologies.",[],"[""10.1111/j.1600-0420.2005.00627.x"", ""10.1016/j.preteyeres.2011.04.002"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-16-06405.2001"", ""10.1002/phar.1264"", ""10.1016/S0161-6420(97)30235-8"", ""10.1001/archopht.119.10.1463"", ""10.1016/j.sleh.2017.03.005"", ""10.1089/pho.2016.4179"", ""10.1364/AO.23.002181"", ""10.1038/260153a0"", ""10.1080/15502724.2018.1501234"", ""10.1097/00004032-200006000-00020"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e318289a611"", ""10.1364/AO.44.002162"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000000580"", ""10.1136/bjo.2005.073825"", ""10.1167/iovs.14-14602"", ""10.1001/archopht.116.4.506"", ""10.1016/j.ajo.2006.06.015"", ""10.1016/j.neuroscience.2016.10.015"", ""10.1038/srep05223"", ""10.1117/12.237518"", ""10.1097/01.HP.0000190115.83416.cb"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.056"", ""10.1364/BOE.1.000771"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31550-2"", ""10.1167/iovs.12-9608"", ""10.1097/ICB.0b013e3181e180d5"", ""10.1186/1472-6882-14-120"", ""10.1038/eye.2015.261"", ""10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05320.x"", ""10.1007/BF00429289"", ""10.1051/radiopro/2018025"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3181ea51e3"", ""10.1097/IAE.0000000000000756"", ""10.1007/s004170000220"", ""10.1038/eye.2015.252"", ""10.1080/15502724.2016.1145551"", ""10.1136/bjophthalmol-2012-302281"", ""10.1001/archopht.1992.01080130101035"", ""10.2147/OPTH.S132338"", ""10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.t01-1-00261.x"", ""10.1016/j.ophtha.2003.11.010"", ""10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01203.x"", ""10.1016/S0161-6420(89)32693-5"", ""10.1177/096032718902100102"", ""10.1186/s12886-018-1004-y""]","['Medicine', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Neuroscience']","['Endocrine and Autonomic Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Molecular Biology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7135), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7131)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7343), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7292)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)]]"

The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and the Nuclear Safety Research Association report the annual effective doses from cosmic rays, terrestrial radiation, inhalation, and ingestion as natural sources. In this paper, the total annual effective dose from cosmic-ray exposure is evaluated as 0.29 mSv. The arithmetic mean of the annual effective dose from external exposure to terrestrial radiation is 0.33 mSv for the Japanese population using the data of nationwide surveys by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences. Previously in Japan, although three different groups have conducted nationwide indoor radon surveys using passive-type radon monitors, to date only the Japan Chemical Analysis Center (JCAC) has performed a nationwide radon survey using a unified method for radon measurements conducted indoor, outdoor, and in the workplace. Consequently, the JCAC results are used for the annual effective dose from radon and that for radon inhalation is estimated as 0.50 mSv using a current dose conversion factor. In this paper, UNSCEAR values are used for the mean indoor and outdoor thoron-progeny concentrations, and the annual effective dose from thoron is reported as 0.09 mSv. Thus, the annual effective dose from radon and thoron inhalation is 0.59 mSv. From a JCAC large-scale survey of foodstuffs, the committed effective dose from the main radionuclides in dietary intake is 0.99 mSv. Finally, the Japanese population dose from natural radiation is given as 2.2 mSv, which is similar to the reported global average of 2.4 mSv.","[{""name"": ""Yasutaka Omori"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Masahiro Hosoda"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fumiaki Takahashi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tetsuya Sanada"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shigekazu Hirao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Koji Ono"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Masahide Furukawa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/18811248.1981.9733221"", ""10.5453/jhps.17.169"", ""10.1093/rpd/7.1-4.267"", ""10.3327/taesj.J16.023"", ""10.1097/00004032-199611000-00016"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.10.051"", ""10.1136/bmj.38308.477650.63"", ""10.5453/jhps.29.155"", ""10.1097/00004032-199401000-00006"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.11.034"", ""10.3354/meps177189"", ""10.1093/rpd/nch008"", ""10.1097/01.HP.0000167228.18113.27"", ""10.1093/rpd/45.1-4.333"", ""10.5453/jhps.32.41"", ""10.1097/00004032-199910000-00008"", ""10.5453/jhps.37.325"", ""10.5026/jgeography.102.7_868"", ""10.3769/radioisotopes.44.19"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncv249"", ""10.5453/jhps.42.341"", ""10.5453/jhps.30.219"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a082837"", ""10.3769/radioisotopes.44.10_710"", ""10.5453/jhps.39.206"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncq229"", ""10.5453/jhps.51.41"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2016.11.014"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a033299"", ""10.1016/j.atmosenv.2007.06.046"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncv251"", ""10.5453/jhps.36.329"", ""10.1088/0952-4746/27/4/005"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncq242"", ""10.5453/jhps.35.193"", ""10.3130/aija.63.47_1"", ""10.1093/rpd/nct176"", ""10.1097/HP.0b013e3182611a06"", ""10.1007/s10967-012-1813-z"", ""10.1097/00004032-200204000-00013"", ""10.1097/00004032-197805000-00006"", ""10.1097/00004032-198502000-00006"", ""10.1016/S0160-4120(96)00107-9"", ""10.1080/18811248.2004.9726416"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2009.02.087"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncv235"", ""10.1097/00004032-199112000-00006"", ""10.1093/rpd/45.1-4.419"", ""10.1016/j.radmeas.2010.06.015"", ""10.5453/jhps.25.385"", ""10.3769/radioisotopes.44.33"", ""10.1093/rpd/24.1-4.383"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncv206"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.03.012"", ""10.5026/jgeography.115.87"", ""10.5453/jhps.25.121"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a079908"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncn316"", ""10.1016/j.ics.2004.11.171"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(02)00097-8"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.06.009"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/37/1/111"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncy192"", ""10.5453/jhps.44.80"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a031847"", ""10.1016/0021-8502(94)90077-9"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a031888"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(98)00085-X"", ""10.1667/RR0610.1"", ""10.1667/RR1094.1"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0144679"", ""10.1038/srep33932"", ""10.5453/jhps.22.487"", ""10.1097/00004032-199208000-00006"", ""10.1007/BF02036292"", ""10.1097/00004032-200001000-00006"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2016.09.008"", ""10.1111/j.1445-5994.1977.tb03361.x"", ""10.3769/radioisotopes.51.543"", ""10.3769/radioisotopes.56.315"", ""10.2131/jts.34.417"", ""10.5453/jhps.33.143"", ""10.1269/jrr.10083"", ""10.1016/S0160-4120(96)00163-8"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a032596"", ""10.1097/00004032-200001000-00012"", ""10.1097/00004032-200106000-00014"", ""10.3769/radioisotopes.52.285"", ""10.1667/RR3237"", ""10.1063/1.2132270"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncq246"", ""10.5453/jhps.53.282"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2019.05.001"", ""10.1080/18811248.2010.9711934"", ""10.1097/00004032-199506000-00013"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a082644"", ""10.5453/jhps.30.149"", ""10.1097/01.HP.0000345025.85844.97"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncr152"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncy106"", ""10.1007/s10967-008-7379-0"", ""10.1016/j.ics.2004.10.014"", ""10.5453/jhps.35.365""]","['Environmental Science', 'Health Professions', 'Medicine']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"

Biopolymers are environmentally friendly materials that are widely used in different geoenvironmental applications such as removal of heavy metals from contaminated soils, reduction of soil hydraulic conductivity, erosion control, and soil improvement. In this research the feasibility of using chitosan biopolymer for sandy soil stabilization has been studied. The effects of biopolymer content, curing time, and curing conditions have investigated using unconfined compression tests. The results indicated that incorporation of chitosan has the potential to increase the interparticle cohesion between the particles and considerable improvement of sandy soil mechanical properties. After initial strengthening of the soil, some strength reduction over time was observed due to the degradation characteristics of the chitosan. With regards to the curing condition, better performances at dry condition compare to the wet and saturated environment were achieved. In addition to soil mechanical properties, the pore plugging effect of chitosan biopolymer on highly permeable sandy soil has been studied in this study.","[{""name"": ""Nader Shariatmadari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammad Reza"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amiri Tasuji"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pooria Ghadir"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A.

10.1002/er.8168,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Electrochemical synthesis of tunable polypyrrole-based composites on carbon fabric for wide potential window aqueous supercapacitor,"SummaryFacile one‐step electrochemical synthesis of a novel graphitic oxide/polypyrrole/2‐acrylamido‐2‐methyl‐1‐propanesulfonic acid composite on carbon fabric were described for development of an efficient positive electrode for supercapacitor applications. The 2‐acrylamido‐2‐methyl‐1‐propanesulfonate monomers behave as dopant in 3D polypyrrole network formed by synergetic coupling with graphitic oxide. Their free acrylic groups interact with each other to form polymer‐hydrogel‐layer on the external surface that facilitate transport of aqueous electrolyte ions inside of the electrode. The most efficient electrode material was synthesized by tuning dopant concentration at 0.01 M. The full‐cell assembled using the composite electrode and graphite counter electrode works at 2.2 V in 3 M NaCl solution that equals to the highest values achieved yet for aqueous supercapacitors. This cell has a capacitance as high as 698.8 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and preserves its initial value even after 10 000 continuous CV cycles at 1000 mV s−1. It also exhibits a high‐energy density of 446.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 366.7 W kg−1, and it is still 65.2 W h kg−1 at 18.3 kW kg−1. The asymmetric capacitor with 1 × 1 cm2 area successfully lit a red light‐emitting diode.","[{""name"": ""Sibel Yazar"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry Istanbul University‐Cerrahpasa, Engineering Faculty  Istanbul Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Gülten Atun"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry Istanbul University‐Cerrahpasa, Engineering Faculty  Istanbul Turkey""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jmst.2014.12.012"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2014.09.061"", ""10.1021/nn503814y"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.039"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.015"", ""10.1021/nl400378j"", ""10.1016/j.polymer.2015.04.064"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.047"", ""10.1002/adma.201203578"", ""10.1016/j.pnsc.2016.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.02.090"", ""10.1021/am5059603"", ""10.1007/s11696‐016‐0048‐9"", ""10.1039/c7cp02707a"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2005.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.10.066"", ""10.1021/acsami.5b08830"", ""10.1021/jp108826e"", ""10.1021/cm00023a012"", ""10.1039/b102091i"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.102"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.polymer.2004.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2012.01.056"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.05.012"", ""10.1186/s11671‐017‐2010‐3"", ""10.1016/j.synthmet.2011.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.orgel.2015.05.037"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2015.05.019"", ""10.1039/C5RA02868J"", ""10.1021/jp205568v"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228657"", ""10.1002/celc.201900490"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.03.157"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2021.131505"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231210"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230078"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2020.02.011"", ""10.1039/c3ee40509e"", ""10.1039/C8AY02619J"", ""10.5185/amlett.2016.6123"", ""10.1088/1757‐899X/509/1/012119"", ""10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.09.015"", ""10.1021/jp400344u"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.10.030"", ""10.1021/la500299s"", ""10.1039/C4NR04254A"", ""10.1039/C8TA09849B"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b01938"", ""10.1155/2016/8932908"", ""10.1155/2014/728675"", ""10.1080/10601325.2014.893134"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b19180"", ""10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b03891"", ""10.1002/eem2.12102"", ""10.1039/d0ma00384k"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2019.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.04.023"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.05.277"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.07.017"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.10.070"", ""10.1039/C5CP04080A"", ""10.1039/C5CP02710A"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.10.031"", ""10.1007/s12221‐021‐0920‐2"", ""10.1016/j.synthmet.2022.117017"", ""10.1007/s11581‐021‐04132‐8"", ""10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.112"", ""10.1016/S1452-3981(23)15829-9"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(00)00551-6""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

Previously, SAR was mainly assessed under conditions of a single frequency and technology and for a limited number of localized RF sources. The current and emerging mobile systems involve a wider range of usage scenarios and are frequently used simultaneously, leading to combined exposures for which almost no exposure evaluation exists. The aim and novelty of this study is to close this gap of knowledge by developing new methods to rapidly evaluate the SAR induced by RF systems in such scenarios at frequencies from 50 MHz to 5.5 GHz. To this aim, analytical methods for SAR estimation in several usage scenarios were derived through a large-scale numerical study.

It is therefore particularly suitable for the analysis of rifted margins and their associated ocean basins. Maps of crustal thickness and conjugate-margin stretching, derived from gravity anomaly inversion, are used to illustrate how the Equatorial Atlantic opened as a set of stepped rift-transform segments, rather than as a simple orthogonal rifted margin. The influence of the transform faults and associated oceanic fracture zones is particularly clear when the results of the gravity anomaly inversion are combined with a shaded-relief display of the free-air gravity anomaly. A set of crustal cross-sections has been extracted from the results of the gravity inversion along both equatorial margins. These illustrate the crustal structure of both rifted-margin segments and transform-margin segments. The maps and cross-sections are used to delineate crustal type on the margins as (1) inboard, entirely continental, (2) outboard, entirely oceanic and (3) the ocean–continent transition in between where mixed continental and magmatic crust is likely to be present. For a given parameterization of melt generation the amount of magmatic addition within the ocean–continent transition is predicted by the gravity inversion. One of the strengths of the gravity-inversion technique is that these predictions can be made in the absence of any other directly acquired data. On both margins anomalously thick crust is resolved close to a number of oceanic fracture zones. On the South American margin we believe that this thick crust is probably the result of post-break-up magmatism within what was originally normal-thickness oceanic crust. On the West African margin, however, three possible origins are discussed: (1) continental crust extended oceanwards along the fracture zones; (2) oceanic crust magmatically thickened at the fracture zones; and (3) oceanic crust thickened by transpression along the fracture zones. Gravity inversion alone cannot discriminate between these possibilities. The cross-sections also show that, while ‘normal thickness’ oceanic crust ( c. 7 km) predominates regionally, local areas of thinner ( c. 5 km) and thicker ( c. 10 km) oceanic crust are also present along both margins. Finally, using maps of crustal thickness and thinning factor as input to plate reconstructions, the regional palaeogeography of the Equatorial Atlantic during and after break-up is displayed at 10 Ma increments.","[{""name"": ""Nick J.

Although its application is huge in the building of aerospace structure, 2XXX and 7XXX series alloys are categorised as non-weldable aluminium alloys. Recent development in the application of friction stir welding process in the joining of these non-weldable alloys simplified the fabrication processes. In this review article, significance of friction stir welding comparing with other solid state metal joining process is addressed. Recent developments and application of this relatively new metal joining process in various industries are also discussed. Particular emphasis has been given to the mechanism responsible for the formation of this solid state joining technique. Apart from this, major process parameters that influence the formation of weld and weld defects caused by the improper selection of process parameters are also explained in detail.","[{""name"": ""J Stephen Leon"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Bharathiraja"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""V Jayakumar"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.15413/ajsr.2017.0724"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2018.02.351"", ""10.1007/s40194-019-00732-1"", ""10.1515/jmsp-2014-0007"", ""10.1080/02670836.2017.1393976"", ""10.1016/j.scriptamat.2007.04.050"", ""10.1080/09506608.2015.1109214"", ""10.24247/ijmperdfeb201918"", ""10.1590/1980-5373-mr-2019-0349"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48173-9_24"", ""10.1016/j.jmst.2017.11.041"", ""10.3390/ma6125923"", ""10.1590/0104-9224/SI24.28"", ""10.1007/s00170-020-05341-7"", ""10.1179/1362171812Y.0000000058"", ""10.1016/j.actamat.2015.08.068"", ""10.1007/s40194-018-0612-8"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2010.07.008"", ""10.5937/fmet2001137L"", ""10.1115/IMECE2002-33817"", ""10.1007/s13632-018-0438-1"", ""10.1155/2014/724590"", ""10.1007/s13632-013-0078-4"", ""10.1016/j.msea.2017.03.054"", ""10.1515/jmbm-2019-0019"", ""10.1177/1687814016679277"", ""10.1007/s40430-018-1378-z"", ""10.24200/sci.2018.5700.1434"", ""10.3390/met7090350"", ""10.1016/S1003-6326(12)61775-0"", ""10.1016/j.dt.2016.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2014.12.384"", ""10.22055/JACM.2019.29340.1585"", ""10.1016/j.dt.2015.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2015.02.020"", ""10.1016/j.msea.2018.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2014.11.007"", ""10.4149/km_2016_5_351"", ""10.13140/RG.2.2.19381.93921""]",['Engineering'],"['Aerospace Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

In general, a cavity-based XFEL can provide a spectral brightness three orders of magnitude higher than that of the SASE mode, thereby opening a new door for cutting-edge scientific research. With the development of superconducting MHz repetition-rate XFEL facilities such as FLASH, European-XFEL, LCLS-II, and SHINE, practical cavity-based XFEL operations are becoming increasingly achievable.

These technologies provide copious amounts of high-quality temporal data pertaining to indoor and outdoor environmental quality, comfort, and energy consumption. However, a barrier to their use in many applications is the lack of spatial context in the built environment. Adding Building Information Models (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to these temporal sources unleashes potential. We call this data convergence the Internet-of-Buildings or IoB. In this paper, a digital twin case study of data intersection from various systems is outlined. Initial insights are discussed for an experiment with 17 participants that focused on the collection of occupant subjective feedback to characterize indoor comfort. The results illustrate the ability to capture data from wearables in the context of a BIM data environment.","[{""name"": ""Clayton Miller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mahmoud Abdelrahman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adrian Chong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Filip Biljecki"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matias Quintana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mario Frei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michael Chew"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Wong"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2011.00745.x"", ""10.1007/s12053-011-9116-8"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103440"", ""10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIV-4-W1-2020-83-2020"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.110885"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106949"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.03.021"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.07.022"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116492"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/012145"", ""10.3390/buildings10100174""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Geology', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

We aim to focus on the synthesis of 125I-cimetidine (125I-cim) as an agent for peptic ulcer imaging. Cimetidine was labeled with Iodine-125 using a different oxidizing agent (Ch-T, NBS). All factors affecting the labeling yield were optimized. The radiochemical yield of 125I-cim was 98 ± 0.22% at optimum conditions. In vitro stability, in vivo biodistribution of 125I-cimetidine was studied in three groups: control group, pretreated group, and ulcer bearing group. In vivo biodistribution studies of 125I-cim revealed high uptake in the stomach ulcer, reaching about 75.4 ± 1.2% ID/g at 15 min post-injection, than pretreated groups compared to the control. The results showed the suitability of using 125I-cimetidine for stomach ulcer imaging.","[{""name"": ""Mahmoud H.

10.1002/er.6146,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Enhanced electrochemical performance of lanthanum ferrite decorated reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite electrodes prepared by in situ microwave irradiation for energy storage applications,"SummaryLanthanum ferrite decorated reduced graphene oxide (LaFeO3/rGO) nanocomposite is prepared by in‐situ microwave irradiation method. The X‐ray diffraction study reveals the single phase orthorhombic structure of LaFeO3 nanoparticles and LaFeO3/rGO nanocomposites. The FTIR study reveals various vibrational modes and the characteristic D and G bands of the Raman spectrum confirms the formation of reduced graphene oxide. The SEM and HR‐TEM images demonstrate that spherical LaFeO3 particles are decorated on 2D graphene sheets. From the HR‐TEM study, the average particle size of LaFeO3 is estimated to be 23 nm.

10.1007/s10894-020-00258-1,JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,Advancing Fusion with Machine Learning Research Needs Workshop Report,"AbstractMachine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) methods have been used successfully in recent years to solve problems in many areas, including image recognition, unsupervised and supervised classification, game-playing, system identification and prediction, and autonomous vehicle control. Data-driven machine learning methods have also been applied to fusion energy research for over 2 decades, including significant advances in the areas of disruption prediction, surrogate model generation, and experimental planning. The advent of powerful and dedicated computers specialized for large-scale parallel computation, as well as advances in statistical inference algorithms, have greatly enhanced the capabilities of these computational approaches to extract scientific knowledge and bridge gaps between theoretical models and practical implementations. Large-scale commercial success of various ML/AI applications in recent years, including robotics, industrial processes, online image recognition, financial system prediction, and autonomous vehicles, have further demonstrated the potential for data-driven methods to produce dramatic transformations in many fields. These advances, along with the urgency of need to bridge key gaps in knowledge for design and operation of reactors such as ITER, have driven planned expansion of efforts in ML/AI within the US government and around the world. The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science programs in Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) and Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) have organized several activities to identify best strategies and approaches for applying ML/AI methods to fusion energy research. This paper describes the results of a joint FES/ASCR DOE-sponsored Research Needs Workshop on Advancing Fusion with Machine Learning, held April 30–May 2, 2019, in Gaithersburg, MD (full report available athttps://science.osti.gov/-/media/fes/pdf/workshop-reports/FES_ASCR_Machine_Learning_Report.pdf). The workshop drew on broad representation from both FES and ASCR scientific communities, and identified seven Priority Research Opportunities (PRO’s) with high potential for advancing fusion energy. In addition to the PRO topics themselves, the workshop identified research guidelines to maximize the effectiveness of ML/AI methods in fusion energy science, which include focusing on uncertainty quantification, methods for quantifying regions of validity of models and algorithms, and applying highly integrated teams of ML/AI mathematicians, computer scientists, and fusion energy scientists with domain expertise in the relevant areas.","[{""name"": ""David Humphreys"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A.

The focus is mainly on the soil candidates, binding mechanism, the reported strengths and weaknesses for each chemical stabiliser used in soil stabilisation. While it is generally agreed that cement is best suited for sand-sized to gravel-sized soil mixtures (well-graded), lime is mainly used for wet heavy-clay soil mixtures. Polymer emulsion is more suitable for silt-sized to fine gravel-sized soil mixtures (well-graded). Organic soils are the most difficult soil type to stabilise, and for any kind of chemical stabiliser used, the strength gain is relatively minimal. Cement undergoes hydration reaction which is rapid, and results in high compressive strength, while lime undergoes a slower pozzolanic reaction is slower, and provide lower compressive strength. Polymer emulsion depends on the rate of evaporation for the film formation to complete, and results in ductile polymer-soil matrix. Like lime, polymer does not provide significant compressive strength but does provide great flexural strength that prevents crack propagations. The outcomes from this paper provide an insight into recent and upcoming research trend using chemical soil stabilisers on local soil mixtures to improve the engineering properties of pavement layers made of these soil mixtures.","[{""name"": ""E H Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E M M Zahran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S J Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s12665-010-0767-0"", ""10.11648/j.ijtet.20170302.12"", ""10.1186/s40703-017-0041-3"", ""10.1515/secm-2016-0084"", ""10.3141/1819b-10"", ""10.1007/s12205-012-1388-9"", ""10.1155/2018/4158682"", ""10.3141/1652-28"", ""10.2113/gseegeosci.I.2.139"", ""10.1007/s10064-013-0549-5"", ""10.1007/s00723-007-0019-y"", ""10.1186/s40703-017-0064-9"", ""10.1016/S0958-9465(97)00065-6"", ""10.1007/s10064-014-0667-8"", ""10.3141/1787-07"", ""10.3141/1989-49"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201710307014"", ""10.30880/ijie.2018.10.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2015.06.004"", ""10.3923/jas.2016.344.358"", ""10.3923/jas.2015.1266.1277"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.687.329"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.306-307.588""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Saccharomyces cerevisiae entrapped in graphene oxide (GO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and alginate and cross-linked in CaCl2- boric acid solution, was prepared, characterized and applied for U (VI) biosorption. The performance of U sorption and cations release (Na, K, Ca and Mg ions) was investigated under different contact time, initial uranium concentration and initial pH. Uranium sorption equilibrium basically achieved after 360 min. The kinetic data of U biosorption and Ca release were best described by the pseudo first-order equation. Both Langmuir and Freundlich models could fit the U sorption isotherm data. With increase of initial uranium (3.7 ~ 472.2 μmol/L) and sodium concentration (78.8 ~ 3911.7 μmol/L), the cations release ((Na + K)/2 + (Ca + Mg)) decreased from 116.9 to 30.1 μmol/g when the corresponding U sorption increased from 0.6 to 77.3 μmol/g. Initial solution pH at 3 was favorable for U sorption when pH ranged from 3 to 7. With increase of uranium concentration, ion exchange played a less role in U removal. The maximum U sorption capacity reached 142.1 μmol/g, calculated from the Langmuir model at initial pH 5. The O-containing functional group, such as carboxyl on the gel bead played an important role in U adsorption according to FTIR and XPS analysis. XPS analysis showed the existence of U (VI) and U (IV) on the surface of gel bead. Ion exchange, complexation and uranium reduction involved in uranium adsorption by the immobilized active dry yeast gel beads.","[{""name"": ""Can Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Collaborative Innovation Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology, INET , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , P.R.

High resolution mesoscale simulations are essential for accurate characterization of atmospheric flows over heterogeneous land use and complex terrain. Under such conditions, the assumption of grid-cell homogeneity, used in one-dimensional planetary boundary layer (1D PBL) parameterizations, breaks down. However, in most numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, boundary layer turbulence is parameterized using 1D PBL parameterizations. We have therefore developed a three-dimensional (3D) PBL parameterization to better account for horizontal flow heterogeneities. We have implemented and tested the 3D PBL parameterization in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model. The new parameterization is validated using observations from the Wind Forecast Improvement 2 (WFIP 2) project and compared to 1D PBL results.","[{""name"": ""B Kosović"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Jimenez Munoz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T W Juliano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Martilli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Eghdami"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A P Barros"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S E Haupt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1175/1520-0469(2004)061<1816:TNMITT>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1002/2016JD024860"", ""10.1175/MWR-D-15-0208.1"", ""10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0035.1"", ""10.1175/1520-0469(1974)031<1791:AHOTCM>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1029/RG020i004p00851"", ""10.1023/A:1018915827400"", ""10.1023/B:BOUN.0000020164.04146.98"", ""10.2151/jmsj.87.895"", ""10.1007/s10546-015-0045-5"", ""10.1175/MWR-D-13-00318.1"", ""10.1175/1520-0493(1989)117<1872:POOITI>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1175/MWR2830.1""]","['Environmental Science', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Atmospheric Science', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0706 大气科学', 0.7502), ('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7343)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"
10.1002/er.6200,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Thermal runaway behavior of lithium-ion batteries in different charging states under low pressure,"SummaryTo investigate the thermal safety behavior of lithium‐ion batteries during the air transportation process, the batteries with different states of charge (SOC) are heated by heating coil under low pressure. The thermal runaway (TR) behaviors of the batteries are investigated by analyzing the differences in TR phenomenon, temperature, time, and voltage. The results show that the voltage drop time is earlier than the gas release time for all the batteries. The increase in the SOC shortens the voltage drop and TR time, and increases the TR temperature and intensity of the batteries under all pressures. In addition, the reduction of pressure leads to the delay of voltage drop time, the reduction of TR intensity and temperature, and the U‐shaped change of TR time. The influence of SOC on the TR behavior is attributed to the difference of lithium content in the anode which leads to the difference in the energy state and stability of the battery. The difference in TR behavior under different pressures is due to the difference in oxygen content and heat transfer efficiency, which affects the ignition time and combustion behavior of the battery.","[{""name"": ""Song Xie"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Aviation Safety Engineering Civil Aviation Flight University of China  Guanghan China""]}, {""name"": ""Jian Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Aviation Safety Engineering Civil Aviation Flight University of China  Guanghan China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiantao Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Aviation Safety Engineering Civil Aviation Flight University of China  Guanghan China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuanhua He"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Aviation Safety Engineering Civil Aviation Flight University of China  Guanghan China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.03.068"", ""10.1007/s10973-018-7899-y"", ""10.3390/en6094682"", ""10.1016/j.amj.2011.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.02.020"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.07.044"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.06.131"", ""10.1007/s10973-015-5219-3"", ""10.1002/er.4666"", ""10.1016/j.psep.2019.08.023"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.129"", ""10.1007/s10694-020-00963-5"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227425"", ""10.1002/er.4897"", ""10.20964/2019.01.14"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2019.03.002"", ""10.3390/ma10030230"", ""10.1002/er.5298"", ""10.1002/er.5411"", ""10.1016/j.joule.2018.06.015"", ""10.1007/s10973-018-7077-2"", ""10.1002/er.4302"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.07.094"", ""10.1016/j.etran.2019.100034"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.100811"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227347"", ""10.1039/C3RA45748F"", ""10.1016/j.firesaf.2016.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.psep.2020.03.037"", ""10.1016/j.proci.2006.08.055"", ""10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.02.022""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

The study focuses on maximizing the yields of value‐added products that is, wood vinegar and biochar, because of their several applications in the agriculture and easy trading among the farmers with a scope of earning higher economic benefits. The effects of different levels microwave power, reaction time, and various concentrations of additive (biochar) on the yields of the pyrolytic products have been investigated. Under the optimal conditions of pyrolysis (input power of 700 W for microwave, pyrolysis reaction duration of 20 minutes and use of 5% additive from biochar), the yields of wood vinegar and biochar were measured to be 31 and 34 wt%, respectively, with the lower yields of both tars (9.64 wt%) and gas (25.2 wt%). The wood vinegar, obtained from the study, contained about 28%‐32% acids, 10%‐15% phenols, 18%‐20% ketones, and 12% alcohol with the pH in the range of 2.94‐3.21. The lower heating value (LHV) of biochar ranged from 22‐27 MJ/kg. From the techno‐economic and environmental assessment, the monthly income, payback period and quantity of CO2 mitigation are estimated to be USD 44, 3.5 years and 25.6 tones in case of lab‐scale set up and USD 44114, 1.7 years, and 20 549 tones for scaled‐up production systems, respectively. These findings would contribute to diminish the greenhouse gases emissions, mitigate climate change, and help to derive economic benefits for the farmers along with the effective utilization of agro‐residues.","[{""name"": ""Ahmed Elsayed Mahmoud Fodah"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology OUAT  Bhubaneswar India"", ""College of Agricultural Engineering Azhar University  Cairo Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Manoj Kumar Ghosal"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology OUAT  Bhubaneswar India""]}, {""name"": ""Debaraj Behera"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology OUAT  Bhubaneswar India""]}]","[""10.1016/j.biombioe.2003.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.envint.2004.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.031"", ""10.3390/ijerph16050832"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-3272-2_9"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.056"", ""10.1186/s13705-017-0126-z"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122480"", ""10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.09.010"", ""10.5539/jsd.v10n3p81"", ""10.1016/j.jaap.2017.07.024"", ""10.3390/en5124952"", ""10.4155/bfs.10.88"", ""10.5772/intechopen.77380"", ""10.1111/j.1748-5967.2010.00265.x"", ""10.2174/1874331501004010111"", ""10.3390/molecules21091150"", ""10.1016/j.esd.2018.10.002"", ""10.3390/en13102418"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2016.02.094"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2018.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2017.04.030"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2012.06.016"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2013.10.047"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2017.110"", ""10.1007/s12155-020-10172-1"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.06.035"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2013.11.046"", ""10.13031/2013.2911"", ""10.1016/j.susmat.2016.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.01.030"", ""10.1021/ef7006276"", ""10.1021/es071719a"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.11.022"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.155"", ""10.1016/j.tca.2011.03.005"", ""10.1021/es048721b"", ""10.1115/1.4007659"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-9612-5_12"", ""10.1016/j.joei.2020.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.10.027"", ""10.1201/9781351208475-22""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Pollution', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"
10.1002/er.6897,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Renewable energy penetration and energy security in electricity markets,"SummaryThe transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies such as wind and solar is being encouraged worldwide. Renewable energy investment costs have been dropping, which, combined with growing incentives, has led to a rapid rise in renewable capacity. These changes in the electricity market entail great challenges and uncertainties, specifically due to resource availability. Wind and solar energy depend on seasonal weather conditions to generate energy, such as wind and radiation, respectively. However, few studies have focused on analyzing and measuring the impact of a progressive increase of renewable energy in a short‐term electricity market and its effect on energy security. We developed a System Dynamics model to be able to analyze alternative scenarios and levels of uncertainties. We studied the impact of different shares of renewable sources on economic dispatch and energy security through reliability, reserve margin, resilience, and vulnerability measures. High shares of renewable resources (&gt;60%) impact the energy security—reliability (&lt; 98%), reserve margin (&lt;−2%), resilience (&gt;4%), and vulnerability—and may lower the spot price due to zero variable costs, which reduce the profitability of conventional firms in the short term and give closure to firms in the middle term and long term.Novelty StatementIn this study, a system dynamics model is proposed to assess the electricity market configuration and the spot price while renewable energy sources (wind and solar) increase and conventional sources fall (hydropower and fossil fuel). Energy security is measured by including energy measures such as reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and reserve margin in a day‐ahead market. The penetration of renewable energy creates a horizontal movement of the supply curve to the right, affecting wholesale electricity price, energy security, and firms' profitability.Highlights The effect of different shares of renewable energy in a day‐ahead electricity market was studied. Energy security under renewable energy share on economic dispatch was considered. The analyses were performed using a system dynamics model for a theoretical market. High shares of renewable resources may lower the spot price due to zero variable costs. Low spot price reduces the profitability of both conventional and nonconventional firms.","[{""name"": ""Juan Pablo Ríos‐Ocampo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Sciences and Decision and Integrate Decision Sciences Group, Faculty of Mines Universidad Nacional de Colombia  Medellín Colombia"", ""Department of Administrative Sciences.

10.1002/er.8347,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,"Recent developments in CO2 capture, utilization, related materials, and challenges","SummaryAnthropogenic activities including the combustion of fossil fuels have led to a dramatic increase in the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in the last three decades. Since fossil‐based fuels are still the predominant energy source for this century, CO2 is a colossal problem. It is emitted as a consequence of combustion and human activities and is a major greenhouse gas (GHG) that significantly contributes to climate change and global warming, making CO2 emission a worldwide problem. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has proposed a 45% decrease in anthropogenic CO2 emissions by 2030, with a target of “net‐zero” CO2 emissions by 2050. Despite its harmful effects, CO2 has the potential to be used for a wide range of different industrial needs, after its capture. CO2 capture technologies are still in the early stage of development because of economic and technological issues. However, in the future, carbon capture and related application technologies and methods may become easier and more accessible due to the new developments in the materials synthesis, strategies and skills and inexpensive utilization, and functioning cost of the employed methods. Furthermore, carbon capture system (CCS) might improve the recent power plan system properties. Concerning climate change, carbon capture is deemed as a promising solution to prevent CO2 emissions. CO2 capture, storage, and utilization are garnering intensive interest from scientists worldwide. This review paper identifies and gave particular attention to the literature on the recent CO2 capture technologies, for example, adsorption, absorption, membrane, and algae‐based separation techniques for pre‐combustion, oxy‐fuel combustion, and post‐combustion periods. Aside from all of these capture technologies, the utilization and application of captured CO2 in various industrial fields such as solvents, chemicals, and fuels are evaluated.","[{""name"": ""Suleyman G.

10.1002/er.8329,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Recent biopolymers used for membrane fuel cells: Characterization analysis perspectives,"SummaryThe emergence of biopolymers as polymer electrolyte membrane for non‐Nafion used fuel cell application in recent years was an impactful finding. This review gives a different approach to researchers, by exposing the characterization analysis perspectives of developed materials from biomass sources – alginates, carrageenan, cellulose, chitosan and polyhydroxyalkanoates. Their membrane performances are proven in this work through chemistry understandings, hence assuring a clear picture to gain information of these biopolymers' behavior as PEM. These five bio‐precursor materials are believed to perform as high potential PEM alternatives, thus this study appeared to be an insightful guidance to the industry replacing high cost Nafion membrane to a lower cost membrane sources for future massive production economically benign.HIGHLIGHTS Biopolymers are one of the promising natural sources to be utilized as the essential PEM in fuel cell These biopolymers to be highlighted in this review are alginates, chitosan, carrageenan, cellulose and starch Electronic biopolymers like carbon composites, hydrogels, nucleic acid, polyester, polysaccharide and protein imposed great features with their abundant functional groups, strong electrical conductivity, excellent ion conduction, versatility and stability","[{""name"": ""Maryam

Although folding of unlithified or ‘soft’ sediments is typically assumed to produce similar geometries to those in ‘hard rocks’, there has to date been little detailed analysis of such folds. The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate folds developed during soft-sediment deformation (SSD) by applying techniques established for the analysis of tectonic folds during hard-rock deformation (HRD). We use the Late Pleistocene Lisan Formation exposed around the Dead Sea as our case study, as the laminated lake sediments record intricacies of fold detail generated during seismically triggered slumping of mass transport deposits (MTDs) towards the depocentre of the basin. While it is frequently assumed that folds created during SSD are chaotic and form disharmonic structures, we provide analyses that show harmonic fold trains may form during slumping, although larger upright folds cannot be traced for significant distances and are more typically disharmonic. Our analysis also reveals a range of fold styles, with more competent detrital-rich layers displaying buckles (Class 1B), as well as upright Class 1A folds marked by thickened limbs. Class 1A buckle folds are generally considered to be created by flattening that overprints folds with an original Class 1B geometry. As thickened fold limbs are truncated by overlying erosive surfaces, the vertical flattening is considered to have occurred during the slump event. Different fold shapes may partially reflect variable flattening, depending on the original orientation of upright or recumbent folds, together with continued downslope-directed simple-shear deformation that modifies the fold geometry. Analysis of fold wavelength, amplitude and bed thickness allows us to plot strain contour maps, and indicates that beds defining slump folds display viscosity contrasts in the range of 50–250, which are similar to values estimated from folds created during HRD in metamorphic rocks. A range of refold patterns, similar to those established by John Ramsay in metamorphic rocks, are observed within slumps, and are truncated by the overlying sediments, indicating that they formed during a single progressive slump event rather than distinct ‘episodes’ of superimposed deformation. This study confirms that techniques developed for the analysis of folds created during HRD are equally applicable to those formed during SSD, and that resulting folds are generally indistinguishable from one another. Extreme caution should therefore be exercised when interpreting the origin of folds in the rock record where the palaeogeographical and tectonic contexts become increasingly uncertain, thereby leading to potential misidentification of folds created during SSD.","[{""name"": ""G.

10.1002/er.6142,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Enhanced thermal energy storage of nitrate salts by silica nanoparticles for concentrating solar power,"SummaryDispersing nanomaterials can effectively improve the thermal energy storage performance of molten salts. However, research on such improvement mechanism is still immature, as the understanding of the performance improvement levels induced by different nanoparticles has not been consistent. Using silica nanoparticles as additives, this work prepares nine molten salt nanofluids by aqueous solution method with the use of potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, and their binary mixture as base salts. The key thermal performance of these nanofluids are evaluated through different characterization approaches, such as differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, laser flash analysis, and scanning electron microscopy for microstructural characteristics. The possible performance enhancement mechanism caused by silica nanoparticle is also explored. Results show that, for these nine molten salt nanofluids containing silica nanoparticles, the change in the melting point is negligible. The potassium nitrate salt dispersed with 20‐nm silica nanoparticles achieve the highest performance improvement not only in latent heat but in specific heat and thermal conductivity, while sodium nitrate salt nanofluids reach maximum improvement at their decomposing temperature. The improvement level can be associated with the electronegativity of alkali ions. Cloud nuclei cause microstructure differences among molten salt nanofluids and may be the main reason for the thermal performance enhancement of the molten salt nanofluids.","[{""name"": ""Yaxuan Xiong"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Lab of Heating, Gas Supply, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Engineering Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhenyu Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Lab of Heating, Gas Supply, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Engineering Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Mingyuan Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Lab of Heating, Gas Supply, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Engineering Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuting Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer Enhancement and Process Energy Conservation Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Peng Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Lab of Heating, Gas Supply, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Engineering Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Xu Qian"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Energy and Environmental Engineering University of Science and Technology Beijing  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Chuan Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Birmingham Center for Energy storage University of Birmingham  Birmingham UK""]}, {""name"": ""Yulong Ding"", ""affiliation"": [""Birmingham Center for Energy storage University of Birmingham  Birmingham UK""]}, {""name"": ""Chongfang Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Heat Transfer Enhancement and Process Energy Conservation Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2017.10.080"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.026"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.119189"", ""10.1115/1.4002600"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2016.09.050"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2013.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.03.062"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2018.12.019"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.01.025"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.114"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2018.01.014"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2018.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2017.04.011"", ""10.1186/1556-276X-9-582"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.03.134"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2016.07.046"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.11.064"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2010.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.026"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2015.01.012"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2013.10.078"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.11.077"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2018.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.09.004"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.11.045"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.026"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.04.012"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2016.07.016"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-28641-1"", ""10.1186/s11671-015-0984-2"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.11.037"", ""10.1063/1.4949129""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The advantage of molecular protein or gene expression (GE) (mRNA) marker lies in their capability for early (1–3 days after irradiation), high-throughput and point-of-care diagnosis, required for the prediction of the acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in radiological or nuclear scenarios. These molecular marker in most cases respond differently regarding exposure characteristics such as e.g. radiation quality, dose, dose rate and most importantly over time. Changes over time are in particular challenging and demand certain strategies to deal with. With this review, we provide an overview and will focus on already identified and used mRNA GE and protein markers of the peripheral blood related to the ARS. These molecules are examined in light of ‘ideal’ characteristics of a biomarkers (e.g. easy accessible, early response, signal persistency) and the validation degree. Finally, we present strategies on the use of these markers considering challenges as their variation over time and future developments regarding e.g. origin of samples, point of care and high-throughput diagnosis.","[{""name"": ""M Abend"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W F Blakely"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Ostheim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Schuele"",

Gn-A11-18isolated from decomposing solid green household waste in water and soil against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger,"Candida albicans an opportunistic pathogenic fungus causes many infections in humans. WhereasAspergillus nigeris a fungus that can produce ochratoxins, a group of extremely dangerous secondary metabolites that are classified as potentially carcinogenic to humans and also causing deterioration in grapes, strawberries, etc. The purpose of the current study is to isolate, purify, identify and characterize new microorganisms associated with solid green household waste for the control ofC. albicansandA. niger. The antifungal activity of bacterial isolates was carried out in vitro by the agar plug diffusion method, the disk and well diffusion method. The isolate that showed promising activity has been identified by those macroscopic, microscopic and biochemical characteristics. The results obtained in the course of this study showed the isolation of an isolate named Gn-A11-18, which was shown to have significant inhibitory activity with a 42.66% inhibition percentage againstA. nigerand a 44.66 mm inhibition diameter againstC. albicanscompared to the controls. The identification of Gn-A11-18 isolate has shown that this isolate belongs to the genusBacilluswith a similarity toBacillus subtilisandBacillus tequilensis. In the light of the results of this study, we can suggest that the bioactive compound ofBacillussp. Gn-A11-18 could become a biological alternate that could have an important role to fight againstC. albicansandA. niger.","[{""name"": ""Azeddin El Barnossi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fatimazahrae Moussaid"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abdelilah Iraqi Housseini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00207233.2019.1579584"", ""10.1016/j.ejpe.2018.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.022"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2019.01.768"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.058"", ""10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.02.022"", ""10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.06.009"", ""10.1111/1750-3841.12390"", ""10.1007/s11894-015-0436-2"", ""10.1016/j.mycmed.2018.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.archoralbio.2019.01.006"", ""10.1093/cid/ciw038"", ""10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.12.042"", ""10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.11.013"", ""10.1016/j.msec.2017.05.130"", ""10.1093/labmed/lmz018"", ""10.4103/jomfp.JOMFP_157_18"", ""10.1016/j.micres.2012.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2019.04.070"", ""10.1016/j.nano.2009.06.005"", ""10.4314/ajcem.v20i2.7"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-68489-5_3"", ""10.5941/MYCO.2016.44.4.302""]","['Environmental Science', 'Medicine']","['Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health', 'Pollution']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7253), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7027)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)]]"
10.1002/er.7003,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,A highly sensitive magnetic configuration-based triboelectric nanogenerator for multidirectional vibration energy harvesting and self-powered environmental monitoring,"SummaryVibration energy, which is ubiquitous but usually abandoned energy, has been considered as a promising source of energy to be harvested for future power supply to electronics. In this study, we demonstrate the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a rationally designed bi‐axial vibration responsive magnetic configuration (BVMC). Oblique placement of two magnets enables the system to be bi‐axially sensitive and the superior response of such BVMC to vibrations is explored for further utilized to harvest multidirectional vibration energy in a single device. Energy harvesting performance of the multidirectional vibration stimuli‐responsive TENG, called MS‐TENG, under various vibration conditions is investigated. In addition, the further development of the MS‐TENG with an additional magnet exhibits the full (three‐dimensional) vibration energy harvesting ability. The MS‐TENG is applied under‐the‐hood of an automobile where typically abandoned vibrations occur frequently. Turning on the engine on the ignition enables the arrayed MS‐TENG to generate a stable output just by engine trembling. Furthermore, the normal human motion‐driven vibration is used to charge the commercial capacitor to wirelessly transmit the signal including information of ambient temperature and humidity from the Bluetooth thermo‐hygrometer sensor. Consequently, the present TENG with simple but bi‐axially sensitive magnetic configuration has a great potential to effectively harvest the multidirectional and low‐frequency vibrations around us for future feasible applications.","[{""name"": ""Minseok Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering (Integrated Engineering Program) Kyung Hee University  Yongin South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sumin Cho"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering (Integrated Engineering Program) Kyung Hee University  Yongin South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yeongcheol Yun"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering (Integrated Engineering Program) Kyung Hee University  Yongin South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Moonwoo La"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sung Jea Park"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea"", ""Advanced Technology Research Center Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Dongwhi Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering (Integrated Engineering Program) Kyung Hee University  Yongin South Korea""]}]","[""10.1021/nn404614z"", ""10.1038/542159a"", ""10.1002/admt.202000003"", ""10.3390/s18082446"", ""10.1002/adma.201500311"", ""10.1021/nl803904b"", ""10.1021/nn507455f"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104584"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111820"", ""10.1117/12.657464"", ""10.1016/j.sse.2008.12.011"", ""10.1002/adma.201505684"", ""10.1039/C8NR04276D"", ""10.1126/science.1124005"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.073"", ""10.1002/aenm.201702432"", ""10.1021/acsnano.9b08998"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2021.108680"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104541"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104745"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105525"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104440"", ""10.1080/14686996.2019.1630856"", ""10.1002/adfm.201807241"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.11.038"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.12.061"", ""10.1002/aenm.201902460"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.joule.2017.09.004"", ""10.1002/adma.201302397"", ""10.1007/s12274-015-0756-4"", ""10.1021/acsnano.7b05626"", ""10.1007/s12274-016-1109-7"", ""10.1088/2631-6331/ab47ba"", ""10.1039/C4FD00159A"", ""10.1002/aenm.201301322"", ""10.1002/adfm.201302453"", ""10.1021/nn405209u"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104011"", ""10.1021/acsnano.6b01569"", ""10.1021/acsnano.6b07633"", ""10.1002/aenm.201501467"", ""10.1021/acsnano.7b03818"", ""10.1039/C8NR09978B"", ""10.1007/s40684-020-00245-z"", ""10.3390/ma13040872"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.01.004"", ""10.1039/C8NR05957H"", ""10.34133/2021/5963293""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Polymers and Plastics', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Traditional wake models are fast but ignore blockage effects. High-fidelity flow models are more complete, but turnaround times can be relatively long. The objective of this study is a model that combines the speed of traditional models with the accuracy of higher-fidelity approaches. To this end, we use a graph neural network (GNN) as a surrogate model for a steady-state Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model.

These nanocatalysts were characterized with XRD, XPS, SEM–EDX, and TEM. Ru/MWCNT and Ru:Co/MWCNT catalysts with varying Ru:Co atomic ratios were prepared successfully, and electronic state of Ru:Co altered compared to Ru. RSBH activities of these Ru/MWCNT and RuCo/MWCNT were examined in alkaline environment. RuCo/MWCNT at 80:20 atomic ratio exhibits superior H2 evolution. Further experiments were performed with RuCo/MWCNT at 80:20 atomic ratio to determine how NaOH concentration (CNaOH), reaction temperature (Trxn), SBH concentration (CSBH), and amount of nanocatalyst (Mc) affect RSBH activities. Activation energy (Ea) was calculated using the Arrhenius equation. RuCo/MWCNT at 80:20 atomic ratio exhibits superior H2 evolution activities compared to the literature values. Initial rate (IR) for this nanocatalyst was found as 123.9385 mL H2 g−1cat min−1. As a result of these kinetic calculations, the Ea of the nanocatalysts was calculated as 35.978 kJ/mol. The degree of reaction (n) was found to be 0.53 by trial and error. RuCo/MWCNT at 80:20 atomic ratio is a promising nanocatalyst for RSBH.","[{""name"": ""Tulin Avci Hansu"", ""affiliation"": [""Chemical Engineering Department Van Yuzuncu Yil University  Van Turkey"", ""Chemical Engineering Department Siirt University  Siirt Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Omer Sahin"", ""affiliation"": [""Chemical Engineering Department Siirt University  Siirt Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Aykut Çağlar"", ""affiliation"": [""Chemical Engineering Department Van Yuzuncu Yil University  Van Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Hilal Demir Kivrak"", ""affiliation"": [""Chemical Engineering Department Van Yuzuncu Yil University  Van Turkey""]}]","[""10.1002/er.5843"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.10.066"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.09.135"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2018.07.120"", ""10.3906/kim-1411-21"", ""10.1021/acscatal.5b01121"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.198"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2019.113402"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.068"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.036"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.08.013"", ""10.17344/acsi.2017.4151"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.041"", ""10.1080/10426507.2018.1515946"", ""10.1021/ja01097a057"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.098"", ""10.1016/j.joei.2016.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.joei.2014.09.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.027"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.12.089"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.06.138"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.09.053"", ""10.1007/s10562-012-0844-y"", ""10.1016/j.mseb.2015.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.12.134"", ""10.1149/06803.0037ecst"", ""10.1002/er.3918"", ""10.1080/1536383X.2020.1777544"", ""10.3390/catal10040451"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.12.059"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.071"", ""10.3390/molecules15074679"", ""10.1039/c2gc16441h"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.04.022"", ""10.1039/c0ce00512f"", ""10.1007/s10853-018-2013-1"", ""10.1038/srep04452"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2019.01.007"", ""10.1021/am508747m"", ""10.1039/C5CP01829C"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2004.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.096"", ""10.1080/15435075.2014.895737"", ""10.1016/j.molcata.2007.09.025"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.03.009""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chemistry']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Catalysis']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0703 化学', 0.7525), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7384)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7169), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7168)]]"
10.1002/er.7005,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Thermocline vs. two-tank direct thermal storage system for concentrating solar power plants: A comparative techno-economic assessment,"SummaryThis paper concerns the ongoing studies on a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant in operation in Ottana (Italy), comprising a 629 kW organic Rankine cycle (ORC) unit fed by a linear Fresnel solar field. Hexamethyldisiloxane (MM) and “Therminol SP‐I” are used respectively as ORC working fluid and heat transfer fluid in the solar receivers. A two‐tank direct Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system is currently integrated in the CSP plant, serving as a direct interface between solar field and ORC. With the view of improving the solar facility, two alternative TES configurations were proposed in this study: a one‐tank packed‐bed TES system using silica as solid storage media and another similar one including encapsulated phase‐change material (molten salt). Comprehensive mathematical models were developed for simulating daily behaviour as well as for assessing yearly performance of the various TES technologies. Furthermore, a preliminary economic analysis was carried out. Results showed poorer response of the one‐tank TES system to large fluctuations in the ORC inlet fluid temperature, leading to reduction in the mean ORC efficiency (18.2% as against 19.7% obtained with the two‐tank TES). Conversely, higher energy storage density and lower thermal losses were obtained adopting the one‐tank TES, resulting in about 5% more annual solar energy yield. Invariably, equivalent annual ORC energy production of 0.92 GWh/year was obtained for the three TES configurations. Additionally, adopting a one‐tank TES system meant that the purchase costs of a second tank and its storage medium (thermal oil) could be saved, resulting in investment costs about 45% lower and, ultimately, levelized cost of storage about 48% lower than what obtains in the two‐tank TES system.","[{""name"": ""Mario Cascetta"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical, Chemical and Materials Engineering University of Cagliari  Cagliari Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Mario Petrollese"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical, Chemical and Materials Engineering University of Cagliari  Cagliari Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Joseph Oyekale"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical, Chemical and Materials Engineering University of Cagliari  Cagliari Italy"", ""Department of Mechanical Engineering Federal University of Petroleum Resources  Effurun Nigeria""]}, {""name"": ""Giorgio Cau"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical, Chemical and Materials Engineering University of Cagliari  Cagliari Italy""]}]","[""10.1016/J.RSER.2016.09.075"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2020.07.045"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2020.06.059"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.090"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.06.017"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-812959-3.00012-5"", ""10.3390/en12061048"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114806"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.04.097"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.03.049"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.03.262"", ""10.1115/1.1464123"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.139"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.06.064"", ""10.3390/en13020340"", ""10.1016/J.EST.2017.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.10.021"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2013.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2009.10.022"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.03.041"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.01.110"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.03.080"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2014.03.019"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.029"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.02.083"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2015.03.127"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.03.067"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2016.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.03.086"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.12.084"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.05.020"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.07.013"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.02.015"", ""10.2172/15004820"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.106"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.01.019"", ""10.3390/en9090758"", ""10.1002/aic.690180225"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113307"", ""10.1063/1.5138861"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2014.12.067"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.097"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.10.005""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

This situation brings many negative impacts towards the environment, cost, productivity, time, social and economy. The increasing of construction wastes is mainly due to the inefficient waste management practices in the construction projects. Hence, the effective management practices in handling construction waste should be highlighted. This study seeks to identify the waste management practices that are able to engender on-site waste minimization. As much as 54 practices had been found from previous research publications. Mapping technique was used to determine the frequency for each practice. This study have found five (5) significant management practices that need to be emphasized in order to achieve on-site waste minimization. The findings of this paper will help researchers to further investigate the significant management practices in minimizing on-site construction waste.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Fikri Hasmori"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Faizul Md Zin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sasitharan Nagapan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rafikullah Deraman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Norhaslinda Abas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Riduan Yunus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mustafa Klufallah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:4(472)"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.08.016"", ""10.1177/0734242X12437564"", ""10.11591/ijaas.v1i1.476"", ""10.1016/j.sepro.2011.08.025"", ""10.1108/02630800410533285"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2016.10.040"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.11.003"", ""10.1108/20425941311323136"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.04.179"", ""10.1007/s10098-012-0481-6"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2011.01.018"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.09.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:7(647)"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.025"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2010.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2008.02.015""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Despite the basic perception of mining being unsustainable, there has been a radical shift in thinking about mining and sustainable development in recent decades, led by the introduction of numerous guidelines, schemes and protocols to address specific issues and improve reporting and accountability by mines and mining companies – in simple terms, using certification-type schemes to justify a sustainable or responsible approach to mining based on more ethical underpinnings. This chapter presents a unique and concise synthesis of these complex issues and outlines how mining can be described as responsible, sustainable or perhaps ethical even – or not as the case may be.","[{""name"": ""Gavin M.

However, it has been difficult to assess internal thyroid doses to Fukushima residents (mainly from their intake of 131I) due to the lack of direct measurements. For the residents, only about 1,300 data points related to 131I are available, and 1,080 of the data points were obtained from the screening campaign that was conducted by the Nuclear Emergency Response Local Headquarters at the end of March 2011 in Kawamata Town, Iwaki City, and Iitate Village. Here, we reassessed thyroid doses to 1,080 subjects aged ≤15 y old using new age-specific conversion factors to determine 131I thyroid contents from net signals of the devices used, with consideration for the possible uncertainty related to the measurements. The results demonstrated that thyroid equivalent doses to the subjects were &lt;30 mSv (excluding outliers). We also demonstrate dose distributions of each age group from the above three municipalities and those of subjects from Minamisoma City and Fukushima City. One of the findings was that the 131I intake was similar among different age groups in each of the three municipalities. This was consistent with the assumption that ingestion was a dominant route of intake rather than inhalation. The range of thyroid doses to Iitate Village residents was similar to that to Iwaki City residents even though the 131I concentration in tap water was much higher in Iitate Village than Iwaki City. The range of thyroid doses to Minamisoma City residents was similar to that to Iitate Village and Iwaki City residents, and the range for Fukushima City residents was smallest among the five municipalities. Since the major route of intake has remained unclear, this paper presents the plausible upper and lower thyroid doses, between which the actual doses are thought to mostly exist, based on two intake scenarios: single inhalation and repeated ingestion.

Using the Phy-X software, the radiation shielding factors for the proposed glasses were reported. The transmission factor (TF) was calculated for various glass thicknesses, and the findings showed that the TF reduces as the glass thickness increases. The transmission of the photon decreased for BTGS55 from 0.83 to 0.49 at 0.284 MeV and from 0.93 to 0.73 at 0.826 MeV as the sample thickness increased from 0.4 to 1.6 cm. The findings of the radiation protection efficiency (RPE) indicated that a thick glass sample absorbs more photons, suggesting that less radiation passes through the glass, improving RPE. Furthermore, the BTGS0 glass has a higher RPE than the BTGS55 glass, indicating that the glass is more effective at blocking incoming radiation when it contains more GeO2. The BTGS55 sample has the lowest RPE and the greatest TF, whereas the BTGS0 glass has the highest RPE and lowest TF. The tenth value layer (TVL) was also obtained, and it was found that TVL rises with energy, peaking at 1.33 MeV and varied from 9.437 to 11.519 cm. The minimal TVL, in contrast, is estimated to range between 3.245 and 3.890 cm and it occurs at 0.284 MeV BTGS0 has the lowest TVL after the addition of GeO2, which lowers the TVL.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Ibrahim Abualsayed"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics , Faculty of Science, Isra University , Amman , Jordan""]}]","[""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.12.078"", ""10.1016/j.molstruc.2019.07.100"", ""10.1016/j.rinp.2018.02.039"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2018.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119596"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2018.04.106"", ""10.1016/j.net.2019.08.017"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2021.109630"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.10.109"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2017.08.035"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2020.119993"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2020.103511"", ""10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102165"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.172"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2018.06.034"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2019.103047"", ""10.1080/10420150.2018.1493481"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.03.018"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2020.04.615"", ""10.1007/s10854-021-05400-z"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2019.119720"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2017.10.027"", ""10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2019.105959"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2019.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2020.108791"", ""10.1007/s10854-021-05904-8"", ""10.1016/j.rinp.2021.103844"", ""10.1016/j.rinp.2018.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2013.10.041"", ""10.1118/1.3689810"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2017.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2013.12.015"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2012.12.024"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.108496"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121248"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2020.120045"", ""10.1016/j.saa.2018.08.038"", ""10.1016/j.physb.2017.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2017.08.011"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2017.03.023"", ""10.1016/j.nimb.2008.02.004""]","['Materials Science', 'Medicine']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)]]"

Gastrointestinal injury occurs as an acute radiation syndrome. To help inform on the natural history of the radiation-induced injury of the partial body irradiation model, we quantitatively profiled the proteome of jejunum from non-human primates following 12 Gy partial body irradiation with 2.5% bone marrow sparing over a time period of 3 wk. Jejunum was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pathway and gene ontology analysis were performed. A total of 3,245 unique proteins were quantified out of more than 3,700 proteins identified in this study. Also a total of 289 proteins of the quantified proteins showed significant and consistent responses across at least three time points post-irradiation, of which 263 proteins showed strong upregulations while 26 proteins showed downregulations. Bioinformatic analysis suggests significant pathway and upstream regulator perturbations post-high dose irradiation and shed light on underlying mechanisms of radiation damage. Canonical pathways altered by radiation included GP6 signaling pathway, acute phase response signaling, LXR/RXR activation, and intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway. Additionally, we observed dysregulation of proteins of the retinoid pathway and retinoic acid, an active metabolite of vitamin A, as quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Correlation of changes in protein abundance with a well-characterized histological endpoint, corrected crypt number, was used to evaluate biomarker potential. These data further define the natural history of the gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome in a non-human primate model of partial body irradiation with minimal bone marrow sparing.","[{""name"": ""Weiliang Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Baltimore, MD""]}, {""name"": ""Jianshi Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Baltimore, MD""]}, {""name"": ""Tian Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Baltimore, MD""]}, {""name"": ""Gregory Tudor"", ""affiliation"": [""Epistem Ltd., Manchester, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Amy E.

Herein, we report one‐dimensional nanowire‐like bimetallic spinel NixCo3‐xO4 (NCO) electrode materials for high performance hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) applications. This unique nanowire architecture is beneficial for providing abundant exposed active sites onto the large accessible surface area, which results in facilitating ion transporting pathways. Remarkably, the optimal NCO electrode with the ratio of Ni/Co of 1 to 1 (NCO11) achieves the maximum specific capacitance of 1033 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the excellent rate capability of 74.55% at 30 A g−1, far exceeding those of their single counterparts. Furthermore, the as‐assembled HSCs integrating NCO11 and AC electrodes deliver large energy and power densities of 41.54 W h kg−1 and 44.95 kW kg−1 with excellent cyclic retention (96.12%).","[{""name"": ""Periyasamy Sivakumar"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Functional Nanohybrid Material Laboratory, Department of Chemistry Dongguk University Seoul‐Campus  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Min Gyu Jung"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering Sungkyunkwan University  Suwon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Chellan Justin Raj"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Functional Nanohybrid Material Laboratory, Department of Chemistry Dongguk University Seoul‐Campus  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""JeongWon Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Functional Nanohybrid Material Laboratory, Department of Chemistry Dongguk University Seoul‐Campus  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Ho Seok Park"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering Sungkyunkwan University  Suwon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Hyun Jung"", ""affiliation"": [""Advanced Functional Nanohybrid Material Laboratory, Department of Chemistry Dongguk University Seoul‐Campus  Seoul Republic of Korea"", ""Research Center for Photoenergy Harvesting &amp; Conversion Technology Dongguk University Seoul‐Campus  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00252"", ""10.1038/s41578-019-0142-z"", ""10.1021/accountsmr.0c00070"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.100852"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.013"", ""10.1002/aenm.201702930"", ""10.1039/C4EE03229B"", ""10.1038/s41563-020-0747-z"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2019.03.002"", ""10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00116"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2020.03.003"", ""10.1002/aenm.201903848"", ""10.1016/j.mtener.2021.100736"", ""10.1039/C7TA02454A"", ""10.1039/C9TA02583A"", ""10.1002/er.3480"", ""10.1039/C4TA02390K"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2018.05.010"", ""10.1039/C8TA04038A"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2020.135694"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.11.072"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b02491"", ""10.1002/admi.201900959"", ""10.1021/acsnano.5b07352"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b11584"", ""10.1002/er.6492"", ""10.1039/C6TA07112K"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03776"", ""10.1021/nn501783n"", ""10.1002/er.6566"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2016.06.142"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-05528-1"", ""10.1007/s40820-016-0117-1"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.05.045"", ""10.1186/s11671-018-2540-3"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2017.08.115"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b07546"", ""10.1039/C5TA02557E"", ""10.1038/srep23398"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101309"", ""10.1002/er.5270"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.119502"", ""10.1007/s10854-020-03580-8"", ""10.1039/D0NJ03430D"", ""10.1039/C9DT00242A"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147123"", ""10.1002/er.5999"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.08.013"", ""10.1021/acsaem.0c01458"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.102029"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.11.169"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.157874"", ""10.1007/s11051-021-05161-0""]","['Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

Considering the interactions between these domains is a major challenge in product development. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) enables cross-domain system development, based on commonly understood system architectures. However, there is still a gap in using MBSE for development, especially in mechanics. Systematic evaluation of design decisions based on system architecture models is not done. The strong simulation methods predicting physical product behaviour are not well connected to the evolving system architecture. We propose a new approach for connecting simulation and design models in a System Modelling Language (SysML) system model using the example of a combustion engine’s cooling circuit. The electric-mechanical coolant pump is chosen for design. The design processes of the hydrodynamic pump wheel and the volume flow controller are modelled as workflows in SysML. Here, we integrate design models for the pump wheel and the controller into the workflows. Thereby, parameters of the pump wheel and controller are calculated. Design results are automatically transferred to CAD. A workflow is created, testing the cooling circuit’s behaviour against requirements, combining a Simulink control model and a Simcenter Amesim heat transfer model. The approach results in a framework for automated design and test processes.","[{""name"": ""Gregor Höpfner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Georg Jacobs"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thilo Zerwas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Imke Drave"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joerg Berroth"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christian Guist"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernhard Rumpe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jens Kohl"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1115/1.4043313"", ""10.1155/2018/5159189"", ""10.1177/1077546318800124"", ""10.3139/9783446447288.008"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-6430-2_19"", ""10.1109/WSC.2009.5429164"", ""10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482335"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/1097/1/012001""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

However, the lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying process-structure-property relationships hinders the utilisation of DED-AM for the production or repair of safety-critical components. This study uses in situ and operando synchrotron X-ray imaging to provide an improved fundamental understanding of laser-matter interactions and their influence on the melt pool geometry. Coupled with process modelling, these unique observations illustrate how process parameters can influence the DED-AM melt pool geometry. The calibrated simulation can be used for guidance in an industrial additive manufacturing process for microstructure and quality control.","[{""name"": ""Y Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Clark"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A C L Leung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L Sinclair"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Marussi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Atwood"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T Connoley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Jones"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Baxter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P D Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.phpro.2016.08.077"", ""10.1038/ncomms9300"", ""10.3390/ma10111260"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2018.08.041"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2012.11.011"", ""10.1016/j.prostr.2017.11.053"", ""10.1007/s00170-018-2586-5"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2013.09.045"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-03761-2"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-03734-7"", ""10.1063/1.5017236"", ""10.1016/j.mtadv.2019.01.001"", ""10.1107/S1600577516016623"", ""10.1016/j.mtadv.2019.100011"", ""10.1038/ncomms5464"", ""10.1007/s11837-001-0066-z"", ""10.1107/S1600577515003513""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The former ducted-fan has been substituted by a multi-propellers actuator system. The new system has been completely developed, calibrated and used on a test campaign carried out at MARIN’s Concept Basin. It was installed on a 1/50 scaled model of the DeepCwind 5MW semisubmersible turbine built by MARIN within the EU MARINET2/Call No.3 under ACTFLOW project framework. The control strategy of the floating turbine was developed by POLIMI and TUDELFT and integrated into the SIL numerical model. The experiment has proved a good behaviour of the enhanced SiL method. It has revealed that the relative importance of gyroscopic moments is low in comparison with the aerodynamic rotor moments in the considered cases. The results also show how rotor moments are particularly important in the floating turbine dynamics in cases with large rotor load imbalances such as situations where one blade fails to pitch.","[{""name"": ""O.

The nanoparticles were examined by different techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT–IR). The sponge rubber nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image analysis before and after exposures to radiation doses, as well as by the XRD patterns for the unirradiated samples. The different properties of the obtained nanocomposites, including their foaming degree, tensile strength, elongation at break, and thermal conductivity, were also investigated. The foam composites containing nano-CaCO3 possessed the best cell and crosslinking densities and mechanical properties among the other composites, while its foaming degree was the lowest. The results indicated that the thermal conductivity was reduced by increasing the foaming agent concentration. However, it increased as the radiation dose increased, and the optimum radiation dose was obtained at 75 kGy. The foam containing MMT exhibited an intermediate behavior while high thermal conductivity was recorded for the foam containing the CaCO3 nanoparticles.","[{""name"": ""Hanan M.

U–Pb zircon ages reveal three stages of plutonism including: (i) sparse 3.2 Ga granodiorite plutons intruding the TTG (tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite) basement away from the western boundary of the Nagamangala greenstone belt; (ii) 3.0 Ga monzogranite to quartz monzonite plutons adjoining the Nagamangala greenstone belt; and (iii) 2.6 Ga monzogranite plutons in the Pandavpura region. Elemental data of the 3.2 Ga granodiorite indicate their origin through the melting of mafic protoliths without any significant residual garnet. Moderate to poorly fractionated REE patterns of 3.0 Ga plutons with negative Eu anomalies and Nd isotope data with ε Nd (T) = 3.0 Ga ranging from −1.7 to +0.5 indicate the involvement of a major crustal source with minor mantle input. Melts derived from those two components interacted through mixing and mingling processes. Poorly fractionated REE patterns with negative Eu anomalies of 2.6 Ga plutons suggest plagioclase in residue. The presence of magmatic epidote in all of the plutons points to their rapid emplacement and crystallization at about 5 kbars. The 3.2 Ga intrusions could correspond to reworking associated with a major juvenile crust-forming episode, whilst 3.0 Ga potassic granites correspond to cratonization linked to melting of the deep crust. The 2.6 Ga Pandavpura granite could represent lower-crustal melting and final cratonization, as 2.5 Ga plutons are absent in the WDC.","[{""name"": ""M.

The strength and durability of this material will decrease over time due to several factors that influence the mechanism of its structural characteristics. Although the compression strength is excellent, it is weak in tensile. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are widely used as an alternative material to replace metal-based engineering materials. This material has properties such as lightweight products, low production costs, easy to form, high tensile and flexural strength, and elastic. The purpose of this review paper is to provide information about the application of FRP composites as reinforcement of concrete structures either as repairs or new structures. Initially, FRP composite materials were used as reinforcement structures for reinforced concrete column-beam joints. The resulting structure has increased the flexural ability due to the load given. The addition of natural fiber (jute) to concrete also increases in the hardness of concrete. Other investigations regarding the application of FRP composites in concrete to improve strength performance are discussed in this paper. Finally, the technique of wrapping FRP composites in concrete in an effort to improve the performance of the resulting structure is also discussed in the paper.","[{""name"": ""M Y Yuhazri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A J Zulfikar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Ginting"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.25082/MER.2019.02.007"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.02.032"", ""10.1007/s40069-016-0182-3"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111634"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.10.088"", ""10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104511"", ""10.4236/jmmce.2016.41002"", ""10.1007/s10570-019-02543-5"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2017.12.155"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.107694"", ""10.31289/jmemme.v3i1.2416"", ""10.1177/204124791700800203"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.04.043"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2017.11.034"", ""10.1007/s10924-009-0155-6"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0268(2006)10:2(139)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0268(2005)9:2(187)"", ""10.15623/ijret.2012.0101007"", ""10.1016/S0950-0618(02)00092-2"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2006.07.020"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.048"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0000152"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.04.050"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119763""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Besides, its high nitrogen content and facile synthesis procedure may provide a good balance between activity and durability. We report novel g‐C3N4 based MOF as a novel electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Two methods are involved in the catalytic synthesis, namely the hydrothermal method for the Cu/Ni MOF and its composites synthesis, and g‐C3N4 is obtained by pyrolysis of melamine. To explore the structural and morphological properties, all the catalysts were eventually characterized using XRD, FTIR, SEM, and EDX techniques, whereas cyclic voltammetry (CV) revealed the electrochemical response for the oxidation of methanol in 3 M methanol and 1 M NaOH on modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electrochemical results illustrate that as the amount of g‐C3N4 increases current density for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The maximum current density is 103.42 mA/cm2 shown by Cu/Ni MOF@5 wt% g‐C3N4 at 0.9 V while the scan rate is 50 mV/s. Thus, graphitic carbon nitride addition in MOF composites enhanced its durability and high carbon monoxide (CO) tolerance makes active catalysts in alkaline electrolyte.","[{""name"": ""Muzzamil Abbasi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical and Materials Engineering (SCME) National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)  Islamabad Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Tayyaba Noor"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical and Materials Engineering (SCME) National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)  Islamabad Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Naseem Iqbal"", ""affiliation"": [""U.S.‐Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Energy (USPCAS–E) National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)  Islamabad Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Neelam Zaman"", ""affiliation"": [""U.S.‐Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Energy (USPCAS–E) National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)  Islamabad Pakistan""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.06.011"", ""10.1080/00139150409605818"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2016.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2005.01.051"", ""10.1080/01614940.2020.1802811"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2022.135042"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00332-8"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.09.081"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.030"", ""10.1149/1.3561636"", ""10.1039/D1RA02240G"", ""10.1016/j.jmst.2021.10.031"", ""10.1186/s11671-018-2498-1"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.093"", ""10.1021/jp103049x"", ""10.1021/jacs.7b12353"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.01.061"", ""10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c01147"", ""10.4061/2011/563495"", ""10.1021/jp982887f"", ""10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03664"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2015.10.128"", ""10.1007/s12274-021-3461-5"", ""10.1038/s41467-020-18459-9"", ""10.1039/C9NR06304H"", ""10.1039/D0QI01523G"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.161"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.05.075"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.07.064"", ""10.1002/er.6316"", ""10.1016/j.arabjc.2015.05.024"", ""10.1038/nature01650"", ""10.1002/anie.200300610"", ""10.1039/C5CS00940E"", ""10.1016/j.enchem.2019.100001"", ""10.1039/B618320B"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.164"", ""10.1007/s10562-019-02904-6"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2019.03.116"", ""10.3390/nano10081601"", ""10.3390/catal9100856"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.131"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.02.104"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.01.150"", ""10.3390/nano10081601"", ""10.1016/j.cclet.2013.01.030"", ""10.1149/1.1517281"", ""10.1039/c4gc00056k"", ""10.3390/ma10060604"", ""10.1039/C7CY02063E"", ""10.1039/B702213A"", ""10.1002/ejic.200801224"", ""10.1039/C9QI00274J"", ""10.3389/fmats.2019.00016"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2016.11.008"", ""10.1002/adma.201001068"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2008.12.005"", ""10.1039/C4RA08952A"", ""10.1016/S1452-3981(23)07755-6"", ""10.1039/D0RA04193A"", ""10.1002/celc.202100649"", ""10.20964/2017.11.61"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2009.11.034"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.09.014"", ""10.1016/j.snb.2015.09.029"", ""10.1049/mnl.2012.0774"", ""10.1007/0-306-46916-2_2"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.014""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1002/er.6925,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Effects of leg geometry and multistaging of thermoelectric modules on the performance of a photovoltaic-thermoelectric system using different photovoltaic cells,"SummaryResearch into improving the performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems using thermoelectric generators (TEGs) has gained increased interest in recent times. Few studies have separately investigated the effects of multistaging, thermoelectric geometry, and type of PV cell on overall performance of PV‐thermoelectric (PV‐TE) systems. Thermoelectric leg geometries considered in these studies were either rectangular or trapezoidal legs. The research work related to examine the combined consequences of PV cell type, TEG leg geometry and multistaging on the overall performance of PV‐TEs has not been carried out till date. Therefore, a three‐dimensional model of this hybrid system considering two different types of PV cells and the rectangular and circular TEG leg geometries in single and multistage arrangements has been investigated using ANSYS 2020 R2 software. A parametric study considering the effects of concentrated solar irradiation, TEG cold junction convective film coefficient and load resistance on the overall performance of the hybrid system has been carried out. Results show that, for both types of PV cell, the circular leg geometry of TEG provides the highest PV‐TE performance. Also, the PV cell type significantly affects the optimum number of TEG stages in the PV‐TE system. Finally, multistaging increases the thermal stresses developed in the PV‐TE system, although the circular leg TEG provides the least thermal stresses as compared with the traditional rectangular leg TEG. Quantitatively, the PV‐TE system with single and two‐stage circular leg TEGs reduced the thermal stress levels of their rectangular leg counterparts by 3.31% and 0.78%, respectively. The findings of this study can be used as a reference for all types of PV cell in the PV‐TE systems.","[{""name"": ""Chika Maduabuchi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Nigeria  Nsukka Nigeria"", ""Department of Mechanical Engineering Federal University of Agriculture  Makurdi Nigeria""]}, {""name"": ""Ravita Lamba"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering Malaviya National Institute of Technology  Jaipur India""]}, {""name"": ""Howard Njoku"", ""affiliation"": [""Applied Renewable and Sustainable Energy Research Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Nigeria  Nsukka Nigeria"", ""Department of Mechanical Engineering Science University of Johannesburg  Auckland Park South Africa""]}, {""name"": ""Mkpamdi Eke"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Nigeria  Nsukka Nigeria""]}, {""name"": ""Chigbo Mgbemene"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Nigeria  Nsukka Nigeria""]}]","[""10.1007/s11664-010-1279-0"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.04.023"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.081"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.04.055"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.05.048"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.116041"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.074"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112515"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.025"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.02.061"", ""10.1186/s40807-015-0016-y"", ""10.1007/s11664-020-08390-6"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.03.023"", ""10.1007/s11664-018-6421-4"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.057"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.117742"", ""10.1002/er.6644"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2012.09.019"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.080"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.08.095"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.117660"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112778"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.12.016"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.07.027"", ""10.3390/sym12050786"", ""10.1063/1.5115044"", ""10.1016/S0011-2275(02)00035-8"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2014.10.040"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.088"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/202123900005"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2020.12.130"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.079"", ""10.1016/0038-092X(81)90051-7"", ""10.3390/en10010020"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2005.02.008"", ""10.1007/s11664-020-08331-3"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2012.07.021"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2015.10.029"", ""10.1007/s11664-018-6410-7"", ""10.3389/fenrg.2018.00101"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.042""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1002/er.8331,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Effect of pore structures in nickel-based porous transport layers for high-performance and durable anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis,"SummaryInvestigation of the anode porous transport layer (PTL) is crucial for the commercialization of anion‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE). Recently, nickel foam (Ni‐foam) has been employed as an alternative to the conventional titanium‐based PTL (Ti‐felt) and strategies to improve its performance and durability have been developed. However, few studies have investigated the effect of pore structures in Ni‐foam and the applications of other Ni‐based PTLs have not been reported. In this study, two Ni‐based PTLs with different pore structures, Ni‐foam and nickel felt (Ni‐felt), were applied and investigated to attain a suitable microstructure in the PTL. The AEMWEs with the optimized Ni‐foam and Ni‐felt showed superior performance and durability than that with the conventional Ti‐felt. In particular, the application of Ni‐foam as an anode PTL resulted in higher performance than that of Ni‐felt, which is attributed to the reduced mass transfer resistance caused by the interconnected pore structure. The Ni‐foam PTL optimized in this study can be an efficient alternative to the conventional Ti‐felt PTL because it can facilitate the enhanced AEMWE performance and durability.","[{""name"": ""Ji Eun Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy and Materials Engineering Dongguk University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Hee Ji Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering Kangwon National University  Samcheok Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sun Young Kang"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Nanoparticle Research Institute for Basic Science (IBS)  Seoul Republic of Korea"", ""School of Chemical and Biological Engineering Seoul National University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Ga Young Jang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering Kangwon National University  Samcheok Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Ok‐Hee Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Science Republic of Korea Naval Academy  Changwon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Mohanraju Karuppannan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy and Chemical Engineering Incheon National University  Incheon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yung‐Eun Sung"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Nanoparticle Research Institute for Basic Science (IBS)  Seoul Republic of Korea"", ""School of Chemical and Biological Engineering Seoul National University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Oh Joong Kwon"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy and Chemical Engineering Incheon National University  Incheon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yong‐Hun Cho"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering Kangwon National University  Samcheok Republic of Korea"", ""Center for Nanoparticle Research Institute for Basic Science (IBS)  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1016/j.est.2019.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2020.106704"", ""10.1021/ja302439z"", ""10.33961/JECST.2017.8.3.183"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.10.143"", ""10.1002/aenm.202003188"", ""10.1002/er.6739"", ""10.1002/anie.201308099"", ""10.1039/D0TA12336F"", ""10.1149/2.0421908jes"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.082"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.069"", ""10.1002/aenm.202002285"", ""10.1021/acscatal.0c04200"", ""10.1021/acscatal.1c04117"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2011.12.072"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05264"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.02.025"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.01.191"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.02.058"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.10.050"", ""10.1039/C9TA13137J"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b06767""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)]]"
10.2298/NTRP2104315O,NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT NANO SIZE AND BULK WO3 ENRICHED BY HDPE COMPOSITES ON ATTENUATION OF THE X-RAY NARROW SPECTRUM,"The X-rays of the narrow-spectrum N-series ranging from 40 kV to 150 kV were used to determine the radiation attenuation ability of a new category of a polymer composite fabricated for shielding purposes. High density polyethylene was synthesized through a compression molding technique, and incorporated with various filler amounts (10, 15, 25, and 35 wt.%) of bulk micro-sized WO 3 (Sample A), two WO 3 nanoparticles 45 nm (Sample B), and 24 nm (Sample C). The WO 3 filler was identified and characterized using X-ray diffraction and a transmission electron microscope. The mass distribution of the chemical elements of the synthesized composites was determined by energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The obtained results of the different attenuation parameters revealed that the particle size and weight fraction of WO particles have an outstanding effect on the X-ray shielding ability of this composite. The 3 experimental measurements of the mass attenuation coefficients were compared to the theoretical values tabulated in the NIST databases XCOM and FFAST. The mass attenuation coefficient was increased with the increment of WO 3 wt.% as well as with the decrease of the WO 3 particle size. This improvement in the attenuation parameters of the NP(C) composite suggests their promising applications in radiation protection at the diagnostic level.","[{""name"": ""Amro Obeid"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon + Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission, National Council for Scientific Research, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Balaa El"", ""affiliation"": [""Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission, National Council for Scientific Research, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Samad El"", ""affiliation"": [""Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission, National Council for Scientific Research, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Zainab Alsayed"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Ramadan Awad"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Badawi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon + Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt""]}]","[""10.1016/j.apradiso.2008.04.012"", ""10.1590/1980-5373-MR-2015-0576"", ""10.2298/NTRP210110001A"", ""10.1007/s10311-021-01189-9"", ""10.2298/NTRP190718033A"", ""10.1038/s41598-021-87518-y"", ""10.2298/NTRP2001042A"", ""10.2298/NTRP2002138M"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1652/1/012008"", ""10.1007/s00339-018-1915-8"", ""10.1016/j.nimb.2020.01.027"", ""10.1088/2053-1591/ab1a89"", ""10.3390/ma13194371"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncw293"", ""10.1049/joe.2018.9126"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncw093"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncz185"", ""10.2298/NTRP1504249B"", ""10.1039/D0RA08372K"", ""10.1002/app.38515"", ""10.1007/s12034-017-1373-5"", ""10.1016/j.snb.2007.07.013"", ""10.1080/1023666X.2020.1803566"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2018.02.026"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2017.02.054"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/59/15/4149"", ""10.1118/1.3633892"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2019.06.031"", ""10.3390/app11094010""]","['Materials Science', 'Medicine']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)]]"

The carbon monoxide (CO) in the produced hydrogen rich steam will be poison to the PEMFC and limits the application of this technic. This study develops a new methanol fuel processing system (MFPS) with incorporated methanol steam reforming and CO selective methanation modules for production of hydrogen rich steam with a low concentration of CO, and used to directly supply for the PEMFC. The core component of the MFPS is a highly layer‐packed microreactor, wherein methanol steam reforming, methanol combustion, and CO selective methanation reactions can occur. For the developed MFPS, an optimized methanol supply strategy is proposed to startup the MFPS, the fastest startup time is about 15.8 minutes. Experimental tests showed that the MFPS can be continuously operated for more than 100 hours with CO concentration below 10 ppm. The produced hydrogen rich steam was directly supplied for a PEMFC to generate 100 W electricity. Results obtained in this study demonstrated that the developed MFPS can produce CO‐free hydrogen rich stream for the supply of PEMFC, the generated electricity can be used to power mobile device and/or electronics.","[{""name"": ""Yancheng Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems, School of Mechanical Engineering Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China"", ""Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology of Zhejiang Province, School of Mechanical Engineering Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Qiong Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology of Zhejiang Province, School of Mechanical Engineering Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Deqing Mei"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems, School of Mechanical Engineering Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China"", ""Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology of Zhejiang Province, School of Mechanical Engineering Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Yidong Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology of Zhejiang Province, School of Mechanical Engineering Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}]","[""10.1007/s11708-017-0501-7"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2019.106273"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.157"", ""10.1002/er.3531"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.071"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.11.202"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118500"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.02.114"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.05.135"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2015.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.10.014"", ""10.1002/er.1805"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114269"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.07.011"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.176"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.118"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2019.10.024"", ""10.1002/er.5225"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2014.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2010.09.086"", ""10.1002/er.3797"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2018.02.032"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.163"", ""10.1021/cs400011m"", ""10.1149/1.2095401"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.02.136"", ""10.1002/ese3.461"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2017.02.001"", ""10.1080/00102202.2012.675375"", ""10.1002/aic.16558"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.084""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Catalysis']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7169), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7168)]]"
10.1002/er.7109,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,A comprehensive review of energy blockchain: Application scenarios and development trends,"SummaryThe disruptive nature of blockchain technology has drawn considerable interest from different types of stakeholders. It is adopted in numerous sectors with the ability to openly and securely verify, track, and exchange data. The energy blockchain, a term used when blockchain technology is applied in the energy sector, is considered as having the potential to develop a decentralized, digitized, and decarbonized energy management system. The article presents an overview of the development progress from three perspectives, including academic research, the deployment of companies and pilot projects, and government support policies. Then a different taxonomy is developed to demonstrate and highlighted the different applications. Finally, the future trends and challenges hindering the effective implementation of energy blockchain are discussed. The results show that energy blockchain is an effective innovation technology to accelerate the transformation of global energy structure.

The performance of a NACA633-418 airfoil with five different damage types was predicted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with bumps at the leading edge and grooves into the leading edge. Also, one type corresponding to a repair of a leading edge with an “overbite” was investigated. These airfoil characteristics were used in rotor computations where three different wind climates and five different maximum tip speeds were investigated. The rotor computations reflected that the Annual Energy Production (AEP) increased significantly with the average wind speed on the site. They also reflected that the relative AEP losses due to leading edge damages reduced with increasing average wind speed on sites. For the low wind speed site the losses were between 1% and 4% depending on the extent and the type of the blade damage. For the high wind speed site the losses were between 0.5% and 3%. Furthermore, the bigger the extent of the damages were the bigger the losses were. Finally, it was shown that increasing the maximum tip speed increased AEP and decreased the losses.","[{""name"": ""Christian Bak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander M.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is used for diagnosis. CT generates ionising radiation, and thus, abdominal shielding may be used. This phantom study investigated the effects of patient shielding and scan length reduction on the fetal and maternal ionising radiation dose from CTPA. The absorbed dose to the fetus was measured using thermoluminescent dosemeters. Estimated effective doses to the pregnant patient were based on the dose-length products. Shielding increased both the effective dose to the patient by 47% and the mean absorbed dose to the fetus (0.10 vs. 0.12 mGy; p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with unshielded standard CTPA, as it affected the automatic exposure control. Shielded short CTPA marginally lowered only the mean fetal absorbed dose (0.03 vs. 0.02 mGy; p = 0.018). Shortening the scan reduced the fetal absorbed dose most effectively by 70% (0.10 vs. 0.03 mGy; p = 0.006), compared with the standard unshielded scan. Shielding modestly reduces fetal radiation dose but may compromise automatic exposure control, possibly increasing the maternal and fetal radiation dose. Shortening the scan is beneficial, assuming anatomical coverage is secured.","[{""name"": ""Dino Begano"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Medical Imaging and Physiology, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö SE-205 02, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Marcus Söderberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Medical Radiation Physics, Department of Translational Medicine, Lund University, Malmö SE-205 02, Sweden"", ""Radiation Physics, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö SE-205 02, Sweden""]}, {""name"": ""Anetta Bolejko"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Medical Imaging and Physiology, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö SE-205 02, Sweden"", ""Department of Health Sciences, Lund University, Lund SE-221 00, Sweden""]}]","[""10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60996-X"", ""10.1148/rg.305105034"", ""10.2214/AJR.09.3506"", ""10.21037/cdt.2017.12.01"", ""10.2214/AJR.10.4497"", ""10.1007/s00330-008-1158-8"", ""10.2214/AJR.18.20508"", ""10.1259/bjr/31771954"", ""10.1016/j.ejmp.2018.03.017"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24535-0"", ""10.2214/ajr.182.5.1821107"", ""10.4103/1947-2714.179128"", ""10.1148/radiology.185.2.1410342"", ""10.1097/RCT.0b013e318198cd18"", ""10.1259/bjr/86609718"", ""10.1118/1.3544350"", ""10.1016/j.ejrnm.2016.08.012"", ""10.3109/02841851003698206"", ""10.1118/1.4771934""]",['Medicine'],"['Internal Medicine', 'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.708), ('1005 中医学', 0.6974)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7137), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7089)]]"
10.1002/er.6932,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Save water and energy: A techno-economic analysis of a floating solar photovoltaic system to power a water integration project in the Brazilian semiarid,"SummaryThis paper proposes the use of a floating solar photovoltaic (FSPV) power plant as an alternative renewable energy resource for the San Francisco River Integration Project (SFIP), which aims to deliver water to 12 million people in the Brazilian semiarid. The SFIP requires considerable amounts of energy in a region that has had increasing electricity costs and consumption of water in the past decade. By simulating an FSPV power plant at the System Advisor Model (SAM) using techniques and parameters of real FSPV projects, the results demonstrated the techno‐economic feasibility of this technology linked to the SFIP. The economic outcomes are positive net present value (NPV), $2.8 million, and a payback varying from 10.5 to 11.7 years. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of $32.17/MWh is smaller than the current energy rates paid by the SFIP administrator, and the water costs to final consumers could be reduced by 40%. In addition, the FSPV's capacity factor was 21.1%, and the system could minimize water evaporation from one of the SFIP's reservoirs by 16.7%. The system can also create revenues for the San Francisco and Parnaiba Valleys Development Company (CODEVASF) by trading the excess of electricity with the grid. This paper also analyses the FSPV's environmental impacts and its relevance under the water–energy nexus in the Brazilian Northeast.

As artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques advance, data-driven methods especially deep learning algorithms have become the rising star in RUL prediction. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants such as Long Short Term Memory have proven effectiveness in various sequential tasks. However, due to its iterative nature along the time axis, RNNs take much time for information to flow through the network for prediction. Inspired by recent advance brought by Transformer in sequence transduction tasks, we proposed the attention mechanism based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with positional encoding to tackle this problem. The attention mechanism enables the network to focus on specific parts of sequences and positional encoding injects position information while utilizing the parallelization merits of CNN on GPUs. Empirical experiments show that the proposed approach is both time effective and accurate in battery RUL prediction.","[{""name"": ""Beitong Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cheng Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guijun Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yong Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.107"", ""10.3390/en6083654"", ""10.3390/en7020520"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.05.036"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.035"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.020"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.134"", ""10.1177/0142331208092030"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.106"", ""10.1016/j.microrel.2012.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.176"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2808918"", ""10.36001/phmconf.2010.v2i1.1896"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2805189"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2017.07.017"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2774777"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113626"", ""10.1162/neco.1989.1.4.541"", ""10.1007/s10994-019-05815-0""]",['Engineering'],"['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

However, uncertainties are high during this early phase and it is important to characterise these uncertainties and, if possible, include them in any dispersion modelling. In this paper we examine three sources of uncertainty in dispersion modelling; uncertainty in the source term, uncertainty in the meteorological information used to drive the dispersion model and intrinsic uncertainty within the dispersion model. We also explore the possibility of ranking these uncertainties dependent on their impact on the dispersion model outputs.","[{""name"": ""S.J. Leadbetter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S.

An accurate method of predicting concrete compressive strength can provide a significant advantage to the construction material industry, particularly within the concrete material industry. Many methods can be used to build the prediction model of concrete compressive strength. However, the traditional methods have so many shortcomings, including expensive experimental costs and the inability to formulate an accurate complex relationship between the components of a concrete mixture with the compressive strength. To overcome this issue, this study applies multiple artificial intelligence (AI) methods to find the most accurate input and output relationships within concrete mixtures. The three types of AI methods that will be used in this study are artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR). This study uses 1030 data samples from concrete compressive strength tests obtained from University of California, Irvine, to demonstrate the use of AI prediction models. The obtained results of the simulation show that these artificial intelligence methods can build predictive models without conducting any expensive experiments in the laboratory with good accuracy.","[{""name"": ""H N Muliauwan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Prayogo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Gaby"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K Harsono"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0008-8846(98)00165-3"", ""10.9744/ced.20.1.21-29"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000088"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2013.11.014"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(1999)13:1(36)"", ""10.1007/s00521-018-3426-0"", ""10.1080/15435075.2016.1206549"", ""10.1007/s00500-018-3400-x"", ""10.1007/s13349-018-0287-2"", ""10.1155/2018/6490169"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000599"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000347"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201820306006"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.09.054""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Molecular dynamics simulations can be used to calculate various physical properties of materials based on specific interaction potentials.

This research was conducted to find the potential parameter values of Lennard-Jones metal Fe, Pb, Ni and Cr based on the melting point value of the material using the LAMMPS program. In this study the normalization of potential parameters is done by comparing the results of the simulation melting point with the experimental melting point. This research produces a Lennard-Jones potential parameter value which yields a melting point value that has a relatively small description.","[{""name"": ""C Y Maghfiroh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Arkundato"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Misto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W Maulina"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.anucene.2013.06.004"", ""10.1063/1.3462751"", ""10.1063/1.4895878"", ""10.19184/jid.v17i1.2661""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemistry']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Physical and Theoretical Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0703 化学', 0.7595), ('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.7513)]]"

In both cases, the authors concluded that they had demonstrated that RF EMFs are carcinogenic in male rats but not in female rats or mice (NTP only). The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) has evaluated their methods and findings for potential information about the carcinogenicity of exposure to RF EMFs. We found that these studies had important strengths; for example, both followed good laboratory practice (GLP), both used much larger numbers of animals than previous research, and both exposed animals over the whole of their lives. We also noted some major weaknesses, including a lack of blinding, difficulties interpreting statistical analyses due to the association between longer lifespans and tumor occurrence in the exposed rats (NTP only), and failure to account for chance. ICNIRP concluded that these substantial limitations preclude conclusions being drawn concerning RF EMFs and carcinogenesis.",[],"[""10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.037"", ""10.1159/000086354"", ""10.1016/j.pathophys.2012.11.001"", ""10.1038/nature11556""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Chemical Health and Safety', 'Cancer Research', 'Biophysics']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7042), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.6969)], [('0836 生物工程', 0.6862), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.684)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7179), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7089)]]"

Our results, along with other studies, serve as a proof of concept that Quantum Machine Learning (QML) methods can have similar or better performance, in specific cases of low number of training samples, with respect to conventional ML methods even with a limited number of qubits available in current hardware. To utilise algorithms with a low number of qubits — to accommodate for limitations in both simulation hardware and real quantum hardware — we investigated different feature reduction methods. Their impact on the performance of both the classical and quantum models was assessed. We addressed different implementations of two QML models, representative of the two main approaches to supervised quantum machine learning today: a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a kernel-based method, and a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), a variational approach.","[{""name"": ""Vasilis Belis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samuel González-Castillo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christina Reissel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sofia Vallecorsa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elías F.

10.1002/er.6202,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Graphene for hydrogen energy storage - A comparative study on GO and rGO employed in a modified reversible PEM fuel cell,"SummaryWe present an experimental investigation on graphene for electrochemical hydrogen storage when employed in a modified reversible polymer electrolyte membrane (MRPEM) fuel cell. Synthesis of graphene nanomaterial is performed to obtain graphene oxide (GO) using the modified Hummers method. Oxides in GO are reduced to get reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using Cedrus deodara (CD) tree's leaf extract. Physical characterisation of the prepared GO and CD‐rGO is done to ascertain their properties, viz, internal pore surface area, average pore diameter, etc. Solid electrodes are fabricated from the prepared powdered samples of GO and CD‐rGO, and later tested in an MRPEM fuel cell. Electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity of GO and CD‐rGO is found to be 1.21 and 2.7 wt%, respectively. It is successfully demonstrated that hydrogen ions could be stored in a porous graphene electrode and recovered back. The obtained results are analysed to draw a relation between physical characteristics of graphene and electrochemical hydrogen adsorption. It is found that higher internal pore surface area attracts more hydrogen storage in ionic form. This research work is a maiden attempt to show, experimentally, the physical/chemical adsorption of hydrogen in graphene when employed in a reversible PEM fuel cell. This surely could contribute towards the development of a safe and efficient alternate powering source with many potential applications.","[{""name"": ""Himanshu Jindal"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department, University Institute of Engineering and Technology Chitkara University  Rajpura India""]}, {""name"": ""Amandeep Singh Oberoi"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology  Patiala India""]}, {""name"": ""Inderjeet Singh Sandhu"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department, University Institute of Engineering and Technology Chitkara University  Rajpura India""]}, {""name"": ""Mansi Chitkara"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department, University Institute of Engineering and Technology Chitkara University  Rajpura India""]}, {""name"": ""Baljit Singh"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Mechanical Engineering Universiti Teknologi MARA  Shah Alam Malaysia""]}]","[""10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.244"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.107"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.012"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.05.093"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.018"", ""10.1016/S0378-3820(02)00092-9"", ""10.1016/S0360-3199(00)00016-1"", ""10.1073/pnas.1019542108"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.05.118"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.132"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.03.144"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.02.242"", ""10.1021/acs.iecr.9b04635"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2013.07.037"", ""10.1016/j.mspro.2015.06.031"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.195"", ""10.4236/graphene.2016.52005"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.112"", ""10.1002/er.2983"", ""10.1002/er.2971"", ""10.1002/ente.201700636"", ""10.1002/er.1886"", ""10.1002/er.5674"", ""10.1002/er.3203"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.241"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.02.052"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.03.129"", ""10.1002/ceat.200900376"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.04.021"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2003.08.010"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.250"", ""10.1039/C2CP42538F"", ""10.4236/graphene.2017.61001"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.118"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2004.08.036"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.024"", ""10.1016/j.tca.2017.07.005"", ""10.3390/s16010103"", ""10.1021/la4029904"", ""10.1186/1556-276X-8-247"", ""10.1016/j.elspec.2014.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.227""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

Nano-calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was prepared from eggshells (ESs) waste. Sponge rubber nanocomposites were prepared and were irradiated by electron beam (EB) radiation at 25, 75, and 150 kGy. Their physicochemical properties, including foam density, compression set (CS), hardness, abrasion loss, and expansion ratio, and their thermal stability were investigated. The physicochemical properties were enhanced by adding 2.5 phr of a foaming agent. Among the composites examined, the foam composites containing nano-CaCO3had the lowest CS, abrasion loss, and expansion ratio and the highest hardness and foam density. The results confirmed that the thermal stability was improved by incorporating nano-CaCO3into the SBR foam and as the radiation dose increased. The sponge containing nanoclay demonstrated an intermediate behavior, whereas that with CaCO3nanoparticles showed low average cell diameter and size and high cell wall thickness. The radiation process enhanced the foam density, CS, abrasion loss, hardness, and thermal property of the developed nanocomposites by inducing the formation of intermolecular crosslinks within the composite matrix.The results showed that physicochemical properties improved by increasing the radiation dose at 25 kGy.","[{""name"": ""H.

In this study a validation methodology and a metric are defined for the standardization of the calibration process for multiple propeller hybrid actuators. A statistical validation between the numerical simulations and experimental results is applied and Power Spectral Density is used to calculate the validation metrics. In this paper, the proposed validation method is applied to a novel design for an actuator, which consists of a custom designed frame with six aerial drone propellers. The actuator is named Multi-Propeller Device (MPD). As a test case for the proposed validation method, the MPD is used in this study to emulate the aerodynamic loads of the NREL 5 MW reference turbine at 1:37 scale. The numerical input is generated with the aero-hydro-elastic solver FAST. The aerodynamic loads and effects investigated are rotor thrust and torque, and gyroscopic moment. The recommended validation metric is the Fraction of Measurements within a user defined Tolerance (FMT), which is 1 for a flawlessly operating device. The MPD performs well at emulating rotor thrust and torque loads, with FMT = 0.97 and 0.98 respectively. However, the MPD underperforms at emulating more complex wind loads, such as gyroscopic moment with FMT = 0.27. The poor results for gyroscopic moment are attributed to the generation of significant amounts of high-frequency vibration when propeller pairs of the MPD are operating intermittently at high rotational speeds.","[{""name"": ""A Otter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Murphy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C J Desmond"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2017.10.052"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.400"", ""10.1007/s40722-017-0089-3"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2018.12.021"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.106605"", ""10.3390/en12030435""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"
10.2298/NTRP2201018O,NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY & RADIATION PROTECTION,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,EFFECT OF PbO INCORPORATION WITH DIFFERENT PARTICLE SIZE ON X-RAY ATTENUATION OF POLYSTYRENE,"Lead oxide (PbO) bulk and nanoparticles of two different sizes (A = 78 nm and B = 54 nm) are incorporated separately into the polystyrene matrix at various concentrations (0, 10, 15, 25, and 35 %) using roll mill mixing and compressing molding techniques. The X-ray narrow-spectrum series (N-series / ISO 4037-1) is then used to investigate the radiation attenuation capability of the novel polymer composite PS/PbO, as well as the effect of varying PbO particle sizes on shielding performance. The filler dispersion and chemical elemental analysis of the synthesized composite are investigated using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. To determine the mass attenuation coefficients ?m, samples with various thicknesses of the synthesized composite are examined using a range of X-ray energies, and the experimental data are compared to theoretical values from NIST databases (XCOM and FFAST). The results indicate that either increasing the filler weight percentage or, decreasing the filler particle size, enhanced the attenuation parameters throughout all energies. The composite containing the smallest nanosize of PbO exhibited the maximum radiation shielding efficacy among all combinations and therefore, might be used to develop low-cost and lightweight X-ray shields.","[{""name"": ""Ahmad Osman"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon + Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission, National Council for Scientific Research, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Balaa El"", ""affiliation"": [""Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission, National Council for Scientific Research, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Samad El"", ""affiliation"": [""Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission, National Council for Scientific Research, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Zainab Alsayed"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Ramadan Awad"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon""]}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Badawi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon + Physics Department, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt""]}]","[""10.1177/0892705719872524"", ""10.1118/1.4811156"", ""10.1109/42.993128"", ""10.5516/NET.04.2013.077"", ""10.1109/MECBME.2016.7745425"", ""10.2298/NTRP1504249B"", ""10.1016/j.synthmet.2014.07.015"", ""10.2298/NTRP210110001A"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-819611-3.00017-0"", ""10.2298/NTRP2001042A"", ""10.1016/B978-008043417-9/50004-0"", ""10.1007/s10311-021-01189-9"", ""10.1088/1402-4896/ab9a6e"", ""10.2298/NTRP190718033A"", ""10.3390/polym13193246"", ""10.1088/2053-1591/abecea"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2017.10.017"", ""10.1038/s41598-021-87256-1"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncw093"", ""10.1049/joe.2018.9126"", ""10.1007/s00339-012-7464-7"", ""10.1002/mame.201100050"", ""10.1021/acsomega.0c05050"", ""10.1007/s10853-014-8685-2"", ""10.4314/jasem.v19i3.9"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2020.108918"", ""10.1016/j.nimb.2015.07.126"", ""10.21203/rs.3.rs-264843/v1"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2011.12.040"", ""10.3390/app11094010"", ""10.2298/NTRP1801075S"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2010.11.002"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-52220-7"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2018.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.108536"", ""10.1002/app.44657"", ""10.2298/NTRP2104315O""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"
10.3233/JNR-200159,JOURNAL OF NEUTRON RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,Development of high intensity neutron source at the European Spallation Source,"The European Spallation Source being constructed in Lund, Sweden will provide the user community with a neutron source of unprecedented brightness. By 2025, a suite of 15 instruments will be served by a high-brightness moderator system placed above the spallation target. The ESS infrastructure, consisting of the proton linac, the target station, and the instrument halls, allows for implementation of a second source below the spallation target. We propose to develop a second neutron source with a high-intensity moderator able to (1) deliver a larger total cold neutron flux, (2) provide high intensities at longer wavelengths in the spectral regions of Cold (4–10 Å), Very Cold (10–40 Å), and Ultra Cold (several 100 Å) neutrons, as opposed to Thermal and Cold neutrons delivered by the top moderator. Offering both unprecedented brilliance, flux, and spectral range in a single facility, this upgrade will make ESS the most versatile neutron source in the world and will further strengthen the leadership of Europe in neutron science. The new source will boost several areas of condensed matter research such as imaging and spin-echo, and will provide outstanding opportunities in fundamental physics investigations of the laws of nature at a precision unattainable anywhere else. At the heart of the proposed system is a volumetric liquid deuterium moderator. Based on proven technology, its performance will be optimized in a detailed engineering study. This moderator will be complemented by secondary sources to provide intense beams of Very- and Ultra-Cold Neutrons.","[{""name"": ""V.

The proposed method is compared to different traditional boosting e.g., Extreme Gradient Boosting (EGB) and simple regression methods e.g., support vector regressors with linear kernel and radial kernel in terms of accurate predictions. R language has been used for the statistical analysis of radon time series (RTS) data. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology predicts SRGC more accurately when compared to different traditional boosting and regression methods. The best correlation is found between the actual and predicted radon concentration for window size of 2 i.e., two days before and after the start of seismic activities. RTS data was collected from 05 February 2017 to 16 February 2018, including 7 seismic events recorded during the study period. Findings of study show that the proposed methodology predicts the SRGC with more precision, for all the window sizes, by overlapping predicted with the actual radon time series concentrations.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Rafique"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aleem Dad Khan Tareen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adil Aslim Mir"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Malik Sajjad Ahmed Nadeem"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Khawaja M.

10.1002/er.8044,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Comparative analysis of multicriteria decision-making approaches for evaluation hydrogen projects development from wind energy,"SummaryNowadays energy demand has increased due to industrial development and population growth. On the other hand, attention to environmental issues has made it necessary to use renewable energy. The utilization of wind energy is emphasized due to low construction costs and rapid installation. Wind energy, on the other hand, can be stored via creating hydrogen because its power fluctuates at different times and is not uniform. The production of hydrogen and energy is essential to meet the needs of industries in different countries. Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive approach is presented to locating hydrogen production from wind energy using multicriteria decision‐making (MCDM). To implement the proposed approach, a case study in Iran and Hormozgan province is used. Hormozgan province is in good condition in terms of wind potential and many industries in this province need energy and hydrogen. The most appropriate factors were judged to be average wind speed, each region's number of refineries, and each region's rate of industrial development, with weights of 0.192, 0.167, and 0.141, respectively, using the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) approach. The cities in Hormozgan province were then prioritized using the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) technique. Then, the sensitivity analysis of the ranking results was performed and The COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS), additive ratio assessment (ARAS), and weighted sum methods (WSM) methodologies were then used to validate the results. For the development of hydrogen projects, Bandar Abbas was determined as the most suitable place. A 900‐kW turbine at Bandar Abbas will generate 532 730 kWh of power and 8620 kg of hydrogen annually.","[{""name"": ""Seyyed Jalaladdin Hosseini Dehshiri"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Management, Faculty of Management and Accounting Allameh Tabataba'i University  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Seyed Mahmoud Zanjirchi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Management, Faculty of Economics, Management and Accounting Yazd University  Yazd Iran""]}]","[""10.1002/er.5751"", ""10.1016/j.esr.2020.100478"", ""10.1080/23307706.2017.1346490"", ""10.1002/er.7018"", ""10.1002/er.6994"", ""10.1002/er.6645"", ""10.1002/er.6578"", ""10.1002/er.6959"", ""10.1002/er.7688"", ""10.1002/er.7728"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125779"", ""10.1007/s10098-018-1539-x"", ""10.1002/er.7828"", ""10.1002/er.5508"", ""10.1002/er.7704"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.079"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.061"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.06.110"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.007"", ""10.1002/er.7620"", ""10.3390/su13168764"", ""10.1007/s11356-021-18311-7"", ""10.1007/s10973-021-10868-2"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2009.07.023"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.004"", ""10.1007/s10661-014-3883-6"", ""10.4236/ijg.2016.710090"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.030"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.02.072"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2019.04.008"", ""10.1007/s11708-018-0534-6"", ""10.3390/en13092284"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.135"", ""10.1177/0309524X19849831"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.07.046"", ""10.1002/er.7528"", ""10.3846/tede.2020.13534"", ""10.1016/j.esr.2021.100684"", ""10.3846/jbem.2010.12"", ""10.5755/j01.eee.122.6.1810"", ""10.3846/tede.2010.10"", ""10.1287/opre.15.3.537"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.122814""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Energy']","['Aerospace Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)]]"

The Sos Enattos site lies on a crystalline basement, made of rocks with good geomechanical properties, characterized by negligible groundwater. In addition, the site has a very low seismic background noise due to the absence of active tectonics involving Sardinia. Finally, the area has a low population density, resulting in a reduced anthropic noise even at the ground level. This location was already studied in 2012-2014 as a promising site for an underground detector. More recently, in March 2019, we deployed a new network of surface and underground seismometers at the site, that is currently monitoring the local seismic noise. Most of the energy carried by the seismic waves is due to the microseisms below 1 Hz, showing a significant correlation with the waves of the west Mediterranean sea. Above 1 Hz the seismic noise in the underground levels of the mine approaches the Peterson’s low noise model. Exploiting mine blasting works into the former mine, we were also able to perform active seismic measurements to evaluate the seismic waves propagation across the area. In conclusion we also give a first assessment about the acoustic and magnetic noise in this underground site.","[{""name"": ""L Naticchioni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""V Boschi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E Calloni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Capello"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Cardini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Carpinelli"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Cuccuru"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M D’Ambrosio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R de Rosa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Di Giovanni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D d’Urso"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""I Fiori"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Gaviano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Giunchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E Majorana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Migoni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Oggiano"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Olivieri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Paoletti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Paratore"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Perciballi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Piccinini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Punturo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Puppo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P Rapagnani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Ricci"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Saccorotti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""V Sipala"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M C Tringali"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1088/0264-9381/31/10/105016"", ""10.1111/j.1365-3121.1995.tb00681.x"", ""10.1007/s10291-015-0481-1"", ""10.1098/rsta.1950.0012"", ""10.1785/BSSA0840010142""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geophysics', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0708 地球物理学', 0.7255), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.72)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"
10.1002/er.6196,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,An experimental study on the performance evaluation of a combined sensible-latent heat thermal energy storage,"SummaryThermal energy storage (TES) is one of the significant technologies for reducing the discrepancy between ever‐increasing energy demand and utilization. Sensible and latent heat based TES concepts are the most widely implemented technologies for thermal applications. However, these two storage technologies have drawbacks of lower energy storage ability, higher thermocline degradation for sensible heat storage and lower thermal conductivity of the phase change material (PCM) causing higher charge and discharge times for latent heat storage. To counter these issues, a novel combined sensible‐latent heat storage system has been proposed. The concept of combined sensible‐latent thermal storage is to place the latent heat storage media above the sensible storage media in the storage container. In the present experimental study, an experimental investigation of the proposed storage system and conventional sensible storage system was performed during charge and discharge cycles. The proposed storage system used concrete spheres as sensible storage media and paraffin encapsulated capsules having the same diameter of 38 mm, as a latent heat storage media. A comparative assessment has been made for two different configurations based on temperature profile, storage capacity, charge and discharge times, energy transferred, and energy recovered. The experimental results reveal that the novel combined sensible‐latent heat storage has lower thermocline degradation during discharge and higher energy storage capacity relative to the sensible storage system. The discharge time and energy utilization is prolonged by adding the PCM capsules above the concrete spheres and also the temperature drop at outlet of the storage system has been reduced than the sensible storage. Based on the analysis, the novel combined sensible‐latent heat storage was found to have a better performance compared with the conventional sensible heat storage system.","[{""name"": ""Charmala Suresh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Hydro and Renewable Energy Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee  Roorkee India""]}, {""name"": ""Rajeshwer Prasad Saini"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Hydro and Renewable Energy Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee  Roorkee India""]}]","[""10.1002/er.4625"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.101118"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114472"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.101046"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2020.07.027"", ""10.1002/er.5255"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2020.01.073"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112596"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114423"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113733"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2016.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.139"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114330"", ""10.1080/08916152.2020.1817178"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.02.045"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.040"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.118651"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.11.059"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.11.024"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.05.020"", ""10.1016/j.est.2018.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2015.06.029"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.101"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.11.039"", ""10.1002/er.5143"", ""10.1108/WJE-08-2016-0048"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.07.023"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2006.04.015"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.04.030"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.04.075"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101414"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2020.05.024"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2005.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.085"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.07.044"", ""10.1016/0894-1777(88)90043""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The formulation is compatible with a wide variety of support structure configurations and no manual or time-domain preprocessing steps are required, making RAFT very practical in design and optimization workflows. The model is applied to three reference floating wind turbine designs and its predictions are compared with results from time-domain OpenFAST simulations. There is good agreement in mean offsets as well the statistics and spectra of the dynamic response, verifying RAFT’s general suitability for floating wind analysis. Follow-on work will include verification of potential-flow and turbine-control features and application to optimization problems.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Hall"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stein Housner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Zalkind"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pietro Bortolotti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Ogden"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Garrett Barter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5194/wes-3-693-2018"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.067"", ""10.1016/j.marstruc.2020.102771"", ""10.3390/jmse7030081"", ""10.1214/aoms/1177699057"", ""10.1002/we.1636"", ""10.5194/wes-7-53-2022"", ""10.2172/1155123"", ""10.2172/1660012"", ""10.2172/1603478""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

The new model, TurbOPark, is based on the Park model but features non-linear wake expansion and a Gaussian deficit profile. The modelled wake expansion depends on the intensity of the local turbulence, which is a combination of ambient atmospheric turbulence and wake-generated turbulence. Moving downstream from the rotor, the intensity of the wake-generated turbulence decreases, and the wake expansion slows down. This leads to more persistent wakes in wind farms and clusters of wind farms with large distances between turbines. In the present study, we focus on the London Array wind farm and show examples of how results from Park and TurbOPark compare to SCADA data. We look at the array efficiency of the wind farm, the production of individual turbines, and the impact of neighbouring wind farms. We find that predictions from TurbOPark generally are closer to observations than predictions from the Park model.","[{""name"": ""J G Pedersen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E Svensson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L Poulsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N G Nygaard"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1002/we.2484"", ""10.3390/en8065413"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-20389-y"", ""10.5194/wes-5-29-2020"", ""10.3390/rs12030462"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1037/7/072008"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1618/6/062072"", ""10.1007/s10546-019-00473-0"", ""10.1002/we.1863"", ""10.1007/s10546-010-9512-1"", ""10.1016/0167-6105(88)90037-2"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2014.01.002"", ""10.5194/amt-10-2881-2017"", ""10.3390/en5125340"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/75/1/012082"", ""10.1017/jfm.2020.77"", ""10.1017/jfm.2020.1037"", ""10.1002/we.2669""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

First, the binary gCN/MoS2 heterojunctions were fabricated by using an in‐situ solvothermal method and then they were doped with Ni or Co via a chemical reduction method. The photocatalytic HER experiments revealed that the prepared gCN/MoS2‐M (M: Ni, Co) photocatalysts showed enhanced HER activities and stabilities compared to pristine gCN and binary gCN/MoS2 heterojunctions. Total H2 productions of 5924 μmol gcat−1 and 5159 μmol gcat−1 in 8 hours were provided by using gCN/MoS2‐Ni and gCN/MoS2‐Co photocatalysts, respectively, under visible light illumination. The detailed structural characterization and examination of optical properties of gCN/MoS2‐M (M: Ni, Co) photocatalysts revealed that their enhanced photocatalytic activities were attributed to the formation of ‘type‐I' 2D/2D heterojunction between gCN and MoS2 semiconductors and the creation of S‐deficient MoS2 nanostructures after Ni or Co doping, which promoted the separation of the photogenerated electron‐hole pairs, the charge mobility, and the visible light absorption.","[{""name"": ""Gizem Yanalak"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biochemistry Selcuk University  Konya Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Seda Yılmaz"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences Koc University  Istanbul Turkey"", ""Koc University TÜPRAŞ Energy Center (KUTEM)  Istanbul Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Zafer Eroglu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences Koc University  Istanbul Turkey"", ""Nanoscience and Nanoengineering Division, Graduate School of Natural and Applied Sciences Atatürk University  Erzurum Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Emre Aslan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biochemistry Selcuk University  Konya Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Onder Metin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences Koc University  Istanbul Turkey"", ""Koc University TÜPRAŞ Energy Center (KUTEM)  Istanbul Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Imren Hatay Patir"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biotechnology Selcuk University  Konya Turkey""]}]","[""10.1002/adma.201604464"", ""10.1021/jacs.9b09932"", ""10.1002/adma.201301207"", ""10.1039/C5TA04326C"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2021.130140"", ""10.1016/j.catcom.2021.106325"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.049"", ""10.1002/smll.201703277"", ""10.1021/am403653a"", ""10.1007/s12598-020-01616-w"", ""10.1039/C2CC16101J"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.10.240"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b04388"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-17390-2"", ""10.1038/s41598-016-0001-8"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b02445"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.04.063"", ""10.1002/adma.200401756"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139054"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.11.056"", ""10.1016/S1872-5813(18)30036-7"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118445"", ""10.1021/jacs.7b00341"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2020.126498"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.01.067"", ""10.1002/cssc.201702220"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.042"", ""10.1021/acsaem.0c00975"", ""10.1126/science.1141483"", ""10.1038/ncomms3642"", ""10.1021/nn502776h"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2010.11.007"", ""10.1039/C8DT01142G"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2016.04.028"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.006"", ""10.1002/cctc.201901654"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.04.012"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2014.05.023"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2015.10.037"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.066"", ""10.1098/rsos.180187"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.12.236"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-58403-x"", ""10.1039/D0TA12504K"", ""10.1039/C6RA08356K"", ""10.1007/s11244-016-0654-3"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.066"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.08.031"", ""10.1002/adfm.201102111"", ""10.1021/acsenergylett.7b00865"", ""10.3390/nano9060844"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2018.05.003"", ""10.1021/acsami.5b02649"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2021.130016"", ""10.1006/jcat.1995.1335"", ""10.1038/srep17542"", ""10.1002/adma.201202920"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2004.07.016"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2016.12.018"", ""10.1016/S0257-8972(96)03186-6"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120419"", ""10.1039/C9CC01577A"", ""10.1039/c3ee41006d"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b15559"", ""10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.12.035"", ""10.1021/jacs.9b02501"", ""10.1007/s10853-019-04205-0"", ""10.1007/s10853-019-03856-3"", ""10.1002/cctc.201700640"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b18917"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.07.030"", ""10.1002/anie.201210294"", ""10.1364/OE.24.010205"", ""10.1007/s11595-019-2009-y"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.155401"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.146076"", ""10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.124668"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115350"", ""10.1038/srep43055"", ""10.1039/C5RA24676H"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.04.020"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.057"", ""10.1039/C6TA08628D"", ""10.1007/s10904-020-01626-2"", ""10.1002/cctc.201901654"", ""10.1039/C1SC00117E"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149755"", ""10.1039/D1CC03880J""]","['Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

This paper aims to summarise available information on sources of radiation exposure of the embryo/foetus primarily in medical settings. Accidental and unintended exposure is also considered. Knowledge on the effects of radiation exposure on the developing embryo/foetus remains incomplete—drawn largely from animal studies and two human cohorts but a summary is provided in relation to the key health endpoints of concern, severe foetal malformations/death, future cancer risk, and future impact on cognitive function. Both the specific education and training and also the literature regarding medical management of pregnant females is in general sparse, and consequently the justification and optimisation approaches may need to be considered on a case by case basis. In collating and reviewing this information, several suggestions for future basic science research, education and training, and radiation protection practice are identified.","[{""name"": ""Kimberly E Applegate"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Úna Findlay"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Louise Fraser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yvonne Kinsella"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Liz Ainsbury"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Bouffler"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ejmp.2017.08.010"", ""10.1200/JCO.2005.03.3126"", ""10.1016/j.acra.2005.10.007"", ""10.1016/S1072-7515(01)00818-3"", ""10.1148/91.5.1013"", ""10.1667/RR15015.1"", ""10.1007/s12094-020-02491-8"", ""10.1016/j.jvir.2014.11.026"", ""10.1097/00007632-200008150-00009"", ""10.1088/0031-9155/61/2/683"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncaa204"", ""10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00209-0"", ""10.1007/s10654-017-0299-y"", ""10.1097/MNM.0000000000000672"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2012.03.001"", ""10.1177/0146645317717209"", ""10.1155/2015/170343"", ""10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.7249"", ""10.1002/acm2.12262"", ""10.1148/radiol.2512080736"", ""10.1182/blood.V12.3.261.261"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/aafdc8"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199904)59:4<234::AID-TERA8>3.0.CO;2-B"", ""10.1259/0007-1285-57-677-409"", ""10.1080/09553009314550341"", ""10.1080/095530098141555"", ""10.1080/09553002.2019.1569778"", ""10.1016/j.envint.2020.106285"", ""10.1148/rg.343135090"", ""10.1001/jama.2016.12126"", ""10.1148/99.2.433"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199904)59:4<222::AID-TERA6>3.0.CO;2-M"", ""10.1080/09553002.2021.1872817"", ""10.1001/archinternmed.2009.427"", ""10.1007/s10654-020-00713-5"", ""10.1148/rg.321115064"", ""10.1159/000444184"", ""10.1080/0955300031000114729"", ""10.1136/ijgc-2020-001776""]",['Medicine'],"['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Oncology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7352), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7321)]]"

Using the time series extracted from large-eddy simulation (LES), we compute the mean power and the yaw-moment damage equivalent load (DEL) at every point of a finite decision space spanned by the yaw angles of the first two turbines. The mean power outputs simulated with LES are compared with those measured in the wind tunnel, and a good agreement is found between the two. The Pareto front of different yaw configurations is extracted in the objective space of AYC and the Pareto-optimal strategies are identified in the decision space. We find that most of the Pareto-optimal strategies share the characteristic of moderately decremental yaw angles. We also find that the strategies with a small yaw angle for the first wind turbine are inefficient since they incur significant increases in fatigue while only achieving marginal power gains. The results indicate that the decision space of algorithms searching for optimal AYC strategies can be significantly reduced a priori with the consideration of load mitigation in the optimization.","[{""name"": ""Mou Lin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fernando Porté-Agel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1146/annurev-fluid-010816-060206"", ""10.1016/S0167-6105(98)00194-9"", ""10.1002/we.238"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2014.06.019"", ""10.1002/we.469"", ""10.1109/TCST.2013.2257780"", ""10.3390/en10060757"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2014.02.015"", ""10.1073/pnas.1903680116"", ""10.1063/1.5077038"", ""10.1002/we.1822"", ""10.1002/we.1993"", ""10.3390/en11010177"", ""10.1002/we.1612"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2013.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.01.051"", ""10.5194/wes-3-489-2018"", ""10.1017/S0022112000008776"", ""10.1007/s10546-010-9569-x"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2011.01.011"", ""10.3390/en12234574"", ""10.3390/en10070908"", ""10.5194/wes-3-243-2018"", ""10.5194/wes-4-127-2019""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"
10.1007/s10894-023-00349-9,JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,HB11-Understanding Hydrogen-Boron Fusion as a New Clean Energy Source,"AbstractHB11 Energy’s mission is to realize large-scale electricity generation from the fusion of hydrogen with boron-11 (the HB11, or “proton-boron”, reaction) without the environmental problems normally associated with nuclear energy. A non-thermal approach is taken in the initiation of the reaction using high-peak-power lasers, which was the pursuit of HB11 Energy founder Prof. Heinrich Hora’s career as a theoretical physicist. In the 1980s, the invention of Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA) of laser pulses by Donna Strickland and Gerard Mourou (Nobel Prize 2018) enabled the possibility of experimentally validating the earlier theoretical predictions. Several experimental demonstrations of the HB11 reaction using CPA lasers inspired the establishment of HB11 Energy and with it, the possibility of realizing an aneutronic nuclear energy source with easily accessible and safe fuel resources that could last thousands of years. Like all quests for fusion energy, there are significant scientific challenges remaining. HB11 Energy Holdings Pty Ltd, an Australian company, was established as the best vehicle to co-ordinate a global collaborative research effort to address these challenges and build capacity to host large-scale public private partnerships, such as those now recommended by the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) (US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in Bringing Fusion to the U.S. Grid,: National Academies Press, Washington, D.C, 2021). If net-energy-gain can be achieved through HB11 Energy’s concepts, there are many engineering benefits over traditional DT fusion that will see a dramatically simpler and safer reactor being produced. A technoeconomic assessment of such a reactor is also discussed which presents many engineering challenges that will need to be met before commercial HB11 fusion can be deployed on a large-scale.","[{""name"": ""Warren McKenzie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dimitri Batani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas A.

The nearly spherical Hs-AgNPs were polydispersed and sized 29.19-52.27 nm with yield of 85.8 %. Hs-AgNPs showed potent inhibition of 75.22-100 % against multidrug resistant bacteria, and fungal growth inhibition of 73.33-100 %. Hs-AgNPs scavenged DPPH and H2O2 by 77.75-83.19, and 54.21-70.11 % respectively. It also effectively inhibited coagulation of blood. The study established the nanobiotechnological importance of H. suaveolens, with bioformation of AgNPs that have potent activities for environmental and biomedical applications.","[{""name"": ""A Lateef"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S M Oladejo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P O Akinola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D A Aina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L S Beukes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""B I Folarin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E B Gueguim-Kana"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.micron.2013.09.003"", ""10.1007/s40097-014-0139-5"", ""10.1007/s13201-018-0676-z"", ""10.1007/s12668-015-0181-x"", ""10.1016/j.jtusci.2015.10.010"", ""10.1007/s40097-016-0191-4"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1019-6"", ""10.1515/ntrev-2016-0039"", ""10.1515/ntrev-2016-0024"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1055-2"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1087-7"", ""10.1080/10826068.2018.1479864"", ""10.15835/nsb749643"", ""10.1007/s40089-014-0133-4"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0492-9"", ""10.1515/ntrev-2016-0049"", ""10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.027"", ""10.1109/TNB.2016.2559161"", ""10.15835/nsb929938"", ""10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.06.003"", ""10.1049/iet-nbt.2017.0299"", ""10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.08.030"", ""10.1016/j.jare.2015.02.007"", ""10.1515/gps-2017-0039"", ""10.1515/gps-2017-0062"", ""10.1515/biolog-2015-0164"", ""10.1007/s13204-013-0260-7"", ""10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.021"", ""10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.05.040"", ""10.1080/00032719.2018.1454936"", ""10.1080/02726351.2018.1450312"", ""10.3923/ijp.2008.227.229"", ""10.1016/S1995-7645(12)60162-X"", ""10.3390/molecules17088917"", ""10.4103/0250-474X.36946"", ""10.1007/s10571-013-0016-7"", ""10.1016/j.parepi.2017.09.001"", ""10.1007/s10876-017-1160-x"", ""10.1002/btpr.2829"", ""10.1016/S0023-6438(95)80008-5"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0473-z"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1146-0"", ""10.33640/2405-609X.1018"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0449-z"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2014.08.122"", ""10.1177/1082013210366894"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2011.06.025"", ""10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.03.030"", ""10.1007/s13204-017-0546-2"", ""10.1016/j.msec.2015.02.053"", ""10.1002/ptr.2069"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.10.026"", ""10.1007/s11051-015-2976-7"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2015.01.021"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.06.069"", ""10.1186/1556-276X-8-542"", ""10.2478/ast-2019-0008""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

10.1002/er.5645,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Enhanced biohydrogen production from sugar industry effluent using nickel oxide and cobalt oxide as cathode nanocatalysts in microbial electrolysis cell,"SummaryDevelopment of economically viable cathode catalysts with practicability in the treatment of real effluents is one of the strenuous efforts among the multidisciplinary approaches in microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). Treatment of industrial effluents using this technology had resulted in simultaneous energy production in the form of hydrogen along with wastewater treatment, promoting both energy and environmental benefits. In this study, two metal oxides such as, Nickel Oxide (NiO) and Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) were employed as the cathode catalyst using sugar industry effluent as the substrate for biohydrogen production in the MEC. The addition of NiO and Co3O4 on nickel foam (NF) has demonstrated better hydrogen evolution performance than the control (uncoated) cathode. Electrochemical characterization of the modified cathodes revealed the improved capability analogous to the current density and hydrogen production rate (HPR) obtained in the experimentation. The best performance was achieved by NiO/NF with the maximum HPR of 3.39 ± 0.03 mmol/L/D, coloumbic efficiency of 58 ± 1.4%, hydrogen recovery of 27 ± 1.8% and COD removal efficiency of 52 ± 1.6% when operated with the applied voltage of 1.0 V. Hence, the potential of metal oxides was demonstrated for the candidature of efficient and economical cathode materials in MECs.","[{""name"": ""Tamilmani Jayabalan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering National Institute of Technology  Tiruchirappalli India""]}, {""name"": ""Samsudeen Naina Mohamed"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering National Institute of Technology  Tiruchirappalli India""]}, {""name"": ""Manickam Matheswaran"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering National Institute of Technology  Tiruchirappalli India""]}, {""name"": ""T.K.

Mouse models have advantages over larger species due to economics, ease of conducting aging studies, existence of historical databases, and research tools allowing for sophisticated mechanistic studies. However, the radiation dose-response relationship of inbred strains is inherently steep and sensitive to experimental variables, and inbred models have been criticized for lacking genetic diversity. Jackson Diversity Outbred (JDO) mice are the most genetically diverse strain available, developed by the Collaborative Cross Consortium using eight founder strains, and may represent a more accurate model of humans than inbred strains. Herein, models of the Hematopoietic-Acute Radiation Syndrome and the Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure were developed in JDO mice and compared to inbred C57BL/6. The dose response relationship curve in JDO mice mirrored the more shallow curves of primates and humans, characteristic of genetic diversity. JDO mice were more radioresistant than C57BL/6 and differed in sensitivity to antibiotic countermeasures. The model was validated with pegylated-G-CSF, which provided significantly enhanced 30-d survival and accelerated blood recovery. Long-term JDO survivors exhibited increased recovery of blood cells and functional bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors compared to C57BL/6. While JDO hematopoietic stem cells declined more in number, they maintained a greater degree of quiescence compared to C57BL/6, which is essential for maintaining function. These JDO radiation models offer many of the advantages of small animals with the genetic diversity of large animals, providing an attractive alternative to currently available radiation animal models.","[{""name"": ""Andrea M.

Contourites include depositional features (separated, sheeted, plastered and confined drifts), erosional features (abraded surfaces, channels, furrows and moats) and mixed features (contourite terraces). Drifts generally show high- to moderate-amplitude reflectors, which are cyclically intercalated with transparent layers. Transparent layers may represent finer-grained deposits, which can serve as seal rocks. High-amplitude reflectors (HARs) are likely to represent sandier layers, which could form hydrocarbon reservoirs. HARs occur on erosive features (moats and channels), and are clearly developed on contourite terraces and overflow features. Most of the contourite features described here are influenced by Mediterranean water masses throughout their Pliocene and Quaternary history. They specifically record Mediterranean Outflow Water, following its exit through the Gibraltar Strait. This work gives a detailed report on the variation of modern contourite deposits, which can help inform ancient contourite reservoir interpretation. Further research correlating 2D and 3D seismic anomalies with core and well-logging data is needed to develop better diagnostic criteria for contourites. This can help to clarify the role of contourites in petroleum systems.","[{""name"": ""Estefanía Llave"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto Geológico y Minero de España (IGME), Rios Rosas 23, 28003 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""F.

However, Marangoni flow in melt pools is rarely quantified due to the opacity of liquid metals and the necessity for in situ evaluation. Here we report the findings of high-temporal-resolution synchrotron x-ray radiography experiments tracking the flow in the melt-pool. Dense, highly attenuating tungsten carbide particles are seeded within an elemental powder blend of aluminium and copper of varying composition. Due to the extremely high temporal resolution of greater than 50 kfps at the 31-ID-B beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, USA, we can track the position of tracer particles from frame to frame. This data provides valuable process guidance for optimising mixing and informs the development and validation of multiphysics models.","[{""name"": ""S J Clark"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C L A Leung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Y Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L Sinclair"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Marussi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P D Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.actamat.2015.06.004"", ""10.1007/BF02816047"", ""10.1098/rsta.1998.0207"", ""10.1098/rsta.1998.0196"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-07900-9"", ""10.2351/1.4922383"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-03734-7"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.08.249"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.04.260"", ""10.1016/j.actamat.2018.12.027"", ""10.1038/s41598-016-0028-x"", ""10.1016/j.actamat.2018.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.actamat.2016.05.017"", ""10.1016/j.actamat.2017.09.051""]",['Engineering'],"['Biomedical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1002/er.6163,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Bioremediation analysis of sediment-microbial fuel cells for energy recovery from microbial activity in soil,"SummaryIn natural environments, voltage gradients can be created in soil or sediments from inherent microbial activity. Present work has utilized sediment microbial fuel cell or s‐MFC for dark flocculent surface sediments to see bioelectricity generation potential at Jaipur, Rajasthan in India. Using a glucose rich substrate media and low external resistance, system generated external voltage of around 500 ± 10 mV, with power density peaking after a week of operation with 2122 ± 80 mW/m2 and current density of 4.31 mA/m2; s‐MFC reactor components included six graphite based anodes, placed strategically in the sediments, connected in series to a cathode for enhanced system performance. FTIR analysis of the surface sediment showed the presence of complex organic and inorganic compounds that allow stable biofilm formation, which influences power density directly. Such systems provide a novel route to bioremediation using microbial metabolism and can provide remote power generation for oceanographic instruments, biosensors and similar low power devices.","[{""name"": ""Debajyoti Bose"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Applied Sciences &amp; Biotechnology, School of Biotechnology Shoolini University of Biotechnology &amp; Management Sciences  Solan India""]}, {""name"": ""Mahula Santra"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science Ahmedabad University  Ahmedabad India""]}, {""name"": ""Rama Venkata Siva Prasanna Sanka"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Chandigarh University  Chandigarh India""]}, {""name"": ""Balaji Krishnakumar"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering University of Petroleum &amp; Energy Studies  Dehradun India""]}]","[""10.1111/gcbb.12578"", ""10.1002/ep.13267"", ""10.1002/ieam.4299"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.09.044"", ""10.1002/ieam.4206"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.001"", ""10.1002/bbb.1892"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2015.06.002"", ""10.1080/14484846.2020.1747152"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2016.09.005"", ""10.5897/AJMR2012.2413"", ""10.1089/sus.2019.0048"", ""10.1016/j.bios.2007.01.010"", ""10.1002/er.4172"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.172"", ""10.1016/j.biotechadv.2018.04.010"", ""10.1016/j.enzmictec.2018.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2018.09.002"", ""10.1002/er.3804"", ""10.5012/bkcs.2008.29.11.2189"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2007.06.069"", ""10.3390/en11010124"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.099"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2009.12.124"", ""10.1109/ICOMICON.2017.8279078"", ""10.1016/j.bios.2009.05.004"", ""10.1021/es800312v""]","['Environmental Science', 'Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)]]"

This work presents a technique that uses readily available measurements to estimate signals that would otherwise require additional instrumentation. This study presents a digital twin concept with a focus on estimating wind speed, thrust, torque, tower-top position, and loads in the tower using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements. The model combines a linear state-space model obtained using OpenFAST linearizations, a wind speed estimator, and a Kalman filter algorithm that integrates measurements with the state model to perform state estimations. The measurements are: top acceleration, generator torque, pitch, and rotational speed. The article extends previous work that derived the linear state-space model using a different method. The new implementation, based on OpenFAST linearization capability, allows for a systematic extension of the method to more states, inputs, outputs, and to the offshore environment. Results from the two methods are compared, and the validation is made with additional measurements using the GE 1.5-MW turbine located at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory test site. Real-time damage equivalent loads of the tower bottom moment are estimated with an average accuracy of approximately 10%. Overall, the results from this proof of concept are encouraging, and further application of the model will be considered.","[{""name"": ""Emmanuel Branlard"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jason Jonkman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Scott Dana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paula Doubrawa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/TCST.2013.2260751"", ""10.1002/we.1817"", ""10.1002/we.523"", ""10.1109/TEC.2010.2090155"", ""10.1002/we.2327"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.09.025""]",['Engineering'],"['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1038/s41598-020-57852-8,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,Thermal damage of tungsten-armored plasma-facing components under high heat flux loads,"AbstractFusion energy is expected as a promising candidate for alternative next generation energy. For fusion reactor, the plasma facing components (PFCs) are the most critical components to achieve this goal. PFCs will suffer severe thermal shock due to repective cyclic high heat flux (HHF) loads. This paper investigates the effects of thermal shock and damage behavior of tungsten armored PFCs under steady, transient and combined thermal loads. The distribution of stress field is analyzed, and crack initiation is predicted using the extended finite element method (XFEM). The unique features of thermal-mechanical behavior of tungsten armored PFCs under simulated service condition are discussed. The dominant factor of the cracking of the tungsten armor is the brittleness of tungsten below ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT). Under the steady loads, the cracking position is apt to near the interface of tungsten armor and the interlayer, and the threshold of cracking is between 14 MW/m2 and 16 MW/m2. With 6 MW/m2 steady loads, applying 1 ms duration of transient load, the cracking threshold is between 0.2 GW/m2 to 0.4 GW/m2. The depth of cracking increases from 100 um to 500 um with the transient load increasing from 0.4 GW/m2 to 1.0 GW/m2. Researches are useful for the design and structural optimization of tungsten-armored PFCs, and the long-term stable operation of further reactor.","[{""name"": ""Shuming Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jiangshan Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ye Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaofang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ruiping Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yanru Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jian Cao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0022-3115(02)01175-3"", ""10.1016/j.jmst.2014.11.014"", ""10.1002/er.3961"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.059"", ""10.1016/j.nme.2014.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2008.07.033"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2011.01.110"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2014.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.nme.2016.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.fusengdes.2017.08.009"", ""10.1007/s40195-018-0721-9"", ""10.1002/er.3782"", ""10.1016/S0920-3796(02)00297-1"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2007.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.fusengdes.2015.09.008"", ""10.1007/s10894-015-9942-3"", ""10.1016/j.fusengdes.2007.03.032"", ""10.1115/1.3422732"", ""10.1002/nme.849"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2009.01.313"", ""10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2010.04.007"", ""10.1002/er.3799"", ""10.1016/j.fusengdes.2018.05.054"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2014.07.021""]",['Materials Science'],['Materials Chemistry'],"[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, also known as the Jenkyns Event, was a hyperthermal episode that occurred during the early Toarcian ( c. 183 Ma; Early Jurassic) and resulted in numerous collateral effects including global warming, enhanced weathering, sea-level change, carbonate crisis, marine anoxia–dysoxia and biotic crisis. The IGCP-655 project of the IUGS–UNESCO has constituted an international network of researchers with different disciplinary skills who have collaborated and shared conceptual advances on uncovering drivers of the environmental changes and ecosystem responses. This volume, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Response to the Jenkyns Event in the Early Toarcian (Jurassic) , presents 16 works that investigate the early Toarcian environmental changes related to the global warming, sea-level rise, carbon cycle perturbation and second-order mass extinction through biostratigraphy, micropalaeontology, palaeontology, ichnology, palaeoecology, sedimentology, integrated stratigraphy, inorganic, organic and isotopic geochemistry, and cyclostratigraphy.","[{""name"": ""Matías Reolid"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Geología, Universidad Jaén, Campus Las Lagunillas sn, 23071 Jaén, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Emanuela Mattioli"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Lyon, UCBL, ENSL, UJM, CNRS, LGL-TPE, F-69622, Villeurbanne, France"", ""Institut Universitaire de France, Paris, France""]}, {""name"": ""Luís V.

10.1002/er.6143,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Shape stabilization of phase change material by polymerized high internal phase emulsion for thermal energy storage,"SummaryTo prepare shape‐stabilized phase change material (SS‐PCM), polymerized high internal phase emulsion (PolyHIPE) was used as the support material, and the hexadecanol was immersed through the vacuum impregnation method. Structure and thermal properties of prepared SS‐PCM were characterized by mercury injection test, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and thermal cycling test. The pore properties of PolyHIPE can be adjusted by internal phase ratio, surfactant content and crosslinking agent content of HIPEs. Experimental parameters for PolyHIPE preparation were optimized in term of phase change enthalpy and shape stability of resultant SS‐PCM. Under optimal condition, the obtained SS‐PCM possess high impregnation ratio (92.6%), high phase change enthalpy (210.4 J·g−1) and excellent long‐term shape stability (2.53% leakage after 1000 thermal cycles). It is highly feasible to use polyHIPE as a support material to prepare SS‐PCMs, and the SS‐PCMs have good energy storage capability, showing brilliant prospects in the field of thermal storage and temperature regulation.","[{""name"": ""Jiaojiao Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Wei Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Chengqian Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Dezhong Yin"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University  Xi'an China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.12.046"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2016.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.12.040"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.097"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2013.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2010.09.033"", ""10.1002/app.47874"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.11.055"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.02.015"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.09.007"", ""10.1115/1.4043126"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2007.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2010.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2018.11.022"", ""10.1016/j.jmst.2018.11.001"", ""10.1023/A:1027484117065"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b10467"", ""10.1002/app.41229"", ""10.1089/ten.tea.2013.0319"", ""10.1039/C6RA19013H"", ""10.1039/b003596n"", ""10.1007/s10965-014-0524-2"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.10.029"", ""10.1007/s10973-012-2408-1"", ""10.1016/0022-0248(75)90010-X"", ""10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.06.060""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Polymers and Plastics', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

High labeling yield and radiochemical purity were achieved for the formation of a [125I]esomeprazole radiotracer at optimum conditions of oxidizing agent content (chloramines-T (Ch-T), 100 μg), substrate amount (Esom, 100 μg), pH of reaction mixture (6), reaction time (30 min) and temperature (37 °C), using radioactive iodine-125 (200–450 MBq). The radiolabeled compound, [125I]esom, was stable in serum and saline solution during 24 h. Esom is acting as a histamine-2-receptor antagonist (H2RA). Biodistribution studies were carried in normal and ulcerated mice. High uptake of 78.12 ± 0.80% injected dose/g organ (ID/g) observed in ulcerated mice confirmed the suitability of [125I]esomeprazole as a novel radiotracer for stomach imaging.","[{""name"": ""M. H.

10.1002/er.8398,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Progress of g-C3N4 and carbon-based material composite in fuel cell application,"SummaryFuel cells are the most promising alternative green and clean energy source in the future because of their low carbon emissions. Fuel cells have been employed in various applications, including large‐scale stationary power generation, distributed combination heat and power, transport, and mobile and stationary applications. Generally, a fuel cell system consists of a proton exchange membrane or polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), a catalyst layer, a microporous layer, a gas diffusion layer, and a bipolar plate at the anode and cathode. PEMs are an important component in fuel cell applications that act as proton carriers and separators for the anode and cathode, while catalyst support materials are a major component of proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The membrane and catalyst affect the cost, durability, and electrochemical activity of fuel cells. Researchers have made serious attempts to develop materials that can reduce the cost of membrane and catalyst manufacturing, lowering the overall cost of fuel cells. Because of its unique features like 2D structure, ease of fabrication, and low production cost, graphitic carbon nitride (g‐CN or g‐C3N4) is now frequently mentioned. Due to their exceptional qualities, carbon‐based materials are also commonly used in a variety of applications, including fuel cells. The effectiveness of experiments using g‐C3N4, carbon nanotube (CNT), and graphene as essential materials in enhancing fuel cell performance is discussed in this study. This review, primarily for fuel cell applications, discusses ways of adjusting the structure in terms of porosity, dimension tailoring, and atomic and edge functionalization. The study also involved the properties of composite materials as well as their respective applications on membranes as well as fuel cell catalysts. This review is useful for investigations into g‐C3N4, CNT, and graphene because it offers ideas and direction for improving the potential of associated systems, including fuel cells, hydrogen production, solar cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.Highlights The materials that can reduce the cost of membrane and catalysts manufacture, lowering the overall cost of fuel cells are discussed. The effectiveness of using g‐C3N4, carbon nanotube, and graphene as essential materials in enhancing fuel cell performance is presented. The properties of composite materials and their functioning in membranes and catalysts application are described thoroughly.","[{""name"": ""Nur Ain Masleeza Harun"", ""affiliation"": [""Fuel Cell

In FDM, the Z-height of the object is achieved by depositing extruded polymer layer upon layer. To reduce the time and cost of printed parts requiring specific properties, many processing parameters can be adjusted to optimize the FDM process. Among those is the nozzle temperature. In this study, Poly-(phenylene sulfide) (PPS) was chosen because of its mechanical performance, making it attractive for high-performance applications. In this work, the impact of printing temperature on the mechanical and structural properties of printed parts was carefully tested. Results show that a 340°C printing temperature yield the parts with the highest tensile properties, with a degree of crystallinity superior to as-received PPS.","[{""name"": ""A El Magri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Vaudreuil"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K El Mabrouk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Ebn Touhami"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.proeng.2013.08.230"", ""10.3390/ma8095271"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.08.088"", ""10.1016/j.scriptamat.2012.04.036"", ""10.5772/34233"", ""10.1108/RPJ-10-2012-0091"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2009.06.016"", ""10.1016/j.jare.2011.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2005.02.259"", ""10.1016/j.msea.2009.03.038"", ""10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.11.036"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2015.06.013""]",['Engineering'],"['Biomedical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The resulting radiation effects are rarely studied and should be more fully evaluated to guide patient care and meet regulatory obligations. The purpose of this work was to show that a dedicated radiopharmaceutical injection monitoring system can help clinicians characterize extravasations for calculating tissue and skin doses. We employed a commercially available radiopharmaceutical injection monitoring system to identify suspected extravasation of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate in 26 patients and to characterize their rates of biological clearance. We calculated the self-dose to infiltrated tissue using Monte Carlo simulation and standard MIRD dosimetry methods, and we used VARSKIN software to calculate the shallow dose equivalent to the epithelial basal-cell layer of overlying skin. For 26 patients, injection-site count rate data were used to characterize extravasation clearance. For each, the absorbed dose was calculated using representative tissue geometries. Resulting tissue-absorbed doses ranged from 0.6 to 11.2 Gy, and the shallow dose equivalent to a 10 cm2 area of adjacent skin in these patients ranged from about 0.1 to 5.4 Sv. Extravasated injections of radiopharmaceuticals can result in unintentional doses that exceed well-established radiation protection and regulatory limits; they should be identified and characterized. An external injection monitoring system may help to promptly identify and characterize extravasations and improve dosimetry calculations. Patient-specific characterization can help clinicians determine extravasation severity and whether the patient should be followed for adverse tissue reactions that may present later in time.","[{""name"": ""Dustin Osborne"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville TN""]}, {""name"": ""Jackson W.

Using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software, relative risks (RRs) and excess RRs per unit absorbed dose (ERR/Gy) for the entire Mayak cohort, the subcohort of workers who were residents of the dormitory town of Ozyorsk and the subcohort of migrants from Ozyorsk were calculated based on maximum likelihood. The mean cumulative liver absorbed gamma-ray dose from external exposure was 0.45 (0.65) Gy (mean (standard deviation)) for men and 0.37 (0.56) Gy for women. The mean cumulative liver absorbed alpha dose from internal exposure to incorporated plutonium was 0.18 (0.65) Gy for men and 0.40 (1.92) Gy for women. By the end of the follow-up, 6019 deaths with DCS as the main cause of death were registered among Mayak Production Association workers (including 3828 deaths in the subcohort of residents and 2191 deaths in the subcohort of migrants) over 890 132 (622 199/267 933) person-years of follow-up. The linear model that took into account non-radiation factors (sex, attained age, calendar period, smoking status and alcohol drinking status) and alpha radiation dose (via adjusting) did not demonstrate significant associations of mortality from DCS, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and cerebrovascular disease with gamma-ray exposure dose in the entire cohort, the resident subcohort or the migrant subcohort (either in men or women). For the subcohort of residents, a significant association with gamma dose was observed for mortality from ischaemic stroke in men with ERR/Gy = 0.43 (95% CI 0.08; 0.99); there were no significant associations with liver absorbed gamma dose for any other considered outcomes. As for internal exposure, for men no significant associations of mortality from any DCS with liver absorbed alpha dose were observed, but for women positive associations were found for mortality from DCS (the entire cohort and the resident subcohort) and IHD (the entire cohort). No significant associations of mortality from various types of DCS with neutron dose were observed either in men or women, although neutron absorbed doses were recorded in only 18% of the workers.","[{""name"": ""Tamara V Azizova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria V Bannikova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Evgeniya S Grigoryeva"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ksenia V Briks"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nobuyuki Hamada"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1136/oemed-2020-106423"", ""10.1097/01.HP.0000300757.00912.a2"", ""10.1667/RR14468.1"", ""10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11719"", ""10.1088/0952-4746/35/3/517"", ""10.1259/bjr.20150169"", ""10.1667/RR13680.1"", ""10.1097/HP.0000000000001131"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncx014"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncw267"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncx195"", ""10.1667/RADE-19-00007.1"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncw110"", ""10.1667/RR14608.1"", ""10.1097/00004032-200111000-00005"", ""10.1097/01.HP.0000175835.31663.ea"", ""10.1289/ehp.1204982"", ""10.1016/j.mrrev.2016.07.008"", ""10.1080/09553002.2021.1876955"", ""10.1186/s40959-015-0007-6"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncx020"", ""10.1136/bmj.b5349"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2012.02.001"", ""10.1667/RADE-20-00094.1"", ""10.1667/RR14347.1"", ""10.1016/j.envint.2020.106235"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncw268"", ""10.1093/ije/dym138"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/ab02b2"", ""10.1088/1361-6498/ab4010""]","['Medicine', 'Health Professions']","['Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1009 特种医学', 0.7528), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7425)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"

Despite advances in technology, their powerful nature often damages expensive instruments placed in their path. These challenges mean that turbidity currents have only been measured in a few locations worldwide, in relatively shallow water depths (&lt;&lt;2 km). Here, we share lessons from recent field deployments about how to design the platforms on which instruments are deployed. First, we show how monitoring platforms have been affected by turbidity currents including instability, displacement, tumbling and damage. Second, we relate these issues to specifics of the platform design, such as exposure of large surface area instruments within a flow and inadequate anchoring or seafloor support. Third, we provide recommended modifications to improve design by simplifying mooring configurations, minimizing surface area and enhancing seafloor stability. Finally, we highlight novel multi-point moorings that avoid interaction between the instruments and the flow, and flow-resilient seafloor platforms with innovative engineering design features, such as feet and ballast that can be ejected. Our experience will provide guidance for future deployments, so that more detailed insights can be provided into turbidity current behaviour, in a wider range of settings.","[{""name"": ""Michael Clare"", ""affiliation"": [""National Oceanography Centre, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, UK""]}, {""name"": ""D.

In this work, large eddy simulations with an actuator line model are used to study the wake of the NREL 5 MW reference turbine mounted on the OC3-UMaine spar and OC4-DeepCwind semi-submersible platforms. The simulations are carried out in the Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) coupled with OpenFAST for the platform and turbine motion. The wake location, deficit, and turbulence levels are compared for the two floating platforms and equivalent fixed-turbine cases. The effects of neutral versus stable atmospheric conditions are also compared. Most notably, floating-turbine wakes are deflected upwards compared to fixed-turbine wakes, because of mean platform pitch. The spar wake deflects upwards more than the semi-submersible, while the stable atmosphere increases this vertical deflection compared to the neutral. The time-varying rotor motions do not significantly affect the mid-to-far wake, though the stable atmosphere shows larger fixed-floating differences in horizontal wake fluctuations.","[{""name"": ""H M Johlas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L A Martínez-Tossas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M A Lackner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D P Schmidt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M J Churchfield"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3390/en11071895"", ""10.1002/we.2265"", ""10.1002/we.545"", ""10.1115/1.4028028"", ""10.3390/en5040968"", ""10.1007/s10546-017-0259-9"", ""10.1063/1.4913695"", ""10.3390/en5125340"", ""10.1080/14685248.2012.668191"", ""10.1002/we.1747"", ""10.1002/we.1810"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2014.02.015"", ""10.1007/s10546-004-2820-6"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.016"", ""10.1115/1.4033110""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"
10.1515/ract-2021-1063,RADIOCHIMICA ACTA,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0703 Chemistry,Highly efficient adsorption of uranyl ions using hydroxamic acid-functionalized graphene oxide,"Abstract A chelating matrix prepared by immobilizing N-hydroxyl amine onto graphene oxide functionalized with aspartic acid (GO-HDX) was applied to recover UO2 2+ from their SO4 2− leach liquor. SEM-EDAX, FT-IR, TGA, and XRD instruments, in addition, Raman spectroscopy (IR-Raman), were used to analyze the synthesized GO-HDX. The static extraction technique optimized various physicochemical parameters that impacted the UO2 2+ extraction. The optimal pH, time of contact, initial concentration, GO-HDX dose, temp., foreign ions, and eluting agents were gained. The experimental equilibrium documents were assessed using Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The Langmuir equation model quite fits the investigational adsorption data with a maximum uptake of 277.78 mg/g, and it implied the attending of monolayer coverage of adsorbed molecules. Pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order analyses were done to inspect the kinetic results. The data indicated that pseudo-second-order kinetics fit all concentrations. The intended thermodynamic factors were ∆G° negative values and ∆H° positive value. The data signified that the UO2 2+ extraction onto GO-HDX was spontaneous adsorption and endothermic at higher temperatures. The regeneration efficiency of GO-HDX was 98% using 1 M HCl.","[{""name"": ""Mohamed A. Gado"", ""affiliation"": [""Nuclear Materials Authority , El Maadi , Cairo , Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Bahig M.

Originally, it was developed in the context of geosciences to increase the awareness of geoscientists to their cultural and social role, but over time expanded to define a way in which humans can rethink their relationship with the Earth system in the light of principles and values that can provide a healthy and safe life in respect for geo-ecosystems. The theoretical framework of geoethics has now consolidated, and it has become the proposal on which to base a global ethics for the new millennium. This chapter outlines the scientific and cultural reference framework in which geoethics developed; the theoretical foundations of geoethics and its main characteristics; global anthropogenic issues under a geoethical perspective; ethical and social aspects related to two potential human activities respectively to combat global warming (geoengineering); and to provide for the growing demand for georesources (deep-sea/ocean mining). The authors highlight the importance of sharing values and actions among planetary human communities to manage global changes and threats. One wonders if the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can suggest or confirm reflections on geoethical thinking. Finally, a charter for a responsible course of human development, articulated in nine principles and actions, is proposed.","[{""name"": ""Silvia Peppoloni"", ""affiliation"": [""Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Rome, Italy"", ""IAPG – International Association for Promoting Geoethics""]}, {""name"": ""Giuseppe Di Capua"", ""affiliation"": [""Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Rome, Italy"", ""IAPG – International Association for Promoting Geoethics""]}]","[""10.1130/SPE501"", ""10.1080/09644010701211650"", ""10.1002/9781119067825.ch11"", ""10.1144/SP508-2019-213"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12010-8_1"", ""10.1126/sciadv.1400253"", ""10.1073/pnas.1704949114"", ""10.1029/2019EO121687"", ""10.1007/3-540-26590-2_3"", ""10.1007/s10584-006-9101-y"", ""10.2190/1GU8-EQN8-02J6-2RXK"", ""10.5751/ES-11236-240416"", ""10.4401/ag-7553"", ""10.1029/2009EO490006"", ""10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0960:GRGAAI>2.3.CO;2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43766-8"", ""10.1007/s11948-005-0006-3"", ""10.5040/9781474236607"", ""10.2138/gselements.14.5.325"", ""10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.245"", ""10.1007/s10584-006-9132-4"", ""10.2307/3857310"", ""10.1017/S0892679416000058"", ""10.1021/acs.est.9b02808"", ""10.1016/S0195-9255(98)00041-9"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2c3k261"", ""10.2138/gselements.14.5.301"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.11.017"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5930.1993.tb00078.x"", ""10.1144/SP508-2020-66"", ""10.1038/s43017-020-0024-3"", ""10.1002/9781119067825.ch13"", ""10.1353/book27397"", ""10.1080/13569775.2018.1452107"", ""10.1126/science.1103618"", ""10.1126/science.1172133"", ""10.1016/j.resourpol.2012.06.016"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-799935-7.00001-0"", ""10.1130/2016.2520(03)"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12010-8_2"", ""10.5751/ES-10558-230446"", ""10.1002/wcc.198"", ""10.1093/biosci/biz088"", ""10.1038/461472a"", ""10.2138/gselements.14.5.291"", ""10.1146/annurev-earth-050212-123944"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-73250-3_6"", ""10.3390/su10113836"", ""10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[614:TAAHNO]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1007/s13280-011-0185-x"", ""10.1177/2053019614564785"", ""10.1126/science.1259855"", ""10.2138/gselements.14.5.298"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-23571-9"", ""10.1130/GSAT01802A.1"", ""10.3390/min7110203""]","['Environmental Science', 'Physics and Astronomy', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Astronomy and Astrophysics', 'Geology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)]]"
10.1002/er.5829,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Dark fermentative biohydrogen production from rice mill wastewater,"SummaryHydrogen (H2) is one of the most promising fuels for sustainable energy production. Microbial bio‐H2 fermentation is considered to be one of the environment friendly alternatives for satisfying the demand for fossil fuels. The study has aimed to isolate the effective bio‐H2 producing microbes from rice mill wastewater (RMWW) using various pre‐treatment enrichment methods. Among the 27 enriched isolates, three isolates produced higher H2 utilizing rice mill wastewater as the substrate. Molecular level identification revealed that the three bacterial strains were Bacillus thuringiensis‐RH1, Bacillus aerophilus‐RH2, and Bacillus beringensis‐AARAT1. Optimization studies revealed that B. thuringiensis‐RH1 would be a promising bio‐H2 producing bacterium with a yield of 0.96 ± 0.06 mol H2/ mol glucose utilizing 50% of rice mill wastewater at pH 5.5. Furthermore, the obtained optimized substrate concentration (50%) and pH (5.5) from batch fermentation were used in the 3 L batch bioreactor experiment using B. thuringiensis‐RH1. A higher hydrogen yield (HY) of 1.63 ± 0.14 mol H2/mol glucose using B. thuringiensis‐RH1 at 72 hours was obtained in the extensive scale up process.","[{""name"": ""Satheesh Murugan Ramu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy Science Alagappa University  Karaikudi India"", ""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}, {""name"": ""Gujuluva Hari Dinesh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy Science Alagappa University  Karaikudi India"", ""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}, {""name"": ""Boobalan Thulasinathan"", ""affiliation"": [""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}, {""name"": ""Angelin Swetha Thondi Rajan"", ""affiliation"": [""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}, {""name"": ""Kumar Ponnuchamy"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Animal Health and Management Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}, {""name"": ""Arivalagan Pugazhendhi"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Research and Development Duy Tan University  Da Nang Vietnam""]}, {""name"": ""Arun Alagarsamy"", ""affiliation"": [""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.103"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2012.02.002"", ""10.1002/er.4376"", ""10.1038/nature01009"", ""10.1016/j.indcrop.2003.12.015"", ""10.1080/15567030802463109"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2010.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.biombioe.2006.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2004.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.05.006"", ""10.1002/er.4188"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.07.076"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.12.165"", ""10.1590/S1517-838246220140111"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2011.02.084"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.031"", ""10.1021/es0349204"", ""10.1016/S0360-3199(02)00130-1"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.04.021"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.02.039"", ""10.22207/JPAM.12.4.09"", ""10.22207/JPAM.12.3.65"", ""10.1128/AEM.27.5.985-987.1974"", ""10.1016/0043-1354(79)90043-5"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.108"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2019.03.060"", ""10.1093/molbev/msr121"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.050"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.036"", ""10.22207/JPAM.13.2.52"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.03.016"", ""10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.053"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.056"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.eaef.2015.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.06.029"", ""10.1007/s11274-011-0789-0"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.05.008"", ""10.1007/BF00360893"", ""10.2175/106143007X175762"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.059"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123447""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Pollution', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

In this scheme, six first-order megasequence boundaries have been defined, characterized by extensive and long-lasting erosional hiatuses and major coastal regressions: (1) Caledonian (or Base Devonian) Unconformity; (2) Variscan–Saalian (or Base Permian) Unconformity; (3) Mid Cimmerian (or Intra-Aalenian) Unconformity; (4) Late Cimmerian (or Base Cretaceous) Unconformity; (5) Atlantean (or Near-Base Tertiary) Unconformity; and (6) Eridanos (or Mid-Miocene) Unconformity. These surfaces have been linked to regional causal factors ranging from orogenesis-related compressional uplifts, in either active plate margin settings (1) or foreland basin settings (2), to intra-plate dynamically supported uplifts associated with the development of mantle plumes (3, 5 and 6) and the end-of-rifting and associated widespread erosion of tilted fault block crests (4). The aforementioned megasequence boundaries punctuate the geodynamic evolution of the North Sea area and facilitate the subdivision of the entire the North Sea sedimentary basin fill into six megasequences, named here A–F. All of the lithostratigraphic units of the North Sea (formations and members) have been described within the context of this first-order tectono-stratigraphic framework. The correlation powers of certain stratigraphic markers are also compared and contrasted, together with the potential cross-border equivalence of sedimentary units on different sides of the political median lines.","[{""name"": ""Stefano Patruno"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Engineering, University of Nicosia, 46 Makedonitissas Avenue, CY-2417, PO Box 24005, CY-1700, Nicosia, Cyprus""]}, {""name"": ""Henk Kombrink"", ""affiliation"": [""North Sea Core, 8 Dubford Terrace, Aberdeen AB23 8GE, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Stuart G.

10.1002/er.8008,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,A review on theoretical studies of structural and optoelectronic properties of FA-based perovskite materials with a focus on FAPbI3,"SummaryOrganic‐inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have captured many researchers' interest in solar cell application during the last decade. Due to their astonishing photoelectric properties and rapid increase in efficiency, these materials are promising candidates for affordable solar cell technologies and optoelectronic devices. Also, with respect to their high‐power conversion efficiency (PCE), cost‐effectiveness, gap tunability, longer charge diffusion length, much improved photochemical and thermal stability, formamidinium (FA)‐based perovskites are one of the most promising materials as well. However, the easy formation of non‐perovskite δ‐phase formamidinium at low temperatures and toxic Pb is disadvantageous. It is worth mentioning that various strategies have been developed to stabilize α‐phase FAPbI3 at room temperature and decrease the toxicity of lead element while retaining their good performances. The current review highlights the recent theoretical progress in stabilization, bandgap engineering, and optical performance of these promising materials.","[{""name"": ""Maryam RaeisianAsl"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""S.

Therefore, it is important to make UAVs that can complete the mission in an efficient and power saving way. To achieve a prescribed flight mission, a UAV has to perform a number of maneuvers/movements, which will consume a certain amount of power. To maximize the cruising time, not only the power source is able to provide enough amount of power to the UAV but also the parts of the UAV can perform efficiently to save power. Before the minimum power capacity can be determined, it is required that the power consumptions of the UAV parts for the required mission be evaluated in a proper way. In this paper, a procedure is presented to estimate the power consumption of a composite UAV. The configuration as well as the fabrication of the UAV using truss-type parts made of carbon strand/epoxy composite material will be briefly introduced. The power consumptions of the propeller system and electric parts will be evaluated in a systematic way. Experiments were conducted to verify the theoretical predictions.

During this time interval, the margin evolved from an active margin ( c. 750–500 Ma: the Reguibat–Avalonian–Cadomian arc) to the final collision with Laurussia in Devonian times to form Pangaea. In this context, one of the oldest recognized ophiolites is the Bou Azzer Ophiolite from the Anti-Atlas Mountains, dated at c. 697 Ma and containing two types of mafic rocks, the youngest of which has a boninitic composition. To the north, in the SW Iberian Massif, the Calzadilla Ophiolite contains mafic rocks also of boninitic composition dated at c. 598 Ma. Farther north, in the NW Iberian Massif, the Vila de Cruces Ophiolite is formed by a thick sequence of mafic rocks with an arc tholeiitic composition and minor alternations of tonalitic orthogneisses dated at c. 497 Ma. In the same region, the Bazar Ophiolite has a similar age of c. 495 Ma. Also in NW Iberia, there is a group of ophiolites with varied lithologies and dominant mafic rocks with arc tholeiitic composition (Careón, Purrido and Moeche ophiolites) dated at c. 395 Ma. The composition of all these peri-Gondwanan ophiolites is of supra-subduction zone type, showing no evidence of preserved mid-ocean ridge basalt type oceanic lithosphere. Consequently, these ophiolites were generated in the peri-Gondwanan realm during the opening of forearc or back-arc basins. Forearc oceanic lithosphere was promptly obducted or accreted to the volcanic arc, but the oceanic or transitional lithosphere generated in back-arc settings was preserved until the assembly of Pangaea. Based on the ages of the described ophiolites, the peri-Gondwanan realm has been a domain where the generation of oceanic or transitional lithosphere seems to have occurred at intervals of c. 100 myr. These regularly spaced time intervals may indicate cyclic events of mantle upwelling in the peri-Gondwanan mid-ocean ridges, with associated higher subduction rates at the peri-Gondwanan trenches and concomitant higher rates of partial melting in the mantle wedges involved. The origin of the apparent cyclicity for mantle upwelling in the peri-Gondwanan ocean ridges is unclear, but it could have possibly been related to episodic deep mantle convection. Cycles of more active deep mantle convection can explain episodic mantle upwelling, the transition from low- to fast-spreading type mid-ocean ridges and, finally, the dynamic context for the episodic generation of new supra-subduction zone type oceanic peri-Gondwanan lithosphere.","[{""name"": ""Ricardo Arenas"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Sonia Sánchez Martínez"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Richard Albert"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut für Geowissenschaften, Goethe-University Frankfurt, 60438 Frankfurt, Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Faouziya Haissen"", ""affiliation"": [""LGAGE, Département de Géologie, Université Hassan-II de Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco""]}, {""name"": ""Javier Fernández-Suárez"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Núria Pujol-Solà"", ""affiliation"": [""Departament de Mineralogia, Petrologia i Geologia Aplicada, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Pilar Andonaegui"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Mineralogía y Petrología and Instituto de Geociencias (UCM, CSIC), Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Rubén Díez Fernández"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Geodinámica, Estratigrafía y Paleontología, Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Joaquín A.

In this paper, the loads are estimated using the edgewise bending moment computed using CCBlade, a steady-state blade element momentum code. The edgewise bending moment is then used to calculate fatigue damage using Miner’s rule. The fatigue damage is used to constrain the layout optimization problem. We show that our method can predict blade root damage with similar trends to damage calculated with other methods, such as a complex, computationally expensive large-eddy simulation and unsteady aeroelastic code. We also optimize wind farm layouts and show that, for a simple problem with two wind directions and ten turbines, the fatigue damage can be constrained without sacrificing wind farm power production.","[{""name"": ""Andrew P.

The PBS extract of rosemary was irradiated with gamma rays at the doses of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 kGy, and their antioxidant activities were investigated by DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), radical cation ABTS•+ (2,2-Azino-Bis (3-Ethylbenzthiazoline-6-Sulfonic Acid), Diammonium Salt), ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) and ferric chelating capacity using ferrozine. The scavenging activities of gamma irradiated rosemary were observed to be significantly higher at 30 and 40 kGy using both methods, DPPH and ABST. Also, the reducing power values of 30 kGy gamma irradiated rosemary were higher than that of non-irradiated (P &lt; 0.05) and the other doses of irradiation could not make any significant difference in reducing power of non-irradiated rosemary. The gamma irradiation of rosemary (at 10–50 kGy), significantly increased the Fe2+ chelating activity compared to non-irradiated rosemary while increasing the absorbed doses reduced Fe2+ chelating activity in rosemary (P &lt; 0.05). There is no significant difference in the rosemary irradiated with 10 kGy and 30 kGy. The gamma irradiated rosemary showed higher antioxidant activities at doses of 30 kGy (79.5 %) and 40 kGy (80 %) with DPPH method, while slightly lower activities were recorded at doses of 30 kGy (34.8 %) and 40 kGy (34.2 %) with ABTS test. Also, results indicate that the 30 kGy might be an effective dose with maximum enhancement in the antioxidant properties of the gamma irradiated rosemary.","[{""name"": ""Reza Rezanejad"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Seafood Science and Technology, Faculty of Fisheries and Environmental Science , Gorgan University of Agriculture Sciences and Natural Resources , Gorgan , Iran"", ""Nuclear Agriculture Research School, Nuclear Science and Technology Research Institute , Karaj , Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Marzieh Heidarieh"", ""affiliation"": [""Nuclear Agriculture Research School, Nuclear Science and Technology Research Institute , P.O.

The main problems faced by rural areas are cover poverty, low level of education, and limited access to technology. Smart village concept emerged due to some different characteristics between rural and urban areas. Banyuwangi Regency is one of regions that created smart concept starting from rural area, called smart kampung. So far, smart kampung only focused on public services, which included only a small part of smart city concept. Hence, this research was intended to propose the model of smart village examined through initial interview in village sample of Banyuwangi, literature reviews related to smart city, smart village, and smart rural. Then, the results were confirmed and adjusted to support local regulations. This research created a smart village model that was capable to be a guide for each village to develop towards better future. The proposed smart village model was categorized into 6 dimensions including 1) Governance, (2) Technology, (3) Resources, (4) Village Service, (5) Living, and (6) Tourism. This research is expected to be applied to villages in other Regencies by adjusting the characteristics of each region.","[{""name"": ""A A Aziiza"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T D Susanto"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.37396/jsc.v1i2.9"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.122""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Information Systems', 'Media Technology', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7248), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7085)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

However, inherent high‐nonlinear, multi‐variable, and strongly coupled features usually lead to thorny obstacles that hinder conventional methods to identify them with a high speed, high accuracy, and reliable stability. Hence, a Levenberg‐Marquardt backpropagation (LMBP) algorithm‐based parameter identification technique is proposed in this study, which is applied to efficiently train designed artificial neural networks (ANNs) to implement the identification task. Furthermore, two typical models, for example, electrochemical model (ECM) and steady‐state model (SSM), are taken into account to validate the identification performance of the LMBP algorithm under different operation conditions. Simulation results based on MATLAB demonstrate that the LMBP algorithm can extremely improve the accuracy, speed, and stability for estimating these unknown parameters via a comprehensive comparison with four mainstream meta‐heuristic algorithms, that is, artificial ecosystem‐based optimization (AEO), equilibrium optimizer (EO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and moth‐flame optimization (MFO).","[{""name"": ""Bo Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Electric Power Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Yijun Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Electric Power Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhengxun Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Electric Power Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Jingbo Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Electric Power Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Chunyuan Zeng"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Electric Power Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Danyang Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Electric Power Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongchun Shu"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Electric Power Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Jieshan Shan"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Electric Power Engineering Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Ting Fu"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Civil Engineering and Mechanics Kunming University of Science and Technology  Kunming China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoshun Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China""]}]","[""10.1186/s41601-019-0147-z"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112595"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2020.3024955"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.117843"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2020.2966509"", ""10.1186/s41601-021-00181-3"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.12.090"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2015.07.036"", ""10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2901747"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.027"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.047"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.074"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.150"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101314"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.063"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.06.020"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.116811"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114310"", ""10.1186/s41601-020-0154-0"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.161"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.116613"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.12.105"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.098"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.11.091"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.102153"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112856"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.038"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.03.174"", ""10.1021/ie100032c"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2009.02.012"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.072"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.08.082"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.062"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.08.130"", ""10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554639"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.557-559.2202"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.064"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.07.100"", ""10.1002/fuce.201100140"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.072"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.155"", ""10.1109/TIE.2016.2618755"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112204"", ""10.1109/TIE.2007.896480"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.04.042"", ""10.1109/TNN.2010.2045657""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

It is one of the approaches applied in mixed methods research. This paper is part of a preliminary study that aims to examine the application of Q methodology. Fourteen undergraduate students from the Faculty of Geography, Universitas Gadjah Mada, participated in this study. Data collected with Q sorting techniques using the Q-Sortware, and analyzed with Principal Component Analysis using KADE desktop. Both are software used specifically in Q methodology research. The method implementation aims to determine the distinguishing factors and consensus of students’ ecoliteracy components on disaster risk reduction. The research showed that Q-Sortware tends to facilitate researchers in collecting data. However, it is quite complicated and less practical for participants. Meanwhile, the KADE desktop has an attractive interface with a tutorial that makes it easy to use. By analyzing the case study, the result showed that the students’ ecoliteracy component is represented by five distinguishing factors and two consensus statements, with cumulative variations explained by 68 %. This study is, however, limited by the performance of quantitative procedures without in-depth qualitative data interpretation.","[{""name"": ""Aldila Rahma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Djati Mardiatno"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dyah Rahmawati Hizbaron"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/104973239600600408"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097086-8.10550-1"", ""10.1177/160940690900800109"", ""10.1063/1.3021248"", ""10.1177/2059799119832194"", ""10.32614/RJ-2014-032"", ""10.21105/joss.01360"", ""10.1002/wics.101"", ""10.1191/1478088705qp022oa"", ""10.1890/ES13-00075.1""]",['Decision Sciences'],['Management Science and Operations Research'],"[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

The basic idea behind this work is to regenerate waste silver from X‐ray films and to employ them in biofuel production from jatropha oil. Stable silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were prepared using Quercus infectoria (oak gall) and raw Camellia sinensis (tea) extracts. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, UV‐visible spectra, energy‐dispersive X‐ray analysis, and Fe‐SEM technique. The temperature of the reactions, weight hourly space velocity, and time of reaction decide the yield of biofuel, and the parameters were optimized over Ag NP catalyst. Apart from yield of biofuel, the proportion of gasoline fraction (C5‐C9) was also peer monitored. A maximum of 90% conversion of jatropha oil was converted into 85% biofuel with 76% selectivity toward gasoline over Ag NPs. Flash point, fire point, calorific value, cloud point, specific gravity, and viscosity of the gasoline were evaluated and correlated with ASTM D6751 standards.","[{""name"": ""Ramya Ganesan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry St. Joseph's Institute of Technology  Chennai India""]}, {""name"": ""Padmamalini Narasimhalu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics St. Joseph's Institute of Technology  Chennai India""]}, {""name"": ""Amala Infant Joice Joseph"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry Holy Cross College  Trichy India""]}, {""name"": ""Arivalagan Pugazhendhi"", ""affiliation"": [""Innovative Green Product Synthesis and Renewable Environment Development Research Group, Faculty of Environment and Labour Safety, Ton Duc Thang University  Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam""]}]","[""10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117725"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.033"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.087"", ""10.3390/en11082132"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.06.073"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.01.048"", ""10.1016/j.fbp.2020.04.001"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-818996-2.00024-7"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.02.012"", ""10.1016/j.jaap.2018.12.017"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.030"", ""10.1016/j.joei.2017.10.008"", ""10.1080/14484846.2019.1567029"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.01.132"", ""10.1007/s10973-018-7725-6"", ""10.1002/apj.2361"", ""10.1080/15567036.2011.590855"", ""10.1002/jctb.1665"", ""10.1016/S1385-8947(02)00142-0"", ""10.1590/1678-4324-2019180178"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2008.03.009"", ""10.1007/s13762-019-02270-1"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2019.02.018"", ""10.1002/ente.201800809"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.116371"", ""10.2174/1570193X16666190122164046"", ""10.1186/s13068-019-1465-0"", ""10.1021/ef000026b"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.06.031"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-803581-8.03653-5"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.06.010"", ""10.1080/15533174.2013.862817"", ""10.1007/s40097-014-0086-1"", ""10.1016/j.snb.2016.07.112"", ""10.1016/j.cbi.2007.10.002"", ""10.1201/9780824745172"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.07.094"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-49444-y"", ""10.1007/s42452-019-0353-3"", ""10.1016/j.micpath.2017.11.052"", ""10.1016/j.biori.2017.11.001"", ""10.3390/ma10040402"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.036"", ""10.1016/S0196-8904(02)00234-0"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.08.084"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29069-6_9"", ""10.1007/s13369-020-04354-4"", ""10.1016/j.molliq.2018.02.022"", ""10.1016/j.jaap.2019.01.020"", ""10.1002/ep.12538"", ""10.1038/srep11327"", ""10.1016/j.molliq.2018.02.022"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2010.10.060""]","['Engineering', 'Chemistry']","['Mechanical Engineering', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0703 化学', 0.7613), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7594)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"
10.1002/er.6194,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Rapid measurement method for lithium-ion battery state of health estimation based on least squares support vector regression,"SummaryThe state of health (SoH) is a key indicator of a battery management system (BMS). Accurate SoH estimation can be adopted to guide the timely recovery and ladder utilization for lithium‐ion batteries (LiBs), which is particularly beneficial to environmental protection. Although many battery SoH estimation algorithms have been developed, there are few simple and easy‐to‐use methods for on‐site rapidly measurement. Therefore, in this paper, a model for battery SoH estimate is realized by least‐square support vector regression (LS‐SVR) configured with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Based on the hysteresis behavior of LiB, data samples can be quickly obtained by the hybrid pulse power characteristic (HPPC) test. The grey correlation analysis (GRA) was conducted to select features of data samples, and the K‐fold cross‐validation and grid search (GS) were performed to optimize the hyperparameters of the estimation model LS‐SVR. Finally, to verify the proposed method, data samples collected from 18 650 LiB with different aging degrees were used for LS‐SVR model training and testing, and the method was compared to existing SoH estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the SoH estimation model only requires some short‐term data of a battery to achieve high‐precision SoH estimation, which shows that this method has broad application prospects.","[{""name"": ""Bin Xiao"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Automation Science and Engineering South China University of Technology  Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Bing Xiao"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Automation Science and Engineering South China University of Technology  Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Luoshi Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Engineering Guangzhou Triv Electronic Technologies Co.LTD  Guangzhou China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.262"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.100811"", ""10.1002/er.3598"", ""10.1109/TII.2019.2951843"", ""10.1002/er.5383"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.157"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.05.148"", ""10.1002/er.4784"", ""10.1109/TIM.2014.2303534"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.041"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2009.2034966"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.03.015"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.11.072"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.092"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.06.036"", ""10.1149/2.1411712jes"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.182"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228069"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.061"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.018"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2019.02.055"", ""10.1149/2.0821614jes"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.11.134"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.086"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.140"", ""10.1007/s00170-010-2985-8"", ""10.1007/BF00994018"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.01.129"", ""10.1149/2.064311jes"", ""10.1109/TIM.2012.2215142""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Comprehensive thermodynamic assessments are conducted to determine the performance of the proposed model. At basic operating circumstances, the simulation results in the generation of 7.871 MW of electricity, 10.05 kg/s of drinking water, 8.788 MW cooling capacity, and hydrogen at a rate of 0.2445 kg/h accompanied by 41.18% energy efficiency and a sum unit cost of products of 6.583 $/GJ. Then, parametric research is going to determine the influence of the proposed system's primary parameters on its performance. Additionally, the gray wolf optimization technique is used to optimize the exergetic efficiency with sum unit cost products and freshwater rate of production under various multi‐objective optimization situations. The first optimization scenario's results indicate that the 53.06% exergetic efficiency and 5.44 $/GJ sum unit cost products are the optimum point, and in the second optimization scenario, the optimum point is 47.64% exergetic efficiency and 9.61 kg/s freshwater production rate. Finally, the performance of the suggested method is demonstrated using a case study of New York, United States of America, and represented the maximum performance in July with 5.2 MW net power and 39.6% exergetic efficiency.","[{""name"": ""Saeid Azizi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Tabriz  Tabriz Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Navid Nedaei"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Tabriz  Tabriz Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Mortaza Yari"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Tabriz  Tabriz Iran""]}]","[""10.3390/su6052474"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2014.10.057"", ""10.1016/j.est.2022.104466"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.02.017"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.099"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.079"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.029"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.013"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.121"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2014.12.070"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.08.067"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.085"", ""10.2172/1360677"", ""10.1039/C5FD00236B"", ""10.2172/1338899"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.01.046"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.01.063"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2016.02.012"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2008.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2007.05.039"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.05.092"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.160"", ""10.1002/wene.75"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2010.09.042"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2009.09.014"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.040"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.049"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.06.050"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.04.038"", ""10.1016/j.geothermics.2017.08.011"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2012.03.029"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2008.03.018"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.07.129"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.11.025"", ""10.1002/est2.71"", ""10.1002/er.4233"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2021.101729"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.12.026"", ""10.1016/j.psep.2022.01.067"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122049"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.11.060"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.12.119"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113486"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2022.102145"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113951"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114395"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.122415"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113970"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.031"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.06.018"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.115899"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101698"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2020.114725"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2021.115494"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2022.118110"", ""10.3390/su12197996"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.09.080"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.049"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2006.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2013.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115892"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.032"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00466-4""]","['Engineering', 'Energy', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1002/er.8089,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Multimodal piezoelectric wind energy harvester for aerospace applications,"SummaryPiezoelectric transduction has been an emerging concept, especially in the aerospace industry for sensor networking and onboard generation of reliable electrical energy. A significant gap has been noticed in the generalized and multimodal analytics of piezoelectric sensors for wind energy harvesting. Therefore, herein, a simplified yet effective transfer‐function ‐based, experimentally validated analytical model of the piezoelectric sensor is presented. MATLAB is utilized to analyze the proposed model for two different categories of piezoelectric sensors (ie, PIC‐255, and PZT‐5A) under the various conditions of wind speed, piezoelectric configuration, and piezoelectric geometrical features. The developed model has also shown the promising features of flutter energy harvesting, and limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) that play an imperative role in aerospace applications such as energy harvesting from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Results emphasize that under the same parametric, and geometric conditions, the PZT‐5A harvester reaches quickly to critical flutter mode as compared to PIC‐255. Subsequently, the PZT‐5A harvester is capable of generating 7.105 mW during the particular region of the limit cycle oscillations (LCOs). Based on the outcomes of multimodal analytics, the proposed model is best suited to both conventional wind energy harvesting (Up to nominal range) and flutter harvesting (Critical limit), making it suitable for aerospace applications. It is also recommended to utilize the model for piezoelectric vibrational energy scavengers by incorporating the additional parameters of the structure in the developed transfer function of the piezoelectric sensor.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Abdullah Sheeraz"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Mechanical Engineering GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology  Topi Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Sohail Malik"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Mechanical Engineering GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology  Topi Pakistan"", ""Pak‐Austria Fachhochschule: Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology  Haripur Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Khalid Rahman"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Mechanical Engineering GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology  Topi Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Hassan Elahi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Sapienza University of Rome  Rome Italy"", ""Department of Mechatronics Engineering National University of Science and Technology (NUST)  Islamabad Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Khurram"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering National University of Technology (NUTECH)  Islamabad Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Marco Eugeni"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Sapienza University of Rome  Rome Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Paolo Gaudenzi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Sapienza University of Rome  Rome Italy""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.01.002"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024168"", ""10.3390/en13164085"", ""10.3390/aerospace6030037"", ""10.2514/1.C035070"", ""10.3390/s22010363"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.101047"", ""10.3390/en14092498"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.047"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.158"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111973"", ""10.1080/10584587.2020.1803672"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-100148-6.00007-X"", ""10.3390/s19030545"", ""10.1063/1.4926876"", ""10.1016/j.euromechflu.2018.11.019"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.12.051"", ""10.1557/mrs.2018.180"", ""10.1063/1.4896166"", ""10.1007/s12206-018-0110-8"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.06.010"", ""10.1115/1.4002788"", ""10.3390/app11031166"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/774/1/012090"", ""10.1007/s13369-020-04526-2"", ""10.1063/5.0054425"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2019.10.115"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.05.078"", ""10.1002/we.2502"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114902"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2019.104051"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/22/9/095029"", ""10.1063/1.4816075"", ""10.1063/1.3486519"", ""10.3390/aerospace7120167"", ""10.1016/j.ast.2017.02.013"", ""10.1007/s00542-020-05017-y"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2017.06.020"", ""10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.12.044"", ""10.3390/mi11080725"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.153"", ""10.1016/j.taml.2016.08.009"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2015.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.ast.2019.105634"", ""10.1007/s00158-013-0923-8"", ""10.1007/s00158-017-1886-y"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.073"", ""10.1115/1.4002931"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-69442-9_4"", ""10.1007/s11664‐019‐07453‐7"", ""10.1007/s00542-018-3856-8"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/22/12/125003"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2019.12.016"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.1049.305"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-80359-9_2"", ""10.1134/S1063771019050014"", ""10.1039/9781839163456"", ""10.1155/2015/292368"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113260"", ""10.1088/1361-665X/ab525a"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111880"", ""10.1016/j.mee.2020.111333"", ""10.1080/10584587.2020.1803681"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114710"", ""10.3390/mi11100933"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114250"", ""10.3390/en13123101""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1007/s41365-024-01589-w,NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0702 Physics,Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart,"AbstractHigh-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei, informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition, leading to the formation of quark–gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP, leading to final-state hadron distributions that are observed experimentally. Recent advances in both experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era of heavy-ion collisions, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of these stages to the final-state observables. To avoid this, we propose leveraging established knowledge of low-energy nuclear structures and hydrodynamic observables to independently constrain the QGP’s initial condition. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei—species with similar mass numbers but different ground-state geometries—we can disentangle the initial condition’s impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the initial stages of the collisions but also turns high-energy nuclear experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches. Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future electron-ion collider. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.","[{""name"":

Examples are given that pose a threat to the vital activity of living organisms from various types of agricultural and human activities. The subject of the study is the analysis of environmental issues arising from the intensification of the development of agricultural industry. Intensive agricultural activity leads to pollution of surface rivers, lakes, seas and groundwater, soil degradation and aquatic ecosystems; violation of the water regime in large areas during drainage and irrigation; desertification due to wind erosion; destruction of natural habitats of living organisms of flora and fauna. An urgent problem of agriculture is a decrease in the content of vitamins and microelements in crop production and the accumulation of harmful substances in them. The reasons for these negative processes are soil degradation, intensification of agricultural production.","[{""name"": ""Eleonora Tsoraeva"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alan Bekmurzov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Soslan Kozyrev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alan Khoziev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aslanbek Kozyrev"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1088/1757-899X/905/1/012034"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/202015706028"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/913/4/042051"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/913/4/042035""]","['Environmental Science', 'Business, Management and Accounting', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Agronomy and Crop Science', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7494), ('0901 作物学', 0.7482)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

In the present study, an effective coculture system, namely, Serratia marcescens AATB1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae AATB2, was used in the MFC system. The isolated strains, AATB1 and AATB2 were identified as biofilm producing bacteria. The experiments were performed in a two‐chambered MFC setup with septic tank wastewater as the substrate in a 5 days batch mode. Pure culture of S. marcescens AATB1 and K. pneumoniae AATB2, and their cocultures were able to produce energy with the maximum current densities of 728.85 ± 36 mA/m2, 642.19 ± 32 mA/m2 and 869.11 ± 43 mA/m2, respectively, and the maximum power densities of 341.65 ± 17 mW/m2, 257.51 ± 12 mW/m2 and 398.69 ± 19 mW/m2, respectively. During the process, cyclic voltammetry analysis has revealed the electrochemical behavior of the anodic biofilm. Approximately, 70.42% ± 3.52% of chemical oxygen demand removal was achieved during the process. Biofilm formation by the adhesion of microbes on the electrode surfaces was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscope and scanning electron microscope. All the three MFC systems were produced by biofilms containing extracellular polymeric substance from S. marcescens AATB1 (55 ± 2.75 μg/cm2 of protein, 61 ± 3.05 μg/cm2 of carbohydrate) and K. pneumoniae AATB2 (46 ± 2.30 μg/cm2 of protein, 53 ± 2.65 μg/cm2 of carbohydrate) and coculture (60 ± 3.00 μg/cm2 of protein, 69 ± 3.45 μg/cm2 of carbohydrate). Furthermore, the anode biofilm metabolites were identified by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC‐MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR spectroscopy.","[{""name"": ""Boobalan Thulasinathan"", ""affiliation"": [""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}, {""name"": ""James Obeth Ebenezer"", ""affiliation"": [""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}, {""name"": ""Abhispa Bora"", ""affiliation"": [""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}, {""name"": ""Arumugam Nagarajan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biotechnology Indian Institute of Technology Madras  Chennai India""]}, {""name"": ""Arivalagan Pugazhendhi"", ""affiliation"": [""Innovative Green Product Synthesis and Renewable Environment Development Research Group Faculty of Environment and Labour Safety, Ton Duc Thang University  Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam""]}, {""name"": ""Tamilmani Jayabalan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering National Institute of Technology  Tiruchirappalli India""]}, {""name"": ""Samsudeen Nainamohamed"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical Engineering National Institute of Technology  Tiruchirappalli India""]}, {""name"": ""Mukesh Doble"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biotechnology Indian Institute of Technology Madras  Chennai India""]}, {""name"": ""Arun Alagarsamy"", ""affiliation"": [""Bioenergy and Bioremediation Laboratory, Department of Microbiology Alagappa University  Karaikudi India""]}]","[""10.1080/17597269.2017.1398953"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2015.05.082"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2019.05.109"", ""10.1021/es050316c"", ""10.1016/j.nbt.2013.01.009"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2014.12.100"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2019.03.060"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.136"", ""10.1007/s12649-015-9379-y"", ""10.1038/srep18070"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(2004)130:2(45)"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.056"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2009.10.017"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2019.115815"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2019.04.052"", ""10.1021/la703469y"", ""10.1128/AEM.02600-08"", ""10.1002/bit.22556"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.019"", ""10.1038/nrmicro1442"", ""10.1007/s00253-010-2757-2"", ""10.1007/s11356-016-8336-z"", ""10.1136/jcp.42.8.872"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2015.02.103"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2015.07.023"", ""10.1016/j.procbio.2016.06.007"", ""10.1016/S0021-9258(19)52451-6"", ""10.1016/j.ab.2004.12.001"", ""10.1021/acs.iecr.7b01855"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b04556"", ""10.1016/j.snb.2016.11.154"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2008.08.030"", ""10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.05.014"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b03419"", ""10.1038/ncomms12217"", ""10.3389/fenrg.2018.00063"", ""10.1201/b18718"", ""10.1128/AEM.69.3.1548-1555.2003"", ""10.1128/AEM.70.2.1234-1237.2004"", ""10.1128/AEM.01142-09"", ""10.1038/nbt867"", ""10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00354-9"", ""10.1006/anae.2001.0399"", ""10.1021/es0605016"", ""10.1007/s00253-008-1546-7"", ""10.1007/s00253-008-1360-2"", ""10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b02294"", ""10.1016/j.bioelechem.2011.12.012"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2011.10.002"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0155247"", ""10.1016/j.bioelechem.2018.08.002"", ""10.1186/s12934-019-1087-z"", ""10.1073/pnas.0710525105"", ""10.1186/s13068-017-0881-2""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1007/s41365-022-01092-0,NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0702 Physics,A high fidelity general purpose 3-D Monte Carlo particle transport program JMCT3.0,"AbstractJMCT is a large-scale, high-fidelity, three-dimensional general neutron–photon–electron–proton transport Monte Carlo software system. It was developed based on the combinatorial geometry parallel infrastructure JCOGIN and the adaptive structured mesh infrastructure JASMIN. JMCT is equipped with CAD modeling and visualizes the image output. It supports the geometry of the body and the structured/unstructured mesh. JMCT has most functions, variance reduction techniques, and tallies of the traditional Monte Carlo particle transport codes. Two energy models, multi-group and continuous, are provided. In recent years, some new functions and algorithms have been developed, such as Doppler broadening on-the-fly (OTF), uniform tally density (UTD), consistent adjoint driven importance sampling (CADIS), fast criticality search of boron concentration (FCSBC) domain decomposition (DD), adaptive control rod moving (ACRM), and random geometry (RG) etc. The JMCT is also coupled with the discrete ordinate SN code JSNT to generate source-biasing factors and weight-window parameters. At present, the number of geometric bodies, materials, tallies, depletion zones, and parallel processors are sufficiently large to simulate extremely complicated device problems. JMCT can be used to simulate reactor physics, criticality safety analysis, radiation shielding, detector response, nuclear well logging, and dosimetry calculations etc. In particular, JMCT can be coupled with depletion and thermal-hydraulics for the simulation of reactor nuclear-hot feedback effects. This paper describes the progress in advanced modeling, high-performance numerical simulation of particle transport, multiphysics coupled calculations, and large-scale parallel computing.","[{""name"": ""Li Deng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gang Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bao-Yin Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rui Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ling-Yu Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xin Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuan-Gang Fu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dun-Fu Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peng Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yan Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dan-Hu Shangguan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ze-Hua Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sheng-Cheng Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jing-Wen Shen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11704-010-0120-5"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2014.07.048"", ""10.2172/10115999"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2019.106942"", ""10.7498/aps.67.20172650"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95588-9_74"", ""10.1007/s12650-018-0487-1"", ""10.1051/epjconf/202023909001"", ""10.2172/4167844"", ""10.13182/NSE15-32"", ""10.7498/aps.65.092501"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.08.118"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2017.10.028"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2017.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2018.12.032"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00936-5"", ""10.7498/aps.65.052801"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2016.02.043"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2018.02.049"", ""10.11884/HPLPB202234.210372"", ""10.7498/aps.69.20200279""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Radiation', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

In the thermal decomposition of studtite, an amorphous phase is obtained at calcination temperatures between 200 and 500 °C. This amorphous compound, referred to elsewhere in the literature as U2O7, has been characterised by analytical spectroscopic methods. The local structure of the amorphous compound has been found to contain uranyl bonding by X-ray absorption near edge (XANES), Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Changes in bond distances in the uranyl group are discussed with respect to studtite calcination temperature. The reaction of the amorphous compound with water to form metaschoepite is also discussed and compared with the structure of schoepite and metaschoepite by X-ray diffraction. A novel schematic reaction mechanism for the thermal decomposition of studtite is proposed.","[{""name"": ""Nathan B. A. Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victoria L.

This paper presents a review of the effects of this pandemic on the informal economy, coupled with empirical evidence based on surveys conducted in Indonesia. Data used in this study was collected by an online survey during the pandemic. Theoretically, there are two points of view about the informal economy roles during a crisis: optimistic views that see informal economy survive in a crisis and pessimistic views that see the ongoing informal economy continue to suffer losses and also informal workers as vulnerable groups during a crisis. The research also discussed the impacts of the crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic on informal employments and incomes, readiness in dealing with the pandemic, and the livelihood conditions of informal workers. The crisis as a result of this pandemic provides a new experience for the informal sector in dealing with the crisis. The informal sector is not always a hero during the crisis but rather an alternative sector that offers business flexibility.","[{""name"": ""Agus Joko Pitoyo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bagas Aditya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ikhwan Amri"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.3547729"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-0428-5"", ""10.1371/journal.pntd.0006580"", ""10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.05.008"", ""10.30958/ajbe.6-2-4"", ""10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.03.001"", ""10.5040/9781849664554"", ""10.1177/1468018109106887"", ""10.1080/13552074.2010.491339"", ""10.4236/me.2010.13018""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Social Sciences']","['Demography', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1002/er.6956,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Recent advances in hierarchical anode designs of TiO2-B nanostructures for lithium-ion batteries,"SummaryThe state‐of‐the‐art development progress of the fabrication, design, modification, and applications of TiO2‐B‐based hierarchical nanostructures with a well‐controlled size and morphology in lithium‐ion battery (LIB) applications has been summarized and discussed. Based on studying on lithiation/delithiation on mechanisms of a typical metal oxide nanomaterials, along with doping with foreign atoms (metal or non‐metal), using electronically conductive additives (graphene/graphene derivatives), as well as designing and using hierarchical anode‐material nanostructures (hybrids/composites) containing two or more constituents in LIB applications, these strategies have provided many great opportunities to take maximum advantage of both the high capacity and rate capacity while avoiding significant capacity loss after charge/discharge cycling. In this review, the advances in TiO2‐B‐based anode structures at the nanoscale for LIBs have been discussed in two major sections, including (a) hierarchical heterostructures based on TiO2‐B and metal, non‐metal, transition metal oxides (TMOs), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs); and (b) hybrid designs/nanocomposites between TiO2‐B and graphene/graphene derivatives. The in‐depth understanding of structure‐property relationships as well as detailed suggestions on the mechanism, reason, and origin of the excellent enhancement in electrochemical performance in the above strategies, has been presented and highlighted.","[{""name"": ""Tuyet Nhung Pham"", ""affiliation"": [""Phenikaa University Nano Institute (PHENA), PHENIKAA University  Hanoi Vietnam""]},

Radioanalytical techniques use the radiation as a looking glass into the composition of materials, thus providing valuable information to various scientific disciplines. Absolute quantification of the measurand often relies on accurate knowledge of nuclear decay data and detector calibrations traceable to the SI units. Behind the scenes of the radioanalytical world, there is a small community of radionuclide metrologists who provide the vital tools to convert detection rates into activity values. They perform highly accurate primary standardisations of activity to establish the SI-derived unit becquerel for the most relevant radionuclides, and demonstrate international equivalence of their standards through key comparisons. The trustworthiness of their metrological work crucially depends on painstaking scrutiny of their methods and the elaboration of comprehensive uncertainty budgets. Through meticulous methodology, rigorous data analysis, performance of reference measurements, technological innovation, education and training, and organisation of proficiency tests, they help the user community to achieve confidence in measurements for policy support, science, and trade. The author dedicates the George Hevesy Medal Award 2020 to the current and previous generations of radionuclide metrologists who have devoted their professional lives to this noble endeavour.","[{""name"": ""Stefaan Pommé"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2760/666973"", ""10.1088/0026-1394/44/4/E01"", ""10.1088/0026-1394/52/3/S1"", ""10.1088/0026-1394/44/4/S03"",

10.1007/s41365-022-01034-w,NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0702 Physics,Iterative Bayesian Monte Carlo for nuclear data evaluation,"AbstractIn this work, we explore the use of an iterative Bayesian Monte Carlo (iBMC) method for nuclear data evaluation within a TALYS Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (TENDL) framework. The goal is to probe the model and parameter space of the TALYS code system to find the optimal model and parameter sets that reproduces selected experimental data. The method involves the simultaneous variation of many nuclear reaction models as well as their parameters included in the TALYS code. The ‘best’ model set with its parameter set was obtained by comparing model calculations with selected experimental data. Three experimental data types were used: (1) reaction cross sections, (2) residual production cross sections, and (3) the elastic angular distributions. To improve our fit to experimental data, we update our ‘best’ parameter set—the file that maximizes the likelihood function—in an iterative fashion. Convergence was determined by monitoring the evolution of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) values and was considered reached when the relative change in the MLE for the last two iterations was within 5%. Once the final ‘best’ file is identified, we infer parameter uncertainties and covariance information to this file by varying model parameters around this file. In this way, we ensured that the parameter distributions are centered on our evaluation. The proposed method was applied to the evaluation of p+$$^{59}$$ 59 Co between 1 and 100 MeV. Finally, the adjusted files were compared with experimental data from the EXFOR database as well as with evaluations from the TENDL-2019, JENDL/He-2007 and JENDL-4.0/HE nuclear data libraries.","[{""name"": ""Erwin Alhassan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dimitri Rochman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexander Vasiliev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathieu Hursin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Arjan J.

The system performance was assessed in two different cases based on: (a) oxygen‐ion conducting electrolyte and (b) proton‐conducting electrolyte solid oxide fuel cells. At low current densities, the system based on proton‐conducting electrolyte cell presented larger values of power. In contrast, the system based on oxygen‐ion conducting electrolyte cell had a better performance from power viewpoint at high current densities. This phenomenon was similar for energy and exergy efficiencies and emission. The comparative analysis revealed that the system based on oxygen‐ion conducting electrolyte cell had higher power output than the system based on proton‐conducting electrolyte cell (204.2 kW against 178.7 kW) at their optimum conditions, while the system based on proton‐conducting electrolyte cell presented lower emission (996.5 kg/MW h against 1560.7 kg/MW h). The TOPSIS method was utilized to solve the multi‐criteria decision‐making problem. The results indicated that the system based on proton‐conducting electrolyte cell had a better performance than the system based on oxygen‐ion conducting electrolyte cell.","[{""name"": ""Parisa Mojaver"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department Faculty of Engineering, Urmia University  Urmia Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Shahram Khalilarya"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department Faculty of Engineering, Urmia University  Urmia Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Ata Chitsaz"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department Faculty of Engineering, Urmia University  Urmia Iran""]}]","[""10.1002/er.4210"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.01.081"", ""10.1002/er.5610"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113904"", ""10.1002/er.4369"", ""10.1002/er.5073"", ""10.1002/er.4005"", ""10.1002/er.4907"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.115899"", ""10.1002/er.4213"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.062"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.033"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.244"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.234"", ""10.1002/er.4781"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.129"", ""10.1002/er.4611"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2012.04.023"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.04.104"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.075"", ""10.1002/er.3585"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-29841-2"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112260"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.08.240"", ""10.1016/S0016-2361(02)00313-7"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2009.09.031"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.12.008"", ""10.1002/er.4837"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.08.038"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114093"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.162"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.04.124"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2006.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.05.096"", ""10.1016/j.tsep.2018.11.002"", ""10.1007/s00170-017-0780-5"", ""10.1007/s00231-019-02628-8"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2011.04.042"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2008.08.005""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Herein, Co/N co‐doped 3D hierarchical porous bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst was synthesized using F127 as soft template and PMMA nanosphere as hard template to build hierarchically ordered macro/mesoporous porous nanostructure. The as‐obtained macro/mesoporous Co‐N‐doped carbon endowing its 3D ordered hierarchical porosity and satisfactory surface area, leading to superior performance for ORR, OER, and rechargeable Zn‐air battery. For ORR, the catalyst showed superior ORR activity with an attractive half‐wave potential of 0.85 V (vs RHE), remarkable methanol tolerance, and robust long‐term stability under alkaline electrolyte. For OER, the as‐synthetized electrocatalyst exhibited low overpotential of 1.67 V (vs RHE) under the current density of 10 mA/cm2. Moreover, the Zn‐air battery assembled from the hierarchical porous catalyst displayed a high peak power density of 146 mW/cm2.","[{""name"": ""Zihan Meng"", ""affiliation"": [""Foshan Xianhu Laboratory of the Advanced Energy Science and Technology, Guangdong Laboratory Xianhu Hydrogen Valley  Foshan China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Neng Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Shichang Cai"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Rui Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Foshan Xianhu Laboratory of the Advanced Energy Science and Technology, Guangdong Laboratory Xianhu Hydrogen Valley  Foshan China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Weibin Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Foshan Xianhu Laboratory of the Advanced Energy Science and Technology, Guangdong Laboratory Xianhu Hydrogen Valley  Foshan China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Haolin Tang"", ""affiliation"": [""Foshan Xianhu Laboratory of the Advanced Energy Science and Technology, Guangdong Laboratory Xianhu Hydrogen Valley  Foshan China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.08.040"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.118405"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.055"", ""10.1016/j.scib.2019.05.020"", ""10.1002/aenm.201700467"", ""10.1039/D0TA02334E"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136775"", ""10.1002/aenm.201802856"", ""10.1039/C9SC01154D"", ""10.1002/cjoc.201700752"", ""10.1002/cjoc.201600366"", ""10.1016/j.scib.2019.06.012"", ""10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00462"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.12.056"", ""10.1002/er.4768"", ""10.1002/smll.201602507"", ""10.1002/adma.201800588"", ""10.1021/jacs.7b10194"", ""10.1002/cjoc.202000073"", ""10.1039/C9TA01807G"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2019.03.013"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2020.01.034"", ""10.1002/cey2.35"", ""10.1021/jacs.8b11129"", ""10.1166/jnn.2020.17325"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2018.04.015"", ""10.1002/adma.201703185"", ""10.1021/ic900132k"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.05.015"", ""10.1021/jp405775x"", ""10.1016/S1872-2067(19)63363-2"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.11.037"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2018.12.066"", ""10.1021/cm060921u"", ""10.1039/C7TA05646J"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.104763"", ""10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62982-6"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b19332"", ""10.1002/er.5280"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2018.08.053"", ""10.1002/er.5524"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.08.096"", ""10.1039/C8CC05959D"", ""10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2013.06.080"", ""10.1039/C8TA07849A"", ""10.1016/S1872-2067(18)63078-5"", ""10.1002/smll.201700740"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.025"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.07.091"", ""10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2017.01.011"", ""10.1002/advs.201500265"", ""10.1038/nnano.2015.48"", ""10.1039/C6TA01349J"", ""10.1021/acsnano.6b05914"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b00204"", ""10.1039/C8NR04372H"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.003""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

The optimal estimated values of the seven control parameters are generated by the bald eagle search (BES) optimizer. These parameters have optimized the model of the solid oxide fuel cells stack and formulated it as an optimization problem with associated constraints. The employed BES optimizer is a flexible algorithm with a relatively large population size which effectively improves the optimization process and has the ability to be improved. The BES optimizer is smooth, rapid, and steady in the convergence process. The BES optimizer is a very simple algorithm that consists of three main stages which are selecting hunting space, searching in the hunting area, and swooping stage. The model of the stack is tested at four operating conditions at 3 bar and varied temperatures of 923/973/1023/1073 K. The BES optimizer leads to more accurate parameters with good convergences. The insignificant values of reported worst mean square errors of something around 4.7e‐6 V2 points out the full conformity and coincidence between actual and estimated dataset voltage points. In addition to that, the efficacy of the BES optimizer is assured by comparing the results to parameters estimated from some recent techniques. The cropped estimated polarization curves, V‐I and P‐I, are very close to the measured datasets at various operating conditions.

10.1002/er.8076,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Multi-objective optimization of thermoeconomic and component size of supercritical carbon dioxide recompression cycle based on small-scale lead-cooled fast reactor,"SummaryWhen the supercritical CO2 power cycle is employed in confined spaces, such as nuclear‐powered ships and spacecraft, its size should be given priority. To estimate the component size, the one‐dimensional heat exchanger model developed in this study is used in a recompression supercritical CO2 cycle integrated on a small‐scale lead‐cooled fast reactor. A parameter analysis was performed to study the influence of several key parameters on the levelized cost of electricity, thermal efficiency, and system size. Moreover, four types of multi‐objective optimizations were conducted to provide optimization schemes for different scenarios. Results indicated that the increased turbine inlet temperature improved the thermoeconomic but augmented the system volume. The size of the low‐temperature recuperator was observably enlarged near the optimal flow split ratio, thereby increasing the system volume. Pareto optimal solution of bi‐objective optimization based on the levelized cost of electricity and system size reached the lowest system volume of 3.71 m3. Additionally, the best trade‐off result of three‐objective optimization was a thermal efficiency of 42.14%, a levelized cost of electricity of 56.30 $∙MWh−1, and a system volume of 4.43 m3. Meanwhile, maximal and minimal pressure drops of CO2 appeared in the cooler and intermediate heat exchanger, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Yadong Du"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Leilei Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical and Equipment Engineering Hebei University of Engineering  Handan China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhiyi Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Hanzhi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yanzhao Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechatronic Information Weifang University of Science and Technology  Shouguang China""]}, {""name"": ""Ce Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.3390/su13042306"", ""10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105398"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.119592"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.12.182"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2017.11.015"", ""10.1016/0013-7480(68)90105-8"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110851"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.145"", ""10.1002/er.7825"", ""10.1002/er.7503"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.130"", ""10.1002/er.6481"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.099"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112649"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.155"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.11.055"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.135"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2021.113910"", ""10.1016/j.egyr.2021.11.258"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.117645"", ""10.2514/6.2020-1154"", ""10.1155/2019/4973120"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115758"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113375"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2013.12.039"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.082"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.06.093"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114299"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115611"", ""10.1115/1.3241788"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.117318"", ""10.1002/er.5932"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120720"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120443"", ""10.1016/j.fusengdes.2014.04.039"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2015.03.021"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2015.02.045"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2005.03.016"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.05.038"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114811"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.02.036"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.035"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2009.04.015"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.122306"", ""10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2004.04.018""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

Il s’agit du début d’un processus de plusieurs années qui nécessite une collaboration ouverte et transparente avec les organismes et les personnes du monde entier. Bien que le système soit robuste et efficace, il convient de l’adapter à l’évolution des connaissances scientifiques et de la société afin de demeurer adapté aux besoins. Le présent document vise à encourager les discussions sur les domaines du système qui pourraient bénéficier le plus d’un examen, et à engager des initiatives de collaboration. Le renforcement de la clarté et de la cohérence constitue une priorité. Plus le degré de compréhension du système est élevé, plus il est possible de l’appliquer efficacement, ce qui se traduit par une amélioration de la protection et une harmonisation accrue. De nombreux domaines pourraient faire l’objet d’un examen, notamment : la classification des effets, avec un accent particulier sur les réactions tissulaires ; la reformulation du détriment radiologique, qui pourrait inclure les maladies non cancéreuses ; la réévaluation de la relation entre le détriment et la dose efficace, et la possibilité de définir des détriments pour les hommes et les femmes et différentes classes d’âge ; la variation de la réponse individuelle à l’exposition aux rayonnements ; les effets héréditaires ; les effets et risques pour le biote non humain et les écosystèmes. Certains des concepts de base sont également examinés, notamment le cadre permettant de réunir la protection des personnes et de l’environnement, les améliorations progressives des principes fondamentaux de justification et d’optimisation, une approche plus large de la protection des personnes et la clarification des situations d’exposition introduites en 2007. En outre, la CIPR envisage de déterminer dans quels cas l’incorporation explicite des fondements éthiques dans le système présenterait un avantage, comment mieux refléter l’importance des échanges et de l’implication des parties prenantes, et de donner des conseils supplémentaires sur l’éducation et la formation. La CIPR invite à répondre à ces questions et à d’autres liées à l’examen du système de radioprotection.","[{""name"": ""C. Clement"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W.

10.1038/s41598-020-70537-6,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,Detecting shielded explosives by coupling prompt gamma neutron activation analysis and deep neural networks,"AbstractPrompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis is a nuclear-based technique that can be used in explosives detection. It relies on bombarding unknown samples with neutrons emitted from a neutron source. These neutrons interact with the sample nuclei emitting the gamma spectrum with peaks at specific energies, which are considered a fingerprint for the sample composition. Analyzing these peaks heights will give information about the unknown sample material composition. Shielding the sample from gamma rays or neutrons will affect the gamma spectrum obtained to be analyzed, providing a false indication about the sample constituents, especially when the shield is unknown. Here we show how using deep neural networks can solve the shielding drawback associated with the prompt gamma neutron activation analysis technique in explosives detection. We found that the introduced end-to-end framework was capable of differentiating between explosive and non-explosive hydrocarbons with accuracy of 95% for the previously included explosives in the model development data set. It was also, capable of generalizing with accuracy 80% over the explosives which were not included in the model development data set. Our results show that coupling prompt gamma neutron activation analysis with deep neural networks has a good potential for high accuracy explosives detection regardless of the shield presence.","[{""name"": ""K.

By calcination at 500°C, nickel‐iron‐aluminum hydrotalcite is decomposed into Ni(Fe,Al)O solid solution; upon reduction at 800°C, Ni‐Fe alloy with uniform composition and the average size of 9.4 to 10.3 nm is formed. The Ni‐Fe/Al2O3 alloy catalysts exhibit higher catalytic life and carbon yield than the Ni3Al counterpart, with the optimal alloy composition being Ni: Fe = 4:1. Carbon nanotubes are produced on all catalysts, and the average carbon diameter is decreased to a certain degree by Ni‐Fe alloying. XRD indicates that Ni‐Fe alloy is less sintered than Ni metal under the reaction atmosphere, which may account for the decrease in the carbon diameter. This study provides a way for the preparation of a uniform Ni‐Fe alloy catalyst and its sintering resistance is helpful for controlling the carbon morphology.","[{""name"": ""Peng Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, College of Chemical Engineering Fuzhou University  Fuzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Hong Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, College of Chemical Engineering Fuzhou University  Fuzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Min Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, College of Chemical Engineering Fuzhou University  Fuzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Chunsheng Wan"", ""affiliation"": [""National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, College of Chemical Engineering Fuzhou University  Fuzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Dalin Li"", ""affiliation"": [""National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, College of Chemical Engineering Fuzhou University  Fuzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Lilong Jiang"", ""affiliation"": [""National Engineering Research Center of Chemical Fertilizer Catalyst, College of Chemical Engineering Fuzhou University  Fuzhou China""]}]","[""10.1021/cr0501994"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.071"", ""10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-092220-010254"", ""10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00233-X"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2006.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2020.10.049"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.110465"", ""10.1016/j.cattod.2010.12.042"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.052"", ""10.1002/er.6541"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.100"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.185"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.06.090"", ""10.1039/D1CY00287B"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2020.117967"", ""10.1021/acs.iecr.0c06355"", ""10.1002/er.5975"", ""10.1002/er.7084"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.065"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.03.160"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.053"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.230"", ""10.3390/catal8080300"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.272"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.01.074"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.11.209"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.05.044"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.12.151"", ""10.1039/C6RA14660K"", ""10.1016/S0926-860X(03)00080-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.10.071"", ""10.1016/0920-5861(91)80068-K"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.141"", ""10.1107/S0567739476001551"", ""10.1016/j.jcat.2008.07.012"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2012.10.035"", ""10.1021/ja00084a011"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.160"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2014.10.077"", ""10.1016/j.arabjc.2016.06.012"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.12.127"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2005.11.013"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.055"", ""10.1016/0926-860X(96)00026-9"", ""10.1021/ef8003976"", ""10.1021/jp040496x"", ""10.1016/j.molcata.2004.06.015"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2014.08.038"", ""10.1070/RC2000v069n07ABEH000540"", ""10.1021/jacs.6b11487"", ""10.1006/jcat.1997.1634"", ""10.1016/0021-9517(89)90006-7"", ""10.1039/a902281c"", ""10.1023/A:1019079929435""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Catalysis', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7169), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7168)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

The latter is subject to large uncertainties coming from, in particular, meteorological and release data. In WP1, several case studies were identified, including hypothetical accident scenarios in Europe and the Fukushima accident, for which participants propagated input uncertainties through their atmospheric dispersion and subsequent dose models. This resulted in several ensembles of results (consisting of tens to hundreds of simulations) that were compared to each other and to radiological observations (in the Fukushima case). These ensembles were analysed in order to answer questions such as: among meteorology, source term and model-related uncertainties, which are the predominant ones? Are uncertainty assessments very different between the participants and can this inter-ensemble variability be explained? What are the optimal ways of characterizing and presenting the uncertainties? Is the ensemble modelling sufficient to encompass the observations, or are there sources of uncertainty not (sufficiently) taken into account? This paper describes the case studies of WP1 and presents some illustrations of the results, with a summary of the main findings.","[{""name"": ""I.

10.1002/er.8132,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Techno-economic feasibility of hydrogen based electric vehicle charging station: A case study,"SummaryDelhi has been experiencing a dramatic surge in pollution levels, especially in the past decade. Renewable energy sources emit negligible carbon pollutants compared to conventional energy sources. However, they are fundamentally intermittent, necessitating a robust storage system. In recent times, hybrid systems have proven to be breakthrough solutions for mitigating electrical energy shortages while also enhancing overall system dependability. This study focuses on hydrogen energy storage which can help overcome variable output power issues for an electric vehicle charging station in Karampura, Delhi. The framework is proposed for three vehicles charging simultaneously, all the while at the charging station, with normal energy utilization of 2100 kWh/day. The most optimum system is found by simulating results from three different combinations (namely photovoltaic [PV]‐Hydrogen, Wind‐Hydrogen, and PV‐Wind‐Hydrogen) using HOMER software. The Levelized cost for the Hybrid combination is most viable, whereas the Wind system costs 7.19% more and the PV combination costs 12.12% higher. In a similar manner, the net present cost (NPC) of a solar PV system and a wind turbine system is $1.80 million and $1.63 million, respectively, whereas the NPC of a hybrid system is $1.52 million. The cost of operating a PV solar system is $79 767, a wind turbine system is $46 078, and a hybrid system is $35 926. These findings suggest that a hydrogen‐based hybrid renewable energy system is an economically feasible combination.","[{""name"": ""Arsalan Syed Mohammed"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Delhi Technological University  New Delhi India""]}, {""name"": ""Anuj"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Delhi Technological University  New Delhi India""]}, {""name"": ""Aditya Shyam Lodhi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Delhi Technological University  New Delhi India""]}, {""name"": ""Qasim Murtaza"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Delhi Technological University  New Delhi India""]}]","[""10.3390/su13063430"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2013.01.041"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2005.12.023"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.12.221"", ""10.1016/s0360‐3199(01)00119‐7"", ""10.9790/1676‐1052116125.2278e1676"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.11.038"", ""10.1021/ef5007808"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.12.226"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.082"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.038"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.157"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.10.147"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.04.088"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.036"", ""10.1002/er.7688"", ""10.3384/ecp110571158"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2013.02.004"", ""10.1109/ICAEE.2017.8255397"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.03.085"", ""10.1109/ICGE.2014.6835408"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2021.04.461"", ""10.1016/s0031‐9422(00)82398‐5"", ""10.1016/j.est.2021.102748"", ""10.1007/s11708‐021‐0748‐x"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2015.07.051"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.084"", ""10.1109/IRANIANCEE.2010.5506962"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.10.136"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2013.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2016.07.009"", ""10.1007/s10668‐019‐00583‐2"", ""10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848731"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/202018102004"", ""10.1002/er.4343"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2005.12.009""]","['Engineering', 'Energy', 'Environmental Science']","['Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Pollution', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Three different options were available for the school to choose from. However, most schools have opted for option A which states that the classes are organized face-to-face but various safety measures must be ensured. Each class or group is equated to a closed set where there are no distance requirements. In turn, the distance between the classes must be observed. This means that students stay in the same class all day and are accompanied by teachers of the respective classes. This can lead to improper ventilation as for most of the schools in Latvia it is organized through the opening of windows. To test this, measurements of CO2 concentration were done in a classroom Secondary School in Daugavpils. The results showed that the CO2 concentration was very high and often reached and exceeded the maximum measuring capacity of the device - 4000 ppm. It indicates that following the special safety procedures cause a negative effect on IAQ as the classrooms are not properly ventilated. This can lead to a drop in the performance of pupils as well as stimulate the transmission of other infectious diseases. Further measurements are necessary to gather data from different schools and best practices must be found.","[{""name"": ""Jurgis Zemitis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raimonds Bogdanovics"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Snezana Bogdanovica"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3846/13923730.2006.9636388"", ""10.5593/sgem2012/s22.v4020"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.080"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.06.020"", ""10.1016/j.envint.2016.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.09.037"", ""10.1111/ina.12403"", ""10.1080/00038628.2017.1416576"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100827"", ""10.3390/buildings9050110"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.001"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.633-634.991"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2016.11.033"", ""10.3390/buildings9090197"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.048"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00320.x"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.10.007"", ""10.1289/ehp.1104789"", ""10.3390/en13226099"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00251.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijheh.2014.03.002"", ""10.1080/10937404.2013.853609""]","['Medicine', 'Environmental Science', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7106), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7025)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

Employing renewable, environment friendly and naturally available biomass feedstock as precursor for producing carbon materials is a low‐cost and sustainable way for designing the electrodes of supercapacitors. In the present study, high surface area hierarchical porous multilayered graphene‐like carbon is obtained via room temperature sono‐exfoliation of the activated carbon synthesized via simple and environmentally friendly hydrothermal carbonization and potassium bicarbonate activation of waste hazelnut shells as the precursor. The high surface area graphene‐like carbon showed excellent electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 320.9 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 current density and exceptional capacitance retention of 77.8% at 2 A g−1 current density after 10 000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, flexible supercapacitors fabricated using sono‐exfoliated graphene‐like activated carbon coated stainless steel mesh electrodes and biopolymer gel electrolyte exhibits an outstanding energy density of 38.7 W h kg−1 and power density of 198.4 W kg−1. These results show that mechanically exfoliated graphene‐like activated carbon derived from hazelnut shells exhibit superior electrochemical performance that can compete with other activated carbon materials used in energy storage devices for real time applications.","[{""name"": ""Kiran Kumar Reddy Reddygunta"", ""affiliation"": [""Smart Materials Research and Device Technology (SMaRDT) Group,

Hydraulic retention time (HRT) was varied from 1 to 12 hours, and the microbial communities were analyzed. The major hydrogen‐producing bacterium was Clostridium chromiireducens, which was enriched up to 82% of the total bacteria with a 2 hour HRT, while Enterobacter cloacae was also observed in the range of 0.2% to 34.4% of total bacteria. When the level of the substrate in the reactor was low (&lt;0.5 g/L), BHP dropped dramatically, and Sporolactobacillus putidus increased to 8.8% of the total bacteria. Differences in substrate affinity between S. putidus and C. chromiireducens likely promoted the dominance of S. putidus, which is more favorable for growth and metabolism at low substrate concentrations, and caused changes in the microbial community.","[{""name"": ""Do‐Hyung Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Green and Sustainable Materials R&amp;D Department Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH)  Cheonan‐si Republic of Korea"", ""School of Civil and Environmental Engineering Yonsei University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Jeong‐Hoon Park"", ""affiliation"": [""Sustainable Technology and Wellness R&amp;D Group Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH)  Jeju‐si Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sang‐Hyoun Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil and Environmental Engineering Yonsei University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Gopalakrishnan Kumar"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil and Environmental Engineering Yonsei University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Byung‐Don Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Chemical and Environmental Process JEONJIN ENTECH LTD.

10.1002/er.8046,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Metal-organic frameworks and their derivatives as anode material in lithium-ion batteries: Recent advances towards novel configurations,"SummaryLithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) have drawn extensive research interests due to their noticeably enhanced gravimetric energy density relative to other chemical batteries. The potential utility of metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives has recently been recognized as highly effective anode components for LIBs because they can be tuned to select specific metal sites and/or to adjust pore sizes. In this work, their electrochemical performance as anodic materials is carefully evaluated with respect to lithium‐ions storage capacity, energy/power, stability, and flexibility. Furthermore, through the coordination of the organic linker and metal center, MOFs can benefit from enhanced catalytic activities in the design of advanced LIBs. For future research for next‐generation LIBs, scientific focus should be placed on the development of diverse features of MOF‐based composites such as core‐shell MOFs, mono/bi‐metal doped MOFs, dual organic linker‐based MOFs, MOFs@MOFs core shell structure, and dual organic ligands‐based MOF. As such, MOF‐based LIB electrode materials are expected to expand their utility with the improvement in topology and functionality in association with the dimensionality, pore size, and surface area.","[{""name"": ""Rajnish Kaur"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Panjab University (PU)  Chandigarh India""]}, {""name"": ""Varun A.

The HPRL is application-driven and the requests are submitted by nuclear data users or representatives of the user’s communities. A panel of international experts reviews and monitors the requests in the framework of an Expert Group mandated by the NEA Nuclear Science Committee Working Party on International Nuclear Data Evaluation Cooperation (WPEC). After approval, individual requests are classified to three categories: high priority requests, general requests, and special purpose requests (e.g., dosimetry, standards). The HPRL is hosted by the NEA in the form of a relational database publicly available on the web. This paper provides an overview of HPRL entries, status and outlook. Examples of requests successfully completed are given and new requests are described with emphasis on updated nuclear data needs in the fields of nuclear energy, neutron standards and dosimetry.","[{""name"": ""E.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the radiation doses received by patients for the most common adult CT examinations in order to establish local diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). Data from 1016 adult patients were collected during 3 months from four Moroccan hospitals. Dose length product (DLP) and volumetric computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol) were evaluated by determining the 75th percentile as diagnostic reference levels for the most common examinations including head, chest and abdomen. The DRL for each examination was compared with other studies. The established DRLs in Morocco in terms of CTDIvol were 57.4, 12.3 and 10.9 for CT examinations of the head, chest, abdomen, respectively. For DLP, they were 1020, 632 and 714, respectively. These established DRLs for CTDIvol were almost similar to the UK DRLs at all examinations, higher than the Egyptian DRLs and lower than the Japanese DRLs at the head CT examination, lower than the DRLs from Egypt and Japan at the CT abdomen examination. In terms of DLP, the DRLs were higher than those of the British studies, lower than those of the Egyptian and Japanese studies at the head CT examination were higher at chest CT and lower at abdominal CT than those of all selected studies. The higher level of established DRLs in our study demonstrates the requirement of an optimization process while keeping a good image quality for a reliable diagnosis.","[{""name"": ""M.

Hereby, the typical equilibrium electron beam parameters corresponding to the proposed two baseline operation modes in the baseline design of HEPS are presented. Methods To compute the equilibrium parameters of the electron beam, the lattice parameters, RF parameters, and the parameters of the insertion devices (IDs) were determined first. Furthermore, it is more precise to use the full-current electron beam parameters in the estimations of the performance of the synchrotron light. Therefore, not only the single-particle dynamics but also the current-dependent collective effects need to be considered in the computations of the full-current, equilibrium parameters of the electron beam. Both analytic computations and multi-particle tracking simulations were carried out. Results The full-current, equilibrium parameters of the electron beams in the HEPS storage ring are presented in this paper. Moreover, the main beam parameters in the injector (the booster and the LINAC), corresponding to the two baseline operation modes of the storage ring, are also presented. Conclusion The typical electron beam parameters corresponding to the two baseline operation modes are given in detail in this paper.","[{""name"": ""Haisheng Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cai Meng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuemei Peng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saike Tian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Na Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaohao Cui"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chongchong Du"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhe Duan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuanyuan Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ping He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiyang Huang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daheng Ji"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hongfei Ji"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yi Jiao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jingyi Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nan Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaoyu Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaohan Lu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pengfei Liang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Weimin Pan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Huamin Qu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bin Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jiuqing Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuanyuan Wei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jinyu Wan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gang Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fang Yan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chenghui Yu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sen Yue"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yaliang Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1107/S1600577518012110"", ""10.1007/s41605-020-00205-w"", ""10.1007/s41605-020-00202-z"", ""10.1007/s41605-020-00209-6"", ""10.1007/s41605-020-00189-7"", ""10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2021-MOPAB380"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2020.164639"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2021.165579"", ""10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.24.034401"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00974-z"", ""10.1107/S1600577514015215"", ""10.1063/1.5119093"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00926-7"", ""10.2172/761286"", ""10.1063/1.2409141""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Radiation', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

These Micro‐PCMs capsules comprise of a renewable material, caprylic acid (CA), as core latent heat storage material, confined inside the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) shells and are produced by the suspension‐like polymerization method. The prepared Micro‐PCMs are characterized by FTIR, SEM, and Particle Size Analyzer. The phase change properties, including melting and crystallization temperatures, and latent heats associated during phase change are determined by DSC and are reported as 14.3 ± 0.2°C, 9.7 ± 0.4°C, and 98.7 ± 1.5 J/g, 99.0 ± 1.7 J/g, respectively. The TGA results indicated that the synthesized Micro‐PCMs exhibit a two‐step degradation pattern and have good thermal stability. The T‐History test is carried out to study the thermal energy storage/release time of the Micro‐PCMs. Thermal cycling test has been performed to check the thermal reliability of the microcapsules. The synthesized Micro‐PCMs are good contenders for latent heat absorption and can play a vital role in the area of thermal energy storage (TES) applications, such as passive space heating or cooling applications, smart textiles, and thermo‐responsive functional coatings.","[{""name"": ""Surya Tanwar"", ""affiliation"": [""Discipline of Polymer Science and Chemical Technology, Department of Applied Chemistry Delhi Technological University (Formerly Delhi College of Engineering)  Delhi India""]}, {""name"": ""Raminder Kaur"", ""affiliation"": [""Discipline of Polymer Science and Chemical Technology, Department of Applied Chemistry Delhi Technological University (Formerly Delhi College of Engineering)  Delhi India""]}]","[""10.1016/j.solmat.2017.07.023"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.03.038"", ""10.1016/j.tca.2014.04.023"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.096"", ""10.1002/pen.25001"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.136"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.tca.2011.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.powtec.2017.02.035"", ""10.1016/j.powtec.2016.02.007"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2013.09.028"", ""10.1016/j.tca.2017.07.006"", ""10.1007/s00396-009-2115-z"", ""10.1016/j.polymer.2008.04.030"", ""10.1016/j.tca.2016.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.174"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2016.10.011"", ""10.1002/pen.25064"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2012.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2017.09.074"", ""10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2017.05.027"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2013.09.035"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2014.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.06.022"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2014.08.036"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2016.09.020"", ""10.1016/j.jpcs.2017.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2010.07.047"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.03.063"", ""10.1002/er.4578"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.03.056"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2010.12.022"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2017.04.014"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2010.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2009.12.013"", ""10.1021/ie101727b""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Mechanical Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

A good warehouse management system boosts warehousing eco-friendliest by reducing space waste and unnecessary number of material movements, to ensure continuous fast materials flow and to keep the heating and cooling costs to a minimum. All this may happen on some lengths inside the traditional manual warehousing scenes, but in fact, if the highest level of efficiency is wanted/needed, the operator shall need to automate, digitalize and robotize their operations. Authors presents an example of automation in the warehousing context, where the warehouse operator is capable of turning around an order line as an outgoing packet, even in high peak load times under 3h time period. This sort of efficiency means less needed storage space as items stay less time in the warehouse and such automatization also gives the 3PLs possibility to store materials in high rising automated systems like automated storage and retrieval systems to optimize their space usage. All combined, the future warehouse operations can make a positive impact on efforts to reduce overall CO₂emissions made by supply chains.","[{""name"": ""Daria Minashkina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ari Happonen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1504/IJSCIM.2020.10028997"", ""10.1108/JMTM-09-2017-0188"", ""10.1108/IJPDLM-02-2019-0064"", ""10.1007/s11625-018-0627-5"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2977779"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-2274-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-22044-4"", ""10.1109/SOFTCOM.2008.4669486"", ""10.1145/1750405.1750415"", ""10.24251/HICSS.2019.933"", ""10.1145/3194779.3194783"", ""10.1063/5.0001883"", ""10.1504/IJSEAM.2019.108467"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95711-1_33"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/202015806002"", ""10.5402/2011/615934"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-27064-7_35""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

Our calculations show that both CoFeYGe (Y = Ti, Cr) alloys have a Type‐I atomic configuration. CoFeCrGe and CoFeTiGe compounds with band gaps of 0.640 eV and 0.489 eV, respectively, were found to display half‐metallic behavior in the minority spin channels. The total magnetic moment of CoFeCrGe was 3.00 μB, while CoFeTiGe's was 1.00 μB. CoFeTiGe and CoFeCrGe are both mechanically stable in the Y‐Type‐I structure. The surface of E is entirely distorted, demonstrating substantial anisotropy for two compounds. They have a higher anisotropic Young's modulus in the (XY), (XZ), and (YZ) planes. At 900 K, ZT is 0.31706 (0.45308) for CoFeTiGe (CoFeCrGe), corresponding to a carrier concentration of n0 = 20.4581 × 1021 cm−3 (64.5856 × 1021) cm−3. Two ways exist to enhance ZT values of CoFeTiGe and CoFeCrGe to 0.4032 and 0.64149, respectively: A charge carrier concentration of 17.392 × 1021 cm−3 for CoFeTiGe and 59.503 × 1021 cm−3 for CoFeCrGe is obtained. The second similar result is obtained by raising the chemical potential of CoFeTiGe and CoFeCrGe by 0.068 and 0.980 Ryd, respectively. To our knowledge, CoFeCrGe and CoFeTiGe exhibit exceptional spintronic and thermoelectric properties.","[{""name"": ""Zoulikha Charifi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science University of M'sila  M'sila Algeria"", ""Laboratory of Physics and Chemistry of Materials University of M'sila  M'sila Algeria""]}, {""name"": ""Torkia Ghellab"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science University of M'sila  M'sila Algeria"", ""Laboratory of Physics and Chemistry of Materials University of M'sila  M'sila Algeria""]}, {""name"": ""Hakim Baaziz"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics, Faculty of Science University of M'sila  M'sila Algeria"", ""Laboratory of Physics and Chemistry of Materials University of M'sila  M'sila Algeria""]}, {""name"": ""Fethi Soyalp"", ""affiliation"": [""Theoretical Physics Research Laboratory, Department of Mathematics and Science, Faculty of Education Yuzuncu Yil University  Kampus, Tusba, Van Turkey""]}]","[""10.1038/s41598-017-01782-5"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.046602"", ""10.1007/s11664-018-6833-1"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-04958-3"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-08223-5"", ""10.12693/APhysPolA.136.127"", ""10.1007/s10948-017-4530-6"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.83.184428"", ""10.1016/j.mattod.2013.09.015"", ""10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.06.048"", ""10.1016/j.ijleo.2011.12.052"", ""10.1016/j.cjph.2018.01.015"", ""10.1007/s10948-017-4206-2"", ""10.1007/s10948-016-3390-9"", ""10.1016/j.progsolidstchem.2011.02.001"", ""10.1063/1.3062812"", ""10.1007/s10948-015-3277-1"", ""10.1002/pssb.201900039"", ""10.1016/j.chemphys.2019.04.009"", ""10.1063/1.4959093"", ""10.1063/1.4805063"", ""10.1016/j.cocom.2018.03.006"", ""10.1088/1361-648X/ab5321"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.08.150"", ""10.1016/j.rinp.2017.06.047"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.84.224416"", ""10.1080/09500839.2014.970239"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.94.184102"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.92.224413"", ""10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.05.029"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.07.165"", ""10.1016/j.jpcs.2017.09.023"", ""10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.10.081"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.74.115115"", ""10.1103/PhysRev.136.B864"", ""10.1088/0022-3719/10/16/019"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865"", ""10.1016/j.cpc.2006.03.007"", ""10.1073/pnas.30.9.244"", ""10.1016/j.jmmm.2015.01.073"", ""10.1002/zamm.19290090104"", ""10.1088/0370-1298/65/5/307"", ""10.1038/nmat3134"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.06.104"", ""10.1016/j.cjph.2017.08.002"", ""10.1080/14786440808520496"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1427"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.93.245202"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.136601"", ""10.1088/2053-1591/aaabcd"", ""10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.04.048"", ""10.1038/nature09996"", ""10.1179/095066003225010182"", ""10.1021/nl202439h"", ""10.1038/srep09567"", ""10.1016/j.jmmm.2017.04.012"", ""10.1063/1.363405"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.51.9622"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.77.125209"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.86.155201"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.82.035204"", ""10.1016/j.commatsci.2012.03.039"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.68.085201"", ""10.1002/adfm.200701369"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.11.022"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.92.115202"", ""10.1073/pnas.93.15.7436""]",['Materials Science'],"['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"
10.1002/er.6988,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Capping agent-free synthesis of surface engineered Pt nanocube for direct ammonia fuel cell,"SummaryDirect ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs), wherein the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) occurs at the anode and oxygen reduction at the cathode, are a promising clean energy production system using easily liquefied ammonia because they exhibit high energy density. However, only a few catalysts are, thus far, available for the AOR because of its sluggish six‐electron‐based reaction kinetics. Pt (100) is considered an optimal catalyst for the AOR; however, the synthesis of pristine Pt (100) is difficult because it requires the use of strong capping agents for faceting particles. Moreover, the capping agents block surface active sites, thereby deaccelerating electrochemical reactions. Herein, we report a novel synthetic method (hot separation) to achieve pristine Pt (100) by precisely controlling the formation kinetics of Pt nanocubes, wherein the further treatment for surface capping agent removal is not required. Hot separation prevents particle aggregation and overgrowth through the rapid separation of the Pt nanocubes and reaction solution and preserves the Pt (100) surface. Furthermore, the characterization of the pristine surface of Pt nanocubes was conducted to compare the properties of the Pt nanocubes with those of the particles prepared from conventional methods. The Pt nanocubes showed better mass activity toward the AOR and 2.3 times higher DAFC performance than those of commercial Pt.","[{""name"": ""Haneul Jin"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Hydrogen·Fuel Cell Research Korea Institute of Science and Technology  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sehyun Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Hydrogen·Fuel Cell Research Korea Institute of Science and Technology  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yeonsun Sohn"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering, School of Semiconductor and Chemical Engineering, Solar Energy Research Center Jeonbuk National University  Jeonju Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Soo‐Hyoung Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering, School of Semiconductor and Chemical Engineering, Solar Energy Research Center Jeonbuk National University  Jeonju Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Pil Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering, School of Semiconductor and Chemical Engineering, Solar Energy Research Center Jeonbuk National University  Jeonju Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sung Jong Yoo"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Hydrogen·Fuel Cell Research Korea Institute of Science and Technology  Seoul Republic of Korea"", ""Division of Energy &amp; Environment Technology KIST School, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon  Republic of Korea"", ""KHU‐KIST Department of Converging Science and Technology Kyung Hee University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1016/j.pecs.2018.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.coelec.2018.03.011"", ""10.1149/2.0431815jes"", ""10.1149/2.0191815jes"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2017.07.088"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.01.120"", ""10.1039/C2TA00607C"", ""10.1021/jp512981f"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.118821"", ""10.1021/acs.iecr.9b01471"", ""10.1016/j.jcat.2017.12.028"", ""10.1021/jp4048874"", ""10.1039/b601306f"", ""10.1021/jp051682l"", ""10.1021/jp0471453"", ""10.1021/acscatal.7b02942"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2016.12.017"", ""10.1002/celc.201600844"", ""10.1007/s40843-014-0010-5"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.053"", ""10.1149/2.1051709jes"", ""10.1039/C6TA02284G"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2014.11.015"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2015.02.021"", ""10.1002/celc.201600701"", ""10.1021/acscatal.9b04670"", ""10.1039/D0CS00415D"", ""10.1016/j.matt.2020.01.001"", ""10.1002/aenm.202003188"", ""10.1039/C8CS00336J"", ""10.1002/anie.202006011"", ""10.1016/j.coelec.2016.12.007"", ""10.1039/C4TA05250A"", ""10.1021/cs300219j"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.114287"", ""10.1039/c2cc16962b"", ""10.1039/c2cc17984a"", ""10.1002/adfm.200801439"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2013.11.019"", ""10.1039/C6RA17561A"", ""10.1021/cr400544s"", ""10.1002/adfm.200801566"", ""10.1016/j.susc.2019.05.002"", ""10.1038/sdata.2016.80"", ""10.1021/acsomega.8b03366"", ""10.1021/nl3032795"", ""10.1016/j.jcat.2019.09.020"", ""10.1088/0957-4484/20/44/445102"", ""10.1021/jp063338"", ""10.1039/C9NA00186G"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-06812-w"", ""10.1039/c3ta13641h"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.09.135"", ""10.1039/D0EE03351K"", ""10.1149/1945-7111/abbdd1""]","['Engineering', 'Energy', 'Materials Science']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1002/er.6446,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Candlenut oil: review on oil properties and future liquid biofuel prospects,"SummaryThe rapid depletion of diesel fuel, increasing energy demand, and environmental pollution concerns are increasing worldwide interest in the production of liquid biofuels. Biofuel (bio‐aviation and biodiesel) is a potential and plausible alternative to diesel fuel to substantially mitigate the environmental impact of future energy demand. Non‐edible crop oil is viewed as a potential feedstock for liquid biofuel production owing to the massive demand for edible oil as a food source. However, the major limitation of utilizing non‐edible crop oil for biodiesel production is the cost due to the high price of feedstocks and the limited supply of large‐scale biodiesel production. Candlenut trees can grow in harsh and arid climates due to low moisture requirements. Therefore, candlenut can be cultivated in the most unused lands, particularly in developing countries along coasts and riverbanks and in deserts and other wastelands unsuitable for edible crops. Additionally, candlenut seed contains a high amount of oil (30%‐60%). Thus, candlenut oil is a promising source for commercial biodiesel production. The present study was conducted to review the possibilities and challenges of utilizing candlenut as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. Additionally, several important aspects related to candlenut oil processing, such as extraction technology, physicochemical properties, biodiesel production technologies, and advantages and limitations of candlenut biodiesel production are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Marwan Abdulhakim Shaah"", ""affiliation"": [""Environmental Technology Division, School of Industrial Technology

The synthesized catalysts are being characterized through several analytical techniques such as X‐ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature‐programmed desorption (TPD) and Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller (BET) to examine its suitability for biodiesel production. The biodiesel production process was optimized and optimum yield obtained was 97.8% using a set of optimum conditions such as methanol‐to‐oil molar ratio of 12, the processing time of 120 minutes, process temperature of 65°C and with catalyst loading of 4.5 wt%. Moreover, catalyst reusability was determined and it was found to be highly suitable for reuse with minimum loss of its activity.

In this paper, a novel liquid‐cooling BTMS with a thin plate and a slender tube is proposed for prismatic batteries, four different cooling structures of the tube are designed to achieve a high temperature uniformity, and a three‐dimensional numerical model is established. The effects of different cooling structures, battery discharge rates, coolant inlet velocities and inner diameters of the slender tube on the thermal performance are investigated. The results indicate that design S3, for which the length of the effective heat transfer tube distributed by each battery increases gradually along the flow direction of the coolant, exhibits the best thermal management performance among the four designed cooling structures, especially in terms of the temperature uniformity. When the inner diameter of the slender tube is 2 mm and the inlet velocity is not less than 0.5 m/s, the maximum temperature difference between the batteries is reduced to 4.23°C at a 2C discharge rate. This study can provide guidance for the structural design of BTMSs for prismatic batteries.","[{""name"": ""Zhiguo Tang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Hefei University of Technology  Hefei China""]}, {""name"": ""Jie Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Hefei University of Technology  Hefei China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhiqing Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Hefei University of Technology  Hefei China""]}, {""name"": ""Jianping Cheng"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Hefei University of Technology  Hefei China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.12.020"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.918"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.101155"", ""10.1002/er.3212"", ""10.1109/SEMI-THERM.2015.7100176"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2019.01.771"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00200-8"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(99)00125-1"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114648"", ""10.1007/s11630-017-0955-2"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.12.064"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.025"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.101017"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.118581"", ""10.1002/er.1956"", ""10.1002/est2.137"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.024"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.169"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.08.063"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.090"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.12.115"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101377"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114787"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114421"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112280"", ""10.1002/er.5089"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EY.1943-7897.0000648"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.049"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.02.070"", ""10.1002/er.3801"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115509"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115331"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115007""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1002/er.6926,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,The effect of plasma treated carbon felt on the performance of aqueous quinone-based redox flow batteries,"Summary4,5‐dihydroxybenzene‐1,3‐disulfonic acid (Tiron) and anthraquinone‐2,7‐disulfonic acid (AQDS) are interesting redox couples for aqueous quinone‐based redox flow batteries (QRFBs) because of their high solubility and good reaction reversibility in acidic condition. Tiron is rate‐determining material due to its slow reaction kinetics. To improve that, Tiron is transformed into 2,4,5,6‐tetrahydroxybenzene‐1,3‐disulfonic acid (TironA), which is effectively formed during the first cycle of QRFB. Once TironA is formed, a desirable two‐electron redox reaction with stable and reproducible charge and discharge step of QRFB occurs, although the electron transfer of TironA is still lower than that of AQDS. To further facilitate that of TironA, oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) plasma‐treated carbon felt (CF) electrodes are suggested. Oxygen functional groups formed onto CF by O2 plasma become the active sites for redox reaction of TironA. As the amount of oxygen functional groups formed increases, the redox reactivity of TironA is enhanced. In contrast, when N2 plasma is used, pyrrolic N and quaternary N are mainly formed. With the formation, (i) hydrogen atoms within pyrrolic N act as proton donor and interact with oxygen groups of TironA and (ii) nitrogen cations within quaternary N interact with the negatively charged atoms of TironA by electrostatic interaction. Thus, both reaction kinetic of TironA and performance of QRFB increase. Regarding the performance of QRFB using N2 plasma‐treated CF, its energy efficiency (EE), discharging capacity, and state of charge are 62%, 17.3 Ahr·L−1 and 64.5% for 50 cycle, which correspond to excellent achievements.","[{""name"": ""Agnesia Permatasari"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Energy and Environment Seoul National University of Science and Technology  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Jeong Woo Shin"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Energy and Environment Seoul National University of Science and Technology  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Wonmi Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Energy and Environment Seoul National University of Science and Technology  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Jihwan An"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Manufacturing Systems and Design Engineering Seoul National University of Science and Technology  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yongchai Kwon"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Energy and Environment Seoul National University of Science and Technology  Seoul South Korea"", ""Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Seoul National University of Science and Technology  Seoul South Korea""]}]","[""10.1016/j.cej.2018.10.159"", ""10.1007/s10800-011-0348-2"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2020.125610"", ""10.1039/C5RA24626A"", ""10.1007/s11814-019-0374-z"", ""10.3390/en12061159"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.11.130"", ""10.1002/anie.201604925"", ""10.1038/nmat4919"", ""10.1038/s41560-018-0108-1"", ""10.1016/j.matchemphys.2019.121813"", ""10.1039/C8TA06445H"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.047"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b10952"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2014.11.056"", ""10.1088/1361-6528/aab0fb"", ""10.1039/C2TA00028H"", ""10.1039/b812769g"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.004"", ""10.14710/ijred.3.1.7-12"", ""10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b00233"", ""10.1016/j.tsf.2011.11.028"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.123085"", ""10.1149/2.1371607jes"", ""10.1149/2.0161807jes"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2009.09.031"", ""10.22180/na172"", ""10.1007/s11814-017-0213-z"", ""10.3762/bjnano.10.165"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.12.042"", ""10.1007/s11814-019-0414-8"", ""10.1007/s11814-020-0522-5"", ""10.1007/s11814-019-0320-0"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.070"", ""10.1149/1.3552663"", ""10.1021/ja910169v"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2020.12.013"", ""10.1021/la2043262"", ""10.1021/acsaem.0c00075"", ""10.1007/s11814-020-0530-5"", ""10.1007/s11814-020-0669-0"", ""10.1007/s11814-020-0559-5"", ""10.1039/C7TA06672D"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2020.125631"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227063"", ""10.1007/s11814-019-0248-4"", ""10.1149/2.0121601jes""]","['Engineering', 'Energy', 'Materials Science']","['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

10.1007/s41365-023-01189-0,NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0702 Physics,Recent progress and perspective on batteries made from nuclear waste,"AbstractSustainable energy sources are an immediate need to cope with the imminent issue of climate change the world is facing today. In particular, the long-lasting miniatured power sources that can supply energy continually to power handheld gadgets, sensors, electronic devices, unmanned airborne vehicles in space and extreme mining are some of the examples where this is an acute need. It is known from basic physics that radioactive materials decay over few years and some nuclear materials have their half-life until thousands of years. The past five decades of research have been spent harnessing the decay energy of the radioactive materials to develop batteries that can last until the radioactive reaction continues. Thus, an emergent opportunity of industrial symbiosis to make use of nuclear waste by using radioactive waste as raw material to develop batteries with long shelf life presents a great opportunity for sustainable energy resource development. However, the current canon of research on this topic is scarce. This perspective draws fresh discussions on the topic while highlighting future directions in this wealthy arena of research.

10.1007/s10894-022-00333-9,JOURNAL OF FUSION ENERGY,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,Progress of Design and Development for the ITER Radial Neutron Camera,"AbstractThe paper presents an overview of the design status of the Radial Neutron Camera (RNC), that, together with the Vertical Neutron Camera, will provide, through reconstruction techniques applied to the measured line-integrated neutron fluxes, the time resolved measurement of the ITER neutron and α-source profile (i.e. neutron emissivity, neutrons emitted per unit time and volume). The RNC is composed of two subsystems, the In-Port RNC and Ex-Port RNC located, respectively, inside and outside the Plug of Equatorial Port #01. The In-Port subsystem is in a more advanced design stage since it has recently undergone the Final Design Review in the ITER procurement process. The paper describes the diagnostic layout, the interfaces, the measurement capabilities and the main challenges in its realization. Prototyping and testing of neutron detectors and electronics components were carried out and led to the choice of the component solutions that can match the environmental and operational constraints in terms radiation hardness, high temperature and electromagnetic compatibility. The performance of the RNC in terms of neutron emissivity measurement capability was assessed through 1D and 2D reconstruction analysis. It is proven that the neutron emissivity can be reconstructed in real-time within the measurement requirements: 10% accuracy, 10 ms time resolution and a/10 (a = plasma minor radius) space resolution.","[{""name"": ""B.

In this study, Mg2NiH6 is used as an MH bed, sodium nitrate (NaNO₃) as heat storage medium (PCM), and sodium‐potassium nitrate (60% NaNO₃‐40% KNO₃) as a heat transfer fluid (HTF). A computational model for this system is developed and validated. Furthermore, the hydriding of the MH bed, the melting of NePCM, and the overall heat transfer characteristics are simulated. With this model, the effect of a few types of nanoparticle additives on the hydriding process is investigated. The nanoparticles of iron oxide (Fe2O3) and copper oxide (CuO) are dispersed at various concentrations (to a range of 0‐1.5 wt.%) in the HTF. Further, CuO and graphene nanoparticles are added to the PCM to a range of 0 to 5 wt.%. The simulation shows that a reduction of hydriding process time by 33.5% is possible by using this MH‐Nanofluid‐NePCM system in comparison with a conventional MH bed system. The use of nanoparticles in the HTF, at an optimum flow rate, did not show a significant effect on the enhancement of the hydriding process. Also, the results show that CuO‐PCM composite has a greater impact in decreasing the time of complete hydriding relative to graphene‐PCM composite.","[{""name"": ""Raja Elarem"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratory of Thermal and Energetic Systems Studies, College of Engineering of Monastir University of Monastir  Monastir Tunisia""]}, {""name"": ""Talal Alqahtani"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department, College of Engineering King Khalid University  Abha Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Sofiene Mellouli"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department, College of Engineering Jazan University  Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Abhilash Edacherian"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department, College of Engineering King Khalid University  Abha Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Faouzi Askri"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department, College of Engineering King Khalid University  Abha Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Abdelmajid Jemni"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratory of Thermal and Energetic Systems Studies, College of Engineering of Monastir University of Monastir  Monastir Tunisia""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.10.166"", ""10.1002/er.3056"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.053"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.07.052"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.01.095"", ""10.1002/er"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.02.169"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.026"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.051"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.11.093"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.03.116"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.11.065"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.090"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.118"", ""10.1002/er.4115"", ""10.1002/er.3919"", ""10.1002/cphc.200800498"", ""10.3390/en12203949"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2014.11.022"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.126"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.026"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.11.045"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.02.073"", ""10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2013.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.03.013"", ""10.1002/est2.127"", ""10.1016/s0360-3199(96)00039-0"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.11.021"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.09.061"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.09.014"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.07.022"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.09.133"", ""10.1007/s11814-019-0282-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2012.03.052"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.07.038""]",['Engineering'],['Mechanical Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

10.1002/er.8399,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Multi-objective quantum atom search optimization algorithm for electric vehicle charging station planning,"SummaryThis paper presents an effective planning methodology for electric vehicle (EV) fast‐charging stations (CS) using a multi‐objective binary version of the atom search optimization (ASO) algorithm. The proposed method uses quantum operations to binarize the algorithm and achieve a higher convergence rate than the existing binary ASO algorithm. Additionally, a modified atom selection function is used to improve the searching capability of the ASO algorithm. Furthermore, the nondominated sorting procedure and pareto concepts are infused to solve the CS location problem (CSLP) considering the EV travel time, CS costs, and grid power loss as independent multi‐objectives. The efficacy of the proposed multi‐objective quantum ASO (MO‐QASO) algorithm is evaluated using performance metrics namely, inverted generational distance (IGD), spacing (SP), and maximum spread (MS). The MO‐QASO simulation results are compared with the results of other heuristic algorithms. MO‐QASO achieves the best IGD (0.0021), SP (0.0002), and MS (0.9982) values, verifying the convergence and diversity of the algorithm. Importantly, the best CS planning solution obtained from MO‐QASO is similar to the true solution obtained from the exhaustive search method. The MO‐QASO efficiency is further validated by solving a CSLP from literature.

This is based on a detailed assessment considering all viable HCD concepts, covering the grid to plasma efficiency, physics applications, technology maturity, integration, maintenance, and costs. Of the two microwave techniques: Electron Cyclotron (EC) and Electron Bernstein Wave (EBW), EC was deemed the lowest risk and EBW is retained as a potential path to a more efficient, higher performing device. To assess the ECCD efficiency, the GRAY beam tracing code was employed to perform detailed scans of the launcher position, toroidal and poloidal launch angle, and frequency over the first 3 cyclotron harmonics. For EBW, GENRAY/CQL3D were used to estimate the CD efficiency, demonstrating promising results. To reduce the physics uncertainties in present models for EBW coupling and current drive, MAST Upgrade will install two dual frequency (28, 34.8 GHz), 900kW, 5s gyrotrons from Kyoto Fusioneering, as part of the MAST Upgrade enhancements package. This will be accompanied by a flexible 2D steering launcher system to allow midplane coand counter-CD and above midplane launch for co-direction off-axis CD. Coupling efficiency is quantified by measuring the heating induced by reflected (i.e. non-coupled) power to a plate inserted in the reflected beam path. The experiments will also include EBW driven solenoid-free start-up, increasing power and pulse length by a factor of 10 compared to previous MAST experiments. This presentation will discuss the STEP microwave studies and the MAST Upgrade physics design and capabilities.","[{""name"": ""Simon Freethy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lorenzo Figini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Henderson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hana El-Haroun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bengt Eliason"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sam Gibson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Krassimir Kirov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alf Köhn-Seemann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ivan Konoplev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Samuli Saarelma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ridhima Sharma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Speirs"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Roddy Vann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Helen Webster"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas Wilson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.13182/FST07-A1494"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.4550"", ""10.1088/0029-5515/53/1/013011"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.265005"", ""10.1051/epjconf/202327701011"", ""10.1017/S0022377800007649"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.175004"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.075003"", ""10.1017/S0022377800001392"", ""10.1088/0029-5515/51/8/083050"", ""10.1063/1.1289689"", ""10.1063/1.5096870"", ""10.1063/1.1792635"", ""10.1063/1.1891065"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.3467"", ""10.1051/epjconf/202327701009"", ""10.1051/epjconf/202327704004"", ""10.1088/0029-5515/43/11/002"", ""10.1088/0741-3335/46/1/016"", ""10.1051/epjconf/20158702007""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7711), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7598)]]"

Here fluorine doped TiO2 nanostructures were synthesized by microwave assisted solvothermal technique. The X‐ray diffraction patterns (XRD) and Raman analysis results of the sample exhibits peaks characteristic of anatase TiO2. From the UV‐visible absorption analysis, an increase in visible light absorption with no significant change in the absorption edge was noticed. F doped TiO2 nanostructures were found to possess quasi cubic morphology through the transmission electron microscope images and from the presence of well‐defined ring pattern in selected area electron diffraction patterns the polycrystalline nature of the samples were confirmed. The presence of fluorine in the TiO2 lattice was confirmed through the presence of Ti3+ states using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis respectively. The prepared TiO2, F doped TiO2 nanostructures were coated over fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, further they were subjected to dye sensitization and were used as photoanodes in dye sensitized solar cells and their power conversion efficiencies were studied.","[{""name"": ""Venkatraman Madurai Ramakrishnan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Coimbatore Institute of Technology  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu India"", ""Department of Engineering and Sciences Western Norway University of Applied Sciences  Bergen Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Muthukumarasamy Natarajan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Coimbatore Institute of Technology  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu India""]}, {""name"": ""Selvakumar Pitchaiya"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Coimbatore Institute of Technology  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu India"", ""Department of Engineering and Sciences Western Norway University of Applied Sciences  Bergen Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Agilan Santhanam"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Coimbatore Institute of Technology  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu India""]}, {""name"": ""Dhayalan Velauthapillai"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Engineering and Sciences Western Norway University of Applied Sciences  Bergen Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Arivalagan Pugazhendhi"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Research and Development Duy Tan University  Da Nang 550000 Vietnam""]}]","[""10.1039/C6MH00511J"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.03.129"", ""10.1002/er.4479"", ""10.1002/pssb.201451256"", ""10.1021/acsomega.8b02520"", ""10.1007/s10854-016-6328-x"", ""10.1038/35104607"", ""10.1016/0927-0248(96)00063-3"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2018.11.049"", ""10.1002/jbm.b.34401"", ""10.1016/j.jpcs.2019.06.011"", ""10.1021/ie3034575"", ""10.1016/j.apcata.2011.04.032"", ""10.1007/s10971-015-3661-0"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.02.172"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.06.077"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2012.08.017"", ""10.1016/j.jphotochemrev.2012.09.002"", ""10.1039/C5CS00352K"", ""10.1016/j.jpcs.2012.02.027"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2015.05.125"", ""10.1039/c2cp23461k"", ""10.1039/c3ta14484d"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b00087"", ""10.1021/jp202819y"", ""10.3390/catal3020455"", ""10.1021/jp4024926"", ""10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2014.02.010"", ""10.1016/j.memsci.2011.03.014"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.04.077"", ""10.1039/C9TA03551F"", ""10.1039/C8NR07762B"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.021"", ""10.1088/0957-4484/27/39/395604"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.01.016"", ""10.1002/jrs.1250070606"", ""10.1016/j.jphotochem.2009.04.010"", ""10.1002/slct.201701132"", ""10.1038/srep12143"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b06923"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.145021"", ""10.1049/mnl.2017.0642"", ""10.1016/0022-3697(96)00343-5"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.11.061""]","['Energy', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1002/er.8094,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Critical success factors for the implementation and management of energy cloud environments,"SummaryEnergy management systems, both at the level of end‐users and companies and organizations, are migrating from a centralized way to cloud‐based environments, thus generating virtual environments for the users to manage their energy generation, storage, and consumption. This energy management system, also called Energy Cloud (EC), is driven by the distributed generation of renewable energies, electric vehicles, and new energy storage technologies, thus providing ample flexibility and autonomy to users. In this sense, the objective of this article is to identify, evaluate, and discuss the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that impact the implementation and management of EC environments. For this, an approach based on a survey with experts and the Multi‐attribute Utility Theory multicriteria method was used, evaluating the impact levels of CSFs for EC by grouping them according to business areas and structuring them hierarchically in a decision tree. Thus, this research shows that the implementation of EC environments depends more heavily on the energy infrastructure, data management, and the computational systems that process this data. This shows the need for investments in infrastructure renewal and also in the development of new and innovative technological solutions for energy management. Another important result was the evidence of the centralizing role that the users who make up the EC environments have, demanding easier access to the technologies that make up this energy management trend, as well as greater freedoms and decision autonomy, establishing themselves in the role of free users in a dynamic and flexible energy market.","[{""name"": ""Jones Luís Schaefer"", ""affiliation"": [""Production Engineering Graduate Program Universidade Federal de Santa Maria  Santa Maria RS Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Julio Cezar Mairesse Siluk"", ""affiliation"": [""Production Engineering Graduate Program Universidade Federal de Santa Maria  Santa Maria RS Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Patrícia Stefan de Carvalho"", ""affiliation"": [""Production Engineering Graduate Program Universidade Federal de Santa Maria  Santa Maria RS Brazil""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ijepes.2021.107353"", ""10.1002/er.6141"", ""10.1108/JMTM‐04‐2020‐0156"", ""10.1007/s40565-019-0518-5"", ""10.1002/er.6093"", ""10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.02.010"", ""10.3390/s19153353"", ""10.1109/TSG.2014.2377020"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2015.2471260"", ""10.1109/TSG.2015.2446980"", ""10.3390/en14227694"", ""10.3390/en13164048"", ""10.1002/er.6507"", ""10.1109/UCC.2014.79"", ""10.1049/iet-rpg.2018.5715"", ""10.1109/TSG.2015.2446980"", ""10.1007/s40565-018-0425-1"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.077"", ""10.48084/etasr.1702"", ""10.1108/JOCM-06-2017-0230"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2017.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.01.020"", ""10.1016/j.esr.2021.100635"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.122765"", ""10.32604/cmc.2022.021885"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.12.053"", ""10.3390/su14042460"", ""10.1016/j.esd.2021.10.004"", ""10.32479/ijeep.12644"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.08.092"", ""10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000082"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2021.106845"", ""10.1002/ER.7735"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.110701"", ""10.1016/j.spc.2021.07.029"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.120"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128853"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2020.106865"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.274"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.10.031"", ""10.1080/10429247.2020.1800385"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000372"", ""10.1002/9781118644898"", ""10.1007/s11269-016-1333-7"", ""10.1109/MWC.2016.7721747"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.073"", ""10.24084/repqj10.667"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121620"", ""10.1109/MWC.2016.7721748"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2543841"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2957704"", ""10.3390/en13123164"", ""10.1109/TPDS.2014.2321378"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.06.021"", ""10.1109/ICCSEA49143.2020.9132909"", ""10.3390/en11123345"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.08.020"", ""10.1109/MNET.2012.6246750"", ""10.1109/ATEE.2019.8724961"", ""10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.06.006"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/121/1/012010"", ""10.1016/j.jisa.2020.102615"", ""10.1109/TCC.2014.2359460"", ""10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369610"", ""10.1016/j.epsr.2017.06.006"", ""10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622089"", ""10.1002/2050-7038.12094"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.10.030"", ""10.1016/j.jnca.2016.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.comnet.2015.08.031"", ""10.1109/TII.2017.2782885"", ""10.1063/1.5039264"", ""10.1109/ICCEP.2015.7177616"", ""10.1109/IoTSMS.2018.8554827"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896403"", ""10.1145/2742488"", ""10.1109/ICECCE47252.2019.8940710"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3020843"", ""10.1109/UPEC.2014.6934600"", ""10.1109/SSPS.2017.8071581"", ""10.1109/INDICON.2015.7443687"", ""10.1109/CISPSSE49931.2020.9212195"", ""10.1109/ICMA.2018.8484418"", ""10.1109/UPEC.2013.6714855"", ""10.1109/IWMN.2015.7322966"", ""10.1109/JSAC.2016.2621398"", ""10.1109/TSG.2016.2609738"", ""10.14483/23448393.10986"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98530-5_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-98530-5_54"", ""10.1109/MCOM.2019.1900073"", ""10.1109/TIT.1972.1054873"", ""10.1007/s40565-018-0418-0""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

The experiments were conducted in two groups. In the first group, radiation pulse signals were pre-processed using a Fourier filter to reduce the original noise in the signals, whereas in the second group, the original noise was left untouched to simulate an extremely high-noise scenario. For each part, artificial Gaussian noise with different intensity levels was added to the signals prior to the discrimination process. In the aforementioned conditions, the performance of the PCNN was evaluated and compared with five other commonly used methods of n−$$\gamma$$ γ discrimination: (1) zero crossing, (2) charge comparison, (3) vector projection, (4) falling edge percentage slope, and (5) frequency gradient analysis. The experimental results showed that the PCNN method significantly outperforms other methods with outstanding $$\mathrm{FoM}$$ FoM -value at all noise levels. Furthermore, the fluctuations in $$\mathrm{FoM}$$ FoM -value of PCNN were significantly better than those obtained via other methods at most noise levels and only slightly worse than those obtained via the charge comparison and zero-crossing methods under extreme noise conditions. Additionally, the changing patterns and fluctuations of the $$\mathrm{FoM}$$ FoM -value were evaluated under different noise conditions. Hence, based on the results, the parameter selection strategy of the PCNN was presented. In conclusion, the PCNN method is suitable for use in high-noise application scenarios for n−$$\gamma$$ γ discrimination because of its stability and remarkable discrimination performance. It does not rely on strict parameter settings and can realize satisfactory performance over a wide parameter range.","[{""name"": ""Hao-Ran Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhuo Zuo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peng Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bing-Qi Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lan Chang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu-Cheng Yan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.nima.2020.163852"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2019.109016"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2016.02.003"", ""10.29233/sdufeffd.477539"", ""10.1016/j.ijggc.2018.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2010.08.021"", ""10.1109/TNS.2018.2821630"", ""10.12737/stp-73202108"", ""10.1088/1674-1137/40/6/066201"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2014.02.032"", ""10.1016/0029-554X(64)90333-7"", ""10.1016/0029-554X(79)90729-8"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2021.165523"", ""10.1115/1.4048767"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2019.162370"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2006.09.094"", ""10.1016/0168-9002(95)00037-2"", ""10.1016/0029-554X(74)90578-3"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00915-w"", ""10.1146/annurev.ns.38.120188.001245"", ""10.1109/TNS.2018.2885074"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2021.165739"", ""10.1016/0168-9002(89)91199-6"", ""10.1109/TNS.2011.2164556"", ""10.1016/j.radmeas.2010.06.043"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.108346"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2021.165483"", ""10.1109/TNS.2010.2044246"", ""10.1016/0006-8993(87)90933-4"", ""10.1007/BF00202899"", ""10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764"", ""10.1162/neco.1990.2.3.293"", ""10.1364/AO.33.006239"", ""10.1109/SECON.1995.513053"", ""10.1109/TNN.2005.844902"", ""10.1109/72.761720"", ""10.1109/TNN.2004.832830"", ""10.1049/iet-cvi.2017.0285"", ""10.1109/72.761706"", ""10.1016/0029-554X(71)90054-1"", ""10.1088/1748-0221/9/06/p06014"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00865-3""]","['Computer Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Radiation', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"

The disease was reported mostly in grouper and shrimp (monodon and vanname) farming, although the infections in snapper (Lates calcarifer)and abalone (Haliotis squamata)aquaculture were also occurred. Causative agents of vibriosis in Indonesia marine fish is involving 14 species of vibrio namelyVibrio harveyi, V. anguillarum, V. alginoluticus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. fluvialis, V. furnisii, V. methcnikovii, V. vulnificus, V. ordalii, V. cincinnatiensis, V. carchariae, V. azureus, V. mimicus and V. damsela. Control of vibriosis is conducted with water quality management, applications of vaccines, antibiotics, probiotics and immunostimulants. Most vaccines developed and commercially available in Indonesia are in the form of inactive-whole cell types. The vaccine product is effective enough to protect fish from vibriosis. Probiotics have been widely studied since the 2000s and have been shown to increase fish and shrimp growth and resistances against vibriosis. Immunostimulants began to be developed since 2010 based on the extracts of terrestrial plants, seaweeds and chitosan. It is therefore concluded that the continuous existence of pathogenic strains in aquaculture farm requires further development of the control methods, including periodic updating of the vaccines, probiotics and immunostimulant formulas for more potent efficacies.","[{""name"": ""Indah Istiqomah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sukardi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Murwantoko"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alim Isnansetyo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3147/jsfp.52.120"", ""10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.11.017"", ""10.1128/AEM.62.9.3548-3550.1996"", ""10.54911/litbang.v16i0.95"", ""10.15578/jkn.v10i3.6187"", ""10.15578/blta.12.1.2014.51-54"", ""10.19027/jai.9.21-29"", ""10.1007/s11274-009-9992-7"", ""10.20473/jafh.v5i3.11330"", ""10.5530/pj.2019.11.130""]","['Immunology and Microbiology', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Aquatic Science', 'Immunology']","[[('1001 基础医学', 0.7323), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.732), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7292), ('0710 生物学', 0.7287), ('0836 生物工程', 0.72)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0908 水产', 0.7739), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7632)], [('1001 基础医学', 0.7385), ('0710 生物学', 0.7264)]]"

The highest annual effective dose values assessed by relying on the investigated sample set were found by using the rationale according to which all the gross alpha and beta activity is due to the alpha and beta radionuclide, with the highest effective dose coefficient, namely 210Po and 210Pb/228Ra, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Violeta Pintilie-Nicolov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Puiu Lucian Georgescu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cătălina Iticescu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dana Iulia Moraru"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adelina Georgiana Pintilie"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.apradiso.2008.01.024"", ""10.1007/s10661-015-4580-9"", ""10.1155/2016/6178103"", ""10.1007/s12665-015-4819-3"", ""10.1134/S1066362217010131"", ""10.1007/s10967-017-5646-7"", ""10.1007/s10967-017-5631-1"", ""10.1007/s10967-018-6156-y"", ""10.1007/s12403-017-0243-0"", ""10.1007/s10967-018-6343-x"", ""10.1007/s41605-019-0136-9"", ""10.1007/s10967-019-06460-6"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134554"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.03.047"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126242"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126519"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106236"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106191"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2019.106043"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136548"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2008.03.015"", ""10.1007/s10967-011-1159-y"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.07.018"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.12.016"", ""10.1007/s10967-014-3345-1"", ""10.1007/s10967-014-3874-7"", ""10.1016/j.jrras.2015.06.007"", ""10.1007/s10967-015-4034-4"", ""10.1007/s10967-014-3845-z"", ""10.1007/s11356-015-4481-z"", ""10.21175/RadJ.2016.03.031"", ""10.1007/s12665-016-6142-z"", ""10.1007/s41742-017-0015-5"", ""10.1007/s10967-018-6053-4"", ""10.1007/s10661-015-4580-9"", ""10.1007/s10967-019-06686-4"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.11.016"", ""10.1007/s10967-019-06699-z"", ""10.1007/s12665-019-8661-x"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.108558"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126114"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.02.074"", ""10.1016/j.jrras.2015.02.009"", ""10.1007/s12665-015-4909-2"", ""10.1007/s10967-018-5901-6"", ""10.1007/s10967-019-06551-4"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2013.03.030"", ""10.1007/s11270-015-2344-3"", ""10.1007/s10967-014-3631-y"", ""10.1007/s10967-017-5493-6"", ""10.1007/s10967-014-3441-2"", ""10.1186/s40064-016-1716-5"", ""10.1016/j.icrp.2012.06.038"", ""10.1093/rpd/45.1-4.227"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(96)00056-2"", ""10.3390/w11061305"", ""10.3390/nano9060891"", ""10.30638/eemj.2018.050"", ""10.17706/ijbbb.2019.9.1.65-7""]","['Materials Science', 'Physics and Astronomy', 'Health Professions']","['Radiation', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"

The most important aspect of health management is the prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of the battery. Therefore, a RUL estimation model based on the aging factor of the charging process and an improved multi‐kernel relevance vector machine is proposed in order to achieve high accuracy estimation of the RUL of lithium‐ion batteries. First, eight aging features highly correlated with lithium‐ion batteries capacity degradation are extracted based on charging current, voltage, and temperature data, then, their correlation is proved using gray relation analysis. Secondly, the improved gray wolf constrained optimization algorithm is used to determine the kernel function combination coefficients of the multi‐kernel relevance vector machine, and the RUL prediction model of the improved multi‐kernel relevance vector machine is established. Finally, using the battery dataset from NASA, aging data of three datasets, 24°C, 43°C, and 4°C, with a total of 11 batteries, were selected for validation. The validation results show that the improved multi‐kernel relevance vector machine prediction model has higher prediction accuracy and more robust long‐term prediction capability, with RUL prediction error less than 10 cycles and MAE less than 0.05, both of which are better than that of the single‐kernel relevance vector machine model and other multi‐kernel relevance vector machine models.","[{""name"": ""Jing‐Song Qiu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Yong‐Cun Fan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Shun‐Li Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiao Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Jia‐Lu Qiao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Dong‐Lei Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Engineering Southwest University of Science and Technology  Mianyang China""]}]","[""10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00767"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230419"", ""10.3390/su132111688"", ""10.1016/j.est.2021.102525"", ""10.1115/1.4049537"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3089032"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.110015"", ""10.1016/j.joule.2019.11.018"", ""10.1109/TR.2019.2896230"", ""10.1002/cjce.23675"", ""10.1002/er.5002"", ""10.1002/cta.3166"", ""10.1002/er.7874"", ""10.1002/er.7505"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.122581"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2021.109935"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231027"", ""10.1016/j.microrel.2021.114405"", ""10.3390/en13020375"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2021.3134701"", ""10.1002/er.7548"", ""10.1002/er.7480"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2022.123222"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936822"", ""10.3390/en13030752"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.121269"", ""10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.03.019"", ""10.1109/PHM.2016.7819778"", ""10.1016/j.est.2021.102990"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.121236"", ""10.20964/2022.02.16"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.102118"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2020.3040010"", ""10.1016/j.egyr.2021.05.019"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2013.12.007""]",['Engineering'],"['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Driven by the electric vehicles proliferation, a hybrid fast‐charging station with grid and a renewable energy connection is particularly considered. In this stationary application, the VRFB is operating as buffering module. This hybrid topology could contribute to reduce the grid connection cost of the charging station. However, to make VRFB a viable technology, improvements are needed. Among these, some of the most important are in the field of the estimation of the battery's State of Charge, State of Health, and internal parameters. The proposed estimation method is based on a recursive least square (RLS) estimation algorithm with forgetting factor, combined with a sliding mode finite‐time convergent differentiation algorithm. The latter provides robust exact derivatives of both VRFB's current and voltage with a high degree of noise rejection, required by the RLS algorithm to perform a precise estimation. The proposed sliding mode‐based estimation setup is completed with a systematic methodology to guarantee the validity of the on‐line estimated values, depending on the persistence of excitation of the measured current and voltage. Finally, the methodology is thoroughly analysed and validated by computer simulation.","[{""name"": ""Pedro Fornaro"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Electrotécnia Instituto LEICI, Universidad Nacional de la Plata – CONICET  Buenos Aires Argentina""]}, {""name"": ""Thomas Puleston"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut de Robótica i Informàtica Industrial, CSIC‐UPC  Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Paul Puleston"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Electrotécnia Instituto LEICI, Universidad Nacional de la Plata – CONICET  Buenos Aires Argentina""]}, {""name"": ""Maria Serra‐Prat"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut de Robótica i Informàtica Industrial, CSIC‐UPC  Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Ramon Costa‐Castelló"", ""affiliation"": [""Institut de Robótica i Informàtica Industrial, CSIC‐UPC  Barcelona Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Pedro Battaiotto"", ""affiliation"": [""Departamento de Electrotécnia Instituto LEICI, Universidad Nacional de la Plata – CONICET  Buenos Aires Argentina""]}]","[""10.2834/508867"", ""10.1002/er.3329"", ""10.1002/ente.202000708"", ""10.1002/er.3294"", ""10.3390/batteries7030053"", ""10.1039/d0mh01632b"", ""10.1002/er.3260"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.001"", ""10.1002/er.1863"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2009.10.022"", ""10.1002/er.6716"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.100770"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2016.02.118"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2020.08.036"", ""10.3390/en13174514"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.080"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.080"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227684"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.103"", ""10.1016/j.est.2017.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.jfranklin.2015.04.010"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2013.11.038"", ""10.1080/00207170802590531"", ""10.1093/imamci/dns019"", ""10.1016/j.jprocont.2010.06.015"", ""10.1109/tste.2017.2699288"", ""10.1109/CDC.2008.4739356"", ""10.1016/s0005‐1098(97)00209‐4"", ""10.1080/0020717031000099029"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2004.11.029"", ""10.1016/j.ejcon.2019.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101889"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139667"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.124"", ""10.1016/j.est.2017.07.016"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.127"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2952212"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.04.169"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.09.123"", ""10.1002/er.4453"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114532"", ""10.1109/TVT.2017.2751613"", ""10.3390/wevj11040066""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

10.1002/er.6939,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Luminescent solar concentrator utilizing energy transfer paired aggregation-induced emissive fluorophores,"SummaryRecently, semitransparent luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have attracted considerable attention because they offer an easy and cost‐effective route to harvest incident light. Various fluorophores including semiconducting quantum dots and organic dyes have been prepared and utilized for LSC fabrication. However, the narrow light absorption range, reabsorption losses, and limited photostability of the fluorophores still hinder the widespread use of LSCs under outdoor and indoor light conditions. Here, we rationally designed an LSC utilizing aggregation‐induced emissive fluorophores (AIEgens) and an energy transfer (ET) strategy. We employ diketopyrrolopyrrole with triphenylamine moiety as a highly stable AIEgen that functions as an emissive ET acceptor in LSC; for a donor, we use tetraphenylethene containing triphenylamine moiety that shows good aggregation‐induced emission features and excellent spectral overlap with the acceptor to yield an efficient ET process. A thin‐film LSC device with an optimized donor:acceptor ratio (1:0.5) was fabricated. Under AM 1.5G solar spectrum, an LSC coupled with three side reflectors and a backside diffuser exhibits 18% optical conversion efficiency and a concentration factor of 1.18. Under indoor white LED illumination, the values were 27% and 1.68%, respectively. After exposed to intense UV radiations for 5 hours, the LSCs preserved 98% fluorescence which suggests their superior long‐term photostability. Our results suggest that the combination of AIEgens and ET holds the potential for enhancing the efficiency of the device and extended stability of the fluorophores, two of the major requirements to allow industrial production and large‐scale use of outdoor/indoor light harvesting LSCs.","[{""name"": ""Fahad Mateen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering Dongguk University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Tae Gyu Hwang"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Advance Specialty Chemicals Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology  Ulsan Republic of Korea"", ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering Seoul National University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Luciano F.

10.1002/er.6951,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Judicious method of integrating phase change materials into a building envelope under Saharan climate,"SummaryPhase change materials (PCMs) have been extensively used for thermal storage systems in buildings. To enhance the building's thermal and energy performance, PCMs can be embedded into envelope systems to reduce the cooling and heating demand. A PCM's melting temperature close to the thermal comfort range (20°C‐26°C) can potentially be an attractive solution. In this work, the thermal and energy performance of a building in Saharan climate, specifically Ghardaïa in Algeria, was modeled using the TRNSYS‐18 simulation package. A newly developed module (Type‐285) was compiled for this version to evaluate different PCMs integration approaches in building envelope. Integration techniques have been evaluated based on three performance indicators, namely, monthly and annual energy savings, mean air temperature, and the daily average temperature fluctuation. When considering the conventional PCMs integration within the building envelope, a reduction of 36.4% in annual energy consumption was achieved. The study indicated that when PCMs are carefully integrated based on orientations and seasons, a reduction of 50.71% in annual energy consumption is possible, an additional 14.34% to the conventional PCMs integration. In addition, PCMs provided an enhanced thermal performance and a significant reduction in indoor temperatures that ranged between 2.36°C to 4°C. The study proposes an improved PCMs integration approach which can be possibly implemented if movable PCMs panels are used instead of the conventional static PCMs panels.","[{""name"": ""Maamar Hamdani"", ""affiliation"": [""Unité de Recherche Appliquée en Energies Renouvelables, URAER Centre de Développement des Energies Renouvelables, CDER  Ghardaia Alegria""]}, {""name"": ""Sidi Mohammed El Amine Bekkouche"", ""affiliation"": [""Unité de Recherche Appliquée en Energies Renouvelables, URAER Centre de Développement des Energies Renouvelables, CDER  Ghardaia Alegria""]}, {""name"": ""Saleh Al‐Saadi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering Sultan Qaboos University  Muscat Oman""]}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Kamal Cherier"", ""affiliation"": [""Unité de Recherche Appliquée en Energies Renouvelables, URAER Centre de Développement des Energies Renouvelables, CDER  Ghardaia Alegria""]}, {""name"": ""Rachid Djeffal"", ""affiliation"": [""Unité de Recherche Appliquée en Energies Renouvelables, URAER Centre de Développement des Energies Renouvelables, CDER  Ghardaia Alegria""]}, {""name"": ""Mohamed Zaiani"", ""affiliation"": [""Unité de Recherche Appliquée en Energies Renouvelables, URAER Centre de Développement des Energies Renouvelables, CDER  Ghardaia Alegria""]}]","[""10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.12.042"", ""10.1177/1744259120945361"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.01.041"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.09.064"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.05.043"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.07.067"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.07.199"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.04.056"", ""10.3934/matersci.2019.6.944"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.02.029"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.07.072"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2018.01.086"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.03.035"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.12.059"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.12.042"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.032"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.121315"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.108"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.109830"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110598"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2005.07.008"", ""10.1016/S0196-8904(03)00131-6"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.09.021"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.09.017"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.01.022"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.01.024"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.10.013"", ""10.1080/19401493.2017.1280087"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-14286-9_2"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.045"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.01.012"", ""10.1016/S0038-092X(00)00012-8"", ""10.1016/0378-7788(91)90009-R"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.11.072"", ""10.1115/1.2847868"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.08.029"", ""10.1127/0941-2948/2010/0430"", ""10.1007/s00382-018-4128-0"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.02.063""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

However, all‐solid‐state supercapacitors are attracting more and more interest because of thinner, lighter, and more flexible. Binary sulfides Ni3Co6S8 nanowire arrays (NCS) are directly grown on a nitrogen‐doped carbon foam (NCF) through hydrothermal reaction, which is applied as a binder‐free electrode for all‐solid‐state supercapacitor. The unique needlelike structure assembled by nanosheet effectively increases the utilization efficiency of active materials and promotes electrochemical performance. The NCS‐NCF electrode shows promising application potential for wearable electronic devices due to the flexibility of NCF. A high‐specific capacitance of 243 mAh g−1is delivered by NCS‐NCF electrode, which also exhibits good rate behavior along with outstanding cycle stability. The NCS‐NCF electrode (positive electrode) and NCF electrode (negative electrode) are employed to assemble asymmetric all‐solid‐state supercapacitor. When the high power density is 675 W kg−1, the energy density of supercapacitor reaches the maximum of 28.31 Wh kg−1. The specific capacitance of supercapacitors could maintain 84%, after 10 000 cycles of galvanostatic charge and discharge under 4 A g−1, indicating the potential application of NCS‐NCF electrode as an excellent supercapacitor electrode material in flexible, wearable energy storage systems.","[{""name"": ""Yanan Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China"", ""Key Laboratory of Functional Inorganic Material Chemistry, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Materials Science Heilongjiang University  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Junwei Gong"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaolin Xing"", ""affiliation"": [""101 Institute of the Ministry of Civil Affairs  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jialiang Du"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Panpan Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China"", ""Department of NanoEngineering University of California San Diego  La Jolla California USA""]}, {""name"": ""Kui Cheng"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Ke Ye"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Kai Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Jun Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Dianxue Cao"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Guiling Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Superlight Materials and Surface Technology of Ministry of Education, College of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Harbin Engineering University  Harbin China""]}]","[""10.1039/C1CS15060J"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.03.137"", ""10.1515/pac-2014-1117"", ""10.1021/acsnano.7b03322"", ""10.1073/pnas.1600422113"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.109"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.05.022"", ""10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00299"", ""10.1039/C7CS00505A"", ""10.1039/C6CS00041J"", ""10.1039/C9SE00565J"", ""10.1039/C8NR08077A"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2019.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.05.027"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.08.013"", ""10.1039/C8CS00237A"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.09.100"", ""10.1039/C7NR06725A"", ""10.1021/jp049692u"", ""10.1002/celc.201800302"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.05.003"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b19043"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.02.093"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2018.05.004"", ""10.1039/C6RA27331A"", ""10.1039/C6TA11001K"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.10.051""]","['Engineering', 'Energy', 'Materials Science']","['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

10.1002/er.6160,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Energy management of islanded microgrid by coordinated application of thermal and electrical energy storage systems,"SummaryThe installation of an energy storage system (ESS) is vital for the Micrgorid (MG) islanded operation to ensure the maintenance of demand–supply balance. Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are among the most commonly used ESS technologies for grid‐based applications, which is used in this paper to constantly maintain the demand–supply balance in a residential MG. For this purpose, a novel frequency‐based energy management scheme is proposed. It uses an LIB ESS to handle the primary frequency control and energy management during peak‐load period, while the dispatchable distributed generators like microturbine and fuel cell supply the base load. The air‐conditioning TCLs consume a significant part of the residential load profile, especially during mid‐summer. Unlike TCLs that instantaneously use their generated cooling thermal energy to control indoor temperatures, the thermal energy storage systems (TESSs) can also store the thermal energy and use it later. In this paper, the TESSs are used instead of TCLs to reduce the power consumption of a residential Microgrid (MG) in islanded mode. By doing this, the required LIBESSs capacity is decreased 70% considerably than the case the TCLs are used for controlling the indoor temperatures. Also, replacing the ACs and EHPs with TESSs results in a 63.7% reduction in the total cost of electrical and thermal storage.","[{""name"": ""Mehrdad Bagheri‐Sanjareh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering Shahid Beheshti University  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Mohammad Hassan Nazari"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering AmirKabir University of Technology  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Seyed Hossein Hosseinian"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering AmirKabir University of Technology  Tehran Iran""]}]","[""10.1007/s00202-020-01077-5"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.03.040"", ""10.1109/access.2019.2936859"", ""10.1002/etep.2665"", ""10.1109/psc49016.2019.9081496"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2995461"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.049"", ""10.1016/J.EPSR.2018.02.009"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2016.2582837"", ""10.3390/en8088798"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.109787"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017458"", ""10.1002/etep.2186"", ""10.1016/j.segan.2020.100357"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2016.09.017"", ""10.1049/iet-gtd.2018.5883"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097089-9.00009-7"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.03.026"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.096"", ""10.1002/er.3971"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.03.021"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.101028"", ""10.1109/TCST.2012.2204261"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2204074"", ""10.1109/TCST.2014.2358844"", ""10.1109/TEC.2017.2763186"", ""10.1109/TII.2016.2515086"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-813306-4.00004-5"", ""10.3390/en13020340"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-814645-3.00006-7"", ""10.3390/su10010191"", ""10.1049/iet-gtd.2015.0423"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.030"", ""10.1007/s40565-018-0442-0"", ""10.1007/s40565-019-0529-2"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.036"", ""10.1109/PSC49016.2019.9081496"", ""10.24200/SCI.2019.53554.3326"", ""10.1016/S0378-7796(02)00033-0"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.09.041"", ""10.1049/joe.2018.5036"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.093""]",['Engineering'],"['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1002/er.8380,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Electrochemical synthesis of MnO2/NiO/ZnO trijunction coated stainless steel substrate as a supercapacitor electrode and cyclic voltammetry behavior modeling using artificial neural network,"SummaryConsidering the limit of resources and the frequent use of energy, energy storage is nowadays the subject that everyone cares about. In the present work, we investigate trijunction metal oxides as supercapacitor electrode for energy storage application. A MnO2/NiO/ZnO trijunction electrode is synthesized for the first time using a successive three electrochemical deposition steps onto stainless steel (SS) substrate. This approach can effectively yield a good distribution and adhesion of all metal oxides onto the substrate with enhanced hydrophilicity and wettability. The specific capacitance of this trijunction electrode, as studied by cyclic voltammetry was higher than that of individual metal oxide electrodes. The maximum specific capacitance was estimated to be 1569.75 g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of this trijunction electrode compared to single metal oxide electrodes (MnO2, NiO, or ZnO) is mainly due to the improvement of ion and electron transportation pathways in the combination of three metal oxides electrode. In addition, this study presents an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict cyclic voltammetry behavior of the prepared trijunction supercapacitor electrode, with a high satisfactory performance for the predicted performance with &lt;0.05% error. The low and simply synthesized hierarchical trijunction electrode with superior electrochemical performance and the good correlation between experimental and theoretical results prove huge potential for its practical application in supercapacitors (SCs).","[{""name"": ""Asma Alimi"", ""affiliation"": [""Nanomaterials and Systems for Renewable Energy Laboratory Research and Technology Center of Energy (CRTEn)  Tunis Tunisia"", ""Faculty of Sciences of Tunis University of Tunis El Manar  Tunis Tunisia""]}, {""name"": ""Ibtissem Ben Assaker"", ""affiliation"": [""Nanomaterials and Systems for Renewable Energy Laboratory Research and Technology Center of Energy (CRTEn)  Tunis Tunisia""]}, {""name"": ""Jakub Mozaryn"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Automatic Control and Robotics Warsaw University of Technology  Warsaw Poland""]}, {""name"": ""David Ávila‐Brande"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Inorganic Chemistry Universidad Complutense de Madrid  Madrid Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Elizabeth Castillo‐Martínez"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Inorganic Chemistry Universidad Complutense de Madrid  Madrid Spain""]}, {""name"": ""Radhouane Chtourou"", ""affiliation"": [""Nanomaterials and Systems for Renewable Energy Laboratory Research and Technology Center of Energy (CRTEn)  Tunis Tunisia""]}]","[""10.1016/j.est.2021.103605"", ""10.3390/su13137351"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2022.123617"", ""10.1007/s11664-020-07992-4"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.100852"", ""10.1016/j.est.2022.104120"", ""10.3390/nano11051248"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2020.03.003"", ""10.1039/D0NA00573H"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2018.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231032"", ""10.1007/s10854-019-02635-9"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2017.11.052"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136041"", ""10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c01793"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115257"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2021.03.017"", ""10.1039/C9NA00543A"", ""10.1080/03067319.2022.2025791"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.268"", ""10.1007/s10008-021-05092-9"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101363"", ""10.1002/adma.201903808"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0004112"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.165343"", ""10.1007/s10854-019-00821-3"", ""10.1007/s10854-021-05501-9"", ""10.1016/j.diamond.2020.108129"", ""10.1002/elan.202060262"", ""10.1016/j.adapen.2021.100060"", ""10.1016/j.physb.2021.413212"", ""10.3390/en15030693"", ""10.1016/j.est.2022.104121"", ""10.24295/CPSSTPEA.2021.00003"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2021.111408"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227149"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101473"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934228"", ""10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106187"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.01.037"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114278"", ""10.1109/MEPCON50283.2021.9686241"", ""10.35940/ijitee.B6516.129219"", ""10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100537"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.08.204"", ""10.1140/epjp/i2016-16201-9"", ""10.1007/s11581-018-2440-7"", ""10.1016/j.tsf.2007.04.027"", ""10.1021/acsanm.9b00797"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2013.11.118"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2010.11.028"", ""10.1016/j.molcata.2014.04.019"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2013.03.077"", ""10.1007/s10854-020-04588-w"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.229664"", ""10.1039/C5CC08373G"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.08.013"", ""10.1007/s10904-021-01922-5"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.159422"", ""10.1016/j.physb.2019.05.025"", ""10.1007/s10904-019-01172-6"", ""10.35940/ijitee.B1206.1292S219"", ""10.1002/er.5091"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2021.03.528"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.156902"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0154566"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101363"", ""10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110870"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2022.05.079""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

The heat pipes and heat‐conducting glue can solve the problem of poor thermal conductivity and large internal temperature difference (Td) of TMS including PCM and liquid cooling. The micro‐channel plates can solve the problem that TMS combined with the PCM and the heat pipes is difficult to transfer heat. The designed TMS can cool and heat li‐ion battery. Through the li‐ion battery discharge test experiment by 1C, 2C, and 3C, the li‐ion battery heating power is obtained. The temperature change curve of li‐ion batteries at 1C, 2C, 3C discharge and when ambient temperature (Ta) is −20°C, −10°C, 0°C, and 20°C are studied. When the Ta is lower than 0°C, the designed TMS can heat the li‐ion battery to 20°C, and make the Td inside the li‐ion batteries approach 0°C within a short period.","[{""name"": ""Qiuqi Yuan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive and Traffic Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoming Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive and Traffic Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Guangyao Tong"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive and Traffic Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Hua Ding"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive and Traffic Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113995"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.092"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227228"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.06.043"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.12.115"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227993"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120813"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EY.1943-7897.0000557"", ""10.1186/s10033-018-0255-0"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.09.083"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.114"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.141"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.130"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2014.07.037"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.018"", ""10.3390/en10040572"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.12.159"", ""10.1002/er.3576"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.02.020"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.09.052"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112280"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.07.141"", ""10.1007/s10973-020-09611-0"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.10.063""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

In this work, a reverse layered series cooling scheme with a U/Z type flow pattern is introduced to enhance the temperature uniformity of the forced‐air cooling BTMS. The cooling performance of the current design is investigated and compared with that of the parallel cooling for the dynamic unsteady heat generation process. It is demonstrated that the proposed cooling scheme provides good cooling performance and uniform temperature distribution. Then, the geometric structure of the proposed cooling scheme with a U‐type inlet/outlet manifold is optimized by the response surface methodology and the Cuckoo search algorithm. In comparison with the initial design, the maximum temperature of the optimized design is reduced by 0.97°C and the temperature difference is reduced by up to 36.4% (1.23°C) with the pressure drop increased merely by 1.28 Pa.","[{""name"": ""Xin Lan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Energy and Power Engineering Shandong University  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiangrui Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Energy and Power Engineering Shandong University  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Shaobo Ji"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Energy and Power Engineering Shandong University  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Chunyu Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Energy and Power Engineering Shandong University  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhiwei He"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Energy and Power Engineering Shandong University  Jinan China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.08.016"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.110685"", ""10.1007/s00502-006-0383-6"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2019.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.11.018"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.05.074"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.04.072"", ""10.3390/batteries6040061"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00200-8"", ""10.1080/01457632.2015.1060776"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.12.051"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.11.019"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.05.126"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101551"", ""10.1007/s11630-017-0955-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.118576"", ""10.1002/er.7571"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.02.080"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.03.157"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2016.05.009"", ""10.1002/er.4113"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.03.102"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.07.143"", ""10.1002/er.4122"", ""10.1002/er.4114"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113426"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114640"", ""10.1002/er.6480"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.09.099"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.11.116"", ""10.1115/1.4046160"", ""10.1002/er.6387"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.116062"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.116932"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.07.080"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EY.1943-7897.0000557"", ""10.1002/htj.21845"", ""10.1002/er.5058"", ""10.3390/en12142685"", ""10.1080/10407782.2020.1845560"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120798"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.119564""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

And then, polyaniline (PANI) was grown on the surface of N, S‐co‐doped graphene hydrogel via simple adsorption of aniline monomer and in situ polymerization process. The N, S‐co‐doped graphene/polyaniline (N/SGH/PANI) composite hydrogel was fabricated as a free‐standing and binder‐free electrode material. Due to the co‐doped synergistic effect, the N/SGH electrode exhibited enhanced electrochemical performances. The N/SGH electrode displays a specific capacitance of 130.4 F/g at 0.5 A/g. Compared with pure graphene hydrogel (GH), the specific capacitance of N/SGH and N‐doped graphene (NGH) electrodes at 0.5 A/g increased by 53% and 20%, respectively. PANI pseudocapacitor material was introduced to further improve its capacitive performance. The resultant N/SGH/PANI composite electrode could achieve a max specific capacitance of 236.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g. In addition, N/SGH/PANI composite electrode showed stable cycle performance with the capacity retention of 95.1% after 1000 cycles performed at 10 A/g. Those provide a fabrication strategy for the design of high‐performance supercapacitors electrode materials.","[{""name"": ""Xiangxiang Du"", ""affiliation"": [""Materials Science and Engineering Department, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering Pingdingshan University  Pingdingshan China"", ""Key Laboratory of Cellulose and Lignocellulosics Chemistry, Guangzhou Institute of Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences  Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Xuejun Shi"", ""affiliation"": [""Materials Science and Engineering Department, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering Pingdingshan University  Pingdingshan China""]}, {""name"": ""Yanling Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Materials Science and Engineering Department, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering Pingdingshan University  Pingdingshan China""]}, {""name"": ""Kesheng Cao"", ""affiliation"": [""Materials Science and Engineering Department, School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering Pingdingshan University  Pingdingshan China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.249"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2018.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.mattod.2016.10.003"", ""10.1093/nsr/nwx009"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-06759-0"", ""10.1002/adma.201401228"", ""10.1039/C5TA07963B"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2016.11.130"", ""10.1002/adma.201201920"", ""10.1002/smll.201702570"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-37369-x"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2019.135398"", ""10.1002/cjoc.201500656"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.002"", ""10.1002/er.5394"", ""10.1002/er.4326"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.06.213"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.11.022"", ""10.1016/j.jssc.2019.06.003"", ""10.1039/C8TA01366G"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.004"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2014.09.090"", ""10.1021/ja01539a017"", ""10.1016/j.gee.2019.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.04.057"", ""10.1039/c3ee41436a"", ""10.1039/B613962K"", ""10.1039/C3EE43979H"", ""10.1039/C4TA05932H"", ""10.1038/ncomms9503"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.12.102"", ""10.1002/adma.200600445"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.01.221"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2017.03.092"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2010.02.025"", ""10.1038/srep09591"", ""10.1007/s10800-018-1276-1"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.micromeso.2018.04.029"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.143572"", ""10.1039/C9TA00038K"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2013.06.065"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.09.143"", ""10.1002/adfm.201701264"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2016.09.096"", ""10.1002/adfm.201304151"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2015.11.066""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Aiming at the shortcomings of a single equivalent circuit model (ECM) and traditional SOC fusion estimation algorithms, this paper proposes a new multi‐model SOC fusion method. First, three sub‐models are established. Second, an adaptive extended Kalman filter is applied to each sub‐model in parallel to predict the battery terminal voltage and SOC simultaneously. Then, based on the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator theory, the real covariance matrix of the output voltage error of each model is obtained, and the weight factor of each sub‐model is calculated using this matrix. Finally, the SOC estimation of each model is weighted and synthesized to realize the SOC fusion estimation. The experimental results show that the maximum absolute error of the multi‐model SOC fusion estimation based on the OWA operator is close to the optimal value of a single model, whether it is the fusion of three ECMs or two ECMs with a degraded electrochemical model, and the multi‐model SOC fusion estimation based on OWA operator has better robustness than the single model SOC estimation.","[{""name"": ""Aihua Tang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle Engineering Chongqing University of Technology  Chongqing China""]}, {""name"": ""Chun Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Sichuan University of Science and Engineering  Zigong China""]}, {""name"": ""Dongyang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering Chongqing University  Chongqing China""]}, {""name"": ""Kaiqing Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""China Merchants Testing Vehicle Technology Research Institute Co., Ltd.

However, the investigation requires human inputs to locate and mark the bubbles in the acquired TEM images, rendering this task laborious and prone to error. In this paper, a machine learning method capable of automatically identifying and analyzing TEM images of helium bubbles is proposed, thereby improving the efficiency and reliability of the investigation. In the proposed technique, helium bubble clusters are first determined via the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm after removing the background and noise pixels. For each helium bubble cluster, the number of helium bubbles is determined based on the cluster size depending on the specific image resolution. Finally, the helium bubble clusters are analyzed using a Gaussian mixture model, yielding the location and size information on the helium bubbles. In contrast to other approaches that require training using numerous annotated images to establish an accurate classifier, the parameters used in the established model are determined using a small number of TEM images. The results of the model formulated according to the proposed approach achieved a higher F1 score validated through some helium bubble images manually marked. Furthermore, the established model can identify bubble-like objects that humans cannot facilely identify. This computationally efficient method achieves object recognition for material structure identification that may be advantageous to scientific work.","[{""name"": ""Zhong-Hang Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ju-Ju Bai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Di-Da Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gang Huang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tian-Bao Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xi-Jiang Chang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ren-Duo Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jun Lin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jiu-Ai Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.nimb.2015.07.040"", ""10.1134/S0036029519110119"", ""10.1016/j.fusengdes.2019.04.061"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2011.12.025"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2014.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.02.291"", ""10.1063/1.2831205"", ""10.4208/cicp.030311.090611a"", ""10.1016/j.coche.2019.03.001"", ""10.1063/1.4813780"", ""10.1016/j.nme.2016.09.013"", ""10.1016/j.physb.2017.12.040"", ""10.1016/j.fusengdes.2013.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2017.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.03.048"", ""10.1088/0029-5515/55/4/042001"", ""10.1016/j.nimb.2017.03.148"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aao2710"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.215501"", ""10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b00864"", ""10.1016/j.cageo.2019.104391"", ""10.1109/CISP.2011.6100372"", ""10.1109/APSIPA.2017.8282124"", ""10.1109/TGRS.2012.2194787"", ""10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2492552"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107432"", ""10.1016/j.ultramic.2020.113068"", ""10.1080/01431161.2019.1685720"", ""10.1109/TPWRD.2020.3046161"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587569"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33415-3_43"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2012.79"", ""10.1080/21681163.2016.1149104""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Radiation', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

The expected increase in the number of simultaneous collisions at the HL-LHC and the resulting high detector occupancy will make track reconstruction algorithms extremely demanding in terms of time and computing resources. The increase in number of hits will increase the complexity of track reconstruction algorithms. In addition, the ambiguity in assigning hits to particle tracks will be increased due to the finite resolution of the detector and the physical “closeness” of the hits. Thus, the reconstruction of charged particle tracks will be a major challenge to the correct interpretation of the HL-LHC data. Most methods currently in use are based on Kalman filters which are shown to be robust and to provide good physics performance. However, they are expected to scale worse than quadratically. Designing an algorithm capable of reducing the combinatorial background at the hit level, would provide a much “cleaner” initial seed to the Kalman filter, strongly reducing the total processing time. One of the salient features of Quantum Computers is the ability to evaluate a very large number of states simultaneously, making them an ideal instrument for searches in a large parameter space. In fact, different R&amp;D initiatives are exploring how Quantum Tracking Algorithms could leverage such capabilities. In this paper, we present our work on the implementation of a quantum-based track finding algorithm aimed at reducing combinatorial background during the initial seeding stage. We use the publicly available dataset designed for the kaggle TrackML challenge.","[{""name"": ""Cenk Tüysüz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Federico Carminati"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bilge Demirköz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Dobos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fabio Fracas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kristiane Novotny"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karolos Potamianos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sofia Vallecorsa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jean-Roch Vlimant"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/s41534-018-0116-9"", ""10.1162/neco_a_01202"", ""10.1038/nphys3272"", ""10.1109/MCSE.2007.55""]","['Computer Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1051/epjn/2022038,EPJ NUCLEAR SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology,Modelling of the long-term evolution and performance of engineered barrier system,"Components of the so-called “multiple-barrier system” from the waste form to the biosphere include a combination of waste containers, engineered barriers, and natural barriers. The Engineered Barrier System (EBS) is crucial for containment and isolation in a radioactive waste disposal system. The number, types, and assigned safety functions of the various engineered barriers depend on the chosen repository concept, the waste form, the radionuclides waste inventory, the selected host rock, and the hydrogeological and geochemical settings of the repository site, among others. EBS properties will evolve with time in response to the thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, radiological, and chemical gradients and interactions between the various constituents of the barriers and the host rock. Therefore, assessing how these properties evolve over long time frames is highly relevant for evaluating the performance of a repository system and safety function evaluations in a safety case. For this purpose, mechanistic numerical models are increasingly used. Such models provide an excellent way for integrating into a coherent framework a scientific understanding of coupled processes and their consequences on different properties of the materials in the EBS. Their development and validation are supported by R&amp;D actions at the European level. For example, within the HORIZON 2020 project BEACON (Bentonite mechanical evolution), the development, test, and validation of numerical models against experimental results have been carried out in order to predict the evolution of the hydromechanical properties of bentonite during the saturation process. Also, in relation to the coupling with mechanics, WP16 MAGIC (chemo Mechanical AGIng of Cementitious materials) of the EURAD Joint Programming Initiative focuses on multi-scale chemo-mechanical modeling of cementitious-based materials that evolve under chemical perturbation. Integration of chemical evolution in models of varying complexity is a major issue tackled in the WP2 ACED (Assessment of Chemical Evolution of ILW and HLW Disposal cells) of EURAD. WP4 DONUT (Development and improvement of numerical methods and tools for modeling coupled processes) of EURAD aims at developing and improving numerical models and tools to integrate more complexity and coupling between processes. The combined progress of those projects at a pan-European level definitively improves the understanding of and the capabilities for assessing the long-term evolution of engineered barrier systems.","[{""name"": ""Francis Claret"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexandre Dauzeres"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diederik Jacques"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patrik Sellin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benoit Cochepin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laurent De Windt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jaime Garibay-Rodriguez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joan Govaerts"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olivier Leupin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alba Mon Lopez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Luis Montenegro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vanessa Montoya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nikolaos I.

Here, using first‐principles calculation method combined with Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), compressive sensing techniques and self‐consistent phonon (SCP) theory, we investigate the heat transport properties of five hydride‐based cubic antiperovskites A3HB (A = Li, Na; B = S, Se, Te) with the inclusion of scattering rates and phonon frequency shifts induced by quartic anharmonicity, which do not contain orthorhombic Na3HS. It is worth noting that only the values of κL obtained by SCP theory are valid for Li3HS and Na3HS, because there is imaginary frequency in HA phonon mode, which makes the conventional calculation of BTE invalid. We also find that quartic anharmonicity is important to capture the reasonable temperature dependence of the κL, while only taking phonon frequency shifts (4 ph scattering processes) into account will result in weaker (stronger) temperature dependence. The calculated κL based SCP theory exhibits a remarkably low value at 300 K, which indicates that the cubic antiperovskites A3HB (A = Li, Na; B = S, Se, Te) are potential thermoelectric materials.","[{""name"": ""Yanan Xiao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Yantai University  Yantai People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Pengfei Sui"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Yantai University  Yantai People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yinchang Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Yantai University  Yantai People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Jun Ni"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Tsinghua University  Beijing People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Sheng Meng"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics and Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences  Beijing People's Republic of China"", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter  Beijing People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhenhong Dai"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Yantai University  Yantai People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1002/ijch.201400037"", ""10.1002/adma.201305371"", ""10.1126/science.1158899"", ""10.1038/nature11439"", ""10.1038/nature13184"", ""10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.085401"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.83.115110"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.69.184202"", ""10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.065401"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.95.014307"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.94.125203"", ""10.1103/PhysRevApplied.17.034023"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.105.104309"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.104.224304"", ""10.1126/science.aak9997"", ""10.1038/35075014"", ""10.1063/1.1587265"", ""10.1038/s41586-021-03492-5"", ""10.1038/s41578-020-0181-5"", ""10.1016/j.jssc.2021.122246"", ""10.1038/s41467-020-20370-2"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.92.054301"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.226603"", ""10.1119/1.1987046"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.84.180301"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.88.144301"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.095901"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.177002"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.157004"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184308"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184309"", ""10.1007/BF02737485"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.28.1928"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.89.184304"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.095501"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.105901"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.96.161201"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.101.184303"", ""10.1103/PhysRev.128.2589"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1819"", ""10.1016/j.cpc.2014.02.015"", ""10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108179"", ""10.1103/PhysRev.136.B864"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.54.11169"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.59.1758"", ""10.1103/RevModPhys.73.515"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.77.144112"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.105901"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.93.045202"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.85.184303"", ""10.1007/BF00502357"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.63.245113"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.80.125205"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.046602"", ""10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.3.033601"", ""10.1063/1.5048814"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.102.094314""]",['Materials Science'],['Materials Chemistry'],"[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

Herein, we adopted an effective strategy to introduce oxygen‐defect into the well‐ordered three‐dimensional flower‐like CoMoO4 nanoarchitecture.

10.1002/er.6922,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Hybrid technique for load frequency control of renewable energy sources with unified power flow controller and energy storage integration,"SummaryIn this manuscript, the load frequency control (LFC) of multiple area hybrid power system (PS) integrated with renewable energy sources (RESs) using energy storage system (ESS) is proposed. The proposed hybrid method is the joint execution of Meta‐heuristic Anopheles Search Algorithm (MASA) and artificial intelligence (AI) technique and hence it is named as MASAAI technique. The main aim of the proposal is “to diminish the load frequency deviations in 3‐area hybrid PS.” The thyristor controlled phase shifter (TCPS) and ultra‐capacitor (UC) application are used in LFC. During the operation of power system, the power distribution quality is suffered owing to continual and random changes in load. Hence, the PS control is necessary for maintaining a continual balance amid the power generation and load demand. The proportional integral derivative (PID) is agreed to LFC mode. Here, the 3‐area system is incorporated with conventional RESs like solar, biomass, and fuel cell. UPFC is joined in series with tie‐line, ensures the stabilization of the system and also presents more service and the quality of power is sustained by the subordinate control of super capacitor energy storage. With the help of MASAAI method, suppressing the peak value of the frequency deviation by power modulation control is a way to lessen this issue. With this proper control, the MASAAI method efficiency becomes optimum in deregulated environment that is agreed to LFC mode. Finally, the proposed method is activated in MATLAB/Simulink site and the performance is compared with existing methods. Finally, the simulation outcomes demonstrate that the efficiency of MASAAI method is more efficient compared to the existing methods.","[{""name"": ""Vijayalaxmi Munisamy"", ""affiliation"": [""Electrical and Electronics Engineering, College of Engineering Anna University  Chennai India""]}, {""name"": ""Rahul Somnath Sundarajan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Power Engineering and Management, College of Engineering Anna University  Chennai India""]}]","[""10.1109/tpwrs.2016.2587938"", ""10.33430/V27N1THIE-2018-0024"", ""10.18280/ejee.224-509"", ""10.1108/ijpcc-09-2020-0136"", ""10.6703/IJASE.202012_17(4).331"", ""10.17148/ijireeice.2015.3831"", ""10.17577/ijertv5is030487"", ""10.1016/j.epsr.2019.105938"", ""10.35940/ijeat.e7833.088619"", ""10.1016/j.jprocont.2014.08.006"", ""10.14257/ijca.2018.11.7.06"", ""10.11591/ijaas.v6.i1.pp12-22"", ""10.22214/ijraset.2019.5295"", ""10.1504/ijbic.2019.10019906"", ""10.1007/s40815-017-0332-z"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.885"", ""10.1080/23080477.2019.1630057"", ""10.1007/s12667-019-00326-2"", ""10.1049/iet-cta.2017.0735"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2017.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.12.074"", ""10.1049/iet-gtd.2016.0108"", ""10.1049/iet-gtd.2019.1217"", ""10.31142/ijtsrd19164"", ""10.1080/15325008.2014.903540"", ""10.1007/s40031-014-0147-3"", ""10.1016/j.isatra.2017.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2016.01.012"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2012.04.024"", ""10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060122"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2014.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.11.085"", ""10.1007/s00521-018-3348-x"", ""10.3390/en11010151"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04205-w"", ""10.3390/su11246908"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.071"", ""10.1016/j.egyr.2019.04.003"", ""10.1080/00207179.2019.1673487"", ""10.1007/s40998-018-0078-0"", ""10.1016/j.asej.2019.01.004"", ""10.1002/2050-7038.12702"", ""10.1080/01430750.2018.1563811"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116171"", ""10.1049/iet-esi.2018.0028"", ""10.1002/ep.13329"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.094"", ""10.7763/ijet.2011.v3.203"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-84878-5"", ""10.1007/s12667-017-0232-1"", ""10.1016/j.jcis.2020.01.003"", ""10.1007/s12065-019-00348-w""]",['Engineering'],"['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) was used to prepare flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators with necklace‐like oriented structure. The results showed that the oriented structure significantly improved the electrical output performance of F‐PENG by enhancing the stress and free charge transmission. For the F‐PENG with 8 vol% oriented PZT particle, open‐circuit voltage and short‐circuit current reached 176 V and 35 μA and an instantaneous power of up to 2 mW was collected for an optimal matched load resistance of 6 MΩ. Output voltage and current increase by 135% and 133%, respectively, compared with the F‐PENG with random structure. Meanwhile, the finite element simulation results also confirmed the superiority of this oriented structure. There was a clear linear relationship between the output voltage and pressure, and the sensitivity was 1.13 N/V. The oriented PZT particle‐based F‐PENG with excellent electrical output performance has great application prospects in the fields of green power generation and self‐powered building monitoring system.","[{""name"": ""Shuo Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Preparation and Measurement of Building Materials University of Jinan  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiujuan Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Preparation and Measurement of Building Materials University of Jinan  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Huan Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Preparation and Measurement of Building Materials University of Jinan  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Zie Yuan"", ""affiliation"": [""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Preparation and Measurement of Building Materials University of Jinan  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Yu Huan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Material Science and Engineering University of Jinan  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Xi Yuan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Central South University  Changsha China""]}, {""name"": ""Shifeng Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Preparation and Measurement of Building Materials University of Jinan  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Cheng"", ""affiliation"": [""Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Preparation and Measurement of Building Materials University of Jinan  Jinan China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.nanoen.2011.12.006"", ""10.1063/1.4992786"", ""10.1002/ente.201700756"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2010.07.024"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.024"", ""10.1557/mrc.2019.19"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.09.068"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.07.019"", ""10.1007/s12274-009-9023-x"", ""10.1002/adma.201202445"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.012"", ""10.1039/C7NR04115B"", ""10.1039/C8EE00014J"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b04497"", ""10.1002/adfm.201904259"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.038"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2018.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2011.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.090"", ""10.1002/admt.201900228"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.06.109"", ""10.1039/C8EE00595H"", ""10.1002/smll.201704022"", ""10.1063/1.1700065"", ""10.1016/j.euromechflu.2015.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.euromechflu.2014.08.007"", ""10.1039/C8TC04741C"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.09.006"", ""10.1002/adfm.201303484"", ""10.1021/nn406481k"", ""10.1039/C6NR05784E"", ""10.1016/j.mtchem.2019.100232"", ""10.1021/jz100330j"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.076"", ""10.1002/ente.201700873"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.11.061"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.05.025"", ""10.1021/acsami.5b09485"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2018.2794182"", ""10.1007/s11071-014-1355-8"", ""10.1016/j.phpro.2015.08.202"", ""10.1063/1.4874305""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

It aims to deliver ultra-intense coherent femtosecond X-ray pulses to five endstations covering a range of 100–620 eV for ultrafast X-ray science. Two undulator lines are designed and constructed, based on different lasing modes: self-amplified spontaneous emission and echo-enabled harmonic generation. The coherent scattering and imaging (CSI) endstation is the first of five endstations to be commissioned online. It focuses on high-resolution single-shot imaging and the study of ultrafast dynamic processes using coherent forward scattering techniques. Both the single-shot holograms and coherent diffraction patterns were recorded and reconstructed for nanoscale imaging, indicating the excellent coherence and high peak power of the SXFEL and the possibility of “diffraction before destruction” experiments at the CSI endstation. In this study, we report the first commissioning results of the CSI endstation.","[{""name"": ""Jia-Dong Fan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ya-Jun Tong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yong-Gan Nie"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zi-Chen Gao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bo He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hui Luan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dong-Hao Lu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jian-Hua Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Di-Fei Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xin-Ye Yuan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jia-Hua Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhi Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tao Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Meng Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chao Feng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hai-Xiao Deng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bo Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhen-Tang Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhi Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Huai-Dong Jiang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/nmat2400"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.205501"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.198101"", ""10.1073/pnas.100015610"", ""10.1073/pnas.0910874107"", ""10.1038/nmeth.1533"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2014.270"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2010.267"", ""10.1038/22498"", ""10.1146/annurev.physchem.59.032607.093642"", ""10.1063/1.2403783"", ""10.1103/RevModPhys.88.015006"", ""10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100097"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2007.76"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2010.176"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2012.233"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2012.141"", ""10.1038/s41566-017-0029-8"", ""10.3390/app7070720"", ""10.1038/s41566-020-0607-z"", ""10.2172/1029479"", ""10.18429/JACoW-FEL2019-TUP087"", ""10.48550/arXiv.1304.5335"", ""10.1007/s41365-018-0490-1"", ""10.3390/app12010176"", ""10.1080/08940886.2017.1386997"", ""10.1088/2040-8978/18/7/074011"", ""10.1088/0953-4075/49/3/034008"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aav8801"", ""10.1038/ncomms4762"", ""10.1016/j.fmre.2022.01.027"", ""10.1364/OPTICA.466064"", ""10.1038/nphys461"", ""10.1364/OE.18.026441"", ""10.1021/nl403247x"", ""10.1364/JOSAA.23.001179"", ""10.1073/pnas.0503305102"", ""10.1038/s41580-019-0173-8"", ""10.1107/S2052252521012963"", ""10.1038/35021099"", ""10.1038/nature09748"", ""10.1038/ncomms4052"", ""10.1038/ncomms6704"", ""10.1364/OE.26.001237"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.208101"", ""10.1364/OE.17.013541"", ""10.1126/science.256.5059.1009"", ""10.1038/nature03139"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.217203"", ""10.1063/1.2364259"", ""10.1007/s41365-017-0188-9"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.025504"", ""10.1073/pnas.1104304108"", ""10.1038/s41563-020-00807-1""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Radiation', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Although, 3D perovskite is known for its high photovoltaic efficiency due to intense visible light absorbance, the hydrophilic organic cation in its structure makes it susceptible to rapid moisture induced structural degradation. When the 2D perovskite, possessing the long chains of hydrophobic organic molecule is incorporated in the 3D counterpart, moisture induced degradation is reduced, but with increased grain boundaries. The novelty of this work is to grow the single crystal of the 2D/3D‐blended perovskite, aiming to enhance the carrier mobility by reducing the grain boundaries, trap state densities, and charge recombination, while preserving the improved material stability. PSCs with polycrystalline 3D perovskite, single crystal of 3D perovskite, and single crystal of 2D/3D‐blended perovskite yielded efficiencies of 4.55%, 6.37% and 5.37% respectively.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Younas"", ""affiliation"": [""Laser Research Group, Department of Physics, Center of Research Excellence in Nanotechnology (CENT) King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM)  Dhahran Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Mohammed A.

10.1007/s41365-021-00898-8,NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0702 Physics,Development of gated fiber detectors for laser-induced strong electromagnetic pulse environments,"AbstractWith the development of laser technologies, nuclear reactions can happen in high-temperature plasma environments induced by lasers and have attracted a lot of attention from different physical disciplines. However, studies on nuclear reactions in plasma are still limited by detecting technologies. This is mainly due to the fact that extremely high electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) can also be induced when high-intensity lasers hit targets to induce plasma, and then cause dysfunction of many types of traditional detectors. Therefore, new particle detecting technologies are highly needed. In this paper, we report a recently developed gated fiber detector which can be used in harsh EMP environments. In this prototype detector, scintillating photons are coupled by fiber and then transferred to a gated photomultiplier tube which is located far away from the EMP source and shielded well. With those measures, the EMPs can be avoided which may result that the device has the capability to identify a single event of nuclear reaction products generated in laser-induced plasma from noise EMP backgrounds. This new type of detector can be widely used as a time-of-flight (TOF) detector in high-intensity laser nuclear physics experiments for detecting neutrons, photons, and other charged particles.","[{""name"": ""Po Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhi-Guo Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kai Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guo-Qiang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""De-Qing Fang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bao-Ren Wei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chang-Bo Fu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu-Gang Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1038/386054a0"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.43.267"", ""10.1007/s11434-015-0821-0"", ""10.1063/1.4931460"", ""10.1209/0295-5075/117/28001"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.96.055801"", ""10.1088/0256-307x/35/9/092901"", ""10.1063/1.5100925"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-26785-8"", ""10.1063/1.4998470"", ""10.1038/239139a0"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.2634"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2012.02.077"", ""10.1134/1.558902"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-00829-0"", ""10.1007/s41365-020-0749-1"", ""10.1088/0256-307X/37/1/015202"", ""10.1088/0256-307x/36/10/105201"", ""10.1017/hpl.2020.13"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-02331-w"", ""10.1007/s41365-019-0619-x"", ""10.1007/s41365-020-00769-8"", ""10.1007/s41365-020-00830-6"", ""10.1088/0256-307X/36/7/074101"", ""10.1088/1748-0221/15/10/C10013"", ""10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.5.031301"", ""10.1109/TNS.2008.2001408"", ""10.1109/TNS.2012.2183385"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2018.09.029"", ""10.1364/AO.13.002218"", ""10.1364/AO.7.002289"", ""10.1364/AO.46.000397""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Mechanics of Materials', 'Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Radiation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)]]"

Ninety-six frozen semen straw from eight bulls were divided into four groups based on age (group-1: 5-6 years; group-2: 7-8 years; group-3: 9-10 years; group-4: 11-12 years). Total and progressive motility were detected by using computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA), while DNA fragmentation was detected by Toluidine blue staining. Over 500 artificial insemination services in the field were used for fertility rate analysis. The results of the analysis of total motility, progressive, and DNA fragmentation in all age groups still meet the minimum standard for artificial insemination programs. Analysis of progressive motility and DNA fragmentation showed significant differences in each age group (P&lt;0.01), whereas analysis of total motility showed no significant differences in group-2 (7-8 years) and group-3 (9-10 years) (P&gt;0.01). Increased age in bulls correlated significantly with increased sperm DNA fragmentation (P&lt;0.01), decreased total and progressive motility (P&lt;0,01), and potentially reduced the fertility rate (P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, although the quality of frozen semen still meets the standards for artificial insemination programs, the age factor in bulls needs to be considered for achieving maximum fertility.","[{""name"": ""Berlin P.

Since this publication, the feedback of the Fukushima-Daiichi accident continued and numerous evolutions occurred, both in French and European regulations and in international recommendations from IAEA and ICRP. This had led to further developments in the French doctrine for management of a post-accidental situation. This will result in the publication of a new version of the French doctrine next year. This evolution also prompted questioning about the existence of such doctrines in other countries, especially in neighboring countries. It appeared also interesting to evaluate the agreement of these doctrines, including the French one, with international recommendations, especially the recently published general safety requirements (GSR), part 11, from IAEA. A benchmark study comparing the different post-accidental management doctrines available was then conducted and is presented here.","[{""name"": ""J.-M.

Green synthesized AgNPs were fabricated using henna (Lawsonia inermis) and DU‐C2 actinomycete in batch using different AgNPs concentrations (0, 40, 80, and 120 μg/mL). The overall results revealed that after 72 hours of AgNPs incubation with C beijerinckii, the henna mediated AgNP synthesis increased the hydrogen production rate with a hydrogen yield of 1.71 mol H2/mol glucose added. However, the DU‐C2‐mediated AgNps synthesis inhibited bio‐H2 production during the batch H2 fermentation. Performed live/dead staining showed AgNPs effect on the bacterial culture in batch fermentation. The results indicated that the henna mediated AgNPs enhanced the bacterial cell population, meanwhile, in case of DU‐C2 AgNPs, less bacterial population occurred. Thus, the present study provides a clear overview on the application of metallic NPs as H2 production catalysts to further improve bio‐H2 production.","[{""name"": ""Imran Khan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biotechnology Daegu University  Gyeongsan Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Parthiban Anburajan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil and Environmental Engineering Yonsei University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Gopalakrishnan Kumar"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Chemistry, Bioscience and Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology University of Stavanger  Stavanger Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Jeong‐Jun Yoon"", ""affiliation"": [""Green Process Material Research Group Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH)  Cheonan Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Ashutosh Bahuguna"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biotechnology Daegu University  Gyeongsan Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Alana Gandra Lima de Moura"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratory of Biological Processes (LPB), Department of Hydraulics and Sanitation, São Carlos School of Engineering University of São Paulo  São Carlos Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Arivalagan Pugazhendhi"", ""affiliation"": [""Innovative Green Product Synthesis and Renewable Environment Development Research Group, Faculty of Environment and Labour Safety Ton Duc Thang University  Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam""]}, {""name"": ""Sang‐Hyoun Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil and Environmental Engineering Yonsei University  Seoul Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sun‐Chul Kang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biotechnology Daegu University  Gyeongsan Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.3390/ijms17091534"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.104"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.1097"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.110"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2016.03.124"", ""10.1186/1754-6834-5-35"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.12.080"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.07.093"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2010.03.146"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.11.015"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2016.02.009"", ""10.1080/08927014.2015.1048686"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.cca.2010.08.016"", ""10.1166/jnn.2009.C158"", ""10.1007/s10646-008-0217-x"", ""10.1016/j.micpath.2017.11.013"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2016.02.121"", ""10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.07.010"", ""10.1007/s00253-014-5953-7"", ""10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.05.016"", ""10.3389/fmicb.2017.02421"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.tibtech.2016.02.006"", ""10.5487/TR.2016.32.2.095"", ""10.1016/j.ejar.2016.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.jsps.2014.11.013"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2011.12.024"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2013.05.042"", ""10.2147/IJN.S121956"", ""10.2174/1389201018666170104112434"", ""10.1016/j.procbio.2015.12.013"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.063"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.197"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2010.01.061"", ""10.1038/srep24312"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2016.04.026"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.01.044""]","['Chemistry', 'Materials Science', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Organic Chemistry', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Molecular Biology']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0703 化学', 0.7525), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7384)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)]]"
10.1002/er.6893,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Archimedes screw generators for sustainable micro-hydropower production,"SummaryArchimedes screws have been used as pumps since antiquity and have more recently been implemented in micro‐hydropower plants as an ecologically advantageous technology. They are regarded as a hydropower technology with lower environmental impact since they allow safe passage of aquatic flora and fauna through slow turning, widely spaced blades during operation. Archimedes screw generators (ASGs) operate at river‐to‐wire efficiencies at approximately 75% with relatively low installation and maintenance costs when compared to other hydropower technologies of the same scale. ASGs are relatively simple and cost‐efficient to manufacture—simple enough to create in the seventh century BCE. Modern manufacturing techniques for sheet metal and fabrication have refined ASG production. The literature contains various parametric models for predicting screw power output, and more recent numerical simulations have provided insight into the fluid mechanics of screw generators. The knowledge gained from these studies has allowed researchers to suggest more optimal designs for Archimedes screws. However, much can be done to further improve the accuracy of power prediction models. This paper discusses the current state of the literature for ASGs, and highlights areas for future research to improve power prediction and optimization capabilities for researchers and industrial designers.Highlights Archimedes screws are an ancient pumping technology that have more recently found use as a hydropower‐producing technology. Archimedes screw generators (ASGs) are a small‐scale hydropower technology that may be installed as a run‐of‐river installation. ASGs are an eco‐friendly technology that allow for the safe passage of sediments, small debris, fish, and other aquatic wildlife through their flights during operation. There are few experiments and computational fluid dynamic simulations that have sought to extend the literature's data on ASG operation. Current performance models for ASGs lack robust validation to be properly implemented in power plant design.","[{""name"": ""Scott Christopher Simmons"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering University of Guelph  Guelph Canada""]}, {""name"": ""William David Lubitz"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering University of Guelph  Guelph Canada""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2000)126:1(72)"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2012.06.020"", ""10.1353/tech.2003.0011"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001479"", ""10.1007/1-4020-2204-2_15"", ""10.1061/9780784408292"", ""10.1100/2012/136218"", ""10.1080/07373930701250120"", ""10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0563:PCSROJ>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1080/02755947.2013.833560"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1177/1/012039"", ""10.1182/asheducation-2018.1.507"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.06.028"", ""10.1299/jsmeicbtt.2006.3.0_29"", ""10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271420"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2013.01.064"", ""10.1063/1.5027551"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1266/1/012007"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.04.035"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/22/6/062007"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.06.084"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.01.168"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/22/6/062005"", ""10.1109/PEOCO.2014.6814495"", ""10.1016/j.esd.2018.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.08.033"", ""10.1115/ES2013-18067"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.062"", ""10.1016/S0262-1762(16)70019-8"", ""10.1641/0006-3568(2000)050[0807:REOHAO]2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/j.chnaes.2013.05.011"", ""10.1093/biosci/biw117"", ""10.1023/A:1012971715668"", ""10.1021/es4042644"", ""10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02896.x"", ""10.1007/BF01685984"", ""10.1021/acs.est.6b04447"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.032"", ""10.1577/1548-8659(2003)132<0326:POJCSA>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1071/MF18100"", ""10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.04.009"", ""10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.04.043"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.060"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000922"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.09.084"", ""10.4324/9781315817484"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.094"", ""10.1080/00221686.2015.1136706"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2018.11.084"", ""10.1080/00221686.2018.1534285"", ""10.1007/s00506-013-0106-2"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.044"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001433"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17777-9_33"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.060"", ""10.25071/10315/35291"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001786"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.10.093"", ""10.25103/jestr.092.12"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.057"", ""10.3826/jhr.2009.3475"", ""10.3384/ecp110571448"", ""10.1080/00221686.2020.1844813"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/49/10/102002"", ""10.1051/e3sconf/20186704027"", ""10.1299/jcst.7.338"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001854""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Mechanics of Materials', 'Ocean Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1002/er.6958,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Application of microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) to detect COVID-19 in energy deprived countries,"SummaryCoronavirus disease (COVID‐19) has spread all across the world. Low‐ and medium‐income countries are more affected economically and socially compared to developed countries due to the lack of a rapid, robust, and affordable testing infrastructure. Furthermore, the high cost of real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, sophisticated user‐handling procedure, and high expense of the conventional clinical tests are the root causes of the less accessibility of the testing systems to the users. In this study, a COVID‐19 Point‐of‐Care (POC) ecosystem model is proposed for the low‐ and medium‐income countries (or energy deprived countries) that will facilitate the technological development with locally available fabrication components. In addition, the nontechnological development phases have also been discussed, which encompasses the collaboration among academia, local as well as government bodies, and entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, a hypothetical design of a microfluidic paper‐based analytical (μPADs) POC platform is proposed to detect COVID‐19 analyte using unprocessed patient‐derived saliva, which is a miniaturized form‐factor of conventional real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The device contains four major reaction zones, which are sample zone, buffer zone, loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) Master Mix zone, Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) zone, and sensor zone. To obtain quicker test results and easier operation, a handheld image acquisition technique is introduced in this study. It is hypothesized that in a remote setting, the proposed design could be used as an initial guideline to develop a POC COVID‐19 testing system, which may be simple, easy‐to‐use, and cost‐effective.","[{""name"": ""Mosfera A.

Therefore, it is commonly used in the simulation research of the life prediction and the cell decay mechanism analysis of the lithium ion battery. This paper mainly introduces three commonly used electrochemistry models: P2D model, SP model and extended SP model. The origin and research progress of three kinds of electrochemical models are described. The characteristics of the three models are analyzed and compared. P2D model can describe the battery reactions comprehensively, but the iterative solution is complicated. The SP model simplifies some electrochemical reactions and improves the computational speed of the model, but the accuracy is decreased. In order to solve the shortcoming of SP model, the electrochemical reaction omitted from SP model is introduced again, and the approximate solution is solved by mathematical method, so as to realize the balance between precision and computational complexity of the model. Based on the above analysis and the application scenarios of lithium ion battery, the further development of the lithium ion battery electrochemical model is prospected.","[{""name"": ""Jiaping Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bo Xing"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chunyang Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s41918-018-0022-z"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.03.002"", ""10.1002/aic.690210103"", ""10.1016/j.compchemeng.2011.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.025"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(98)00092-5"", ""10.1063/1674-0068/29/cjcp1604063"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.04.129"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.12.101"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.084"", ""10.5796/electrochemistry.84.432""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

This paper proposes a reduced‐dimension dynamic model of fuel cells that considers main mass‐transport mechanisms, including two‐phase flow in the gas diffusion layer. Under the quasi‐steady‐state assumption, the distributions of liquid water and gas species in the through‐plane direction are calculated through analytical expressions. Thus, the reduced‐dimension fuel‐cell model can obtain a similar output to a one‐dimensional model without needing to solve partial differential equations. The reduced‐dimension model was validated on steady state and transient experimental data. The computational load of the reduced‐dimension model was only 1/60 that of a one‐dimensional model. To simulate the transient behavior of the fuel‐cell system, the reduced‐dimension fuel‐cell model was integrated with a comprehensive balance‐of‐plant model. The system model could execute long‐time‐scale transient simulations and evaluate the internal states of the fuel cell while minimizing the computing resources. Finally, the contradiction between the power response rate and oxygen starvation under the load‐delay strategy was analyzed with the system model, and the delay duration was optimized. Results verify the potential of the reduced‐dimension model in control‐oriented applications.Novelty statementThe existing models of proton‐exchange membrane fuel cells, such as computational fluid dynamics and lumped‐parameter models, cannot provide a comprehensive description of mass‐transport mechanisms without incurring a high computational load.

The hydrogel was synthesized via gamma-irradiation copolymerization and characterized through FTIR, TGA, and SEM. The medium acidity notably affected the adsorption capacity of both ions. The adsorption data was in line with the pseudo-1st-order equation and the Freundlich isothermal model. The thermodynamics analysis showed that the temperature rise promoted the adsorption capacity. The reusability studies highlighted the good performance of the hydrogel up to five regeneration rounds.","[{""name"": ""Zeinab F.

10.1002/er.8149,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,A bright future of hydrogels in flexible batteries and Supercapacitors storage systems: A review,"SummaryThe next generation of IoT, IoMT, and wearable bioelectronics demands the development of a novel form of thin‐film and flexible energy storage devices that offer high energy and power densities, mechanical reliability, and biocompatibility. Hydrogels are a class of materials that can be engineered with a range of desired properties, including stretchability, ionic conductivity, biocompatibility, adhesiveness, and mechanical match with organs, as they can be designed with Young's modulus in the range of the human skin. This review covers different types of hydrogels, including biopolymer hydrogels, carbon‐based hydrogels, and self‐healing hydrogels, and presents their use in the components of supercapacitors and batteries such as electrolyte; electrode, binder, separating membrane, and current collector. We also explain how these hydrogels contribute to improved properties of the energy storage devices and include cases in which the hydrogel is used for several functions in the same device. The contribution of hydrogels in the development of flexible energy storage devices and their impact on electrochemical performance are also discussed.","[{""name"": ""Elahe Parvini"",

10.1002/er.6175,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Research on matching design method of waste heat reuse system of fuel cell vehicle considering system energy consumption and waste heat exchange rate,"SummaryThe research of hydrogen fuel cell waste heat recovery is a new field of fuel cell thermal management, which helps to improve the overall fuel utilization. At present, the research on the waste heat utilization of fuel cell vehicles is less, and it is more based on the traditional vehicle waste heat management ideas without systematic summary of the factors affecting the system performance. This study takes the waste heat reuse system of fuel cell vehicle as the research object, and established the waste heat exchange rate model and energy consumption model of the waste heat reuse system. Through the study of relevant parameter variables, the effects of parameters on system energy consumption and waste heat exchange rate at low temperature were obtained. The matching design of waste heat reuse system of 60 kW fuel cell vehicle was carried out, and the simulation analysis and experimental verification were done. The results showed that when the ambient temperature is −3°C and −6°C, the waste heat exchange rate of the new matching scheme is 16.2% and 16.3% higher than that of the original scheme, respectively. Also, the total energy consumption of the system is reduced by 62.02% and 60.62%, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Wei Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive Engineering Shandong Jiaotong University  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Fengyan Yi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive Engineering Shandong Jiaotong University  Jinan China""]}, {""name"": ""Donghai Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive and Traffic Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiaming Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Beijing Institute of Technology  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114932"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2011.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.042"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112830"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112328"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.052"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.12.026"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.09.023"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2018.09.063"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.08.132"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.031"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.114976"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.192"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.117495"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.083"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.022"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.062"", ""10.1063/1.3289832"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.080"", ""10.1007/s11664-015-3912-4"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.01.052"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2008.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2009.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2011.02.031"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.08.042"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2005.04.014""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Despite some progress in one-dimensional problems, there is still a paucity of benchmark studies that are easy to solve using traditional numerical methods albeit still challenging using neural networks for a wide range of practical problems. We present two networks, namely the Generalized Inverse Power Method Neural Network (GIPMNN) and Physics-Constrained GIPMNN (PC-GIPIMNN) to solve K-eigenvalue problems in neutron diffusion theory. GIPMNN follows the main idea of the inverse power method and determines the lowest eigenvalue using an iterative method. The PC-GIPMNN additionally enforces conservative interface conditions for the neutron flux. Meanwhile, Deep Ritz Method (DRM) directly solves the smallest eigenvalue by minimizing the eigenvalue in Rayleigh quotient form. A comprehensive study was conducted using GIPMNN, PC-GIPMNN, and DRM to solve problems of complex spatial geometry with variant material domains from the field of nuclear reactor physics. The methods were compared with the standard finite element method. The applicability and accuracy of the methods are reported and indicate that PC-GIPMNN outperforms GIPMNN and DRM.","[{""name"": ""Qi-Hong Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yang-Tao Deng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Qiao-Lin He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""He-Lin Gong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shi-Quan Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0306-4549(87)90074-0"", ""10.13182/NSE72-A22416"", ""10.1016/0306-4549(93)90076-2"", ""10.1115/1.4055379"", ""10.1016/0149-1970(86)90034-X"", ""10.1016/j.net.2019.05.015"", ""10.1134/S1063778812130042"", ""10.1002/9783527611041"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59560-3"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111868"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-12110-4_61"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2020.107346"", ""10.1007/s10915-022-02059-4"", ""10.1016/j.jocs.2021.101405"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2023.109864"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2023.109863"", ""10.1090/gsm/019"", ""10.1007/s40304-017-0117-6"", ""10.1073/pnas.1718942115"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2018.08.029"", ""10.1007/s40304-018-0127-z"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045"", ""10.1002/lpor.202100483"", ""10.1002/nme.7176"", ""10.1002/nme.6828"", ""10.1063/5.0058529"", ""10.1115/1.4050542"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2022.111716"", ""10.1364/OE.384875"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111302"", ""10.1007/s10915-022-02059-4"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111270"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3140726"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2019.05.027"", ""10.1016/j.ress.2021.107636"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2022.109656"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2007.10205"", ""10.1162/neco\\_a_01583"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2010.05075"", ""10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9891944"", ""10.1080/00295639.2022.2123211"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-88467-5_1"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109792"", ""10.1016/j.camwa.2023.07.013"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-01545-2"", ""10.13182/PHYSOR22-37488"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2020.113028"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2022.109234"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-22470-1"", ""10.1002/nme.6681"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2019.108963"", ""10.1016/j.cam.2022.114358"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111576"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1137/20M1318043"", ""10.1007/s10915-022-01881-0"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2008.01491"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2021.110242"", ""10.1002/nme.4533"", ""10.1515/jnum-2012-0013"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2018.02.050"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110833"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2021.108184"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2021.111113"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-65870-4_8"", ""10.1080/00295639.2021.2014752"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2022.109497"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2022.109431"", ""10.1080/00295639.2021.2014752""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

The study is conducted on samples of six soil types collected from Chateau Kefraya terroirs in Lebanon. Both methods succeeded in forecasting moisture giving high correlation values between the measured moisture and the predicted moisture when tested on unknown data.

10.1007/s41365-022-01073-3,NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0702 Physics,Levels and behavior of environmental tritium in East Asia,"AbstractFor a more systematic understanding of the levels of environmental tritium and its behavior in East Asia, a database on environmental tritium was established based on the literature published in the past 30 years. Subsequently, the levels and behavior of the environmental tritium were further studied by statistical analyses. The results indicate that the distribution of environmental tritium is inhomogeneous and complex. In areas without nuclear facilities, the level of environmental tritium has decreased to its background level, even though a certain number of atmospheric nuclear tests were performed before 1980. In general, the level of atmospheric tritium was marginally higher than the levels in precipitation and surface water; the levels in shallow groundwater and seawater were considerably lower. Furthermore, the levels of tritium in the atmosphere, precipitation, and inland surface water were strongly correlated with latitude and distance from the coastline. In soil and living organisms, the level of tissue-free water tritium (TFWT) was comparable to the tritium levels in local rainfall, whereas the persistence of organically bound tritium (OBT) in the majority of organisms resulted in an OBT/TFWT ratio greater than one. Conversely, extremely high levels of environmental tritium were observed near certain nuclear power plants and the Fukushima accident sites. These results highlight the requirement to know the tritium baseline level and its behavior in the environment beforehand to better assess the impact of tritium discharge. Further investigations of environmental tritium in East Asia using more efficient and adequate monitoring methods are also required.","[{""name"": ""Bin Feng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wei-Hai Zhuo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7733/jnfcwt.2018.16.1.11"", ""10.1002/2016JD025484"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.448"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-31208-9"", ""10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.01.035"", ""10.1016/j.envexpbot.2009.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.06.009"", ""10.3390/W12092414"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.026"", ""10.5194/acp-20-3555-2020"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2017.11.001"", ""10.1002/em.22200"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-56453-4"", ""10.1016/j.envint.2013.12.020"", ""10.1088/0952-4746/28/1/R01"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2020.109475"", ""10.1016/j.epsl.2015.06.043"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106427"", ""10.1021/es400896t"", ""10.1021/es302321n"", ""10.1007/s10967-020-07044-5"", ""10.1126/science.abc1507"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.110188"", ""10.1021/acs.est.9b03855"", ""10.1088/0952-4746/21/4/307"", ""10.1016/0883-2889(91)90143-O"", ""10.1023/A:1016024619727"", ""10.1016/j.radmeas.2006.06.006"", ""10.3969/j.issn.1000-8187.2014.01.008"", ""10.13182/FST08-A1813"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.05.005"", ""10.1007/BF02036007"", ""10.1080/18811248.2004.9726451"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncv241"", ""10.1080/18811248.2007.9711395"", ""10.1016/j.fusengdes.2021.112556"", ""10.1007/s10967-004-0477-8"", ""10.3969/j.issn.1672-2469.2021.01.008"", ""10.1007/s12665-017-6574-0"", ""10.1007/s10967-019-06720-5"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.427"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.12.069"", ""10.1016/0048-9697(94)90114-7"", ""10.13182/FST08-A1816"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.342"", ""10.1585/pfr.11.1305032"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncz087"", ""10.13182/FST11-A12669"", ""10.2343/geochemj.2.0423"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncr182"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(97)00093-3"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2015.11.094"", ""10.1007/s10967-012-2077-3"", ""10.1007/s10967-015-4340-x"", ""10.1007/s10967-010-0731-1"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.04.058"", ""10.16506/j.1009-6639.2000.01.006"", ""10.1088/0952-4746/16/2/008"", ""10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-5098.2013.05.020"", ""10.1007/s10967-020-07315-1"", ""10.19657/j.geoscience.1000-8527.2020.066"", ""10.13491/j.cnki.issn.1004-714x.2013.06.039"", ""10.1023/A:1016091912400"", ""10.13182/FST08-A1815"", ""10.13182/FST11-A12659"", ""10.1007/s10967-006-0005-0"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.04.014"", ""10.5194/bg-2021-10"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.362"", ""10.2343/geochemj.2.0499"", ""10.1093/rpd/nct024"", ""10.1038/s41598-020-76964-9"", ""10.1080/18811248.2007.9711573"", ""10.1080/00223131.2008.10875890"", ""10.1038/ngeo2590"", ""10.1016/S0969-8043(98)00075-X"", ""10.1007/s10040-008-0292-3"", ""10.13182/fst95-a30501"", ""10.1016/j.apgeochem.2011.02.007"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.10.040"", ""10.1007/s12665-013-2450-8"", ""10.1007/s12665-020-09281-z"", ""10.3390/ijerph16111921"", ""10.5194/hess-21-4419-2017"", ""10.1007/s12665-018-7425-3"", ""10.1007/s12517-019-4371-7"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncv244"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-12840-3"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.07.016"", ""10.1007/s12665-010-0747-4"", ""10.1007/s00254-004-1205-y"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.084"", ""10.1097/00004032-200006000-00013"", ""10.1007/s10967-010-0504-x"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.07.011"", ""10.1007/BF02036539"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.11.006"", ""10.1007/s41365-016-0087-5"", ""10.3969/j.issn.1002-2481.2020.04.27"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2019.108804"", ""10.11889/j.0253-3219.2018.hjs.41.120601"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.07.004"", ""10.1269/jrr.39.129"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.08.013"", ""10.1097/00004032-199210000-00002"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106504"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncv246"", ""10.1080/00223131.2014.921583"", ""10.1038/srep00947"", ""10.1097/00004032-199804000-00005"", ""10.1007/s41365-018-0412-2"", ""10.13182/FST11-A12656"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01007-z"", ""10.1021/es405654c"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00964-1"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncz105"", ""10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a006435"", ""10.1023/A:1015782726049""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['Geochemistry and Petrology', 'Global and Planetary Change', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.7485), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7296)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"
10.1002/er.7046,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Improvement of hydrogen storage characteristics of catalyst free magnesium nanoparticles prepared by wet milling,"SummaryMagnesium is one of the potential candidates for on‐board hydrogen storage, but slow hydrogenation kinetics and unfavourable thermodynamics limits its practical implementation. To improve the hydrogenation characteristics, nanocrystalline magnesium was prepared by a simple wet milling method without addition of heavy metal catalyst. Compared to micro‐crystalline Mg, developed nanocrystalline Mg exhibits improved hydrogen storage properties showing extended plateau region in the pressure‐composition‐temperature curves with higher hydrogen storage capacity (6.24 wt% at 300°C). Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics is found to follow Kolmogorov−Johnson−Mehl−Avrami activation energy model confirming the involvement of nucleation‐growth‐impingement mechanism. Prolonged ball milling leads to quite fast hydrogenation kinetics (upto 90% of the saturation value in 15.5 minutes at 250°C) and leads to substantial decrease in the activation barrier. The activation energy for hydrogenation is found to be 68.88 kJ mol−1 for 8 hours ball milled sample. Present study established a simple and scalable method for nanocrystalline Mg, which can undergo reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption with improved performance without using any additional catalyst.","[{""name"": ""Seemita Banrejee"", ""affiliation"": [""Chemistry Division Bhabha Atomic Research Centre  Mumbai India"", ""Homi Bhabha National Institute  Mumbai India""]}, {""name"": ""Asheesh Kumar"", ""affiliation"": [""Chemistry Division Bhabha Atomic Research Centre  Mumbai India""]}, {""name"": ""Priyanka Ruz"", ""affiliation"": [""Chemistry Division Bhabha Atomic Research Centre  Mumbai India""]}, {""name"": ""Vasanthakumaran Sudarsan"", ""affiliation"": [""Chemistry Division Bhabha Atomic Research Centre  Mumbai India"", ""Homi Bhabha National Institute  Mumbai India""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2004.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112182"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123833"", ""10.1002/er.3549"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.11.086"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.153548"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.12.212"", ""10.1007/s00339-016-9601-1"", ""10.1021/ja908398u"", ""10.1016/S0925-8388(00)00708-8"", ""10.1016/S0925-8388(99)00442-9"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.12.006"", ""10.1021/ic50069a016"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.10.055"", ""10.3390/met4030388"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.157"", ""10.1063/1.3000673"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.01.107"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.190"", ""10.1016/S1369-7021(08)70251-7"", ""10.3389/fchem.2019.00949"", ""10.1039/c2cc30740e"", ""10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.11.043"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.042"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.07.106"", ""10.1016/j.mtnano.2019.100064"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.11.135"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2012.07.001"", ""10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b02280"", ""10.1002/adma.201700760"", ""10.1016/j.jpcs.2014.06.014"", ""10.3390/en4010001"", ""10.1016/j.jma.2020.04.002"", ""10.1039/D0DT00025F"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.05.048"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.089"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.12.068"", ""10.1002/er.6006"", ""10.1021/acsanm.9b00694"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.090"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b13222"", ""10.1039/C5CC08801A"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.06.119"", ""10.1016/j.actamat.2009.05.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.135"", ""10.1039/d0ee03160g"", ""10.3166/acsm.31.135-144"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.02.191"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.73.224102"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227936"", ""10.1103/PhysRev.56.978"", ""10.1039/C8RA07068G"", ""10.1021/cm702897f"", ""10.1021/jp9002092"", ""10.1021/ja054569h"", ""10.1039/C8RA05596C"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.11.158"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.018"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.251"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.02.119"", ""10.1039/C5TA03721B"", ""10.1016/j.intermet.2009.07.012""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Catalysis', 'Biomaterials', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7169), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7168)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7179), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7085)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"
10.1002/er.8133,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Highly effective bi-functional electrochemical activity of Ag2O-PrO2/γ-Al2O3 electrocatalysts towards OER and ORR,"SummaryThe oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER), are the keystones for many energy generating and storage devices, have influence with many electrocatalytic reactions. The sluggish kinetics of these reaction is a challenging situation on the surface of electrodes which imposes large over‐potential and affects the energy output of fuel cells. Although the platinum‐based electrode materials have excellent activity toward ORR/OER but their high cost limits commercialization of fuel cells. To deal with this problem, platinum‐free electrode materials has aroused the considerations of scientists. The present work is proposed to study the oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation on the surface of xAg2O‐yPrO2/γ‐Al2O3/Glassy‐Carbon. The ORR was studied electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry on the surface of these nano‐catalysts while the OER was investigated via cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry in alkaline media. The mechanism of ORR on catalysts surface was enquired and the results indicate that ORR followed two electrons pathway in case of 10PrO2/γ‐Al2O3/Glassy‐Carbon while four electrons reduction pathway is identified on surface of others catalysts which divulged that addition of silver with praseodymium shifted the mechanism from 2e− to 4e− pathway. The electrocatalysts featured the stability during multiple scans and no corrosion of electrode in OER/ORR is observed. Different kinetic parameters for both reactions are determined which affirmed that both ORR and OER on the active surface of catalysts is irreversible and diffusion controlled. 4Ag2O‐6PrO2/γ‐Al2O3 is indicated to be proficient electro‐catalyst among other members of the series, having greater value of mass transport and diffusion coefficients.

10.1002/er.7037,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Experimental and model validation of a phase change material heat exchanger integrated into a real building,"SummaryLatent heat thermal energy storages (LHTES) are a promising technology with a wide range of applications in the framework of energy efficiency improvement. Phase change materials provide a big storage capacity, but their thermal conductivities are always extremely low. The use of finned tube heat exchangers is nowadays the best solution to enhance PCMs thermal performances. This allows significant charging and discharging rates. The major challenge concerns the balance between thermal performances and high material costs. A proper design of the heat transfer surfaces is essential to limit the system overall cost. Two different heat exchangers solutions, with radial and longitudinal fins are here examined. The design of the LHTES is performed by deploying a simplified FEM numerical model specifically developed for the application. A validation procedure based on laboratory tests with a small LHTES prototype was also carried out. The obtained results confirmed the reliability of the numerical model and justify its adoption as a tool for the design phase. The FEM model allows to effectively simulate the system thermal behaviour and assess the impact of the different HEX geometrical parameters on thermal performances. Based on this information it was possible to perform the optimization of the heat transfer surfaces and to derive the best heat exchanger layout in terms of material usage. The results showed that the solution with longitudinal fins is the most efficient, with 215 kg of steel less required for the realization of the finned heat exchanger.","[{""name"": ""Gabriele Triscari"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy (DENERG) Politecnico di Torino  Turin Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Michele Santovito"", ""affiliation"": [""i‐TES Thermal Energy Storage  Turin Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Maurizio Bressan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy (DENERG) Politecnico di Torino  Turin Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Davide Papurello"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy (DENERG) Politecnico di Torino  Turin Italy"", ""Energy Center Politecnico di Torino  Turin Italy""]}]","[""10.1787/681829d5-en"", ""10.1016/j.ijft.2019.100006"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101421"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.171"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101913"", ""10.3390/su10010191"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.11.115"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-20922-7_5"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2009.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.012"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.007"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.04.045"", ""10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2014.02.025"", ""10.1002/er.5268"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114102"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115017"", ""10.1016/S1359-4311(02)00192-8"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.02.045"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2012.11.079"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.01.060"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.167"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.03.020"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.07.015"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-68557-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-56026-2_4"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2009.04.007""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Mechanical Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1002/er.6233,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Evaluating the drop of electrochemical performance of Ni/YSZ and Ni/ScSZ solid oxide fuel cells operated with dry biogas,"SummaryThis work is aimed at evaluating the influence of carbon deposition on the power density drop of in‐house fabricated Ni/YSZ and Ni/ScSZ solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating in dry internal reforming of simulated biogas (CH4/CO2 = 2). An immediate drop of open‐circuit voltage (OCV) and maximum power densities is observed when the fuel changes from hydrogen to biogas, 86.5% and 33.3% for the Ni/YSZ and Ni/ScSZ cells, respectively with mass transfer polarisation dominates Ni/YSZ polarisation. Carbon deposition is investigated as the cause of the reduction in performance by quantification of deposited carbon by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and catalytic activity test. Results from TPO analysis show unexpectedly higher amount of carbon on the Ni/ScSZ cells (2.35 × 10−3 mgC/mgcat) as compared to Ni/YSZ (5.68 × 10−4 mgC/mgcat) despite higher performance of the former. Catalytic activity tests reveal a low carbon oxidation rate compared to an initially higher methane decomposition reaction, leading to carbon deposition in both cells, in which the methane decomposition reaction of Ni/ScSZ is higher. Different effects are observed on the pellets, where the carbon deposited on Ni/YSZ deactivates the reforming reaction sites as quick as 20 minutes into the operation, whereas carbon deposited on the Ni/ScSZ pellet did not show the same blocking effect on the catalyst due to the different carbon morphology formed. A graphitic whisker‐like rod structure is observed on Ni/ScSZ while amorphous non‐crystalline carbon covers the Ni/YSZ pellets with 3 hours exposure to high methane content dry biogas (CH4/CO2 = 2). The difference of carbon structure affects the amount of carbon quantified in the TPO analysis where most of the amorphous carbon oxidises while some of the graphitic carbon deposits remain.","[{""name"": ""Nor Anisa Arifin"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre of Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Research, School of Chemical Engineering University of Birmingham  Birmingham UK"", ""Institute of Sustainable Energy Universiti Tenaga Nasional  Kajang Malaysia""]}, {""name"": ""Abd Halim Shamsuddin"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Sustainable Energy Universiti Tenaga Nasional  Kajang Malaysia""]}, {""name"": ""Robert Steinberger‐Wilckens"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre of Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Research, School of Chemical Engineering University of Birmingham  Birmingham UK""]}]","[""10.1016/j.renene.2018.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.113044"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113854"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.08.256"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.08.111"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2012.07.031"", ""10.1007/s10008-010-1079-8"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.03.024"", ""10.1002/1521‐4095(200010)12:19<1465::AID‐ADMA1465>3.0.CO;2‐9"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.12.086"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.031"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.006"", ""10.1002/fuce.201700031"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2008.11.010"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.075"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.05.065"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.06.070"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.08.022"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-410453-2.00001-4"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/476/1/012074"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.11.028"", ""10.1016/J.JPOWSOUR.2013.01.017"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.02.008"", ""10.1002/fuce.201500179"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2017.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2017.11.030"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.05.020"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.037"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.10.115"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.111"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.09.082"", ""10.1533/9781845696511.156"", ""10.1039/C0DT01373K"", ""10.1088/1757‐899x/509/1/012064"", ""10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00284"", ""10.1149/2.1011906jes"", ""10.1016/j.jece.2019.103018"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.01.061"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.092"", ""10.1002/er.3332"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.01.192"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2018.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.09.220"", ""10.1002/er.4106"", ""10.1002/er.4210"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.05.069"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.07.071"", ""10.1149/06801.2503ecst"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2006.11.027"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.223"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2005.12.009"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2004.06.016"", ""10.1149/1.3435320"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2012.03.038"", ""10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00243-6"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.05.064"", ""10.1149/07801.1417ecst"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.01.151"", ""10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.033"", ""10.1016/J.RSER.2015.11.069"", ""10.1515/revce-2016-0022"", ""10.1007/s11581-013-0843-z"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.086"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.082"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11274-4_70"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.101"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.02.043"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.11.005""]","['Energy', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1002/er.8400,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Enhancing anion conduction stability of quaternized poly(phenylene) oxide-based anion exchange membranes with ionic liquids modified carbon nanomaterials,"SummaryThe anion exchange membrane (AEM) with high and stable conductivity is important to the commercial application of anion exchange membrane fuel cell. The AEM based on the polymer of quaternized poly(phenylene) oxide (QPPO) with enhanced anion conduction stability has been constructed through the introduction of the ionic liquid (IL) of 1‐aminopropyl‐3‐methylimidazolium bromide (APMIMBr)‐modified carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes oxide (OCNT) and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The IL‐OCNT and IL‐GO composites prevented hydroxyl groups from attacking the polymer of QPPO. Thus, QPPO/x(IL‐OCNT) and QPPO/x(IL‐GO) series membranes possessed enhanced hydroxide conductivity stability in alkaline solution. Specifically, QPPO/5%(IL‐OCNT) and QPPO/5%(IL‐GO) membranes exhibited the hydroxide conductivities of 23.0 and 28.5 mS/cm at 80°C. Notably, the hydroxide conductivities could reach 16.3 and 30.2 mS/cm while the prepared membranes were immersed in 2 M KOH solution for 1848 h. Furthermore, the stable hydroxide conductivity was derived from the fine dimension stability and mechanical property. The tensile stress values were, respectively, 19.4 and 19.8 MPa even if the membranes were immersed in alkaline solution.

We present a new design of qGAN, the dual-Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) GAN, which consists of a classical discriminator and two quantum generators which take the form of PQCs. The first PQC learns a probability distribution over N-pixel images, while the second generates normalized pixel intensities of an individual image for each PQC input. With a view to HEP applications, we evaluated the dual-PQC architecture on the task of imitating calorimeter outputs, translated into pixelated images. The results demonstrate that the model can reproduce a fixed number of images with a reduced size as well as their probability distribution and we anticipate it should allow us to scale up to real calorimeter outputs.","[{""name"": ""Su Yeon Chang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Steven Herbert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sofia Vallecorsa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Elías F.

In this regard, the performance of the propylene carbonate (PC) and tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) based DES (PC/TBAI‐DES) as a new electrolyte solvent for DSSCs is evaluated for the first time. Herein, the effects of various electrolyte components, namely the amount of acetonitrile (AN), iodine, and 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium iodide (EmimI), are investigated. The optimal conditions are achieved with an electrolyte composition of 0.1 M of iodine and EmimI in a binary mixture of PC/TBAI‐DES and AN (volume ratio 80:20). The DSSCs based on this electrolyte attained a significant conversion efficiency of 10.04% (Jsc = 21.94 mA cm2, Voc = 0.78 V, and FF = 0.58) under 1 sun (AM 1.5) illumination. Moreover, a detailed view of the molecular arrangement of PC/TBAI‐DES solution near the titanium dioxide and platinum solid surfaces as electrodes of DSSCs is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Besides, the interaction parameters between TBAI ion pair and PC molecule are determined through density functional theory.","[{""name"": ""Raheleh Ahmadi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences Shiraz University  Shiraz Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Maryam Heydari Dokoohaki"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences Shiraz University  Shiraz Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Javad Tashkhourian"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences Shiraz University  Shiraz Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Amin R.

Herein, we present the electrocatalytic OER/HER of Co‐ and Ni‐incorporated WB2 (W(1‐x)TMxB2: TM = Ni and Co; x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) under alkaline media. Metal‐substituted WB2 was constructed with two different synthetic approaches, molten salt (ms) and carbothermal (ct) reduction, to explore the influence of morphology on electrochemical properties to drive OER/HER in 1 M KOH. In general, materials synthesized by the ms technique are relatively better catalysts toward OER/HER. Among the samples, W0.8Co0.2B2/ms demanded the lowest respective overpotential of 340 and 363 mV to generate the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for OER/HER and exhibited favorable stability at 10 mA cm−2 for 12 h which were ascribed to high double‐layer capacitance (0.247 mF cm−2) and low charge‐transfer resistance.","[{""name"": ""Ezgi Hatipoglu"", ""affiliation"": [""Koç University Boron and Advanced Materials Application and Research Center (KUBAM) Koç University  Istanbul Sariyer Turkey"", ""Graduate School of Sciences and Engineering Koç University  Istanbul Sariyer Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Naeimeh Sadat Peighambardoust"", ""affiliation"": [""Koç University Boron and Advanced Materials Application and Research Center (KUBAM) Koç University  Istanbul Sariyer Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Ebrahim Sadeghi"", ""affiliation"": [""Koç University Boron and Advanced Materials Application and Research Center (KUBAM) Koç University  Istanbul Sariyer Turkey"", ""Graduate School of Sciences and Engineering Koç University  Istanbul Sariyer Turkey""]}, {""name"": ""Umut Aydemir"", ""affiliation"": [""Koç University Boron and Advanced Materials Application and Research Center (KUBAM) Koç University  Istanbul Sariyer Turkey"", ""Department of Chemistry Koç University  Istanbul Sariyer Turkey""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.05.043"", ""10.1021/acscatal.7b04286"", ""10.1021/acscatal.8b02901"", ""10.1002/ange.201611756"", ""10.1021/acscatal.9b02457"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b06832"", ""10.1021/acsenergylett.6b00219"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b17836"", ""10.1021/acscatal.7b00120"", ""10.1021/acscatal.6b02479"", ""10.1039/D0CC01931C"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2015.11.020"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113953"", ""10.1021/acscatal.8b01794"", ""10.1002/adfm.201906481"", ""10.3389/fchem.2020.592915"", ""10.1002/aenm.201502313"", ""10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02550"", ""10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03374"", ""10.1039/C9TC01862J"", ""10.1002/aenm.201803369"", ""10.1039/D0QI00146E"", ""10.1039/D0CC02246B"", ""10.1002/cssc.201901301"", ""10.1039/C9CC03638E"", ""10.1039/D1QI01419F"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164148"", ""10.1038/s41598-021-83066-7"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2021.138789"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.08.006"", ""10.1021/cm702327g"", ""10.1111/jace.16788"", ""10.1039/C6CP04287B"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2015.08.129"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.03.294"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.11.071"", ""10.1039/D0CC06072K"", ""10.1021/acsami.0c10441"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.02.100"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b02281"", ""10.1002/smll.201502106"", ""10.1002/adfm.201706008"", ""10.1039/c1cp21228a"", ""10.1021/acscatal.0c01273"", ""10.1039/C6CS00328A"", ""10.1039/D0CC00070A"", ""10.1002/anie.201915663"", ""10.1039/C8TA00163D"", ""10.1002/smtd.202000988"", ""10.1039/C8NR02142B"", ""10.1021/ja407115p"", ""10.1007/s10008-013-2314-x""]","['Engineering', 'Energy', 'Materials Science']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

Currently, various metals‐based organic materials, metal oxide nanoparticles, and metal nanomaterials have been urbanized as light harvesting photocatalysts for direct carbon (C)‐hydrogen (H) arylation of aryl diazonium salts and heteroarenes. These light harvesting photocatalysts, however, still suffer from poor stability, reusability problem, high cost, or less selectivity. Herein, we report the fabrication of a novel chitosan‐based fluorescein isothiocyanate (CBFITC) film photocatalyst and demonstrate its tremendous photocatalytic activity, high yields (97 ± 0.015%), selectivity (99%), and reusability to catalyze the metal free solar‐light‐mediated direct CH arylation of aryl diazonium salts and heteroarenes at ambient temperature. Moreover, CBFITC film photocatalyst can be recycled more than five times without loss of activity, verifying this photocatalyst excellent light harvesting ability and stability. The present approach to fabricate a metal‐free film photocatalyst with the suitable band gap will be a new platform for efficient photocatalytic reaction and provide a new insight into the solar chemical synthesis.","[{""name"": ""Pooja Singh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Chemistry and Environmental Science Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology  Gorakhpur‐273010, Uttar Pradesh India""]}, {""name"": ""Rajesh K.

10.1002/er.8328,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Zinc-ion battery based on heteroatom-doped improved-quality graphene film as a functional current collector,"SummaryOwing to their acceptable level of safety performances, low cost, and easy assembly, zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs) have attracted attention as encouraging energy storage devices. However, the intrinsic deficiency of the carbon‐based current collector used to enhance the energy storage performances of ZIBs has limited the further application of ZIBs. To address this, the technical streaming of current collectors via the functionalization of their surface to enhance their chemical activity has appeared as a promising method for future‐oriented ZIBs. Here, a fluorine and nitrogen codoped improved‐quality graphene film was fabricated as a functional current collector for ZIBs, and the synergistic effect of the increased electrical conductivity and enhanced wettability of the current collector on the energy storage performance of ZIBs was demonstrated. The results revealed that the fabricated ZIB exhibited a high specific capacity of 380 mAh/g at a current density of 0.3 A/g, a remarkable long cycle life with a capacity retention of 80.6% for up to 150 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and a high energy density of 135 W h/kg and a power density from 270 W/kg. Moreover, the solid‐state ZIB exhibited an outstanding mechanical flexibility and safety.","[{""name"": ""Seoyeong Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy System Engineering Gyeongsang National University  Jinju South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Geon‐Hyoung An"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy System Engineering Gyeongsang National University  Jinju South Korea"", ""Department of Energy Engineering Future Convergence Technology Research Institute, Gyeongsang National University  Jinju South Korea""]}]","[""10.1039/C8EE01419A"", ""10.1039/C4EE03051F"", ""10.1002/er.7624"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.08.064"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2021.04.041"", ""10.1016/j.mtadv.2021.100149"", ""10.1039/C9CS00349E"", ""10.1002/aenm.201902981"", ""10.1021/acsami.0c10512"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2021.128916"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2022.134738"", ""10.1039/D1TA04051K"", ""10.1038/s41467-021-25848-1"", ""10.1002/er.6830"", ""10.1002/adfm.202104256"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2021.11.008"", ""10.1039/C5TA06012E"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.139"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2015.08.019"", ""10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04889"", ""10.1002/adma.201701972"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2020.124228"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.06.038"", ""10.1038/nenergy.2016.119"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.04.111"", ""10.1039/C7TA07160D""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

However, these systems face challenges that require a deeper understanding of the coupling between the distribution networks and the connected buildings, to enable demand-side management and balance the intermittence of renewables. In recent years, many smart energy meters have been installed on the heating systems of Danish dwellings connected to district heating, and the first yearly measurement data sets of large building clusters are now available. This article presents the methodology for the pre-processing and cluster analysis (K-means clustering) of a one-year-long smart energy meter measurement data from 1665 Danish dwellings connected to district heating. The aim is to identify typical household daily profiles of heat energy use, return temperature, and temperature difference between the supply and the return fluid. The study is performed with the free software environment “R”, which enables the rapid extraction of information to be shared with professionals of the building and energy sectors. After presenting the preliminary results of the clustering analysis, the article closes with the future work to be conducted on this study case.","[{""name"": ""Hicham Johra"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Leiria"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Per Heiselberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anna Marszal-Pomianowska"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Torben Tvedebrink"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.energy.2009.11.023"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.075"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.015"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.05.016"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.07.030"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.063"", ""10.32614/RJ-2017-009""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Building and Construction', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Participants were instructed to estimate the radiation dose administrated to patients during common radiological procedures. I received 100 survey responses. Only 13% (n = 13) of the participants correctly identified the effective radiation dose from 1-view chest and abdominal X-ray, whereas 7% (n = 7) correctly identified the dose from 2-view chest X-ray. Approximately half of the participants underestimated the patient dose from head and abdominal computed tomography and 2-view unilateral mammogram. Moreover, 17–26% correctly estimated the patient’s risk of fatal cancer from common radiological procedures. These results revealed a remarkably low level of knowledge among radiographers regarding radiation dose and risks. The vast majority of radiographers underestimated radiation doses and associated risks from common radiological examinations. The number of bachelor’s programs in Saudi Arabia has been extremely limited in the past decade. Most radiographers hold a diploma degree, which does not include any courses on radiation dose or protection. Continuous professional development in radiation safety is required to practice radiography.","[{""name"": ""F.M.

10.1002/er.8408,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Preliminary lightweight core design analysis of a micro-transportable gas-cooled thermal reactor,"SummaryMicro nuclear reactors with small sizes have a wide range of applications. The present study discusses the lightweight core design for a micro‐transportable gas‐cooled thermal reactor. The main objective of this design is to reach an output power of 20 MWt for a lifetime of several years without refueling. To this end, a moderator is introduced in the assembly design to help decrease the volume fraction of the fuel inventory, and a reflector slider is used to control reactivity. A two‐dimensional assembly model is established using the Monte Carlo code OpenMC to gain insights into the influences of design parameters on the core mass and neutronic performances. In this regard, various parameters, including the assembly configuration, pitch‐to‐diameter ratio, and moderator material, are analyzed. It is found that using the BeO moderator can achieve a low critical mass of approximately 5 metric tons. To fulfill the target thermal power, 37 fuel assemblies are arrayed in four rings, and pure beryllium is selected as the most appropriate reflector material. Meanwhile, the utilization of a low‐density reflector yields a more compact design with a core weight of 8.06 metric tons. Finally, core performance features, including depletion, power profiles, flux distributions, and reactivity feedback coefficients, are analyzed. The obtained results reveal that the proposed design can sustain full power generation for over 10 years without refueling. Moreover, an adequate shutdown margin is ensured using reflector sliders to control the reactivity, and negative reactivity coefficients guarantee the inherent safety of the core.","[{""name"": ""Chaoran Guan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Nuclear Science and Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiang Chai"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Nuclear Science and Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Tengfei Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Nuclear Science and Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaojing Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Nuclear Science and Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.pnucene.2021.103822"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.11.255"", ""10.1177/1757482X18765377"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110569"", ""10.1002/er.5329"", ""10.1002/er.4119"", ""10.1002/er.6661"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2019.106948"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2021.108632"", ""10.1002/er.3686"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2021.111603"", ""10.1051/epjconf/202124701005"", ""10.1002/er.6042"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2022.104189"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2021.103830"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2016.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2015.04.028"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2019.103184"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2014.06.030"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2020.108040"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2014.07.048"", ""10.1016/j.nds.2011.11.002""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

Such harsh environments are typically encountered in nuclear reactor measurement locations as well as high-level radioactive waste and/or “hot” dismantlingdecommissioning operations. In the present fleet of commercial nuclear reactors, temperatures in excess of 300 °C are often encountered, and temperatures up to 800 °C are anticipated in advanced reactor designs. The wide bandgap for SiC (3.27 eV) compared to more widely used semiconductors such as silicon (1.12 eV at room temperature) has allowed low-noise measurements to be carried out at temperatures up to 700 °C. The concentration of thermally induced charge carriers in SiC at 700 °C is about four orders of magnitude less than that of silicon at room temperature. Furthermore, SiC radiation detectors have been demonstrated to be much more resistant to the effects of radiation-induced damage than more conventional semiconductors such as silicon, germanium, or cadmium zinc telluride (CZT), and have been demonstrated to be operational after extremely high gamma-ray, neutron, and charged-particle doses. The purpose of the present review is to provide an updated state of the art for SiC neutron detectors and to explore their applications in harsh high-temperature, high-radiation nuclear reactor applications. Conclusions related to the current state-of-the-art of SiC neutron detectors will be presented, and specific ideal applications will be discussed.","[{""name"": ""Frank H.

Generally, a helium–xenon gas mixture with a molecular weight of 14.5–40.0 g/mol is adopted as the working fluid to reduce the mass and volume of the turbomachinery. The Prandtl number for helium–xenon mixtures with this recommended mixing ratio may be as low as 0.2. As the convective heat transfer is closely related to the Prandtl number, different heat transfer correlations are often needed for fluids with various Prandtl numbers. Previous studies have established heat transfer correlations for fluids with medium–high Prandtl numbers (such as air and water) and extremely low-Prandtl fluids (such as liquid metals); however, these correlations cannot be directly recommended for such helium–xenon mixtures without verification. This study initially assessed the applicability of existing Nusselt number correlations, finding that the selected correlations are unsuitable for helium–xenon mixtures. To establish a more general heat transfer correlation, a theoretical derivation was conducted using the turbulent boundary layer theory. Numerical simulations of turbulent heat transfer for helium–xenon mixtures were carried out using Ansys Fluent. Based on simulated results, the parameters in the derived heat transfer correlation are determined. It is found that calculations using the new correlation were in good agreement with the experimental data, verifying its applicability to the turbulent heat transfer for helium–xenon mixtures. The effect of variable gas properties on turbulent heat transfer was also analyzed, and a modified heat transfer correlation with the temperature ratio was established. Based on the working conditions adopted in this study, the numerical error of the property-variable heat transfer correlation was almost within 10%.","[{""name"": ""Biao Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu Ji"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jun Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu-Liang Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2011.02.024"", ""10.1080/00295450.2020.1832814"", ""10.1007/s41365-018-0537-3"", ""10.2514/1.27664"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2007.06.050"", ""10.1063/1.1358045"", ""10.1007/s41365-018-0525-7"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2009.04.035"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2007.10.021"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2019.106986"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110569"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2017.10.010"", ""10.1007/s10512-018-0414-5"", ""10.1016/0735-1933(85)90003-X"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(64)90125-5"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(79)90118-2"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(88)90218-9"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2019.110220"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2014.03.080"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.02.041"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.10.096"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2011.07.010"", ""10.1017/jfm.2019.432"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(60)90016-8"", ""10.1016/0009-2509(72)87065-9"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2013.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2005.09.006"", ""10.1021/i160061a021"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110738"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(81)90220-9"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-52919-5"", ""10.1016/S0017-9310(97)00084-7"", ""10.1016/0009-2509(67)80205-7"", ""10.1016/S0017-9310(99)00218-5"", ""10.1205/cherd06002"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.03.082"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(72)90131-7"", ""10.2514/6.2006-4154"", ""10.1299/jsmeicone.2019.27.1960"", ""10.1146/annurev.fl.22.010190.000245"", ""10.1002/aic.690220105"", ""10.1016/S0017-9310(00)00009-0"", ""10.1115/1.2911398"", ""10.1016/S0142-727X(98)10026-7""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

The recycling processes such as bioleaching are much simpler and environment friendly but lack the required efficiency for metal recovery to prove the commercial feasibility of the model. This work focuses on increasing the efficiency of the bioleaching process by targeting its intermediate processes for maximum vital metal recovery. The intermediate process of biomass generation from Aspergillus niger fungus is targeted. The data from experimental design is modelled using support vector regression with v‐fold cross‐validation. The bioleaching process is optimized such that maximum biomass concentration is obtained for efficient and commercially viable metal recovery. The results are divided into four sections, each addressing an important issue of the recycling process mechanism. The generated model is found to have good stability and accurate process mechanism predictability. Global sensitivity and interaction analysis is employed for efficient weighted optimization. The model generated trends and optimization results are verified through the profiling curve as well as past literature experimental data. This work reports the maximum biomass concentration of 25 g/L. The model employed is stable and efficient, reaching a stable optimized value under 300 iterations. The optimized input parameters values obtained are 144.39 g/L, 1.29% v/v, 6.70, 1513.05 ppm, 4989.79 ppm, 2094.22 ppm, 347.57 ppm and 2.37 for sucrose concentration, inoculum size, initial pH, oxalic acid, gluconic acid, malic acid, citric acid concentration and final pH, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Chaitanya Ruhatiya"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering, École Centrale School of Engineering Mahindra University  Hyderabad India""]}, {""name"": ""Ruthvik Gandra"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering, École Centrale School of Engineering Mahindra University  Hyderabad India""]}, {""name"": ""P Kondaiah"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering, École Centrale School of Engineering Mahindra University  Hyderabad India""]}, {""name"": ""Kura Manivas"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering, École Centrale School of Engineering Mahindra University  Hyderabad India""]}, {""name"": ""Aditya Samhith"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering, École Centrale School of Engineering Mahindra University  Hyderabad India""]}, {""name"": ""Liang Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment &amp; Technology, School of Mechanical Science and Engineering Huazhong University of Science and Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Jasmine Siu Lee Lam"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil and Environmental Engineering Nanyang Technological University  Singapore Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Akhil Garg"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Digital Manufacturing Equipment &amp; Technology, School of Mechanical Science and Engineering Huazhong University of Science and Technology  Wuhan China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2019.01.023"", ""10.1002/anie.201703772"", ""10.1002/adma.201800561"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1682-5"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.12.006"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b03811"", ""10.1021/acs.est.9b03725"", ""10.1016/j.jece.2019.103335"", ""10.3390/met9090994"", ""10.1016/j.hydromet.2019.105122"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31834-5_4"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2020.122859"", ""10.1016/j.biteb.2020.100389"", ""10.1115/1.4044358"", ""10.1007/s41918-018-0012-1"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b01494"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.363"", ""10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00535"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.086"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.04.104"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2016.10.034"", ""10.1115/1.4045194"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2019.135314""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

The first batch of 20 sets of 1.3 GHz coupler prototypes was fabricated from three domestic manufacturers for the SHINE project. To better characterize the radio frequency conditioning phenomena for validating the performance of power couplers, a room temperature test stand was designed, constructed, and commissioned for the SHINE 1.3 GHz power couplers. In addition, a horizontal test cryostat was built to test the 1.3 GHz superconducting cavities, fundamental power couplers, tuners, and other components as a set. The results of these tests indicate that the 1.3 GHz couplers are capable of handling up to 14 kW continuous waves.

The use of an external solar dish raises the effects of the water basin, resulting in a higher rate of evaporation. The stepped still was designed, built, and tested in Ismailia, Egypt, using local weather conditions. The proposed SS had a 1 m2 base area and eight steps, a solar dish with a concentration ratio of 80, a cone tank, two centrifugal pumps, four photovoltaic modules totaling 1000 W, a control unit, and solenoid valves. The impact of utilizing the storage material during the phases was investigated. A nozzle was installed at the top of the cone tank. Four mass flow rates of circulated water were examined 250, 350, 450, and 550 mL/min. The control unit receives inputs from the photovoltaic output, photodiodes, and water temperature inside the cone. The control unit outputs the signal for the two solar dish motors, centrifugal pumps, and solenoid valves. First, a standard stepped SS, second, a stepped SS using phase change material (PCM), and finally, a stepped SS using PCM combined with a solar dish were investigated. The conventional stepped SSs with PCM had an optimal mass flow rate of 250 mL/min, whereas the stepped SS integrated with the solar dish had 550 mL/min of mass flow rate (an optimum value). The highest daily freshwater productivity was 7.63, 9.18, 11.23, and 13.9 kg/d for water spraying mass flow rates of 250, 350, 450, and 550 mL/min, respectively, with 0.0161 $/L/m2 of a maximum projected cost, according to data from an integrated stepped SS.","[{""name"": ""Mohamed M.

10.1002/er.5783,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Experimental investigation and numerical analysis of energy efficiency building using phase changing material coupled with reflective coating,"SummaryWith growing population in India, utilization of natural energy plays a significant role in reducing the space and resource constraints. Also, due to climate change and urbanization, future generation in the cities is mainly affected by overheating. One way to reduce the use of artificial energy is to decrease the thermal conductivity of the buildings by introducing phase changing materials (PCM). PCM reduces the energy requirements and peak temperature of the buildings. The main focus of this study is to reduce artificial energy in buildings by employing cool roof strategies. Initially, the conventional room was tested and it is compared with PCM and room with PCM‐reflecting coating. The parameters which influence the thermal stress in buildings such as, transition temperature, latent heat, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, PCM thickness, and absorption coefficient are measured and compared. PCM with insulated coating shows lower thermal conductivity than conventional buildings and PCM incorporated buildings. On the other hand, after 90 days of weathering PCM with reflective coating roof showed 15% less thermal conductivity than conventional roof. The results showed that, there is a temperature difference on cool roof and delay time for the peak temperature between models is beyond 2 hours compared to conventional roof. The effect of PCM layer thickness with insulated coatings on the thermal performance of roof is relatively good compared with conventional roof. Maximum temperature and heat flux values were recorded at 3.30 pm for all the absorption coefficient values except 0.7.","[{""name"": ""Rajasree Shanmuganathan"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Research and Development Duy Tan University  Da Nang Vietnam""]}, {""name"": ""Manigandan Sekar"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Aeronautical Engineering Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology  Chennai India""]}, {""name"": ""T.

Its columnar layout drives rapid analyses, as only those parts (“branches”) that are really used in a given analysis need to be read from storage. Its unique feature is the seamless C++ integration, which allows users to directly store their event classes without explicitly defining data schemas. In this contribution, we present the status and plans of the future ROOT 7 event I/O. Along with the ROOT 7 interface modernization, we aim for robust, where possible compile-time safe C++ interfaces to read and write event data. On the performance side, we show first benchmarks using ROOT’s new experimental I/O subsystem that combines the best of TTrees with recent advances in columnar data formats. A core ingredient is a strong separation of the high-level logical data layout (C++ classes) from the low-level physical data layout (storage backed nested vectors of simple types). We show how the new, optimized physical data layout speeds up serialization and deserialization and facilitates parallel, vectorized and bulk operations. This lets ROOT I/O run optimally on the upcoming ultra-fast NVRAM storage devices, as well as file-less storage systems such as object stores.","[{""name"": ""Jakob Blomer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Philippe Canal"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Axel Naumann"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Danilo Piparo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0168-9002(97)00048-X"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1085/3/032020"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1085/4/042008"", ""10.1051/epjconf/201921406021""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Information Systems and Management', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

Contemporarily, researchers strive to achieve longer plasma pulses, and therefore, appropriate hardware is required. Analogue-to-Digital Converters are applied for data acquisition in many plasma diagnostic systems. Some diagnostic systems need data acquisition with gigahertz sampling frequency. However, gigasample digitizers working in continuous mode generate an enormous stream of data that requires suitable, high-performance processing systems. This becomes even more complicated and expensive for complex multi-channel systems. Nonetheless, numerous plasma diagnostic systems operate in a pulse mode. Thomson scattering (TS) diagnostics is a good example of a multi-channel system that does not require continuous data acquisition. Taking this into consideration, the authors decided to evaluate the CAEN DT5742 gigasample digitizer as a more cost-effective solution that would utilize the pulsed nature of the TS diagnostic system. The paper presents a complete data acquisition and processing system dedicated for plasma diagnostics based on the ITER real-time framework (RTF). Integration of RTF with real hardware is discussed. The authors of the paper have developed software including RTF function block for the CAEN DT5742 digitizer, example data processing algorithms, data archiving and publishing for plasma control system.","[{""name"": ""M.

This study investigates the feasibility of producing bioethanol and the commercially important EPS from a non‐nitrogen fixing marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus BDU 10144 in a novel low‐cost seawater‐fertilizer medium for the development of a biorefinery strategy. Herein, agricultural fertilizer diammonium phosphate (DAP) (nitrogen source), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and potassium were optimized by the central composite design to produce maximum biomass and carbohydrate accretion. The optimal physical conditions for attaining maximum growth and carbohydrate accumulation were determined to be pH 10, 50 μmol m−2 s−1 (light intensity) and 25°C. Further, different concentrations of seawater were mixed with the optimized fertilizer‐salts, and it was observed that 70% of seawater mixed with the optimized fertilizer‐salts (hereafter FSW medium) was an optimum condition for growing the test cyanobacterium, which ultimately reduced the cost of the medium by &gt;40 times compared to the standard artificial seawater nutrient (ASN‐III) medium. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum biomass (1.79 g/L) and carbohydrate (702.4 mg/L) yield obtained were ~1.7 and 2.2 times higher than the ASN‐III. The yield of bioethanol was noted to be 318.1 mg/L, which was ~2.3 times greater than ASN‐III. The commercially important EPS was obtained from the discarded supernatant (0.28 g/L), which was ~1.6 times higher in the FSW medium. Thus, the present investigation paves a way forward for mass cultivation of the S. elongatus BDU 1044 in the novel FSW medium for the cost‐efficient and sustainable development of a biorefinery concept.","[{""name"": ""Neha Chandra"", ""affiliation"": [""Agricultural and Food Engineering Department Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur  Kharagpur West Bengal India""]}, {""name"": ""Nirupama Mallick"", ""affiliation"": [""Agricultural and Food Engineering Department Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur  Kharagpur West Bengal India""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2016.07.024"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125079"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137116"", ""10.1007/s10811-017-1297-x"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.07.064"", ""10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.038"", ""10.1007/s10811-010-9626-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-35734-4_11-1"", ""10.1186/s13068-020-1660-z"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152795"", ""10.3390/polysaccharides2040046"", ""10.1016/S0958-6946(01)00112-1"", ""10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131153"", ""10.1007/s10811-014-0292-8"", ""10.1016/j.copbio.2017.11.018"", ""10.1007/s11274-013-1413-2"", ""10.1007/s10811-017-1377-y"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2019.121681"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2021.111464"", ""10.3390/w13040486"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.09.018"", ""10.1002/bit.22033"", ""10.1007/s10811-006-9108-9"", ""10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.11.002"", ""10.1099/00221287-111-1-1"", ""10.1016/S0176-1617(11)80732-7"", ""10.9734/ARRB/2018/38182"", ""10.1016/S0580-9517(08)70641-X"", ""10.1016/S0076-6879(57)03489-8"", ""10.1021/ac60111a017"", ""10.1016/j.bcab.2020.101632"", ""10.1016/S0021-9258(19)52451-6"", ""10.1139/y59-099"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.052"", ""10.1021/ac60147a030"", ""10.1016/S0003-2697(69)80009-6"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2006.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.02.254"", ""10.1007/s10295-008-0497-4"", ""10.1007/s11694-016-9463-4"", ""10.2323/jgam.62.7"", ""10.1016/j.ejar.2012.09.003"", ""10.1016/0144-4565(87)90061-8"", ""10.1186/s40643-021-00389-z"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.012"", ""10.1111/pre.12099"", ""10.1039/C6RA27286J"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2014.12.092"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2020.10.086"", ""10.1007/s13205-017-0812-8"", ""10.3390/en6094607"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-817937-6.00003-5"", ""10.3390/w12020407"", ""10.2166/wst.2021.319"", ""10.3390/en12122233"", ""10.1016/j.cep.2009.03.006"", ""10.1098/rspb.2003.2538"", ""10.1104/pp.103.038323"", ""10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.01.010"", ""10.1007/s00253-015-7024-0"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.06.303"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2006.08.028"", ""10.1016/j.algal.2018.04.021"", ""10.1007/s12010-016-2241-2"", ""10.1016/j.cogsc.2018.06.008"", ""10.1186/1754-6834-7-64"", ""10.3390/en6083937"", ""10.5012/bkcs.2013.34.2.379"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2012.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2014.10.065"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.046"", ""10.1007/s12298-016-0380-0"", ""10.3390/md16020069"", ""10.1016/j.jes.2017.05.020"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-60147-7_1"", ""10.1002/bit.10912"", ""10.1080/08927014.2011.562605"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2008.07.002"", ""10.3923/rjes.2015.28.38"", ""10.1016/0141-8130(90)90057-H"", ""10.1111/j.1744-7909.2006.00291.x"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2022.134895"", ""10.3390/app10113763"", ""10.1016/S0031-9422(99)00202-2"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.554-556.1009"", ""10.1007/s10811-016-0963-8"", ""10.1002/elsc.201800082"", ""10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.05.117"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.091"", ""10.18331/BRJ2018.5.1.5"", ""10.1016/j.algal.2018.02.001""]","['Nursing', 'Energy', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Nutrition and Dietetics', 'Molecular Biology', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('1011 护理学', 0.7465), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7157), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7101), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7061), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7035)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7392), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7295)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

Nowhere else does global heating occur faster. Negative impacts of climate change will increase the strain on wooden structures and can daily be observed at Svalbard. The severe changes affect the degradation rate of wooden constructions, including cultural heritage. Certain microclimates, also in Polar areas, are favourable to fungal growth and decay. The probable enhancing effects climate change have on fungal degradation in wooden structures are however alarming. The paper displays findings of measurements from four different case study projects at Svalbard between 2009 and 2019. The results have been analysed separately, compiled and discussed in context, and towards relevant literature. We claim that impacts of climate change may not be generalized in order to predict effects in building materials. Further, that with extended knowledge on how climate change affects natural development of fungal decay, negative impacts may be reduced. Lessons learned from high Arctic areas might add longevity and sustainability to wooden cultural heritage constructions, also in different areas and environments.

These challenges include developing a model for algorithms to offload their computations on the co-processors as well as keeping the traditional CPU busy doing other work. The CMS data processing framework, CMSSW, implements multithreading using the Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library, that utilizes tasks as concurrent units of work. In this paper we will discuss a generic mechanism to interact effectively with non-CPU resources that has been implemented in CMSSW. In addition, configuring such a heterogeneous system is challenging. In CMSSW an application is configured with a configuration file written in the Python language. The algorithm types are part of the configuration. The challenge therefore is to unify the CPU and co-processor settings while allowing their implementations to be separate. We will explain how we solved these challenges while minimizing the necessary changes to the CMSSW framework. We will also discuss on a concrete example how algorithms would offload work to NVIDIA GPUs using directly the CUDA API.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Bocci"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Dagenhart"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vincenzo Innocente"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Jones"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matti Kortelainen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Felice Pantaleo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marco Rovere"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08001""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Hardware and Architecture', 'Information Systems and Management', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7741), ('1205 信息资源管理', 0.7676)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

Experimental results showed that for the iron‐nickel oxygen carrier with a loading ratio of 3% NiO under reaction conditions of 800°C, ratio of steam content to biomass (S/B) of 1.25, and ratio of lattice oxygen to biomass (O/B) of 0.2, the volume fraction of hydrogen in the synthesized gas reached 43.06%; correspondingly, the carbon conversion rate was 78.22%, the low calorific value of syngas was 7.49 MJ/Nm3, and the gas production rate was 1.25 Nm3/kg. After modification of the iron‐nickel oxygen carrier with a mass ratio of 5% K2CO3, the volume fraction of hydrogen in the prepared synthesis gas increased to 47.83%, the corresponding carbon conversion rate was 85.44%, and the low‐level calorific value was 7.95 MJ/Nm3. The gas production rate was 1.49 Nm3/kg.","[{""name"": ""Pengcheng Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Low‐Grade Energy Utilization Technologies and Systems, Ministry of Education Chongqing University  Chongqing China"", ""School of Energy and Power Engineering Chongqing University  Chongqing China""]}, {""name"": ""Ge Pu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Low‐Grade Energy Utilization Technologies and Systems, Ministry of Education Chongqing University  Chongqing China"", ""School of Energy and Power Engineering Chongqing University  Chongqing China""]}, {""name"": ""Qiwen Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Low‐Grade Energy Utilization Technologies and Systems, Ministry of Education Chongqing University  Chongqing China"", ""School of Energy and Power Engineering Chongqing University  Chongqing China""]}, {""name"": ""Weicheng Xiong"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Low‐Grade Energy Utilization Technologies and Systems, Ministry of Education Chongqing University  Chongqing China"", ""School of Energy and Power Engineering Chongqing University  Chongqing China""]}]","[""10.1002/er.5439"", ""10.1002/er.5184"", ""10.1021/acs.iecr.9b06896"", ""10.1002/er.5167"", ""10.1016/j.jaap.2016.06.005"", ""10.1002/er.4581"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2017.07.175"", ""10.1002/er.3556"", ""10.1039/C6EE03718F"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.267"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2018.09.027"", ""10.1002/er.3277"", ""10.1002/er.5180"", ""10.1002/er.1958"", ""10.1021/ef900553j"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.09.128"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.130"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.04.019"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2017.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2013.04.055"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.10.030"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.08.122"", ""10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b01771"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2017.12.121"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2019.04.103"", ""10.1021/ie504468a"", ""10.1007/s10973-013-3630-1"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.04.246"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.12.216"", ""10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b00284"", ""10.1002/er.4246""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

Furthermore, the surface area of triboelectric film is critical in TENG production. With a simple, cost‐effective, and scalable technique, this study represents a paradigm shift in the manufacture of high surface area PA‐66 triboelectric films. The fabricated PA‐66 film was superficially modified and provided a high surface area to result in enhanced charge generation. The fabricated film could harvest mechanical energy in various TENG operational modes such as vertical contact and lateral sliding modes. Various TENGs were fabricated in this work to demonstrate the different operation modes on the prepared film and its efficiency. The TENGs were utilized to harvest mechanical energy from wind and vehicle motion and track real‐time vehicle acceleration.","[{""name"": ""Sontyana Adonijah Graham"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronics and Information Convergence Engineering, Institute for Wearable Convergence Electronics Kyung Hee University  Yongin‐Si Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Harishkumarreddy Patnam"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronics and Information Convergence Engineering, Institute for Wearable Convergence Electronics Kyung Hee University  Yongin‐Si Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Punnarao Manchi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronics and Information Convergence Engineering, Institute for Wearable Convergence Electronics Kyung Hee University  Yongin‐Si Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Mandar Vasant Paranjape"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronics and Information Convergence Engineering, Institute for Wearable Convergence Electronics Kyung Hee University  Yongin‐Si Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Jae Su Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronics and Information Convergence Engineering, Institute for Wearable Convergence Electronics Kyung Hee University  Yongin‐Si Korea""]}]","[""10.1039/C5EE01532D"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105547"", ""10.1021/acsnano.1c03230"", ""10.1109/TNANO.2018.2876824"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2013.03.008"", ""10.1039/c3ee42571a"", ""10.1002/adfm.202004714"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.105833"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105637"", ""10.1002/eom2.12063"", ""10.1002/advs.202000186"", ""10.1088/1361-6463/aac827"", ""10.1002/adfm.201807779"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106369"", ""10.3389/fchem.2020.577327"", ""10.1016/j.xcrp.2020.100142"", ""10.1016/j.mattod.2021.10.034"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2020.105670"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106668"", ""10.1002/adfm.202202145"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106515"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106300"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2021.07.118"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2021.106672"", ""10.1155/2015/140716"", ""10.1002/adfm.202105380"", ""10.1038/s41427-019-0187-x"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.04.081"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2021.112633"", ""10.1016/j.elstat.2008.07.001"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-09461-x"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.104086"", ""10.1088/1361-6528/ab793e"", ""10.1002/eom2.12062"", ""10.1016/j.eml.2016.02.019"", ""10.1002/adfm.201706365"", ""10.1002/adma.201401184"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.052"", ""10.1021/nn402477h"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.103960"", ""10.1039/C4RA06334A""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

This study was approved by CCN (Centre Cardiologique du Nord, Saint-Denis, France) ethical committee; all patients provided informed consent. All procedures were conducted in the interventional radiology department at CCN, by an experienced single radiologist using the same model and CT scan with identical parameters. The interventional dose length product (IDLP), representing the absorbed dose by the length of explored organs during the needle insertion phase, was compared in 15 consecutive patients who underwent a conventional procedure (CT control group), and in 22 patients who underwent CAN CT vertebroplasty (CAN group). The IDLP difference between the two groups was evaluated using Mann–Whitney U test. The median IDLP dose for the CAN group was 305.6 mGy.cm [182.3; 565.4], representing a reduction by a 3.2 factor compared with that of the conventional CT group (median 975.2 mGy.cm [568.3; 1077.1]; p &lt; 0.001). The median procedure duration for the CAN group was 50 min [35; 60] vs. 100 min [82; 100] in the CT group (p &lt; 0.001), representing a 50% reduction. In experienced hands, use of a CT-Navigation™ system (IMACTIS®) significantly reduced both patient radiation dose and procedure duration when compared to conventional CT guided percutaneous vertebroplasty.","[{""name"": ""C.

Therefor this paper aims to study the mechanical and thermal properties improvement of the RPMB with the use of a commercial elastomer styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS). Initially conventional 35/50 quality bitumen was mixed with different percentages of LDPE, PS and PP, and then doped with commercial SBS. Basic rheological parameters such as penetration, softening point, elastic recovery and penetration index showed the changes caused by each rate of polymer addition to pure bitumen. The tests showed that the penetrability of the modified bitumen decreases and its softening point and elastic recovery increases, resulting in a decrease in the thermal sensitivity of the new bitumen mixture.","[{""name"": ""Nacer Akkouri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Khadija Baba"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sana Simou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Latifa ELfarissi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Abderrahman Nounah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.compositesb.2016.09.013"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.03.080"", ""10.1002/cjce.5450780308"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.01.027"", ""10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2014.02.005"", ""10.1016/0032-3861(83)90010-1"", ""10.1080/10916460902937026"", ""10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2005.05.034"", ""10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2018.10.049"", ""10.1080/10298430500495147"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2009.02.089"", ""10.1016/S0142-9418(01)00086-1"", ""10.1080/14680629.2011.644113"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2005.07.007"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/204/1/012016""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

10.1007/s41365-024-01584-1,NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNIQUES,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0702 Physics,Neutron skin and its effects in heavy-ion collisions,"AbstractNeutron skin is an exotic phenomenon that occurs in unstable nuclei. In this study, the various effects of the neutron skin on nuclear reactions and their relationship with the properties of nuclear structures are reviewed. Based on numerous studies using theoretical models, strong correlations have been found between the neutron skin thickness and the neutron removal cross section, neutron/proton yield ratio, $$\hbox {t}/{^3\hbox {He}}$$ t / 3 He yield ratio, neutron–proton momentum difference, isoscaling parameter, photon production, reaction cross sections for neutron-induced reactions, charge-changing cross-sectional differences of mirror nuclei, astrophysical S-factor, and other quantities in nuclear reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei. Moreover, the relationships between the neutron skin thickness and certain properties of the nuclear structure, such as $$\alpha$$ α -cluster formation, $$\alpha$$ α decay, nuclear surface, nuclear temperature, and proton radii difference of mirror nuclei, have also been investigated. Furthermore, it has also been shown that the neutron skin plays a crucial role in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Experimentally, an unstable nucleus with a neutron skin can be generated by radioactive nuclear beam facilities, and the thickness of the neutron skin can be extracted by measuring the sensitive probes, which further helps impose stringent constraints on the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter and the properties of neutron stars.","[{""name"": ""Meng-Qi Ding"", ""affiliation"":

10.1002/er.6218,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Metal-organic framework-derived carbon-cobalt oxysulfide nanocage heterostructure electrode for efficient hybrid supercapacitors,"SummaryConstruction of hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) with defect engineered electrodes derived from single metal‐organic frameworks (zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, ZIF‐67) via control of the thermal influences showed unique structural features and rich electrochemical properties. Designing the three‐dimensional Co oxysulfide nanograins with carbon frame (CoOS‐C)‐based positive electrode surfaces through sulfidation with tunable defect states along with N‐ and S‐doping states improved the electrical energy storage; further, the possibility of having a carbon‐based skeleton surface influenced the effective rate capability during the charge‐discharge process. This unique nanostructural feature with encapsulation of porous N‐ and S‐doped graphitic carbon enabled improved rate performance by enhancing the stability of the electrode material and shortening the ion‐diffusion paths by the synergistic effect. Owing to the tunable defect functionality, the CoOS‐C based electrode exhibited a high storage capacity of 708.8 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an excellent rate capability with long‐term cyclic stability, with more than 93% capacity retention after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the fabricated HSCs operated within a wide potential window of 1 to 1.6 V, which allowed excellent rate capability with a high‐energy density of 31.7 W h kg−1 at a specific power density of 800 W kg−1 with long‐term cyclic stability up to 10 000 cycles.","[{""name"": ""Kugalur Shanmugam Ranjith"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy and Material Engineering Dongguk University  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Ganji Seeta Rama Raju"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy and Material Engineering Dongguk University  Seoul South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Cheol Hwan Kwak"", ""affiliation"": [""Carbon Industry Frontier Research Center Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT)  Daejeon South Korea"", ""Department of Biological Engineering Inha University  Incheon South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Seyed Majid Ghoreishian"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biological Engineering Inha University  Incheon South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yun Suk Huh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Biological Engineering Inha University  Incheon South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Ji Sun Im"", ""affiliation"": [""Carbon Industry Frontier Research Center Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT)  Daejeon South Korea"", ""Advanced Materials and Chemical Engineering University of Science and Technology (UST)  Daejeon South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Young‐Kyu Han"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Energy and Material Engineering Dongguk University  Seoul South Korea""]}]","[""10.1039/C8TA03988G"", ""10.1039/C5CS00580A"", ""10.1039/C8TA06820H"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2018.02.110"", ""10.1039/c4ta00567h"", ""10.1039/C7TA00863E"", ""10.1093/nsr/nwx009"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2013.04.084"", ""10.1021/nl404008e"", ""10.1039/C6TA01369D"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.03.244"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2017.02.033"", ""10.1021/acsnano.5b01244"", ""10.1039/c2cs35307e"", ""10.1039/C6RA27369F"", ""10.1021/acsnano.5b01790"", ""10.1039/C6TA03158G"", ""10.1038/srep21717"", ""10.1021/jp303121n"", ""10.1002/ente.201801002"", ""10.1039/C6RA23071G"", ""10.1039/C6RA20502J"", ""10.1039/C6RA18624F"", ""10.1039/C6RA18732C"", ""10.1039/c3nr03533f"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.06.017"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2016.01.156"", ""10.1016/j.jelechem.2018.04.035"", ""10.1039/C5TA08706F"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2019.01.050"", ""10.1002/advs.201600539"", ""10.1002/smll.201701827"", ""10.1039/C8TA01163J"", ""10.1039/C6CS00571C"", ""10.1039/C7CS00076F"", ""10.1002/adma.201606459"", ""10.1039/C8NJ02087F"", ""10.1039/C9QI00663J"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2020.02.047"", ""10.1039/C8TA07686C"", ""10.1039/C9TA01951K"", ""10.1039/C9CS00871C"", ""10.1039/C7TA03070C"", ""10.1039/D0DT01676D"", ""10.1039/C7TA00276A"", ""10.1039/C8CS00684A"", ""10.1039/C6RA27331A"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2019.08.022"", ""10.1039/C4TA03341H"", ""10.1002/advs.201700659"", ""10.1021/am404196s"", ""10.1039/C4TA02870H"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-07102-1"", ""10.1039/C3TA15373H"", ""10.1021/am5053784"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.12.092"", ""10.1039/C5TA02432C"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2015.06.011"", ""10.1039/C5CP01945A"", ""10.1039/C5TA04464B"", ""10.1039/C7TA06036J"", ""10.1039/C8TA04307H""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Downhole nuclear measurements focus on formation properties such as natural radioactivity, formation density, and hydrogen content, as well as the identification of the elemental and mineralogical composition of the rock through spectroscopy. Accurate nuclear modeling is a fundamental part of nuclear well logging tool development, from concept through design to response characterization. Underlying the accuracy of nuclear modeling is a good knowledge of nuclear cross sections of the elements in the tool, borehole, and subsurface formations. The recent focus on replacing tools based on radio-isotopic sources with those based on D-T neutron generators opens many opportunities for new measurements but highlights the deficiencies of current cross sections. For example, in neutron-induced inelastic and capture gamma ray spectroscopy, major obstacles come from a lack of or inaccuracies in the cross sections of essential materials.","[{""name"": ""Marie-Laure Mauborgne"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R.J.

In this paper, a novel process of preparing ZnMn2O4 as anode material for lithium‐ion batteries from the spent zinc‐manganese battery is present. Nano ZnMn2O4 is synthesized by the low‐temperature hydrothermal method, and the formation mechanism is discussed. The structure, morphology, and composition of the products are characterized by XRD and SEM. The result shows that ZnMn2O4 with a crystal size of about 50 nm is prepared under the conditions of T = 200°C, pH = 7, reaction time t = 3 days, and n(Zn: Mn) = 0.966:2, which have the advantages of good crystallinity and high purity. The nanocrystallization and spheroid‐like structure of ZnMn2O4 determine that the battery assembled with ZnMn2O4 has a high initial discharge capacity, and the initial discharge specific capacity reaches 902.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. This study shows that the nano ZnMn2O4 synthesized by the hydrothermal method is a promising anode material for lithium‐ion batteries.","[{""name"": ""Pengwei Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Materials Science and Engineering Northeastern University  Shenyang China"", ""Key Laboratory of Dielectric and Electrolyte Functional Material Hebei Province Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Shao‐hua Luo"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Materials Science and Engineering Northeastern University  Shenyang China"", ""Key Laboratory of Dielectric and Electrolyte Functional Material Hebei Province Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Rolling and Automation Northeastern University  Shenyang China"", ""School of Resources and Materials Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China"", ""Qinhuangdao Laboratory of Resources Cleaner Conversion and Efficient Utilization Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Qing Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Materials Science and Engineering Northeastern University  Shenyang China"", ""Key Laboratory of Dielectric and Electrolyte Functional Material Hebei Province Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China"", ""School of Resources and Materials Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Yahui Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Materials Science and Engineering Northeastern University  Shenyang China"", ""Key Laboratory of Dielectric and Electrolyte Functional Material Hebei Province Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China"", ""School of Resources and Materials Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Materials Science and Engineering Northeastern University  Shenyang China"", ""Key Laboratory of Dielectric and Electrolyte Functional Material Hebei Province Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China"", ""School of Resources and Materials Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Caihong Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Resources and Materials Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao  Qinhuangdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Jinsheng Liang"", ""affiliation"": [""Manufacturing Innovation Center for Solid Waste Resource Utilization and Ecological Development Hebei University of Technology  Tianjin China""]}, {""name"": ""Xinhui Duan"", ""affiliation"": [""Manufacturing Innovation Center for Solid Waste Resource Utilization and Ecological Development Hebei University of Technology  Tianjin China""]}]","[""10.1038/nature07853"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228970"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.06.043"", ""10.1039/C9EE02759A"", ""10.7498/aps.69.20201581"", ""10.1002/inf2.12190"", ""10.1002/adma.201402962"", ""10.1002/er.6546"", ""10.1016/j.jechem.2021.04.047"", ""10.1002/inf2.12185"", ""10.1002/er.4764"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.01.191"", ""10.1016/j.ccr.2020.213434"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123715"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1521-4095(199807)10:10<725::AID-ADMA725>3.0.CO;2-Z"", ""10.1002/er.6426"", ""10.1007/s12598-021-01716-1"", ""10.1021/acsami.0c11678"", ""10.1149/1.1837740"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2013.04.001"", ""10.1002/smtd.201900753"", ""10.1007/s11581-020-03570-0"", ""10.1002/er.4232"", ""10.1021/acsami.9b03365"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2019.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.07.213"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.12.421"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.160445"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136115"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.136"", ""10.1007/s12274-011-0106-0"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2014.05.126"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2014.04.157"", ""10.1021/am403546s"", ""10.1038/s41467-017-00467-x"", ""10.1002/er.6336"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2016.06.042"", ""10.1016/j.optlastec.2012.01.036"", ""10.1016/j.hydromet.2010.07.004"", ""10.1002/er.4834"", ""10.1002/ppsc.201300338"", ""10.1038/35035045"", ""10.1016/S1003-6326(21)65493-6"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.143590"", ""10.1007/s11837-019-03446-3"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b17597""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1002/er.6148,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Heat capacity and viscosity of ternary carbonate nanofluids,"SummaryRecent studies have shown that eutectic salt mixtures show remarkable enhancement in heat capacity after nanoparticles are dispersed at small concentrations. The exact mechanism behind these heat capacity enhancements is still inconclusive. However, recent studies proposed that the enhancement could be associated with nucleation and grain growth of salt dendritic structures. To investigate the hypothesis, we synthesized several samples of ternary carbonate salt mixture doped with 1% alumina nanoparticles and thermally cycled them at various heating rates and cooled them back to the solid‐state during the synthesis procedure. It can affect the nucleation/grain growth of salt dendritic nanostructures and, as a result, there can be different heat capacity enhancements. A differential scanning calorimetry was employed to characterize the heat capacity values of the systems. It was observed that the heat capacity enhancements decreased with increases in the heating rates. The highest heat capacity enhancement was observed at the lowest heating rate (ie, 2°C/min). A transmission electron microscope was employed to confirm the effect of heating cycling rates on the formation of dendritic structures. Moreover, pH variation method was used to study the effect of the dendritic structures on the heat capacity of the mixture. Furthermore, a rheometer was employed to characterize the rheological behavior. It was observed that nanofluid samples showed shear‐thinning behavior, whereas shear thinning was not observed in pure and nanofluid prepared with the pH variation method.","[{""name"": ""Syed Muhammad Mujtaba Rizvi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering &amp; Technology Central Michigan University  Mount Pleasant Michigan USA""]}, {""name"": ""Baha El Far"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering &amp; Technology Central Michigan University  Mount Pleasant Michigan USA""]}, {""name"": ""Donghyun Shin"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering &amp; Technology Central Michigan University  Mount Pleasant Michigan USA""]}]","[""10.1115/1.4002600"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2014.02.066"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.01.100"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.11.064"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.125"", ""10.1039/c8ra10318f"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2017.04.011"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.11.015"", ""10.1039/d0ra03666h"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2020.110503"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2013.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.molliq.2020.112570"", ""10.1063/1.4868254"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.05.072"", ""10.1186/1556-276X-9-582"", ""10.1186/s11671-015-1188-5"", ""10.1063/1.4801645"", ""10.1016/j.compfluid.2014.01.036"", ""10.1149/1.2425785"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2012.10.062"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120260"", ""10.1023/A:1012514216429"", ""10.1007/s10765-006-0022-9"", ""10.1088/0953-8984/20/29/295224"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(94)00260-3"", ""10.1016/S1359-6454(02)00020-4"", ""10.1021/ar9702278"", ""10.1016/j.ces.2009.07.025"", ""10.1023/A:1019914716275"", ""10.1038/nature02397"", ""10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2014.07.039"", ""10.1002/andp.19063240204"", ""10.1017/S0022112077001062"", ""10.2514/2.6486"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.09.033"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.86.011710"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2014.08.085""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

Phase change material (PCM) has been adapted for thermal management of LIB because it can absorb a mass of energy without additional power. In this research, the thermal conductivity of PCM is improved, and its cooling effect is detected. The addition of hybrid thermal conductivity filler is beneficial to its uniform dispersion and improvement of aggregation phenomenon on the surface of materials. The results show that the PCM with hybrid filler has better thermal conductivity, which is increased by 264%. In different proportions of composite materials, the composite phase change material with 1% few‐layer graphene and 2% graphite nanoplatelet can play a better cooling effect in LIB module thermal management, and it respectively decreases the maximal temperature of the battery module by 7.17°C, 10.52°C, and 16.33°C at 1C, 2C, and 3C conditions, and the maximal temperature difference does not exceed the safety range of 5°C.","[{""name"": ""Mingyi Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of the Environment and Safety Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Fire Science University of Science and Technology of China  Hefei China""]}, {""name"": ""Yilin Cui"", ""affiliation"": [""School of the Environment and Safety Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Dongxu Ouyang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Safety Science and Engineering Nanjing Tech University  Nanjing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jingwen Weng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Fire Science University of Science and Technology of China  Hefei China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiahao Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Ocean Science and Engineering Shanghai Maritime University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Luyao Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of the Environment and Safety Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Fire Science University of Science and Technology of China  Hefei China""]}, {""name"": ""Jian Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Fire Science University of Science and Technology of China  Hefei China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.spc.2021.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2021.111188"", ""10.1016/j.est.2021.103447"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.09.058"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230340"", ""10.1016/j.psep.2022.01.055"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.10.051"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.04.015"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2017.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.01.026"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.06.043"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2016.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.013"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.049"", ""10.1002/er.3801"", ""10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2016.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2020.104612"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2013.12.076"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121199"", ""10.1002/er.5363"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.147"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.069"", ""10.3390/app10207354"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.083"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.08.172"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.11.100"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2017.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.07.010"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2005.11.022"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.08.135"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2012.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.10.061"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.064"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.11.068"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2011.01.048"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2016.01.011"", ""10.1021/acsaem.1c00235"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2013.01.046"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.117147"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2021.117376"", ""10.1021/acsaem.0c03116"", ""10.1016/j.est.2021.103651"", ""10.3390/app7060574"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2005.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2010.10.014"", ""10.1002/adma.200800401"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.08.098"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.11.064"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.109672"", ""10.1016/j.est.2022.104857"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2017.09.019"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00200-8""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

The analysis is performed based on a specific exergy costing (SPECO) method to determine the influences of various design criteria on the costs and then identify possible improvements for more cost effective approaches. The article includes an exergy analysis, economic study, exergy costing and exergo‐economic evaluation. Also, a scale‐up analysis is performed to predict the cost of a larger scale facility of 1000 kg per day of hydrogen production. The results of the exergo‐economic and scale‐up analysis are expected to assist in the design, optimization and improvement of a scaled‐up Cu‐Cl thermochemical cycle. Furthermore, the results of this study show that for a large‐scale Cu‐Cl cycle plant with a capacity of 1000 kg/day H2, the cost of hydrogen production, excluding the treatment of side reactions, is predicted at about 3.91 $/kg H2.","[{""name"": ""Aida Farsi"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Research Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science Ontario Tech.

In this paper, submicron LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) primary particles with good crystallinity and dispersibility have been synthesized combine a coprecipitation method used ethanol as solvent with solid‐phase sintering technology. A feeding strategy through separate dropping of sodium carbonate and ammonia is adopted; the structure and properties of NCM523 under different pH conditions are investigated. It is found that the NCM523 synthesized at pH = 8 (NCM523‐8) exhibits a uniform particle size of about 300 nm, with good crystallinity. The NCM523‐8 exhibits an excellent high‐potential cycling performance, with an initial discharge capacity of 193.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C in the voltage of 3.0 to 4.5 V, and the capacity retention is 91% after 100 cycles. It also shows excellent rate performance with a reversible capacity of 130 mAh g−1 at 5 C. The superior high‐potential electrochemical performance is attributed to the improved lithium‐ion diffusion coefficient and stabilized structure by the special structural characteristics as evidenced by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and X‐ray diffraction.","[{""name"": ""Yanfang Xie"", ""affiliation"": [""Guizhou Province Key Laboratory of Metallurgical Engineering and Process Energy Saving, College of Materials and Metallurgy Guizhou University  Guiyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Fuzhong Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Guizhou Province Key Laboratory of Metallurgical Engineering and Process Energy Saving, College of Materials and Metallurgy Guizhou University  Guiyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Xinyi Dai"", ""affiliation"": [""Guizhou Province Key Laboratory of Metallurgical Engineering and Process Energy Saving, College of Materials and Metallurgy Guizhou University  Guiyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Yi Mai"", ""affiliation"": [""Guizhou Province Key Laboratory of Metallurgical Engineering and Process Energy Saving, College of Materials and Metallurgy Guizhou University  Guiyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Yijing Gu"", ""affiliation"": [""Guizhou Province Key Laboratory of Metallurgical Engineering and Process Energy Saving, College of Materials and Metallurgy Guizhou University  Guiyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Huixin Jin"", ""affiliation"": [""Guizhou Province Key Laboratory of Metallurgical Engineering and Process Energy Saving, College of Materials and Metallurgy Guizhou University  Guiyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Junqi Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Guizhou Province Key Laboratory of Metallurgical Engineering and Process Energy Saving, College of Materials and Metallurgy Guizhou University  Guiyang China""]}]","[""10.1038/35104644"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.031"", ""10.1039/C8CC09596E"", ""10.1002/er.4918"", ""10.1002/er.4043"", ""10.1021/am503260s"", ""10.1002/er.4314"", ""10.1039/C3EE42704H"", ""10.1002/er.4061"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227456"", ""10.1038/nmat2418"", ""10.1002/er.4022"", ""10.1002/er.3049"", ""10.1002/er.4601"", ""10.1002/er.4081"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2014.02.100"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.10.027"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2009.04.149"", ""10.1039/c3ee42398k"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.01.010"", ""10.1039/C7TA02888A"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.126"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.10.158"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.01.016"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.03.061"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.057"", ""10.1039/c1jm11077b"", ""10.1149/2.004302jes"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2012.11.090"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.089"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.10.016"", ""10.1039/C4DT01611D"", ""10.1002/er.4916"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b10264"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.11.113"", ""10.1002/er.4121"", ""10.1149/1.1392516"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.10.154"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.03.224"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.12.131"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2015.11.093"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2015.07.006"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b10016"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2004.12.001"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b10677"", ""10.1038/srep25771"", ""10.1039/C5TA02233A"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b18933"", ""10.1039/C3TA13920D""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

In this study, energy, exergy, environment, and economic (4E) analyses were performed for a 500‐MWe oxy‐coal ultra‐supercritical circulating fluidized‐bed (CFB) power plant with CO2 capture. The effect of the location of flue‐gas recirculation (FGR) on the 4E values was investigated for wet FGR (wFGR) at 170°C, dry FGR (dFGR) at 68°C, and 80% wet and 20% dry FGR (wdFGR). The net electricity efficiencies of the wFGR and dFGR power plants were 37% and 36%, respectively. The exergy loss was the largest in the combustor and boiler area, where process improvement was possible. The levelized cost of electricity was approximately 60 $/MWh. The return on investment was 6.7% and 6.1%/y for the wFGR and dFGR plants, respectively. The CO2 emission rate decreased by 90% (from 690 to 76 kg‐CO2/MWh) in the oxy‐coal power plants with CO2 capture. Relative to the wFGR, the dFGR was advantageous for preventing material corrosion because of the lower sulfur content in the FGR stream. For the wdFGR power plant, the process performance was intermediate, that is, between that of the wFGR plant and that of the dFGR plant. The study provided an effective tool for identifying the technological and economic effects of the FGR location for the oxy‐coal power plant with CCS via 4E analyses.","[{""name"": ""Semie Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""CoSPE, Department of Chemical Engineering Hankyong National University  Anseong‐si Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Young‐Il Lim"", ""affiliation"": [""CoSPE, Department of Chemical Engineering Hankyong National University  Anseong‐si Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Doyeon Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Korea Institute of Energy Research  Daejeon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Myung Won Seo"", ""affiliation"": [""Korea Institute of Energy Research  Daejeon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Tae‐Young Mun"", ""affiliation"": [""Korea Institute of Energy Research  Daejeon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Jae‐Goo Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Korea Institute of Energy Research  Daejeon Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1002/ente.202000627"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112050"", ""10.1002/er.4730"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2012.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.cherd.2011.01.028"", ""10.1039/c3ra43965h"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2014.03.008"", ""10.1007/s11814-011-0057-x"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.116855"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.096"", ""10.1007/s11814-017-0046-9"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2020.117424"", ""10.1002/er.3608"", ""10.1533/9780857098801.2.620"", ""10.1002/er.5251"", ""10.1021/ef901076g"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2018.08.036"", ""10.1002/er.3486"", ""10.1021/ie1022173"", ""10.1016/j.ijggc.2015.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.08.009"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.02.056"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.074"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2015.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2019.116795"", ""10.1021/ef500051c"", ""10.1016/j.ijggc.2017.01.014"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2005.08.010"", ""10.1080/00022470.1967.10468999"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2010.04.001"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.10.138"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2018.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.tsep.2018.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.11.151"", ""10.1016/0360-5442(86)90013-7"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.11.085"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.04.116"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2013.06.009""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

This has led to the current state of the art district heating systems, commonly referred to as the 4th generation district heating, also known as low temperature district heating (LTDH). The success of the LTDH has fuelled a lot of research interest in district energy systems, one of the new research topics has been focusing on reducing the operating temperatures down to the ambient temperature (ATDH), commonly referred as 5th generation district heating. In these systems the supply temperature is insufficient for fulfilling the heating demands of the connected buildings, which then requires end-user located heat pumps to raise the supply temperature to the level required by the buildings. As of today, number of ATDH systems have been realized as part of various research projects. The question however remains if ATDH brings additional benefits compared to LTDH. This paper compares the levelized cost of heat from these two systems types for two countries with different climate zones. The results of the analysis indicate that LTDH is the favourable solution in both countries.","[{""name"": ""Oddgeir Gudmundsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anders Dyrelund"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Eric Thorsen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.089"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.12.059"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.05.076"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.05.165"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.046"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.08.018""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Interestingly, some of nucleons may group together and exhibit collective behavior inside a nucleus. Such clustering effects have been known since the early stages of nuclear physics because of the observation and description of α-cluster decay from many heavy nuclei. Subsequent studies demonstrated that cluster structures exist in many nuclear systems, especially in weakly bound or excited states, and are complementary to the shell-like structures. In this review article, we provide a brief historical recall of the field, and follow it with a conceptual and logical description of the major theoretical models that have been frequently applied in the literature to describe nuclear clustering. Experimental methods and progress are outlined, recent outcomes are emphasized, and perspectives relevant to future studies of heavy neutron-rich systems are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Kang Wei"",

The influence of Cu doping on the property of SFCM series was studied in detail. The oxygen content decreases with the increase of Cu doping amount. SFCM samples are chemically compatible with LSGM electrolyte. However, the TEC values are still a bit higher than that of some common SOFC electrolytes. At 750°C, the Rp values are 0.261, 0.227 and 0.155 Ω·cm2 for SFCM0, SFCM0.1, and SFCM0.2. The obtained activation energies for x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2 are 1.01, 0.98, and 0.87 eV, respectively. These results indicate that Cu doping into SrFe0.9‐xCuxMo0.1O3‐δ has a favorable effect on the electrochemical activity of the materials.","[{""name"": ""Chuangang Yao"", ""affiliation"": [""College of chemistry and materials engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China"", ""Liaoning Engineering Technology Research Center of Supercapacitor Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Jixing Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of chemistry and materials engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Haixia Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of chemistry and materials engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Sigeng Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""College of chemistry and materials engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Jian Meng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resources Utilization, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences  Changchun China""]}, {""name"": ""Kedi Cai"", ""affiliation"": [""College of chemistry and materials engineering Bohai University  Jinzhou China"", ""Liaoning Engineering Technology Research Center of Supercapacitor Bohai University  Jinzhou China""]}]","[""10.1038/nature11475"", ""10.1002/ente.201900543"", ""10.1002/er.4722"", ""10.1126/science.1204090"", ""10.1039/b612060c"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.11.134"", ""10.1016/S0013-4686(00)00330-3"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.09.097"", ""10.1038/nature02863"", ""10.1016/S0955-2219(01)00120-0"", ""10.1149/1.1617300"", ""10.1002/adma.201700132"", ""10.1038/ncomms13990"", ""10.1021/cm300255r"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.12.081"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.04.025"", ""10.1021/cm101665r"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.096"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2020.155406"", ""10.1002/celc.201900391"", ""10.1007/s10008-009-0932-0"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2014.01.020"", ""10.1149/1.1854617"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2009.09.028"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.01.019"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.157"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.11.021"", ""10.1016/j.susc.2011.12.013"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.05.096"", ""10.1002/er.4950"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.153"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.172"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.09.043"", ""10.1007/s11581-014-1327-5"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.12.150"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.08.063"", ""10.1039/c2jm31711g"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.10.087"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.04.066"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.06.036"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.01.160"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2020.136143"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.07.136"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.02.139"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.04.041""]",['Materials Science'],"['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

In this study, the effect of adding inexpensive fly ash waste (34 kg per t PR) together with lower quantities of pure silica (8.5 kg per t PR) on the radioactivity of PG was investigated. The addition of fly ash waste/pure silica reduced the radiological activity of the PG by roughly 30%. The reduction was attributed to decreased activities from 238U (60% reduction) and 226Ra (30% reduction) in PG. Besides, P2O5 losses were slightly decreased.","[{""name"": ""Fatima Ezzahra Arhouni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammed Hakkar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Mahrou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laila Belahbib"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hamid Mazouz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nils Haneklaus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sandra Pavón"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Bertau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aziz Boukhair"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saad Ouakkas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maged A.

10.1002/er.8312,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Assessment on combustion performance and bottom ash properties of carbon-rich fraction from coal gasification fine slag co-combustion with corn straw char,"SummaryIn this paper, the co‐combustion characteristics of the carbon‐rich fraction from coal gasification fine slag and corn straw char were investigated. The combustion performance of the blend was studied by TGA, and the properties of bottom ash samples were evaluated by XRD, SEM‐EDS, and ICP‐MS. The results showed that the addition of corn straw char (CC) to carbon‐rich fraction (RC) can improve the combustibility of RC. The kinetic reaction mechanisms of the blend combustion were described by the diffusion model and chemical reaction order model (D1 and O3). The 40%RC case was recommended because of the lowest reaction activation energy. Hematite (Fe2O3), quartz (SiO2), anhydrite (CaSO4), and diopside (Ca(Mg, Al)(Si, Al)2O6) were the main mineral compounds in the RC‐CC ash. With different compounding ratios of RC‐CC, significant variability was observed in the degree of denseness and aggregation on the surface of the blend combustion bottom ash. The heavy metal concentrations (V, Cr, Ni, As, Cd and Pb) in the ash were tested to be in accordance with Chinese soil environmental quality standards, and the co‐combustion process had a positive impact on the enrichment of V, Cr, and Ni in the bottom ash to some extent. The results obtained can make a reference for the synergistic utilization of RC‐CC, and the treatment and reuse of combustion bottom ash samples.","[{""name"": ""Wenke Jia"", ""affiliation"":

The current comprehensive utilization rate of steel slag is still very low in China, far behind the developed countries. The low comprehensive utilization rate of steel slag is a stumbling block to the green and sustainable development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Improving the comprehensive utilization rate of steel slag is an imperative way to resolve these problems and to realize sustainable development for the steel enterprise. Steel slag presents porous structure and large surface area; in addition, it is easy to separate from water due to its high density. Therefore, the application of steel slag in industrial waste water treatment has received intensive attention in recent years. This paper systematically introduced the research progress of steel slag resource utilization as absorbent materials for waste water and proposed the important improved method and critical problems for steel slag as absorbent materials.","[{""name"": ""Chan Yu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wei Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fei Gao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Huawei Huang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Liangyuan Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0956-053X(00)00102-1"", ""10.1016/S0043-1354(01)00037-9"", ""10.1097/NCC.0000000000000213"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2014.02.056""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Water Science and Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0815 水利工程', 0.7539), ('0908 水产', 0.7497)]]"
10.1002/er.6171,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,An intelligent passivity-based backstepping approach for optimal control for grid-connecting permanent magnet synchronous generator-based tidal conversion system,"SummaryTidal turbine systems‐based permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) has been largely investigated due to their higher efficiency, predictability, and high‐power density. However, parameter uncertainties and external disturbances make the controller design a challenging work. This study suggests a new adaptive fuzzy linear feedback passivity‐based backstepping control to solve the robustness problems faced by the conventional proportional‐integral (PI) controls in the machine‐side converter (MSC). The proposed controller design uses an energy‐based approach; therefore, its dependence on the system parameters is extremely reduced and avoids the cancellation of nonlinearities of the system. Then, the dynamic response is fast and efficient, and the asymptotic stability and the robustness of the conversion system are improved. The main objectives are the extraction of the maximum tidal power, feeding the electrical grid with only the active power, and regulating the DC voltage and the reactive power toward their references, whatever the disturbances caused by the PMSG behavior. The control strategy is tested under parameter variations, and the performances are compared to the conventional PI strategy. Numerical investigation under MATLAB/Simulink environment demonstrates that the proposed control solution provides a higher efficiency and robustness under parameter variations over conventional PI approach.","[{""name"": ""Youcef Belkhier"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratoire de Technologie Industrielle et de l'Information (LTII), Faculté de Technologie Université de Bejaia Bejaia Algeria""]}, {""name"": ""Abdelyazid Achour"", ""affiliation"": [""Laboratoire de Technologie Industrielle et de l'Information (LTII), Faculté de Technologie Université de Bejaia Bejaia Algeria""]}]","[""10.1002/er.4625"", ""10.1002/er.4417"", ""10.1002/er.3383"", ""10.1002/er.4847"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2018.10.079"", ""10.1007/s13369-018-3433-6"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.12.023"", ""10.1109/TEC.2017.2744980"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2018.09.013"", ""10.1109/ISIE.2014.6864611"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.12.047"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2011.10.008"", ""10.1049/iet-rpg.2017.0680"", ""10.1016/j.isatra.2009.04.004"", ""10.1002/er.1726"", ""10.1109/CDC.1994.411573"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.085"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.03.063"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2018.12.044"", ""10.1109/TSTE.2013.2251918""]",['Engineering'],"['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1002/er.6955,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,A robust type-2 fuzzy logic-based maximum power point tracking approach for thermoelectric generation systems,"SummaryA robust type‐2 fuzzy logic (FL)‐based approach for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is proposed in this work. The method is used to increase the energy efficiency of thermoelectric generators (TEGs). Type‐2 FL was applied to adapt the variable step size of incremental resistance (INR) MPPT to track the maximum available power of a TEG. The output power from a TEG relies mostly on the difference in temperature of its two sides added to the load value. Consequently, MPPT must be robust to extract the optimum operation point continually under varying operational conditions. The aim of the suggested approach is to enhance the dynamic response and eradicate fluctuations around the maximum power point (MPP). The results employing the type‐2 FL are compared with conventional methods including INR, perturb and observe (P&amp;O), and type‐1 FL. With a variable load (15, 20, and 25 Ω), the proposed approach takes around 7 ms to reach a steady state with 2.6, 3.9, and 5.2 W overshoot, respectively, and almost zero oscillation. With a fixed load and a fixed temperature difference, our proposed tracker decreases the response time by 35.84%, 45.27%, and 96.50% compared to INR, P&amp;O, and conventional FL, respectively. With a fixed load and a varying temperature difference, the proposed tracker decreases the response time by 53.33%, 94.07%, and 96.53% compared to INR, P&amp;O, and conventional FL, respectively. The results confirmed the ability of the proposed method to keep the conversion efficiency of TEGs high and stable, reducing energy loss.","[{""name"": ""Hegazy Rezk"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Engineering at Wadi Addawaser Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University  Wadi Addawaser Saudi Arabia"", ""Faculty of Engineering, Electrical Engineering Department Minia University  Minia Egypt""]}, {""name"": ""Abdelghani Harrag"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechatronics Laboratory Optics and Precision Mechanics Institute, Ferhat ABBAS University Setif 1  Setif Algeria""]}]","[""10.1002/er.4953"", ""10.1080/15567036.2018.1549171"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2019.100805"", ""10.3390/en13174531"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945990"", ""10.3390/math7100875"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025222"", ""10.3390/su12145601"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2017.11.040"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119301"", ""10.1016/j.actaastro.2016.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.274"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.206"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2019.104224"", ""10.1007/s00521-020-04865-z"", ""10.1002/er.6728"", ""10.1002/er.6329"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111991"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114232"", ""10.1002/er.4823"", ""10.1002/er.4793"", ""10.1080/23311916.2017.1378475"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2014.11.010"", ""10.1007/s00521-021-05729-w"", ""10.1007/s40815-020-00916-8""]","['Computer Science', 'Energy', 'Materials Science']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

10.1002/er.6052,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,"""Process modelling and thermodynamic performance optimization of mixedIndian lignocellulosicwaste co-gasification","SummaryBio‐syngas derived from lignocellulosic biomass (LB) has emerged as a potential precursor gas to be converted to liquid fuels. The quality of syngas with respect to the concentrations of CO, H2 and CO2 is, however, dependent on the elemental analysis of the LB and the variables like equivalence ratio, gasification temperature. The generation of tar and ash from the gasification process is also influenced by the proximate analysis of the LBs. In this study, steady state process simulation of co‐gasification of mixed Indian LBs has been developed through Aspen plus using non‐equilibrium model based on reaction kinetics. Formation of char and tar has also been incorporated in the model. The composition of syngas, obtained through Aspen plus simulation of co‐gasification has been successfully compared with literature data. The ratio between individual agro wastes in the LB mixture is another input variable in the co‐gasification model. Finally, response surface methodology has been used to optimise the energy and exergy efficiency of the co‐gasification process with respect to equivalence ratio, gasification temperature and ratio of high and low ash LBs. It has been found that the combination of 750°C temperature, 0.2 biomass ratio and 0.2 equivalence ratio gives the optimum energy efficiency and combination of 750°C temperature, 0.8 biomass ratio and 0.5 equivalence ratio gives maximum exergy efficiency.","[{""name"": ""Soumitra Pati"", ""affiliation"": [""Engineering Faculty, Mechanical Engg.

As the tsunami destroyed 23 of the 24 status monitoring points, almost no relevant radiation dose measurements data were available. A rapid deployment of a mobile radiological unit that can quickly determine the activity and direction of the radioactive cloud spread on the ground or in the air can prevent unnecessary deaths and related financial losses. Although the design of the current generation of NPPs incorporates features that minimize the risk of large radioactive releases outside the reactor, it is still important to focus on the development of systems that can mitigate the consequences of such events. In situations when the level of radiation does not permit the personal to perform the required measurements, online unmanned radiation monitoring systems may come to the play. For such a purpose the RMS-00x radiation monitoring system could be used, which is a modular system covering the functionality of dose rate measurement, air sampling and radiation map creation without requiring the human personnel to be present at the measurement site. The main purpose of the RMS-00x radiation monitoring system is the rapid deployment of unmanned monitoring devices to reduce the radiation burden on workers and on public. The system can be applied in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant (NPP) or at any location, where source of ionizing radiation could be present. Before this system is used in real conditions, its components must be thoroughly calibrated, based on certified measurement equipment and state-of-art simulation tools. This paper deals with the description of the RMS-00X sensor modules and demonstrates their functionality in combination with UAV. In addition, demonstration of the use of the developed technology was carried out as part of the regular emergency planning and preparedness of EBO NPP on 26th October 2017.","[{""name"": ""Jakub Lüley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Branislav Vrban"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Štefan Čerba"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Filip Osuský"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vladimír Nečas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1088/0952-4746/33/3/497""]","['Environmental Science', 'Physics and Astronomy', 'Health Professions']","['Radiation', 'Global and Planetary Change', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"
10.1002/er.8318,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Transactive energy management for microgrids considering techno-economic perspectives of utility - a review,"SummaryIn a power system, distributed energy resources, including renewables, are advantageous for reducing power transmission losses and environmental pollution. However, increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy sources is challenging as they may pose security issues to the grid and centralized control of quantum number of such sources is quite impossible. Microgrid based distribution system is facilitating integration of distributed renewable energy sources as they can supply the local loads and reduce burden on the grid. Moreover, distributed control mechanism of different microgrids enhances the functioning efficiency of the grid. However, intermittent and uncertain nature of renewables leads into demand‐supply imbalance in a microgrid. Networked microgrids is new concept where the energy sharing between the microgrids may encourage renewable integration and reduce demand‐supply imbalance. In order to manage such energy sharing among the different components in a microgrid or different microgrids in a networked structure, an appropriate energy management approach is necessitated. Transactive energy is an emerging technology for energy management in the distribution system, which uses market mechanisms for energy management.

10.1002/er.6229,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Thermal behavior of lithium-ion battery in microgrid application: Impact and management system,"SummarySafe and reliable operation is among the considerations when integrating lithium‐ion batteries as the energy storage system in microgrids. A lithium‐ion battery is very sensitive to temperature in which it is one of the critical factors affecting the performance and limiting the practical application of the battery. Furthermore, the adverse effects differ according to the temperature. The susceptibility of lithium‐ion battery to temperature imposes the need to deploy an efficient battery thermal management system to ensure the safe operation of the battery while at the same time maximizing its performance and life cycle. To design a good thermal management system, accurate temperature measurement is vital to assist the battery thermal management system in managing relevant states such as the stage‐of‐charge and state‐of‐health of the battery. This article outlines the effects of low and high temperatures on the performance of Li‐ion batteries. Next, a review of currently available internal temperature monitoring approaches is presented based on their feasibility and complexity. Then, an overview of battery thermal management systems based on different cooling mediums is presented. This includes air cooling, liquid cooling, phase change material (PCM) cooling, heat pipe cooling, boiling‐based cooling, and solid‐state cooling. The final section of this article discusses the practical implementation of the internal temperature measurement approach and battery thermal management system for microgrids. From the review, a suitable candidate is the flexible, low maintenance, and long lifetime hybrid battery thermal management system that combines heat pipe cooling and solid‐state cooling. It is capable of maintaining the maximum operating temperature of the battery within 45°C at up to 3C discharge rate while being a relatively simple system. Additionally, passive PCM with thermally conductive filler can also be employed to assist the hybrid battery thermal management system in improving the temperature uniformity well within 5°C.","[{""name"": ""Azri H.

10.1002/er.8080,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Structural and electrochemical properties of mesoporous FeVO4 as a negative electrode for lithium-ion battery,"SummaryThe approach to accomplishing long cycle solidity usually depends on the electrode materials in lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, mesoporous FeVO4 (MFVO) nanostructures (NSs) were prepared via a simple hydrothermal method and post‐calcination using different concentrations of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) chelating agent. The morphology, microstructure, and mesoporous nature of the as‐prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller analyses, respectively. The as‐obtained MFVO NSs were examined as a negative material for LIBs. The enhanced MFVO‐2 (0.2 g of EDTA) electrode provides an initial charge/discharge capacity of 2880 mA h g−1/2707 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. Even after 100 cycles, it displays a superior specific discharge capacity of 906 mA h g−1. Furthermore, the MFVO‐2 electrode exhibits a high‐rate performance with a steady reversible capacity. As a result, the porosity and density of nanorod‐like morphologies are significant factors in their electrochemical performances.

Three contexts were examined in detail: nuclear emergency preparedness, response and recovery; exposure to indoor radon; and medical exposures to ionising radiation. Research showed that prescriptions and practices for stakeholder engagement would benefit from acknowledging the normative and substantive rationales for engagement. It suggests broadening participation both in terms of stakeholders – particularly from the perspective of integration of radiological protection into broader frameworks – and the forms of participation – for instance by recognising the importance of informal and citizen-led engagement. In addition, more systematic approaches for stakeholder engagement should be included in the elaboration and evaluation of national policies. Finally, results substantiate the need for developing radiological protection culture in a participatory, multi-disciplinary way. Recommendations for more robust stakeholder engagement in radiological protection are formulated based on the findings.","[{""name"": ""C. Turcanu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M.

It is customary to attach great importance to blood, consisting of uniform elements and plasma, constantly circulating through the vessels. It provides gas exchange, metabolism and the delivery of hormones and bioregulators in their tissues. The success of hemocirculation strongly determines the completeness of the realization of the genetic growth potential and productivity of the animal and is closely related to the activity of aggregation of blood cells. Purpose: to find out the activity of aggregation of the main formed elements of the blood in newborn calves. The work was carried out on 32 newborn calves of black-motley breed, born of healthy cows after 2–3 pregnancies. The calves were examined on 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8 and 9–10 days of life. In the work, hematological and statistical research methods are applied. For newborns in calves, a tendency towards increased aggregation activity of red blood cells was revealed. This was combined with a low platelet aggregation, which tended to increase. The low aggregation of neutrophils in these calves also gradually increased. In newborn calves of optimal physiological status, there is a tendency to increase the aggregation of the main formed elements of the blood, which is a response to environmental influences.","[{""name"": ""Tatyana I.

10.1002/er.6219,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Pencil-traced-graphite on cellulose: A rapid and solvent-less approach for solar steam generation,"SummarySolar steam generation has proven to be a sustainable method to handle water shortage. Various materials for solar steam generation have been introduced in the past few years. However, the utilization of tedious and complicated synthesis to generate a photoactive layer is a matter of concern in the fabrication solar steam generation devices. Thus, improved methods toward cost‐effectiveness by exploring economical materials with simple manufacturing process are urgently and essentially needed. In this study, we first report on manufacturing hybrid membranes using commercially accessible materials, that is, cellulose paper and pencil graphite. The proposed method is to trace and coat a cellulose paper directly with a pencil without the use of solvents and chemicals, and it is possible to create an ecofriendly photoactive layer without a complicated process. The formed pencil graphite‐traced membranes were successfully utilized in solar steam generation and showed excellent steam generation rate of 4.32 kg/m2h which is almost 3.5 times more than that of pristine membrane at solar intensity of 3 Sun. The developed method could be widely utilized in the field of solar steam generation, since it is very facile and simple, and can be integrated to other commonly used materials for solar steam generation such as fabric and wood. In addition, on‐site production is possible, so it has a potential to be utilized in remote and resource‐limited areas for steam generation.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Zakria Tariq"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea"", ""Advanced Technology Research Center Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea"", ""Future Convergence Engineering Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Zahid Hanif"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea"", ""Advanced Technology Research Center Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Moonwoo La"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Dongwhi Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering (integrated Engineering) Kyung Hee University  Yongin South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sung Jea Park"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea"", ""Advanced Technology Research Center Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea"", ""Future Convergence Engineering Korea University of Technology and Education  Cheonan South Korea""]}]","[""10.1038/nature11475"", ""10.1038/ngeo2248"", ""10.1038/nature13774"", ""10.1016/j.agwat.2005.07.001"", ""10.1002/gch2.201700094"", ""10.1021/nn304948h"", ""10.1016/S0360-5442(03)00172-5"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2017.09.042"", ""10.1002/adma.201501832"", ""10.1039/C7MH01064H"", ""10.1002/adma.201701756"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2016.75"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b08619"", ""10.1002/aenm.201702149"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.10.049"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.110529"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b18071"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b15125"", ""10.1039/C9TA05935K"", ""10.1002/cssc.201902775"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.05.106"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.053"", ""10.1002/adsu.201600013"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.065"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.12.008"", ""10.1002/solr.202000232"", ""10.1002/adma.201807716"", ""10.1039/C7TA04834C"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2019.110347"", ""10.1016/j.solmat.2019.110111"", ""10.1002/er.5012"", ""10.1007/s10646-012-0862-y"", ""10.1021/acs.est.5b00345"", ""10.1002/adma.201702590"", ""10.1039/C8EE00567B"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114410"", ""10.1002/er.5603"", ""10.1016/j.susmat.2020.e00180"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.116480"", ""10.1016/j.scib.2019.08.022"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2014.02.039"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2018.03.024"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.190"", ""10.1002/adsu.201800055"", ""10.1039/C8TA03280G"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2019.07.023"", ""10.1016/j.mtener.2018.04.004"", ""10.1073/pnas.1613031113"", ""10.1038/nnano.2015.37"", ""10.1039/C7TA05976K"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b02094"", ""10.1002/cssc.201802485"", ""10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b04157"", ""10.1002/aenm.201802158"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.080"", ""10.1039/C7NR05149B"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b01992""]","['Energy', 'Environmental Science']","['Water Science and Technology', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0815 水利工程', 0.7539), ('0908 水产', 0.7497)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1002/er.6189,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Parametric sensitivity analysis on the cold start process of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell,"SummarySubzero start‐up of the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is one of the most challenging tasks to be solved before commercialization. During the subzero start‐up process, water generated in the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode side of PEMFC is susceptible to freeze，which makes active sites covered by the ice and gases failed to reach the surface of the catalyst layer (CL), leading to a substantial decay and even ending up with a failure of the start‐up. Given that many factors affect the cold start process, the relative contribution of the essential factors on the cold start process is independently analyzed using first‐order finite‐difference sensitivity analysis from −20°C to −30°C. The effect of essential parameters on the cold start process is quantified. The investigated parameters include the ratio of bipolar plate (BP) thickness to that of the CL (RBP/CL), the starting voltage (Vini), stoichiometry ratios, inlet gas temperature (Tin), the porosity of the CL (εCL), initial membrane water content (λini), membrane thickness (θmem), the volume fraction of ionomer (ωCL) in CLs, and the heat capacity of the BP (ρcpBP). Results show that the cold start process is most sensitive to RBP/CL and λini. Significant improvement of cold start performance can be achieved by appropriately adjusting RBP/CL, λini, Tin, and εCL. Appropriately increasing the Vini also can be a method to improve cold start performance, especially for the cold start from −30°C. Besides, optimized ωCL in CLs, proper θmem, and lower ρcpBP can contribute to better performance, especially for the cold start from −20°C.","[{""name"": ""Huipeng Niu"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Energy and Power Engineering, Beijing Lab of New Energy Vehicles and Key Lab of Regional Air Pollution Control, Beijing University of Technology Beijing University of Technology  Beijing P.R.

A quick and accurate diagnosis of hydrogen leakage is essential to suppress further leakage. Therefore, an optimized model‐based diagnosis approach is proposed to diagnose the hydrogen leakage in hydrogen supply system of fuel cell truck. The simulation model of hydrogen leakage is established. Two novel leakage features are proposed and then trained and tested by applying support vector machines (SVMs) to classify different hydrogen leakage levels. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to improve the performance of hydrogen leakage detection method in terms of accuracy. The results show that the proposed hydrogen leakage diagnosis method can effectively diagnose different hydrogen leakage levels. Especially for small hydrogen leakage, the proposed approach also shows enough effectiveness. Moreover, the proposed diagnosis method can detect hydrogen leakage both under parking state and continuously changing driving conditions. The proposed diagnosis method has good practicability and can guide the design of alarm system, which is important to save hydrogen energy and improve the reliability of the system.","[{""name"": ""Shu Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive and Traffic Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Ren He"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive and Traffic Engineering Jiangsu University  Zhenjiang China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.08.006"", ""10.1002/er.2983"", ""10.1007/s10704-010-9560-z"", ""10.1002/er.7001"", ""10.1002/er.7902"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044362"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.08.148"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116508"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2018.01.015"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.10.107"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.04.114"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.04.163"", ""10.1049/el.2014.0565"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.145"", ""10.3182/20090630-4-ES-2003.00088"", ""10.1016/j.jprocont.2019.09.010"", ""10.1109/TCST.2007.916311"", ""10.1049/iet-rpg.2016.0158"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2007.08.078"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2018.11.001""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

Conventional SE synthesis methods such as high‐energy ball‐milling and solid‐state synthesis require a significant amount of energy. Consequently, in recent years, several studies have been conducted on developing liquid phase methods for mass‐producing SEs. One such liquid phase method uses tetrahydrofuran (THF, an aprotic solvent) and ethanol (EtOH, a protic solvent) to synthesize Li6PS5Cl. However, the synthesized SE contains impurities that are generated by reactions between EtOH and PS43−. In this study, we present a novel one‐pot liquid phase method for synthesizing Li6PS5Cl using THF. The synthesized SE had a high ionic conductivity (2.03 mS·cm−1) and low electronic conductivity (7.44 × 10−8 S·cm−1). Notably, it had few impurities and was essentially composed of a single phase. Furthermore, an ASSB cell composed of LiNbO3‐coated LiNi0.6Mn0.2CoO2 (NMC622)/Li6PS5Cl/Li‐In, which contained the synthesized SE, exhibited a high discharge capacity of 156 mAh·g−1. Therefore, the liquid phase method proposed herein can be used to synthesize SEs, and can help realize mass production and commercialization.","[{""name"": ""Young Jin Heo"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering Korea University  Seoul Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Seung‐Deok Seo"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering Korea University  Seoul Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Suk‐Ho Hwang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering Korea University  Seoul Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Sun Hee Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering Korea University  Seoul Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Dong‐Wan Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering Korea University  Seoul Korea""]}]","[""10.1038/natrevmats.2016.13"", ""10.1021/cm901452z"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.009"", ""10.1149/2.1571707jes"", ""10.1021/ja029326t"", ""10.1038/srep02261"", ""10.1038/nenergy.2016.30"", ""10.1021/cr030203g"", ""10.1002/aenm.201501590"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2007.03.001"", ""10.1021/acsenergylett.1c02428"", ""10.1039/C8TA09477B"", ""10.1021/ja3110895"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2015.11.032"", ""10.1039/C6TA02294D"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2016.09.155"", ""10.1039/C7RA09081A"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.09.097"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.09.241"", ""10.1021/acsenergylett.8b01997"", ""10.1149/2.0301903jes"", ""10.1002/adma.202200083"", ""10.1002/pssa.201001117"", ""10.1021/acsaem.8b00280"", ""10.1039/D0MA00115E"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.117"", ""10.1038/s41570-019-0078-2"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b19181"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.228158"", ""10.1039/C9TA04772G"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b04842"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2015.09.010"", ""10.1002/aenm.201902881"", ""10.1039/C8TA05537H"", ""10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00751"", ""10.1038/srep21302"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2005.03.025"", ""10.1002/batt.201900218"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c03198"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.02.160"", ""10.1002/aenm.201800035"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2012.06.008"", ""10.1038/s41467-017-01187-y"", ""10.1021/acsaem.0c02771"", ""10.1002/ange.200703900"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b11530"", ""10.1016/j.ssi.2019.115217"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b01137"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00931""]","['Engineering', 'Chemistry']","['Inorganic Chemistry', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0703 化学', 0.7396), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7296)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

CORTEX aims at developing innovative core monitoring techniques that allow detecting anomalies in nuclear reactors, e.g. excessive vibrations of core internals. The technique will be mainly based on using the fluctuations in neutron flux, i.e. noise analysis. The project will result in a deepened understanding of the physical processes involved. This will allow utilities to detect operational problems at a very early stage, and to take proper actions before such problems have any adverse effect on plant safety and reliability. The purpose of the experimental campaigns in the AKR-2 and CROCUS reactors is to produce noise-specific experimental data for the validation of the neutron noise computational models developed within this framework. The first campaigns at both facilities consisted in measurements at reference static states, and with the addition of mechanical perturbations. In the AKR-2 reactor, perturbations were induced by two devices: a rotating absorber and a vibrating absorber, both sets in experimental channels close to the core. In CROCUS, the project benefited from the COLIBRI experimental program: 18 periphery fuel rods were oscillated at a maximum of ±2 mm around their central position in the Hz range. The present article documents the experimental setups and measurements for each facility and perturbation type.","[{""name"": ""Vincent Lamirand"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adolfo Rais"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sebastian Hübner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carsten Lange"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joachim Pohlus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Uwe Paquee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christoph Pohl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oskari Pakari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pavel Frajtag"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Godat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mathieu Hursin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Axel Laureau"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Grégory Perret"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carlo Fiorina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andreas Pautz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/TNS.2018.2831180"", ""10.1080/00295450.2019.1701906"", ""10.1080/00223131.2002.10875256"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2005.09.012"", ""10.1051/epjconf/202022504020""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Radiation', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

The proposed system employs solar heliostat and solar PV subsystems for hydrogen, cooling and power production. The solar heliostat field, thermochemical copper‐chlorine (Cu‐Cl) cycle, refrigeration, methanol production and methanol separation are the major components in the proposed system. First, clean hydrogen is produced via a four‐step thermochemical Cu‐Cl cycle which is further synthesized into methanol. The proposed configuration is investigated under both energy and exergy analyses and software package of Engineering Equation Solver and Aspen Plus are employed for modeling and simulation. The performance index is calculated in terms of efficiencies, and the calculated overall energy and exergy efficiencies are 37.58% and 36.8%. The energetic and exergetic efficiencies of the Cu‐Cl cycle are found to be 39.6% and 43.5% respectively. Further sensitivity results are presented and discussed in this study.","[{""name"": ""Haris Ishaq"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Research Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science University of Ontario Institute of Technology  Oshawa Ontario Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Ibrahim Dincer"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Research Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science University of Ontario Institute of Technology  Oshawa Ontario Canada""]}]","[""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.08.054"", ""10.1504/IJEX.2016.078093"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.223"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2004.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2011.07.038"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.06.017"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2006.06.011"", ""10.1016/B978-0-444-63903-5.00001-7"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.05.197"", ""10.1002/9780470750025"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-5119-7_9"", ""10.1002/er.3329"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.05.019"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.01.249"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.03.023"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.10.008"", ""10.1115/1.4044023""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"
10.1002/er.6696,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,High-heat flux flow and heat transfer transitions in a supercritical loop: Numerical verification and correlation,"SummarySupercritical heat transfer loops are widely used in large‐scale thermal equipment, which development is restricted by the thermal‐hydraulic characteristics, especially the safety and thermal efficiency under high‐heat fluxes. This study is focused on numerical simulation for a 4‐m test section of the loop and further analyzes the flow transitions and heat transfer mechanisms from subcritical to supercritical. The heat transfer characteristics of supercritical water in the vertical loop were simulated for conditions: P = 24 MPa, Tin = 320°C, 340°C, mass flux (G) = 1000 kg/m2s, 1500 kg/m2s, and heat fluxes varied from 100 to 1200 kW/m2. The heat transfer transitions are analyzed from the perspective of local parameters that affect the status of both core flow and boundary layers. The empirical correlation and the error backpropagation (BP) neural network prediction model are proposed and compared with experimental and numerical results. The results show that transitions of both boundary layer and core flow from subcritical to supercritical contribute to the heat transfer behaviors: normal heat transfer, heat transfer deterioration, and heat transfer enhancement. The zero‐velocity gradient (∂u/∂r = 0) on the M‐shaped velocity curve causes the turbulent shear stress near the wall to be close to zero, which leads to the suppression of the turbulence. At the same time, the thickness of the thermal boundary layer reaches the maximum, resulting in a large thermal resistance, which affects the heat transfer from the wall to the core area.","[{""name"": ""Dong Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Engineering Thermophysics Chinese Academy of Sciences  Beijing China"", ""University of Chinese Academy of Sciences  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Lin Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Engineering Thermophysics Chinese Academy of Sciences  Beijing China"", ""University of Chinese Academy of Sciences  Beijing China"", ""Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Low and Medium Grade Energy (Tianjin University) Ministry of Education of China  Tianjin China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiaxiang Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Engineering Thermophysics Chinese Academy of Sciences  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yongchang Feng"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Engineering Thermophysics Chinese Academy of Sciences  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.4018/978-1-7998-5796-9"", ""10.1002/er.3221"", ""10.2172/4153321"", ""10.3390/en13112935"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.08.059"", ""10.1115/1.4026920"", ""10.1115/1.4047760"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2019.110207"", ""10.1016/0017-9310(72)90148-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.119233"", ""10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2018.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115987"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.118871"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.01.077"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.11.039"", ""10.1002/er.4602"", ""10.1016/S0017-9310(02)00119-9"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.12.121"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2010.06.028"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.02.027"", ""10.1115/1.802523"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2013.09.045"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.12.097"", ""10.2298/TSCI190813007W"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2018.12.028"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2017.03.016"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.119564"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.11.031"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2017.06.013"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.03.145"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2010.05.030"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2010.06.012"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.01.017""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

So far, this project has led to the achievement of the highest confined ion energies of any fusion experiment (&gt; 200 keV) as well as, recently, the lowest impurities of any fusion plasma. Among privately-funded fusion efforts, our experiments have achieved the highest ratio of fusion energy generation to device energy input (wall-plug efficiency) and the highest nτT product of 3.4 × 1020 keV-s/m3. Our calculations and simulations indicate that the quantum magnetic field effect will allow a great reduction in bremsstrahlung radiation with p-B11 fuel. For commercial fusion, this approach has several major advantages. The small size and simplicity of design of the DPF can lead to 5 MW generators that are much cheaper than any existing energy source, that can be manufactured by mass production and that can be located close to loads. It shares with other p-B11 approaches a lack of neutron damage and radioactive waste. Direct energy conversion of the ion beam and x-rays produced by the device avoids the high costs associated with thermal cycles. With adequate, but still modest, financial resources we anticipate working prototype generators could be ready for production by 2026–2030.","[{""name"": ""Eric J.

The catalytic activity of the new 50 wt% CoFe2O4/SiO2 and 50 wt% CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5 catalysts were evaluated for direct methane decomposition to hydrogen production at fixed operating temperature of 800°C. The physiochemical properties of the fresh and spent catalysts were characterized by several techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), X‐ray diffractometer (XRD), Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric (TGA), and Raman spectroscopy. The CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5 catalyst exhibited higher activity and stability than CoFe2O4/SiO2 catalyst. Maximum methane conversion reached 37.35% and hydrogen formation rate of 76.48 × 10−5 mol H2 g−1 min−1 at time on stream (TOS) of 300 min for CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5, while its 5.80% with 15.82 × 10−5 mol H2 g−1 min−1 at TOS of 30 min. The XRD, Raman, and XPS results confirm the presence of CoFe2O4 particles on the CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5 catalyst surface, while the CoFe2O4 particles partially shield with SiO2 in CoFe2O4/SiO2 catalyst. SEM images of spent catalysts elucidated the formation of filamentous carbon which indirectly confirm the higher distribution of CoFe2O4 in CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5 than that of CoFe2O4/SiO2. The deposited carbon on spent CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5 catalyst was evaluated using TGA, which was found to be ca. 50 wt%.Highlights CoFe2O4/SiO2 and CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5 catalysts synthesized and characterized by various techniques. H‐ZSM‐5 and SiO2 support material were found strongly affects the physiochemical properties and the methane decomposition activity of CoFe2O4 catalyst. CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5 catalyst performance reached 37.4% and the hydrogen formation rate was 76.5 × 10−5 mol H2 g−1 min−1. CoFe2O4/SiO2 catalyst demonstrated a negligible activity toward methane cracking and producing hydrogen. The estimated deposited carbon on the spent catalysts were 1 wt% and 50 wt% for CoFe2O4/SiO2 and CoFe2O4/H‐ZSM‐5, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Abdulrahman I.

Based on unfavorable assumptions given by the theoretical simulations, no hydrogenation of photocathodes and its effect on the conversion efficiency of in p‐type DSSCs are reported. While the theoretical works have addressed the study of the electronic structure of hydrogenated Cu2O, our experimental work aims to highlight the features of hydrogenated Cu2O/dye interface which are critical in DSSC and still unexplored. We report the beneficial effect of hydrogen in Cu2O on anchoring of the dye leading to an improvement by 98% for JSC and thus, improving the solar energy conversion efficiency of p‐type DSSC. Even in 2% H2 atmosphere, the significant increase in JSC had demonstrated the suitability of hydrogenation in the case of p‐type semiconductors as an effective and low‐cost way to augment the efficiency of p‐DSSCs.","[{""name"": ""Melinda Vajda"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute for Research and Development in Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter  Timisoara Romania"", ""Politehnica University Timisoara  Timisoara Romania""]}, {""name"": ""Daniel Ursu"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute for Research and Development in Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter  Timisoara Romania""]}, {""name"": ""Cristina Mosoarca"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute for Research and Development in Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter  Timisoara Romania""]}, {""name"": ""Narcis Duteanu"", ""affiliation"": [""Politehnica University Timisoara  Timisoara Romania""]}, {""name"": ""Marinela Miclau"", ""affiliation"": [""National Institute for Research and Development in Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter  Timisoara Romania""]}]","[""10.1002/adfm.200901476"", ""10.1021/cr900356p"", ""10.1002/er.4915"", ""10.1002/er.3366"", ""10.1002/er.4298"", ""10.1002/er.4255"", ""10.1002/er.3503"", ""10.1002/er.4479"", ""10.1016/j.coelec.2017.03.008"", ""10.1039/C5CC06759F"", ""10.1016/j.ccr.2012.04.017"", ""10.1021/ar900275b"", ""10.1021/jz400861v"", ""10.1002/cssc.201700152"", ""10.1039/C6RA17879K"", ""10.1021/jz3003603"", ""10.1021/am501783b"", ""10.1039/C6CP02209J"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2018.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.011"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.90.045203"", ""10.1038/srep27049"", ""10.1063/1.2194315"", ""10.1557/mrc.2016.33"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-18051-0"", ""10.1039/C6RA23449F"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.186403"", ""10.5488/CMP.22.23702"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.06.180"", ""10.1016/S0020-1693(99)00407-7"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b11883"", ""10.1364/JOSA.38.000448"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134685"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2009.01.010"", ""10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b01122"", ""10.3390/molecules22040677"", ""10.1039/FT9908600959"", ""10.1007/s40145-013-0069-6"", ""10.1063/1.1832736"", ""10.1021/ed084p685"", ""10.1039/C1JM14478B"", ""10.1021/nl900772q"", ""10.1038/srep35158"", ""10.1088/0022-3719/9/8/014"", ""10.1021/ja8001474"", ""10.1002/adma.200802461"", ""10.1002/adma.200903151"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2009.04.045"", ""10.1016/j.cap.2016.01.002"", ""10.1039/C7NR01059A"", ""10.2174/1876387101205010049"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.05.135"", ""10.1021/la100137u""]","['Energy', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

Thermal variation of resistivity (ρ), thermopower (S), carrier concentration (nH), magneto‐resistance (MR), and magnetization measurements have been performed on synthesized Cobalt‐doped n‐type Bi2Te3, viz., Bi2−xCoxTe3 (x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1) samples. Theoretical simulation of electrical and thermal transport parameters has been done in the frame of the Boltzmann equation approach and shows satisfactory agreement with experimental results. The thermoelectric performance, as estimated through power factor is found to increase with Co doping, with an enhancement of ~47% is observed for Bi1.9Co0.1Te3 sample. The positive linear MR and nearly cusp like behaviour at low field and low temperature confirms the presence of weak anti‐localization (WAL) effects in pristine and Co‐doped Bi2Te3 samples. The field‐dependent magnetization showing a cusp‐like nature in the susceptibility data around zero field regions signifies the existence of topological surface state (TSS). MR along with magnetization data confirms the robustness of TSS with Co doping.","[{""name"": ""P.

Side blockages arranged in the cathode flow channel is proposed for performance improving of PEMFC. Conventional straight, side blockage alternating with straight, side blockage flow channels are studied to analyze the effects of side blockages arrangement on the distribution of velocity, temperature, reactant concentration and water content and the performance of PEMFC. Results show that the O2 mole concentration in the flow field could be increased by the presence of side blockages, thus the convective mass transfer coefficient and performance are both improved. At current density of 2.0 A cm−2, the performance of PEMFC increases by 9.5%. In comparison to the straight flow channel, flow channels installing side blockage present about 1.5 K lower of the maximum temperature, more uniform temperature distribution and increased Nusselt number, indicating the enhancement of heat transfer. Based on field synergy theory, it’s found that the average angles describing the synergetic effect of heat transfer and mass transfer decrease with the installation of side blockages. This reveals the enhancement of the synergetic degree in heat and mass transfer processes under the turbulence of side blockages, which coincides with the improved performance of PEMFC.","[{""name"": ""Jun Shen"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Automotive Components Technology Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Changqing Du"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Automotive Components Technology Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Fuwu Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Automotive Components Technology Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Ben Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Automotive Components Technology Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhengkai Tu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Energy and Power Engineering Huazhong University of Science and Technology  Wuhan China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.125"", ""10.1002/er.7085"", ""10.1002/er.7635"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.122235"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.09.022"", ""10.1002/er.6489"", ""10.1002/er.6415"", ""10.1007/s11581-016-1644-y"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.037"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121900"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.119951"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.119313"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.04.023"", ""10.1016/j.egyr.2021.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120497"", ""10.1002/tee.22328"", ""10.1149/2.F03152if"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.008"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.09.110"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112335"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114464"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.252"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.05.112"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.12.040"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.121957"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2009.06.012"", ""10.1007/s10973-019-08354-x"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.019"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.12.138"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2021.115077"", ""10.4271/2021-01-0740"", ""10.1002/fuce.201800135"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.021"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2013.06.046"", ""10.1007/s11434-009-0223-2"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.07.053"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.07.034"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.08.041""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Molten chloride salt fast reactors (MCFRs) are a type of MSR. Compared to molten fluoride salt reactors (MFSRs), MCFRs have a higher solubility of heavy metal atoms, a harder neutron spectrum, lower accumulation of fission products (FPs), and better breeding and transmutation performance. Thus, MCFRs have been recognized as a type of MSR with great prospects for future development. However, as the most important feature for MSRs, the effect of different reprocessing modes on MCFRs must be researched in depth. As such, this study investigated the effect of different isotopes, especially FPs, on the neutronic performance of an MCFR, such as its breeding performance. Furthermore, the characteristics of the different reprocessing modes and MCFR rates were analyzed in terms of safety, radioactivity level, neutron economy, and breeding capacity. In the end, a reprocessing method suitable for MCFRs was determined through calculation and analysis, which provides a reference for the further research of MCFRs.","[{""name"": ""Liao-Yuan He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yong Cui"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Liang Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shao-Peng Xia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lin-Yi Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yang Zou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rui Yan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2172/859029"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2014.02.014"", ""10.13182/NT8-2-118"", ""10.2172/5352526"", ""10.2172/4206400"", ""10.13182/NT07-A3846"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2013.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2013.06.006"", ""10.1007/s41365-020-0740-x"", ""10.2172/4319127"", ""10.1016/0302-2927(74)90045-2"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2006.02.013"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2015.02.016"", ""10.2172/4030941"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2013.10.015"", ""10.11889/j.0253-3219.2018.hjs.41.070602"", ""10.1007/s41365-020-00790-x"", ""10.12943/CNR.2018.00010"", ""10.12943/CNR.2018.00010"", ""10.13182/FST14-851"", ""10.1080/00295639.2020.1798728"", ""10.13182/NSE07-49"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2016.09.025"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2018.09.032"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2019.01.036"", ""10.1016/j.net.2019.12.014"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2019.01.030"", ""10.11889/j.0253-3219.2020.hjs.43.010604""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Radiation', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

To reach such an ambitious and urgent goal, an energy efficient renovation of the existing building stock is needed. Nonetheless, some buildings must be treated with special attention because of their historical value. Thus, it is advisable to evaluate their retrofit with the aid of calibrated hygrothermal simulation models, whose calibration can be complex and time demanding. This work shows the strategy adopted for obtaining a calibrated model for a XVI-century construction located northern Italy, by means of indoor air temperature and relative humidity monitoring, plus CO2 measurements and in situ inspection. This study accounts for the first 9 months of measurements performed on the case study and it adopts HAMBase as a simulation tool because of its ability to combine heat and moisture calculations in monumental buildings with HVAC systems. This paper aims at showing the main problems found in developing and calibrating the simulation model while defining a procedure to overcome them. The major outcome of the study is that the stratification of temperature detected in the main monumental room could be successfully modelled via dividing this space into different zones, vertically, by introducing fictitious interzonal surfaces made of a material with high thermal conductivity and vapour permeability. All in all, the strategy adopted in this work can be used by other researchers and professionals to overcome problems that can be commonly met when modelling similar historic constructions.","[{""name"": ""Magda Posani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maria Do Rosario Veiga"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vasco Peixoto de Freitas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karin Kompatscher"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Henk Schellen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/15583058.2019.1650133"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.12.052"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.08.044"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.09.717"", ""10.1080/00393630.2019.1638666"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.09.395"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.06.034"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.09.703"", ""10.1007/s12273-011-0026-7"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2012.01.008"", ""10.3390/en7128465"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.468"", ""10.3390/en10101587""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Building and Construction', 'Earth-Surface Processes', 'Conservation']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0709 地质学', 0.7376), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7361)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

Therefore, it was necessary to find alternative packaging materials that were easily degraded, including edible film. The main raw materials for edible film were alginate and plasticizers including glycerol and virgin coconut oil (VCO). The aims of this study were to determine the characteristics of edible films composed of alginate, glycerol and VCO and to determine the best concentration of alginate in edible films. The study was carried out through the manufacture of edible films composed of alginates at various concentrations (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6%), 10% glycerol and 0.01% VCO. The characteristics observed included thickness, tensile strength, elongation, solubility, and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR). The results showed that increasing the concentration of alginate increased the thickness, tensile strength, and elongation of edible films but reduced the solubility and WVTR of edible films. The best alginate concentration was 4% with the following characteristics: thickness, 0.12±0.01 mm; tensile strength, 1.59±0.12 MPa; elongation, 48.73±1.97%; solubility, 92.07±0.57%; and WVTR, 49.18±0.59 g/m2.24 hours. The various alginate concentrations significantly affected the thickness, tensile strength, elongation, and water vapor transmission rate of the edible film produced.","[{""name"": ""Adinda Dwi Putri Marismandani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Amir Husni"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1126/science.1260352"", ""10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2008.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.09.019"", ""10.4315/0362-028X-67.4.833"", ""10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.03.006"", ""10.1080/10408690290825466""]","['Materials Science', 'Environmental Science']","['Pollution', 'Biomaterials', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7179), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7085)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)]]"

The materials were analyzed by FTIR, SEM, XRD, and BET methods. The adsorption capacity of the MA-A for U(VI) was 451.4 mg/g. The Langmuir isotherm model well described the experimental data for the adsorption of U(VI) ions. The second-order kinetic model data proposed that the adsorption of U(VI) ions preferred the chemisorption mechanism. The adsorption enthalpy of the MA-A beads for U(VI) ions was 35.4 kJ/mol. After seven cycles of use, the adsorption capacity of MA-A beads was not significantly changed for U(VI) ions. Finally, the functionalization of MA beads with agmatine ligand can be a good candidate for applications for environmental technologies to remove metal ions.","[{""name"": ""Gulay Bayramoglu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mehmet Yakup Arica"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.micromeso.2015.12.040"", ""10.1007/s12221-021-0133-8"", ""10.1016/j.eti.2020.101254"", ""10.1016/j.jssc.2022.123168"", ""10.1007/s10967-014-2964-x"", ""10.1080/03067319.2021.1884242"", ""10.1007/s10967-024-09362-4"", ""10.1007/s10967-023-09264-x"", ""10.1002/jccs.202200369"", ""10.1016/j.micromeso.2021.111647"", ""10.1016/j.micromeso.2021.111223"", ""10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.126173"", ""10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.09.036"", ""10.1007/s10967-017-5216-z"", ""10.1007/s10532-023-10024-7"", ""10.1007/s10967-023-08861-0"", ""10.1007/s10967-016-4828-z"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.124840"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2017.12.142"", ""10.3390/nano11051345"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2022.10.233"", ""10.3390/inorganics8060040"", ""10.1007/s12221-022-0221-4"", ""10.1016/j.jwpe.2018.08.013"", ""10.1016/j.micromeso.2017.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.01.173"", ""10.1080/10643389.2018.1547621"", ""10.1016/j.reactfunctpolym.2018.02.008"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2021.128553"", ""10.1007/s10967-021-07708-w"", ""10.1007/s10967-023-09254-z"", ""10.1007/s10967-021-07991-7"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.03.165"", ""10.1016/j.jece.2021.105681"", ""10.1016/j.arabjc.2020.102959"", ""10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.128508"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.157604"", ""10.1007/s10965-021-02819-0"", ""10.1016/j.molliq.2021.118375"", ""10.1021/acsanm.8b00103"", ""10.1007/s13762-023-05042-0"", ""10.1515/zpch-1907-5723"", ""10.1016/j.cherd.2019.04.039"", ""10.1007/s10967-022-08223-2"", ""10.1016/S0032-9592(98)00112-5"", ""10.1016/j.seppur.2005.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.034"", ""10.1016/j.cherd.2022.02.031"", ""10.1007/s10967-022-08739-7"", ""10.1007/s10967-023-09266-9"", ""10.1007/s10967-020-07455-4"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2024.151045"", ""10.1007/s10570-024-05909-6"", ""10.1007/s11356-024-32208-1"", ""10.1007/s11705-021-2054-x"", ""10.1007/s10570-020-03337-w""]","['Materials Science', 'Chemistry', 'Environmental Science']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Inorganic Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0703 化学', 0.7396), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7296)]]"

Ever more powerful accelerators deliver beams of continuously increasing intensity, which brings targets of current technology to their limits and beyond. We motivate efforts to produce targets with improved properties, which calls for a better understanding of targets produced by molecular plating, the current standard method. Complementary analytical methods will help shedding more light on their chemical and physical changes in the beam.

Analyzing experimental data using Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models revealed coefficients of determination R2 exceeding 90%. The Freundlich isotherm was found to be more suitable for describing the adsorption process.","[{""name"": ""Marek Hupian"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michal Galamboš"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eva Viglašová"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oľga Rosskopfová"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vipul Vilas Kusumkar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Daňo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1021/ie50636a005"", ""10.1007/s11783-020-1265-6"", ""10.3390/w10020182"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109797"", ""10.1007/s13762-020-03060-w"", ""10.1155/2022/7218759"", ""10.3390/app112411640"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2012.01.048"", ""10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.jaap.2010.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2008.08.022"", ""10.1016/j.jaap.2020.104839"", ""10.3390/c6020021"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.01.033"", ""10.3390/ma14051083"", ""10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.12.023"", ""10.1016/j.arabjc.2015.05.021"", ""10.1007/BF02389473"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.05.010"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.01.013"", ""10.1002/9783527613366"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128728"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-33990-8"", ""10.1007/s42452-020-03524-1"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2022.104398"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.195"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2018.11.146"", ""10.1002/anie.201510723"", ""10.1007/s10967-014-3303-y"", ""10.1134/S207020511206010X"", ""10.1007/s10967-017-5532-3"", ""10.1021/es8003156"", ""10.1021/es104343p"", ""10.1016/j.gca.2012.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121721"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2016.10.135"", ""10.1081/SS-100107214"", ""10.1021/acs.est.9b05341"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2023.107267"", ""10.1007/s10967-015-4351-7"", ""10.1007/s10967-016-4742-4"", ""10.1007/s10311-020-01005-w"", ""10.1007/s10967-015-3953-4"", ""10.1007/s10967-015-4142-1"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-35534-w"", ""10.1007/s11356-018-3815-z"", ""10.3390/w11081559"", ""10.1016/B978-0-323-90763-7.00005-6"", ""10.1016/0956-9618(96)00148-8"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2022.110296"", ""10.1007/s10967-016-4850-1"", ""10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01004"", ""10.1038/s41467-017-01208-w""]","['Chemistry', 'Environmental Science']","['Inorganic Chemistry', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Water Science and Technology']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0703 化学', 0.7396), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7296)], [('0703 化学', 0.7613), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7594)], [('0815 水利工程', 0.7539), ('0908 水产', 0.7497)]]"
10.1002/er.7010,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,A review on combustion instabilities in energy generating devices utilizing oxyfuel combustion,"SummaryThis paper reviewed theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies on combustion instabilities in combustors for energy‐producing devices such as gas turbines, boilers, and furnaces utilizing oxyfuel combustion technology. Oxyfuel combustion as a CO2 capture technology gives encouraging and promising solutions for controlling greenhouse gases emission from combustion devices. However, the major concerns with oxyfuel systems are the combustion instabilities mainly arising from the CO2 dilution required for controlling excessive temperatures. Higher dilution levels or significantly nonuniform distribution of CO2 in the mixture can potentially lead to static and/or dynamic instabilities associated with local flame extinction and unsteady heat release rate, respectively. As in the case of lean premixed air/fuel flames, combustion instabilities are among the most critical operational challenges encountered in CO2‐diluted oxyfuel systems as well. Existing literature on flame instabilities has predominately focused on air‐fuel flames, with very few research studies dedicated to the same phenomena in oxyfuel combustion. With an ever‐increasing push toward carbon capture and reduction in NOx emissions, it has become important for the combustion community to accelerate research efforts in the direction of oxyfuel combustion systems. This review study on flame instabilities in oxyfuel combustors is one small step in that very direction. This paper starts with discussions on the theoretical mechanisms of combustion instabilities. Then a range of numerical and experimental studies, from premixed to non‐premixed flames, are presented and discussed. The main objective is to summarize recent progress in understanding instabilities in oxyfuel combustion systems, focusing primarily on the effect of CO2 dilution on flame stability. A range of experimental and numerical studies by various groups have strongly associated both static and dynamic instabilities in oxyfuel systems with diluent concentration, suggesting higher concentrations potentially result in a stratified mixture field which leads to higher heat release fluctuations and pressure oscillations. As such, many combustion systems use hydrogen enrichment to enhance static stability while employing flow and/or fuel modulation to dampen dynamic instabilities in oxyfuel combustors. Finally, we highlight and summarize some of the key issues and unsolved questions that still challenge researchers and, therefore, need to be the focus of future research work as regards to oxyfuel combustion.","[{""name"": ""Zubairu Abubakar"", ""affiliation"": [""Mechanical Engineering Department King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals  Dhahran Saudi Arabia""]}, {""name"": ""Esmail M.

Heavy flavor production at the EIC provides access to nPDFs in the poorly constrained high Bjorken-x region, allows us to study the quark and gluon fragmentation processes, and constrains parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter. Scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory are developing a new physics program to study heavy flavor production, flavor tagged jets, and heavy flavor hadron-jet correlations in the nucleon/nucleus going direction at the future EIC. The proposed measurements will provide a unique way to explore the flavor dependent fragmentation functions and energy loss in a heavy nucleus. They will constrain the initial-state eﬀects that are critical for the interpretation of previous and ongoing heavy ion measurements at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. We show an initial conceptual design of the proposed Forward Silicon Tracking (FST) detector at the EIC, which is essential to carry out the heavy flavor measurements. We further present initial feasibility studies/simulations of heavy flavor hadron reconstruction using the proposed FST.","[{""name"": ""Xuan Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ivan Vitev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Melynda Brooks"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lukasz Cincio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J.

In this respect, the material was prepared and characterized to confirm its chemical composition and structure. Results illustrate that the synthesized nano-cryptomelane has a tunnel structure with particle size ranged between 4 and 6 nm. The material feasibility was detected by conducting a series of batch experiments for determination of the kinetic and equilibrium performance of the removal process. All characteristic Raman bands for Mn–O lattice vibrations within the (2 × 2) tunnel structure of MnO6 octahedral are observed which confirm formation of nano-cryptomelane. The specific surface area (SSA) for nano-cryptomelane was calculated and equal to 299.03 m2/g while the surface fractal information (Ds) was2.53. The process sensitivity to changes of H+ concentration is attributed to changes in structural elements-species distribution at the solid/aqueous interface. The pH optimum value was desired at pH 5 for exchange of Cs+ and/or Co2+ with K+ ions.

The development of novel methods for charged particle reconstruction at the HL-LHC incorporating machine learning techniques or based entirely on machine learning is a vibrant area of research. In the past two years, algorithms for track pattern recognition based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a particularly promising approach. Previous work mainly aimed at establishing proof of principle. In the present document we describe new algorithms that can handle complex realistic detectors. The new algorithms are implemented in ACTS, a common framework for tracking software. This work aims at implementing a realistic GNN-based algorithm that can be deployed in an HL-LHC experiment.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Biscarat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sylvain Caillou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Charline Rougier"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Stark"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jad Zahreddine"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1051/epjconf/201921406037"", ""10.1016/j.cpc.2008.01.036"", ""10.1088/1126-6708/2006/05/026""]",['Physics and Astronomy'],['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)]]"

A dynamic model coupled with exergy calculation is developed and the charging strategy for trigenerative application is focused on. The dynamic characteristic of ACAES is performed and the effects of charging mode, number of compression stages and thermal energy storage on the characteristic of trigenerative application are obtained. The sliding‐pressure charging mode is suggested for the trigeneration due to 3.92% higher exergy efficiency than that of constant‐pressure charging mode. Asymmetrical arrangement of ACAES with more compression stages is efficient for its trigenerative application especially increasing heating and cooling supplies with 2.9% exergy efficiency improvement. Furthermore, changing mass flow rate of thermal energy storage medium (ie, water) shows an outstanding ability to vary the cooling, heating, and power supply ratios in a very wide range. Besides, the economic analysis is carried out which addresses the obvious economic improvement by trigenerative application of ACAES. Accordingly, joint regulation of compression stages and water mass flow rate is suggested to be an efficient and economic approach to adjust the distribution of cooling, heating and electricity supplies according to the user's demand.","[{""name"": ""Yang He"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering and Technology Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Shenghui Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering and Technology Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Yujie Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Engineering Thermophysics  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Haisheng Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Engineering Thermophysics  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jianqiang Deng"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemical Engineering and Technology Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2016.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.07.028"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.09.081"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.02.108"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2019.115993"", ""10.1016/j.est.2019.100944"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.222"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.04.048"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.10.132"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.168"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.12.055"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2015.10.047"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.067"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.108"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.09.102"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.058"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.019"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.02.071"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.03.013"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.145"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.03.087"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.055"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2019.01.086"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2015.11.049"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.027"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.10.043"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.07.005"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.08.026"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2009.09.011"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.033"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.026"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.089"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117948"", ""10.1016/S0196-8904(02)00018-3"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.10.115"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2003.12.012"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.074"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111953"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2015.07.095"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.071""]","['Engineering', 'Energy', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Statistical and Nonlinear Physics']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)]]"

Among the organic matter samples, bark and wattle tannin sorbed relatively large amounts of Cs, whereas wood and cellulose powder sorbed small amounts. In contrast, samples containing clay minerals showed much higher Cs sorption. We also conducted desorption experiments, and suggested that Cs on the organic matter samples were relatively mobile.","[{""name"": ""Takuya Manaka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shinta Ohashi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sumika Ogo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuichiro Otsuka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hitomi Furusawa"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.02.006"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.05.023"", ""10.1186/s40645-017-0117-x"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.359"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.04.016"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2019.02.014"", ""10.1038/335247a0"", ""10.1016/S0169-7722(99)00094-7"", ""10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.10.017"", ""10.1016/j.gca.2014.02.049"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.03.011"", ""10.1038/s41598-019-43499-7"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106306"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(01)00065-0"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(98)00125-8"", ""10.1021/es990657o"", ""10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.12.039"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109785"", ""10.1038/srep06853"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.05.012"", ""10.3327/jnst.22.284"", ""10.1007/s10086-014-1431-1"", ""10.1007/s10967-018-6353-8"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.02.005"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-08261-x"", ""10.1111/j.1747-0765.2006.00066.x"", ""10.1252/jcej.40.270"", ""10.1201/9781420005271"", ""10.2166/wst.2016.098"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-3476-1_23"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(01)00118-7"", ""10.1016/S0039-6028(00)00730-5"", ""10.1080/00380768.2004.10408466"", ""10.1007/s00226-013-0562-7"", ""10.1080/13416979.2018.1426898"", ""10.1007/s11104-010-0397-z"", ""10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.02.090"", ""10.1039/C7RA03056H"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.298"", ""10.1246/cl.2011.867"", ""10.1246/cl.2012.1715"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.12.025"", ""10.1016/0883-2927(96)00027-3"", ""10.1016/C2012-0-06837-8"", ""10.1002/hyp.5746"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.03.001"", ""10.1126/science.143.3604.368"", ""10.1007/s00226-015-0746-4"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.01.159"", ""10.1007/s10310-016-0534-5"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.12.087"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2014.07.025"", ""10.1016/j.foreco.2017.11.024"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2019.106137"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(01)00067-4"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2004.02.008"", ""10.1080/12298093.2018.1538074""]","['Engineering', 'Chemistry', 'Environmental Science']","['Inorganic Chemistry', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0703 化学', 0.7396), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7296)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"

The vibration of the in-core sensors near their nominal locations is a new problem for neutronic field reconstruction. Current field-reconstruction methods fail to handle spatially moving sensors. In this study, we propose a Voronoi tessellation technique in combination with convolutional neural networks to handle this challenge. Observations from movable in-core sensors were projected onto the same global field structure using Voronoi tessellation, holding the magnitude and location information of the sensors. General convolutional neural networks were used to learn maps from observations to the global field. The proposed method reconstructed multi-physics fields (including fast flux, thermal flux, and power rate) using observations from a single field (such as thermal flux). Numerical tests based on the IAEA benchmark demonstrated the potential of the proposed method in practical engineering applications, particularly within an amplitude of 5 cm around the nominal locations, which led to average relative errors below 5% and 10% in the $$L_2$$ L 2 and $$L_{\infty }$$ L ∞ norms, respectively.","[{""name"": ""He-Lin Gong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Han Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dunhui Xiao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sibo Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0306-4549(80)90082-1"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2015.08.016"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2021.108149"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2022.109300"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2022.109521"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2020.107346"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-54576-9"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2020.113516"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2021.114532"", ""10.1198/tech.2005.s326"", ""10.1137/1.9781611974546.bm"", ""10.1007/s00477-019-01743-6"", ""10.1002/nla.2529"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-12110-4_61"", ""10.1016/j.nima.2011.10.056"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2013.04.026"", ""10.1051/epjn/e2015-50046-1"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2022.109431"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2018.02.050"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110833"", ""10.1002/nme.7240"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2021.111113"", ""10.3389/fenrg.2021.804018"", ""10.1016/j.compfluid.2018.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2023.109864"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2023.109863"", ""10.1007/s10915-022-02059-4"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2022.115773"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2022.109538"", ""10.1109/JAS.2023.123537"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2015.01.018"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2018.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2017.04.017"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110756"", ""10.48550/arXiv.2306.13637."", ""10.1038/s42256-021-00402-2"", ""10.1515/crll.1908.134.198"", ""10.1145/116873.116880"", ""10.1126/science.260.5111.1170"", ""10.4324/9781315154282"", ""10.1146/annurev-fluid-010719-060214"", ""10.1080/00295450.2022.2151822"", ""10.1016/S0893-6080(98)00010-0"", ""10.1017/9781009089517"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59560-3"", ""10.1515/jnum-2012-0013"", ""10.1109/TIP.2003.819861"", ""10.1016/j.net.2019.05.015"", ""10.13832/j.jnpe.2019.S1.0008"", ""10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.104401"", ""10.1016/j.taml.2020.01.031"", ""10.1016/j.physd.2022.133454"", ""10.1007/s41365-023-01173-8"", ""10.1007/s41365-023-01233-z"", ""10.1007/s11433-023-2116-0"", ""10.11889/j.0253-3219.2023.hjs.46.030101"", ""10.11889/j.0253-3219.2023.hjs.46.070502"", ""10.1007/s41365-023-01229-9""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Radiation', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

They influence level of gamma radiation in the environment, which can cause significant health risk in humans. Due to the non-uniform distribution of radionuclides in the soil, various measurement methods have been adopted to monitor our environment. The challenges involved in collecting environmental samples, duration, technicality and cost of measurement have led to various models for predicting unmeasured locations. This article presents geostatistical method using kriging techniques, which adopt the theory of regionalized variables, to characterize the spatial distribution of radionuclide in un-sampled locations using data obtained from sampled locations. Among other things, this paper presents results of application of this method to a study area. Spatial distribution of radionuclides reveal the non-uniform distribution in the study area. Though the radionuclides level in the study area are below global average set by United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), the spatial distribution map can be used to provide adequate information needed by regulatory authorities in identifying the contaminated area in need of remediation.","[{""name"": ""Peter Oluwadamilare Olagbaju"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olanrewaju Bola Wojuola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victor Tshivhase"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1088/0952-4746/25/3/007"", ""10.1080/10807039.2017.1312278"", ""10.1007/s11270-020-04678-9"", ""10.1046/j.1365-2389.2002.00488.x"", ""10.1186/s40201-014-0130-6"", ""10.1093/rpd/ncq579"", ""10.15244/pjoes/106032"", ""10.1016/j.gexplo.2005.01.001"", ""10.2113/gselements.2.6.335"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61167-9"", ""10.1007/s10653-020-00688-y"", ""10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.05.003"", ""10.2113/gsecongeo.58.8.1246"", ""10.1016/j.envres.2006.11.005"", ""10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100010027x"", ""10.1007/s00254-002-0600-5"", ""10.52547/ijrr.19.3.591"", ""10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.111961""]","['Computer Science', 'Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"

By colliding heavy ions, such as lead ions, the LHC recreates conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang. This allows scientists to study the quark–gluon plasma (QGP), a state of matter in which quarks and gluons are not confined within protons and neutrons. These studies provide valuable insights into the strong force and the behavior of the early universe. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of recent significant findings from A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) at the LHC. The topics covered include measurements related to the properties of the QGP, particle production, flow and correlations, dileptons, quarkonia, and electromagnetic probes, heavy flavor, and jets. Additionally, we introduce future plans for detector upgrades in the ALICE experiment.","[{""name"": ""Qi-Ye Shou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu-Gang Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"":

The fast neutron flux was 1.40 108 cm−2 s−1 with the average energy of 2.30 MeV. Intensities and neutron spectrum averaged isotopic partial cross section for production of 214 gamma lines (22 for aluminum, 72 for titanium and 120 for copper) are presented. The results are consistent with the literature data. However, the new sets of gamma lines are recommended to replace the old datasets from fast neutrons reactors with several new lines also recognizing a few false identifications.

The methods of establishing efficient compositions of polymer concrete and fibre concrete, based on a filler with gapped grading in which the pinholes in coarse fractions are filled with smaller fractions have been developed. After hardening, such mixtures have the strength 1.5...2 times higher than the items made of metal. The efficient additive of steel fibre to fibre concrete has been identified which improves the strength characteristics. The regularities of the impact on the strength and structure of polymer concrete and fibre concrete of the rotation frequency of the working element of the mixer and time of mixing the mixture components are identified. TS-250 gear and centrifugal pump casings are made by casting method and are tested on a test bed.

Yet there are some deficiencies or new needs of data. Those needs are generally associated with new emerging clinical applications of radionuclides, e.g. theranostic approach, bimodal imaging, radioimmuno-therapy, etc. This article gives an overview of on-going nuclear data research utilizing charged-particle accelerators in four directions, namely low-energy region, intermediate energy range, use of the α-particle beam, and utilization of fast neutrons generated at accelerators. Wherever possible, a comparison of experimental data with theoretical estimates is presented and evaluated (standardised) data, if available, are also briefly discussed.","[{""name"": ""Syed M.

In this perspective, a field experiment was conducted during 2018/2019 season at the educational farm of the National School of Agriculture of Meknes (Morocco) to evaluate mulch effect of black plastic, oat straw and sycamore leaves on both faba bean and weed growth at flowering and harvest stage. The experiment was performed according to a randomized complete block design (RCBD) repeated four times. The results showed that the highest weeds infestation was recorded in weedy check (Control). Sycamore leaves, oat straw and black plastic mulches have significantly reduced weeds density and biomass, thus provided efficiency by 84.8, 80.6 and 86.8% respectively. In addition, the oat straw, black plastic, and sycamore leaves have improved faba bean yield by 42, 52.9, and 43% respectively. In conclusion, mulching practice can be a promising alternative of weed management for faba bean crop in Meknes region.","[{""name"": ""Abdellatif Boutagayout"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laila Nassiri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""El Houssine Bouiamrine"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Saadia Belmalha"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5586/aa.2012.031"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-397935-3.00005-0"", ""10.4081/ija.2017.900"", ""10.1614/WS-04-136R"", ""10.5937/leksir1535037M"", ""10.1016/j.still.2017.01.001"", ""10.12944/CARJ.5.3.17"", ""10.1016/j.fcr.2016.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.fcr.2005.01.006"", ""10.15666/aeer/1504_13591372"", ""10.1590/s0100-83582018360100143"", ""10.2135/cropsci2004.0861""]",['Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],"['Agronomy and Crop Science', 'Soil Science']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7494), ('0901 作物学', 0.7482)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7714), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7605)]]"

However, it is still limited in terms of capacity decay and complex preparation process. Herein, the hybrid MoO2/C is synthesized through a novel molten‐salt‐assisted approach, in which isolated small MoO2 nanoparticles were anchored on the well‐developed coal‐based porous carbon framework. The novel MoO2/C electrodes demonstrate enhanced electrochemical performance as Li+ battery anodes with a higher capacity of 960 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1, which is attributed to the synergistic effect for the uniform dispersion of MoO2 nanoparticles and coal‐based porous carbon layer with abundant active contact sites, which is better by far than the currently reported MoO2‐based electrode. Meanwhile, the hybrid MoO2/C exhibited improved extrinsic capacitive characteristics. Therefore, the hybrid MoO2/C constructed by the simple low cost strategy can be a prospective Li‐ion battery anode.","[{""name"": ""Shasha Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Energy Materials Chemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Institute of Applied Chemistry Xinjiang University  Urumqi Xinjiang China"", ""Key Laboratory of Microelectronics and Energy of Henan Province, Department of Physics and Electronic Engineering Xinyang Normal University  Xinyang China""]}, {""name"": ""Yakun Tang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Energy Materials Chemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Institute of Applied Chemistry Xinjiang University  Urumqi Xinjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongyang Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Chemistry Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Lang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Energy Materials Chemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Institute of Applied Chemistry Xinjiang University  Urumqi Xinjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Yahong Gu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Energy Materials Chemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Institute of Applied Chemistry Xinjiang University  Urumqi Xinjiang China""]}, {""name"": ""Rui Sheng"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Energy Materials Chemistry, Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Institute of Applied Chemistry Xinjiang University  Urumqi Xinjiang China""]}]","[""10.1126/science.1212741"", ""10.1016/j.ensm.2019.09.004"", ""10.1038/451652a"", ""10.1002/adma.201003587"", ""10.1016/S0008-6223(99)00141-4"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.10.118"", ""10.1038/35035045"", ""10.1002/adfm.201605017"", ""10.1002/advs.201700592"", ""10.1002/er.5755"", ""10.1002/er.5136"", ""10.1002/er.5686"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.073"", ""10.1002/smll.201701246"", ""10.1021/cm202459r"", ""10.1002/adfm.201102669"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2017.08.066"", ""10.1007/s11051-017-4019-z"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.06.019"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b05049"", ""10.1039/C3TA14123C"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2014.10.027"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.10.091"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b07100"", ""10.1016/S0022-4596(73)80031-3"", ""10.1002/adma.201203422"", ""10.1002/adma.201302034"", ""10.1002/anie.201411685"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2014.04.156"", ""10.1021/acsomega.7b00839"", ""10.1007/s10934-016-0144-9"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b03421"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0008-3"", ""10.1038/ncomms15630"", ""10.1039/c3ee41006d"", ""10.1016/0167-2738(87)90074-9"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b05194"", ""10.1039/c2nr30742a"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2018.03.130"", ""10.1002/adfm.201303856"", ""10.1149/2.0141505jes"", ""10.1038/nmat2612"", ""10.1016/j.mtener.2017.10.009"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b04418""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

In order to address the problem, the ore body is represented by a geological block model. Numerical data is used to represent the attributes of each block, such as mass, density, ore grade, rock type. The mining plan provision with reserve standards on the degree of reconnaissance for production is reduced to the optimization task solution. The main condition for ensuring the planned production productivity of the mine is to provide the minimum necessary developed reserves. In the proposed mathematical model, it is taken into account by one of the objective function’s terminators for solving the set task. As the results of the calculations have shown, such a scheduling ensures approach that there is developed ore’s sufficient amount for at least 6 months at the beginning of each period, which is a clear advantage of the proposed model.","[{""name"": ""Kanay Rysbekov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ayan Toktarov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tursyn Kalybekov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Serik Moldabayev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Timur Yessezhulov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gulnara Bakhmagambetova"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.25018/0236-1493-2019-05-0-34-43"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-71815-6_29"", ""10.1007/s12351-013-0140-7"", ""10.1287/opre.1120.1050"", ""10.1179/1743286311Y.0000000009"", ""10.33271/mining13.03.104"", ""10.5593/sgem2017/13/S03.066"", ""10.1201/b17547-8""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

It produces neutrons by impinging 1.6 GeV protons onto a tungsten target with 25 Hz repetition frequency. A beam line exploiting the back-streaming neutrons (Back-n) was built mainly for nuclear data measurement and started commissioning simultaneously with CSNS in 2018. There are two experimental endstations along the Back-n beam line: endstation 1 (#ES1) with a neutron flight path of about 55 m and endstation 2 (#ES2) with about 76 m. The neutron energy spectra of both #ES1 and #ES2 were measured since it is important for feasibility study and analysis. In this paper, the measurement of the neutron energy spectrum of Back-n #ES1 is reported. It is measured by a multi-layer fission chamber using the 235U samples as the neutron converters. The neutron energy spectrum from 0.1 eV to 30 MeV is obtained. The integral neutron flux (from 0.1 eV to 30 MeV) normalized to the proton beam power of 100 kW is 1.55×107 neutrons/cm2/s.","[{""name"": ""Yonghao Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guangyuan

Boosted decision trees are trained combining measurements from the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) and the tracking system. The chosen observables are sensitive to the different physics that governs interactions of hadrons, electrons and muons with the calorimeter crystals. Dedicated classifiers are used in various detector regions and lepton momentum ranges. The tree output is eventually combined with classifiers that rely upon independent measurements from other sub-detectors. Using simulation, the performance of the new algorithm is compared against the method used for analysis of the 2018 Belle II data, namely a likelihood discriminator based on the ratio of energy measured in the ECL over the momentum measured by the trackers. In the low momentum region, we largely improve the lepton-pion separation power, decreasing misidentification probability by a factor of 10 for electrons, and 2 for muons at fixed identification efficiency.","[{""name"": ""Marco Milesi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Justin Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Phillip Urquijo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.nima.2018.08.017"", ""10.1080/09500340.2011.554896"", ""10.1007/s41781-018-0017-9"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/898/4/042060"", ""10.1016/S0168-9002(97)00048-X"", ""10.1088/1748-0221/13/03/P03018"", ""10.1088/1748-0221/10/03/T03002""]",['Physics and Astronomy'],"['Nuclear and High Energy Physics', 'Radiation']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)], [('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7202), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7076)]]"

10.1002/er.8385,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Influence of the interaction between activation conditions on the pore structure and CO2 uptake of the prepared macadamia nutshell-based activated carbon,"SummaryRenewable carbon materials are attractive materials with great potential for many applications. Macadamia nutshell is a by‐product of the nut industry, with high yield and fast regeneration. It is a potential precursor for biomass‐based activated carbon. In this study, we prepared an adsorbent using macadamia nutshell as a precursor and KOH as an activator. To prepare the samples with the highest CO2 uptake, the preparation process was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Interactions between different activation conditions were investigated, and their effects on CO2 uptake were explored. Meanwhile, visual three‐dimensional images were used to describe the effects of activation conditions and interactions on adsorption capacity. It was found that the activation conditions affected the location of the central region (high CO2 uptake region) of the carbon material. Meanwhile, the interaction between different activation conditions has a significant influence on the growth of pores during the activation process. The preparation conditions optimized by RSM in this study are as follows: activation temperature is 771°C, KOH/C is 1.7, and time is 2.3 h. At 0°C and 1 bar, the carbon sorbent prepared under optimized conditions has a CO2 adsorption capacity of 6.58 mmol/g.

This present work aimed to hydrolyze cellulose present in OPEFB to form glucose with the aid of Aspergillus niger. A. niger is a type of filamentous fungi able to produce cellulase, a multi-enzyme complex consisting of an endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and β-glucosidase, able to converting cellulose into glucose. The glucose produced is then fermented to produce bioethanol. The present study compared hydrolytic activity of cellulose between OPEFB with pretreatment using NaOH 10 % and OPEFB without pretreatment, concerning temperature, pH, and hydrolysis time. The concentration of reducing sugar derived from cellulosic hydrolysis was determined by using a glucose assay of 3.5-dinitrosalicylic acid. The results showed that the optimum temperature for hydrolysis of cellulose OPEFB (pretreated and untreated) was at 40 °C and the optimum pH was 5.0 for OPEFB-untreated and 5.5 for OPEFB-pretreated. Hydrolysis of cellulose at 40 °C and 3 d yielded reducing sugar 13.01 mg mL−1 and 1.16 mg mL−1 for OPEFB-untreated and OPEFB-pretreated, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Sri Sugiwati"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Suaidah Suaidah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eka Triwahyuni"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muryanto Muryanto"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yosie Andriani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haznan Abimanyu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.renene.2011.06.045"", ""10.1016/j.bcab.2019.101292"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.050"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2009.10.061"", ""10.1016/j.bej.2009.04.020"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2005.11.019"", ""10.1007/s10532-011-9525-6"", ""10.1007/s13205-015-0284-7"", ""10.1007/s12010-014-0758-9""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Biomaterials', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7179), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7085)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

The major differences between fuel cell and battery-powered vehicles are the range and refuelling times of each vehicle type. With a hydrogen (Hed vehicles are the range and refuelling times of each vehicle type. With a hydrogen (H2) fuelling time of approx. 5 minutes it is possible to cover a distance of up to 800 km with a fuel cell vehicle. These properties make a fuel cell vehicle comparable to a fossil fuel powered vehicle. Furthermore, due to short fuelling times and long range capabilities, fuel cell vehicles are more suitable for long-distance, trucking and agriculture than battery-powered vehicles. The aim of current research is to increase the profitability of fuel cells by reducing costs and improving performance. To ensure a high performance of the fuel cell stack, more hydrogen is supplied to the stack than is needed for the reaction. Therefore, unused hydrogen is pumped back to the anode inlet of the FC-stack using a jet pump or a recirculation blower. In this study, the application of an electrochemical compressor or hydrogen pump (HP) for hydrogen recirculation is suggested. The hydrogen pump is an innovative H2 transport technology with the additional functions of compression and purification in the recirculation system. Hydrogen pumps are very efficient compared to mechanical compressors due to the almost isothermal conditions they operate under. Furthermore, due to the modular design, hydrogen compressors can utilize a minimal amount of space in vehicles.","[{""name"": ""Wilhelm Wiebe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thomas v.

The activity concentrations of 239+240Pu and 137Cs in the surface soils of the paddy fields were in the range of 0.089–0.734 and 1.80–7.88 mBq/g, respectively. The activities of 239+240Pu and 137Cs showed very similar distribution trends, first increasing and then decreasing with increasing elevation. The 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in the surface soils ranged from 0.162 to 0.232. The activities of 239+240Pu and 137Cs in the soil cores tended to be uniformly distributed within the plowed layer and declined exponentially below this depth. The mean soil erosion rates of Longji Rice Terraces estimated by 239+240Pu and 137Cs tracer methods were 5.44 t/(ha·a) and 5.16 t/(ha·a), respectively, which demonstrated that plutonium can replace 137Cs as an ideal tracer for soil erosion research in the future. Landform features are the main factors affecting the distribution of plutonium and 137Cs as well as soil erosion in the Longji Rice Terraces.","[{""name"": ""Yong-Jing Guan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wu Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shen-Zhen Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu-Xin Hua"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Qiao-Yan Jing"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhi-Yong Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chun-Ping Huang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""De-Yu Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hui-Juan Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xian-Wen He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mario De Cesare"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Liang-Jia Cui"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hua He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kai-Di Fan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zi-Chen Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.05.008"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.006"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01141-8"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00911-0"", ""10.1016/0012-8252(83)90029-6"", ""10.1016/j.jconhyd.2004.08.004"", ""10.1038/srep00304"", ""10.1016/j.aca.2009.03.010"", ""10.1016/S0012-821x(02)00930-5"", ""10.1007/s41365-017-0252-5"", ""10.1016/j.nimb.2009.10.029"", ""10.1007/s41365-016-0065-y"", ""10.1007/s41365-018-0440-y"", ""10.4236/wjnst.2012.24024"", ""10.1007/s41365-016-0085-7"", ""10.13538/j.1001-8042/nst.26.040604"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01148-1"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00906-x"", ""10.1038/srep03506"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.07.009"", ""10.1007/s41365-019-0710-3"", ""10.5194/soil-2021-2"", ""10.1016/j.iswcr.2022.05.001"", ""10.1109/ICMSS.2010.5577125"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.12.016"", ""10.1007/s10967-015-4208-0"", ""10.1038/200668b0"", ""10.2134/jeq1990.00472425001900020006x"", ""10.1016/j.still.2013.08.013"", ""10.1007/s11629-015-3581-z"", ""10.1016/S0265-931X(00)00117-X"", ""10.1007/s00114-001-0281-z"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2010.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.catena.2022.106666"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2021.109873"", ""10.1016/j.nimb.2018.09.047"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2021.106548"", ""10.1016/s0048-9697(99)00160-6"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2020.109098"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2014.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2022.106971"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2008.01.001"", ""10.1007/s10661-012-3045-7"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.09.021"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.08.019"", ""10.1269/jrr.24.250"", ""10.1021/es0008968"", ""10.7538/yzk.2019.53.10.2083"", ""10.1016/j.agee.2020.107114"", ""10.1016/0265-931X(94)00066-6"", ""10.1016/j.catena.2006.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.geomorph.2005.05.010"", ""10.1016/S0167-1987(02)00131-9"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2014.04.017"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2009.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.375"", ""10.1016/j.apradiso.2003.11.045"", ""10.1021/es050073o"", ""10.1007/s10661-020-08680-w"", ""10.1002/ldr.983"", ""10.1007/s11442-022-1963-z"", ""10.1016/j.catena.2019.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.03.006"", ""10.1080/02626669909492201"", ""10.1016/j.nimb.2012.07.041"", ""10.19637/j.cnki.2305-7068.2018.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.10.013"", ""10.1039/c3em00521f""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science', 'Health Professions']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Global and Planetary Change', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)]]"

The attained optimized lattice constants are comparable to the previous theoretical data. Electronic band structures and density of states (DOS) have advocated that the electronic bandgap of studied materials lie in the semiconductor region with an indirect band gap of 0.133 and 1.329 eV for AsInO3 and SbInO3, respectively. The participation of O‐2p orbital electrons near the Fermi level is maximum as compared to the rest of the elements in both the investigated perovskites as examined in DOS. We have computed the optical properties with real and imaginary dielectric functions and they prescribe utmost diffraction and absorption in the visible region in both compounds. Furthermore, we have determined the elastic parameters like bulk modulus, elastic constants, Pugh's ratio, and Poisson's ratio. It is perceived from the results of elastic properties that the studied materials are found to be ductile, anisotropic, and also mechanically stable. To determine the material nature and dynamics, we have also calculated the temperature and chemical potential dependence of thermal and thermodynamic properties and results recommended, due to which they could be considered as appropriate candidates for solar energy harvesting based applications Using a quasi‐harmonic model, the thermodynamic properties at high temperature and pressure are also estimated and studied for the first time.","[{""name"": ""Mumtaz Manzoor"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering Riphah International University  Lahore Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Muhammad Waqas Iqbal"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics Riphah International University  Lahore Pakistan""]}, {""name"": ""Ramesh Sharma"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Applied Science Feroze Gandhi Institute of Engineering and Technology  Raebareli Uttarpradesh India""]}, {""name"": ""Jisha Annie Abraham"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Physics National Defence Academy  Pune Maharashtra India""]}]","[""10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.104601"", ""10.1021/ja809598r"", ""10.1126/science.aan2301"", ""10.1038/nnano.2015.90"", ""10.1126/science.aaa0472"", ""10.1126/science.aad1818"", ""10.1038/nnano.2014.149"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0451-1"", ""10.1038/nphoton.2015.82"", ""10.1016/j.cpc.2006.03.007"", ""10.1038/nmat4271"", ""10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b03095"", ""10.1149/2162-8777/ac12b0"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.77.235214"", ""10.1016/j.physleta.2013.11.018"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2017.02.147"", ""10.1021/jp4048659"", ""10.1039/C4TA05033A"", ""10.1002/jctb.6342"", ""10.1021/es071763q"", ""10.1002/pip.1068"", ""10.1038/srep00591"", ""10.1021/nl400349b"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.61.1756"", ""10.1007/s11426-018-9308-2"", ""10.1038/srep37254"", ""10.1109/T-ED.1970.17035"", ""10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b12080"", ""10.1016/j.cpc.2011.05.009"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.64.195134"", ""10.1016/S0010-4655(02)00206-0"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.98.079904"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.226401"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.13.5188"", ""10.1016/j.rinp.2017.06.033"", ""10.1016/j.comphy.2003.12.001"", ""10.1007/s42247-021-00324-0"", ""10.1080/14786435.2016.1189100"", ""10.3390/nano9071002"", ""10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00094"", ""10.1016/j.chemphys.2019.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.mssp.2020.105352"", ""10.1016/S0966-9795(02)00127-9"", ""10.1103/PhysRevB.68.184108"", ""10.1016/j.mssp.2021.106229"", ""10.1021/jp5051639"", ""10.1016/0166-1280(92)85014-C"", ""10.1039/C9TA01456J"", ""10.1016/j.mseb.2021.115064"", ""10.1016/j.jpcs.2018.04.024"", ""10.1002/andp.19123441404"", ""10.1016/j.commatsci.2017.06.030"", ""10.1016/j.physc.2014.08.010""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7748), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.7639)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

For the subsequent retrieval of debris from the reactor building, the resolidified debris must be cut into smaller pieces using various cutting methods. During the cutting process, aerosol particles are expected to be generated at the submicron scale. It has been noted that such aerosols sizing within the Greenfield gap (0.1–1 μm) are difficult to remove effectively using traditional spraying methods. Therefore, to improve the aerosol removal efficiency of the spray system, a new aerosol agglomeration method was recently proposed, which involves injecting water mist to enlarge the sizes of the aerosol particles before removing them using water sprays. In this study, a series of experiments were performed to clarify the proper spray configurations for effective aerosol scavenging and to improve the performance of the water mist. The experimental results showed that the spray flow rate and droplet characteristics are important factors for the aerosol-scavenging efficiency and performance of the water mist. The results obtained from this study will be helpful for the optimization of the spray system design for effective aerosol scavenging during the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi plant.","[{""name"": ""Rui-Cong Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Avadhesh Kumar Sharma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erdal Ozdemir"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shuichiro Miwa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shunichi Suzuki"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00295450.2023.2186675"", ""10.1080/00223131.2020.1806135"", ""10.1080/00223131.2018.1462267"", ""10.1115/ICONE26-81531"", ""10.1115/1.4051611"", ""10.1016/j.anucene.2018.03.047"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2020.103361"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2020.103406"", ""10.1080/00223131.2015.1134359"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2008.08.023"", ""10.1016/C2010-0-67817-5"", ""10.2172/569132"", ""10.5194/acp-15-9159-2015"", ""10.1115/1.4051538"", ""10.1016/j.nucengdes.2016.06.043"", ""10.1016/j.pnucene.2021.103903"", ""10.1175/1520-0469(1957)014<0115:RSORPM>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105697"", ""10.1080/02786826.2021.1966377"", ""10.1299/jsmeicone.2019.27.1234"", ""10.1002/ceat.270170204"", ""10.2172/6503368"", ""10.1029/GL003i001p00021"", ""10.3389/fenrg.2020.00102""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Materials Chemistry', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"

The growth of microalgal cells and their metabolic activity toward lipid production could be controlled by the nutrient factors employed in production media. The lipid accumulation ability of the microalgal strains could be influenced by the deprivation of vital chemicals like carbon, nitrogen, calcium and magnesium. In the part of commercializing microalgal based biodiesel, cost effective measures in oil extraction and downstream processes have to be considered. Huge varieties of microalgal cellular pretreatment methods are employed to enhance cellular disintegration so as to facilitate oil extraction by structural modification of carbohydrates present in cell wall. The diversified methods used for microalgal pretreatment encompass chemical, thermal, biological, mechanical or combinatorial approaches. Among all the pretreatment methods chemical methods are greatly advantageous while concerning the feasibility in energy and time consumption. Combinatorial approaches like thermochemical pretreatment or microwave assisted extraction methods are very successful in terms of feasible energy production under limited time consumption.

The UrQMD model was adopted to simulate the dynamic evolution of heavy-ion collisions, whereas the GEMINI++ code was used to simulate the decay of primary fragments produced by UrQMD. The calculated results were compared with the INDRA and FOPI experimental data. It was found that the rapidity distribution, collective flows, and nuclear stopping power were affected to a certain extent by the decay of primary fragments, especially at lower beam energies. Furthermore, the experimental data of the collective flows and nuclear stopping power at the investigated beam energies were better reproduced when the sequential decay effect was included.","[{""name"": ""Kui Xiao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Peng-Cheng Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yong-Jia Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fu-Hu Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Qing-Feng Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0370-1573(88)90170-6"", ""10.1016/0370-1573(91)90094-3"", ""10.1126/science.1078070"", ""10.1016/j.physrep.2008.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.ppnp.2019.02.009"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01149-0"", ""10.1016/j.ppnp.2018.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.ppnp.2021.103920"", ""10.1016/j.ppnp.2020.103775"", ""10.1038/s41586-022-04750-w"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01006-0"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00897-9"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00944-5"", ""10.1007/s41365-020-00839-x"", ""10.1007/s41365-020-00842-2"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01040-y"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01075-1"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.93.044609"", ""10.1016/j.ppnp.2022.103962"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.104.024603"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.100.044617"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.97.034625"", ""10.1142/S0218301308010714"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.98.014610"", ""10.1007/s41365-020-00832-4"", ""10.1140/epja/i2007-10389-2"", ""10.1016/0375-9474(85)90266-0"", ""10.1016/0370-1573(94)00097-M"", ""10.1007/BF01412298"", ""10.1016/0375-9474(88)90542-8"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.54.R28"", ""10.1006/jcph.2000.6534"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.89.034606"", ""10.1007/s41365-018-0510-1"", ""10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137019"", ""10.1007/s11433-016-0120-3"", ""10.1007/s11433-015-5775-3"", ""10.1007/s11433-015-5768-2"", ""10.1016/S0146-6410(98)00058-1"", ""10.1088/0954-3899/25/9/308"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.83.044617"", ""10.1007/s11467-020-0964-6"", ""10.1007/s11467-020-0961-9"", ""10.1140/epja/i2015-15037-8"", ""10.1016/j.physletb.2018.01.035"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01130-x"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01146-3"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00955-2"", ""10.1016/j.physletb.2020.135249"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.97.044620"", ""10.1007/s11433-022-2026-5"", ""10.1007/s11433-022-2041-8"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.82.014610"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.50.2017"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.84.037601"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.91.034618"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.66.029902"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.81.044620"", ""10.1007/s41365-022-01050-w"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.97.054604"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.106.034913"", ""10.1088/1674-1137/ac9601"", ""10.1088/1674-1137/ac6249"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.82.044610"", ""10.1088/1674-1137/abddaf"", ""10.1007/s41365-021-00956-1"", ""10.1146/annurev.nucl.47.1.663"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.232701"", ""10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2011.12.006"", ""10.1140/epja/i2006-10101-2"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.98.034901"", ""10.1103/PhysRevC.90.064602"", ""10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2010.09.008"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.232301""]",['Physics and Astronomy'],['Nuclear and High Energy Physics'],"[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7508), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7468)]]"

The chromium corrosion of Hastelloy N alloy is caused by the oxidation of chromium on the alloy surface by reaction with UF4. The tellurium IGC of Hastelloy N alloy is caused by the diffusion of tellurium along the grain boundaries with the formation of unstable tellurides with based metals and alloying additives. Results indicate that the selective chromium corrosion and the tellurium IGC of the Hastelloy N alloy in fuel salt can be controlled by the [U(IV)]/[U(III)] ratio. The tellurium IGC of Hastelloy N alloy exposed in fuel LiF-BeF2-UF4 salt can be avoided. For temperatures up to 760 °C the selective chromium corrosion can be minimized to the acceptable level when the [U(IV)]/[U(III)] ratio of fuel salt is bellow 30–40.,"[{""name"": ""Aleksandr Surenkov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Victor Ignatiev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mikhail Presnyakov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jianqiang Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhijun Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xinmei Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhimin Dai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.13182/NT8-2-118"", ""10.2172/7295251"", ""10.2172/5195742"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2013.05.007"", ""10.1007/s10512-018-0372-y"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-100906-2.00005-7"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2011.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.jfluchem.2008.07.017"", ""10.1149/1.2411671"", ""10.1007/s10967-010-0478-8"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2016.02.010"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2016.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2015.04.017"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2015.12.152"", ""10.1016/j.optlastec.2016.01.029"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2014.09.112"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2015.01.049"", ""10.1016/j.jnucmat.2013.04.056""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

10.1002/er.6045,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Different kinds of energy harvesters from human activities,"SummaryHuman has abundant energy and can achieve energy from different human daily activities with energy harvesters. It can provide power for the wearable electronic devices, and the micro implanted electronic devices. Achieve the purpose of assisting movement, reducing metabolism, detecting life signals, and measuring metabolism level. Energy sources are mainly divided into mechanical energy and biochemical energy. According to the biomechanical energy achieved from different parts of the body, the energy harvesters are classified. The working principle, design idea, wearing style, and materials of the energy harvesters are compared and analyzed. It is indicated that the biochemical energy harvesting technology based on cell and molecular level is an innovative method which can be used for low‐power devices with great potential. While mechanical energy technology based on the principle can achieve more energy, but larger and heavy structure will lead to poor wearing experience. Meanwhile, they should complement each other and excavate human energy. This paper is not only a summary of the current research, but also points to weaknesses and outlines possible improvements that are suitable for practical applications through comparison and analysis of different energy harvesters.Novelty StatementHuman has abundant energy and can achieve energy from different daily activities. Energy sources are divided into mechanical energy and biochemical energy. The biochemical energy harvesters based on cell and molecular level is an innovative method which can be used for low‐power devices. While mechanical energy harvesters can achieve more energy. This paper provides useful information for researchers to develop energy harvesters suitable for practical application in daily life.","[{""name"": ""Xin Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""Shaanxi Engineering Laboratory for Transmissions and Controls Northwestern Polytechnical University  Xi'an China"", ""School of Mechanical Engineering Xi'an Aeronautical University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Geng Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Shaanxi Engineering Laboratory for Transmissions and Controls Northwestern Polytechnical University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Bing Han"", ""affiliation"": [""Shaanxi Engineering Laboratory for Transmissions and Controls Northwestern Polytechnical University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoli Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of integrated traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Xi 'an Children's Hospital, The Affiliated Children's Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University  Xi'an China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2013.12.026"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.113"", ""10.1201/9781420005332.ch5"", ""10.1016/j.epsr.2008.09.017"", ""10.1039/c0ee00137f"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.02.011"", ""10.1126/science.1149860"", ""10.1126/science.346.6209.538"", ""10.1002/ente.201700622"", ""10.1039/C2FO30239J"", ""10.1088/1674-1056/27/11/114402"", ""10.1111/apha.12231"", ""10.3182/20130925-3-CZ-3023.00053"", ""10.1016/j.humov.2018.07.011"", ""10.1152/jappl.2000.88.6.2287"", ""10.1002/emmm.200900045"", ""10.1109/MPRV.2005.9"", ""10.1126/science.1118058"", ""10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.02.047"", ""10.1007/s10999-011-9153-7"", ""10.1016/j.humov.2003.11.002"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-5451-8_102"", ""10.1177/1687814016651371"", ""10.1242/jeb.205.23.3717"", ""10.1109/BIOROB.2008.4762919"", ""10.1109/ICCAR49639.2020.9108090"", ""10.1109/TBME.2007.901024"", ""10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.07.017"", ""10.2165/00007256-200636080-00001"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0059993"", ""10.1115/1.4024755"", ""10.1186/1743-0003-8-22"", ""10.1063/1.4896166"", ""10.1541/ieejfms.132.649"", ""10.1080/03014469200002272"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.03.120"", ""10.1063/1.4793486"", ""10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848649"", ""10.1109/MEMEA.2009.5167942"", ""10.1109/PEDS.2009.5385814"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2013.2252526"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-2404-7_5"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.186"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.11.038"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/254/7/072015"", ""10.1109/CENCON.2015.7409541"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.117"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.06.041"", ""10.1109/IECON.2012.6388587"", ""10.1016/j.bios.2012.04.030"", ""10.1016/j.tiv.2010.06.016"", ""10.1038/ncomms4928"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2012.01.112"", ""10.1016/j.bios.2012.05.041"", ""10.1002/anie.201302922"", ""10.1039/C6TA08358G"", ""10.1098/rspb.2001.1761"", ""10.1016/S0021-9290(01)00169-5"", ""10.1038/nature14288"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/16/5/036"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-32175-x"", ""10.1098/rsos.182021"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.04.013"", ""10.1109/ICCAR49639.2020.9108081"", ""10.1186/1743-0003-6-22"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.03.008"", ""10.1088/1361-665X/aa6cec"", ""10.1109/JESTPE.2015.2514079"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.025"", ""10.1109/ECCE.2012.6342380"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0127635"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2015.02.025"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2015.2428618"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.288"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/24/2/025029"", ""10.1007/s11708-012-0186-x"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2014.2375354"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2016.08.008"", ""10.1063/1.4867216"", ""10.1088/1361-665X/aa548a"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.093"", ""10.1063/1.5007195"", ""10.1109/MEMSYS.2011.5734678"", ""10.1088/0960-1317/23/11/114012"", ""10.1063/1.5053945"", ""10.3390/s140712497"", ""10.1242/jeb.125500"", ""10.1007/s40684-018-0054-1"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/19/11/115011"", ""10.1063/1.4979832"", ""10.1063/1.4897624"", ""10.1109/40.928763"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/557/1/012090"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2016.11.035"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/055013"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/20/5/055007"", ""10.1002/adma.201804944"", ""10.1109/ICSENS.2015.7370232"", ""10.1109/TRANSDUCERS.2015.7181334"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.02.033"", ""10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.11.083"", ""10.1007/s12034-019-1801-9"", ""10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975366"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2011.2181954"", ""10.1109/SENSOR.2007.4300279""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Biomedical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)]]"

To establish the expiration date of wheat grain during long-term storage, the author of the article considered the fat acid value (FAV) in mg of KOH. Storage temperature and relative air humidity in a desiccator affect the change (growth) of fat acidity value. The greatest changes occurred at 6th, 7th and 8th months of storage at a relative air humidity of more than 65 % and temperatures above 20 °C. At a storage temperature of 10 °C, in all cases the growth of FAV remained insignificant and was within the limits of determination accuracy. It is noted that when the relative humidity was below 60 %, while the temperature was the same as in the previous case, the FAV of wheat grain was practically unchanged through the 6-month storage period.","[{""name"": ""I.

The data inputs consisted of DEM, land use, soil, and climate (rainfall, temperature, sunshine hour, wind speed and humidity). The model parameters used the default values from SWAT database and daily simulation was conducted from 2005 to 2017. The division of sub-basins into “landscape units” is one of new features of SWAT+. The total number of HRUs defined from SWAT+ were higher than those from SWAT because the sub-basins derived from SWAT+ contained two landscape units (floodplain and upslope). With the default model parameters, the model performance indicators were found below the satisfactory rating. Both models simulated relatively high streamflow at the beginning of rainy season, while the observed streamflow was still not occurred. In paddy field, rainfall excess become ponding water, not surface runoff. The appropriate representation of paddy field in SWAT model should be further investigated.","[{""name"": ""Isared Kakarndee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ekasit Kositsakulchai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1623/hysj.53.5.948"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.05.059"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135148"", ""10.1080/02626667.2018.1506128"", ""10.1111/1752-1688.12482"", ""10.13031/trans.12600"", ""10.1111/1752-1688.12482"", ""10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.08.004"", ""10.13031/2013.23153"", ""10.1016/0022-1694(70)90255-6"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.10.032"", ""10.1080/00380768.2014.919834"", ""10.1016/j.agwat.2014.01.009"", ""10.3390/su10093246""]",['Environmental Science'],"['Global and Planetary Change', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Water Science and Technology']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0815 水利工程', 0.7539), ('0908 水产', 0.7497)]]"

Key metrics, including effective diameter (Deff) and water-equivalent diameter (Dw), play pivotal roles in characterizing patient size. However, a notable gap exists in delineating the specific relationships between age and head patient size (Deff and Dw) for pediatric patients in Morocco. The primary objective of this study was to establish these critical associations between patient age and head patient size (Deff and Dw), providing a foundation for calculating size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) in pediatric head CT examinations. A retrospective analysis of data from 134 pediatric patients, aged 0–13 yr, comprising 71 males and 63 females who underwent head CT scans, was conducted. Utilizing the Radiant DICOM Viewer, patient sizes were measured in terms of both lateral and anterior-posterior dimensions for Deff and Dw calculations based on CT images in DICOM format. Our analysis revealed robust correlations between patient size (Deff and Dw) and the patient’s age, with R2 values ranging from 0.65 to 0.86. Notably, larger Dw values were consistently observed compared to Deff. For male patients, Deff measurements ranged from 9.02 to 18.77 cm, with Dw values spanning 9.83 to 20.16 cm. Female patients exhibited Deff values ranging from 8.77 to 17.41 cm and Dw values ranging from 8.92 to 18.37 cm. These findings shed light on the crucial relationship between age and patient size, facilitating more precise dose calculations.","[{""name"": ""H. Sekkat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K.

10.1002/er.6204,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH,0827 Nuclear Science and Technology; 0820 Oil and Natural Gas Engineering,Characterization and electrocatalytic properties of electrospun Pt-IrO2 nanofiber catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction,"SummaryIn this study, novel Pt‐IrO2 nanofiber catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were successfully prepared using the electrospinning method with a high‐concentration precursor solution. The composition and structure of catalysts were characterized, and the electrocatalytic performance of the nanofiber catalysts in water electrolysis was investigated from various aspects such as overpotential, charge transfer resistance, and exchange current density. Special attention was paid on the effect of Pt/Ir ratio on the electrocatalytic activity of the electrospun nanofibers. The results showed that the Pt‐IrO2 nanofiber catalysts with average fiber diameters ranging from 10 to 100 nm can be successfully obtained by the electrospinning method, and the average diameter decreased with the increase of Pt content. Since a bigger amount of IrO2 content and a thinner fiber structure are all beneficial to the electrocatalytic performance, the Pt‐IrO2 catalysts with Pt:Ir = 1:9 and Pt:Ir = 9:1 both showed better catalytic performance for OER than the commercial IrO2, which was also demonstrated by the lower charge transfer resistance and higher exchange current density. As a result, the overpotentials of Pt‐IrO2 catalysts with Pt:Ir = 1:9 and Pt:Ir = 9:1 are 50 mV and 32 mV lower than the overpotential of the commercial IrO2 at 30 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The electrospun Pt‐IrO2 nanofiber catalyst with proper Pt content seems to be very promising since it can not only improve the catalytic performance and the safety of PEM electrolysis cells, but also reduce the amount of more expensive Ir in catalysts.","[{""name"": ""Zhi Ming Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Power Station Energy Transfer Conversion and System of MOE, School of Energy Power and Mechanical Engineering North China Electric Power University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Peng Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Power Station Energy Transfer Conversion and System of MOE, School of Energy Power and Mechanical Engineering North China Electric Power University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yan Peng Cao"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Power Station Energy Transfer Conversion and System of MOE, School of Energy Power and Mechanical Engineering North China Electric Power University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Feng Ye"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Power Station Energy Transfer Conversion and System of MOE, School of Energy Power and Mechanical Engineering North China Electric Power University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Chao Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Power Station Energy Transfer Conversion and System of MOE, School of Energy Power and Mechanical Engineering North China Electric Power University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiao Ze Du"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Power Station Energy Transfer Conversion and System of MOE, School of Energy Power and Mechanical Engineering North China Electric Power University  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1109/TIE.2006.878356"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2010.11.037"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2011.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.12.035"", ""10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62949-8"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2007.02.013"", ""10.1002/er.3081"", ""10.1007/s10853-011-5958-x"", ""10.1021/cs3003098"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.045"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.06.078"", ""10.1039/C4CY00669K"", ""10.1149/1.1634083"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.05.023"", ""10.1007/s10800-009-9809-2"", ""10.2174/1876402911204030186"", ""10.1007/s12678-016-0321-2"", ""10.1021/nl103343w"", ""10.1039/C7CC03727A"", ""10.1002/er.4389"", ""10.1021/nn506851x"", ""10.1002/adfm.201201008"", ""10.1021/acsami.6b11073"", ""10.1002/er.5549"", ""10.1002/adma.200904391"", ""10.1002/adma.200390087"", ""10.1039/c3ra47910b"", ""10.1039/C9QI00799G"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.10.119"", ""10.1007/s10832-012-9755-y"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.12.019"", ""10.1016/j.snb.2014.02.032"", ""10.1039/c3ce26846b"", ""10.1166/nnl.2009.1042"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b00402"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b14399"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b14563"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.140"", ""10.1016/j.electacta.2014.08.110"", ""10.1021/acsami.7b12247"", ""10.1002/celc.201500072"", ""10.1039/C6RA27354H"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.119"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.05.127"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.094"", ""10.1021/acscatal.7b03429"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2016.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.09.087"", ""10.1016/j.elecom.2006.12.017"", ""10.1002/apj.1675"", ""10.1021/jp306900m"", ""10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2004.07.036""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

Inter-fraction setup accuracy and treatment time were assessed by comparing CBCT shifts registered following SGRT-based vs. standard tattoo-based patient setup in two randomly selected groups of ten breast patients. Next, using a torso phantom and a volunteer, intra-fraction motion tracking accuracy and surface coverage were assessed for 3 adjusted central ceiling camera positions. SGRT was shown to significantly reduce setup errors (mostly within ± 2 mm) compared to tattoos (up to 2.1 cm) in all translational directions (p-value &lt; 0.001). Treatment throughput and efficiency were also significantly improved with SGRT (p = 0.038). Meanwhile, intra-bore surface coverage with an adjusted central SGRT camera proved insufficient, suffering from patient self-occlusions (invisible body parts occluded by patients’ own morphology such as breasts, bellies, arms, etc.) and bore-induced camera obstructions. Tracking accuracy remained satisfactory (sub-0.5 mm) but 6 degrees-of-freedom motion monitoring, critical in stereotactic radiosurgery, stereotactic body radiation therapy and deep inspiration breath hold techniques and clinical applications, was not possible. Standard ceiling-mounted SGRT systems reduce inter-fraction breast setup errors and treatment duration while intra-fraction motion tracking is insufficient for O-ring linear accelerators.","[{""name"": ""D.

Analytical thermal conductivity models are essential tools to study and manage such structure/heat transfer relations in porous composite materials. This study develops an analytical thermal conductivity model for porous composites with colloidal matrix morphologies. The model developed here is a modified series‐parallel model that considers important structural parameters such as the system's porosity, the colloidal size of the matrix, and the filler's aspect ratio. Moreover, essential effects in the structure of porous composites, including the gas‐solid coupling effect and contact length of particles, are also included in the model developed here. In addition, this model can be used in a wide range of porosity and can predict the thermal conductivity of porous composites with appropriate accuracy by changing temperature, pressure, specific surface area, porosity, and other textural properties. Novolac/graphene oxide nanocomposite aerogels with different contents of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets in the structure were prepared and used to study the validity of the data calculated using the developed model. Our results confirmed that the developed model in this study predicts the effective thermal conductivity of porous composite and nanocomposite structures with acceptable accuracy. More importantly, this model considers the structure's simultaneous presence of fillers and pores. As a result, it is an effective model for predicting the total thermal conductivity of porous composite and nanocomposite materials. Although the gaseous thermal conductivity contribution measured via the modified series‐parallel model for porous composites (MSPC) model in novolac/graphene oxide nanocomposite aerogels decreased by around 79% with the incorporation of 15 wt.% GO, the effective thermal conductivity of nanocomposite aerogels was improved for more than 300%, compared to the neat novolac aerogel. Additionally, specific surface area and micropore surface area increased from 953.56 and 602.56 m2/g for neat novolac aerogel to 965.89 and 664.30 m2/g for the sample with 15 wt.% of GO respectively.","[{""name"": ""Narges Nazari"", ""affiliation"": [""Polymer Engineering Department, Faculty of Chemical Engineering Tarbiat Modares University  Tehran Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Allahbakhsh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Materials and Polymer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering Hakim Sabzevari University  Sabzevar Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Reza Bahramian"", ""affiliation"": [""Polymer Engineering Department, Faculty of Chemical Engineering Tarbiat Modares University  Tehran Iran""]}]","[""10.1038/s41578-020-00250-3"", ""10.1039/D0CS00075B"", ""10.3390/ijms22020903"", ""10.1002/advs.202001274"", ""10.1002/er.5077"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115215"", ""10.1007/s11242-020-01433-w"", ""10.1039/C6RA12947A"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.08.029"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2021.121140"", ""10.1016/j.ijengsci.2021.103456"", ""10.1007/s10973-016-5970-0"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.106404"", ""10.1007/s42114-021-00362-6"", ""10.1186/s11671-016-1264-5"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2021.108957"", ""10.1016/j.jtice.2021.03.003"", ""10.3144/expresspolymlett.2021.28"", ""10.1016/j.micromeso.2022.111722"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.118842"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2020.120306"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2020.01.083"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.02.053"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2019.106009"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2017.11.066"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2020.112988"", ""10.1002/polb.24365"", ""10.1080/01430750.2018.1557544"", ""10.1029/2021WR031433"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2019.01.074"", ""10.1007/s10765-009-0617-z"", ""10.1007/s11630-021-1422-7"", ""10.1002/j.1538-7305.1935.tb00688.x"", ""10.1016/S0022-3093(01)00456-2"", ""10.1016/0022-3093(95)00052-6"", ""10.1088/0022-3727/46/1/015304"", ""10.1115/1.2822665"", ""10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110206"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.10.049"", ""10.3390/molecules24061103"", ""10.1016/j.firesaf.2013.09.012"", ""10.1088/1468-6996/16/6/065001"", ""10.1021/acsami.8b22073"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.04.092"", ""10.1515/epoly.2012.12.1.253"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2013.08.022"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2015.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.03.106"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.177"", ""10.1021/acsomega.8b00492"", ""10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2017.01.026"", ""10.1016/j.radphyschem.2020.109067"", ""10.1016/j.jmrt.2020.09.092"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2014.05.038"", ""10.1038/srep03909"", ""10.1177/0731684416669600"", ""10.1007/s10765-013-1542-8"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2018.07.038"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2017.04.075"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.09.067"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2009.10.001"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2016.05.017"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.02.062""]","['Engineering', 'Chemistry', 'Materials Science']","['Spectroscopy', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7181), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7171)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

Afghanistan’s energy industry is in poor condition due to many years of war and negligence. Despite international agencies’ support and energy policies adopted in the last few years, Afghanistan has no universal access to power. Besides, the residences suffer from an irregular distribution of power supply. There is a growing gap between demand and supply, and the current predictions of demand do not show reality due to hindered economic growth. Afghanistan’s domestic power transmission is limited, which must be extended for the country to enjoy a stable and sustainable energy supply. Sustainability and security of Afghanistan’s power sector would rely on its ability to become self-reliant in power generation. Overall, the objective of this paper is to summarize the current energy status of Afghanistan and to identify energy opportunities for self-sufficiency and challenges in various aspects of energy sources. To meet energy demand, Afghanistan can develop its autochthonous hydrocarbon and renewable energy resources. By improving its domestic energy potential from natural resources, Afghanistan can fulfill its primary energy requirement. Further, along with policy formulation, appropriate and planned implementation of renewable energy policy, energy efficiency targets, and strategies, Afghanistan can reach energy self-sufficiency goals with socio-economic development.","[{""name"": ""Shambalid Ahady"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nirendra Dev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anubha Mandal"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.energy.2008.10.005""]","['Energy', 'Environmental Science']","['Pollution', 'Energy Engineering and Power Technology', 'General Energy']","[[('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0808 电气工程', 0.7956), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7788)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.6919), ('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.6893)]]"

One of the most important factors enhancing the dispersive potential is the existence of dissolved salts in the soil water. The main objective of this study is to explore the influence of water salinity on the instability of a railway embankment due to rainfall infiltration. In order to achieve this goal, the embankment resting on a dispersive stratum is numerically modeled and subjected to transient infiltration flow. The effect of dispersion is simplified through variations in the soil-water retention curve with salinity. The measured water retention curves revealed that by omitting the natural salinity in the soil-water, the retention capability of the soil decreases; therefore, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil stratum will significantly decline. According to the extensive decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of the desalinated materials, the rainfall cannot infiltrate in the embankment and the rainfall mostly runs off. However, in the saline embankment, the infiltration decreases the soil suction; and consequently, the factor of safety of the railway embankment decreases.","[{""name"": ""Ali Kolahdooz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hamed Sadeghi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mohammad Mehdi Ahmadi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enggeo.2017.12.020"", ""10.1680/geng.2011.164.5.299"", ""10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.01.015"", ""10.1016/j.gete.2017.11.002"", ""10.1139/T07-117"", ""10.1139/t94-062"", ""10.1139/cgj-2016-0531"", ""10.1680/geot.1967.17.1.11"", ""10.1139/t78-029"", ""10.1680/tgasm.20139""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)]]"
