10.1590/S1516-89132005000200013,19TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE ENGINEERING FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT,0828 Agricultural Engineering,EXTRACTION OF PECTIN FROM APPLE POMACE,"As apple-processing units are now in expansion in Brazil, industrial by-products like pomace play an important role in pectin manufacture. The objective of this article was to determine a pratical follow-up to the extraction of pectin from apple pomace and to characterize it in a laboratory, on a small scale, aiming at establishing the optimum conditions for acid extraction. The highest yields were obtained when [1]apple pomace was dried and ground to obtain an apple flour to be used as raw material, [2] citric or nitric acids were used and [3] when the citric acid concentration was 6.2 g/100 ml and the time of reaction was 153 minutes. The apple variety in itself was not significant in pectin yield. The degree of esterification (DE = 68.84 %) of the product obtained, as well as its physical looks, show the success of pectin extraction.","[{""name"": ""Maria Helene Canteri-Schemin"", ""affiliation"": [""Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica do Paraná,  Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Heloísa Cristina Ramos Fertonani"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa,  Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Nina Waszczynskyj"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidade Estadual deUniversidade Federal do Paraná Ponta Grossa,  Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Gilvan Wosiacki"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa,  Brazil""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1365-2621.1994.tb05572.x"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2621.1998.tb17911.x"", ""10.1016/S0308-8146(00)00307-1"", ""10.1016/S0963-9969(01)00078-3""]","['Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Food Science', 'Plant Science', 'Biotechnology']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7319), ('0710 生物学', 0.7295)]]"

The emission of gases and fuel efficiency of vehicles are two important issues. The best way to improve the fuel efficiency is to decrease the weight of vehicle parts. Research and development played an important role in lightweight materials for decreasing cost, increasing ability to be recycled, enabling their integration into vehicles, and maximizing their fuel economy efficacy. There arises a need for developing a novel generation of materials that will combine both weight reduction and safety issues. The application of carbon fibre reinforced plastic material offers the best lightweight potential to realize lightweight concepts. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic has outstanding specific stiffness, specific strength, and fatigue properties compared to commonly used metals. In automotive industry, the advantages of carbon fibre reinforced plastic are reduction in weight, part integration and reduction, crashworthiness, durability, toughness, and aesthetic appealing. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic is a composite material that has been used extensively in various applications such as aerospace industry, sports equipment, oil and gas industry, and automotive industry. Keeping in view the aforementioned advantages of carbon fibre reinforced plastic, the authors have presented a brief review on carbon fibre for automotive industrial applications.","[{""name"": ""H Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A A Markina"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M V Porotnikov"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.21272/jes.2017.4(2).f8"", ""10.13005/msri/140109"", ""10.1002/app.20336"", ""10.1140/epjp/i2015-15022-8"", ""10.1016/S0034-3617(03)00715-X"", ""10.1016/j.tws.2013.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.addma.2019.100962"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2013.10.067"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.10.038"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.06.028"", ""10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2019.105115"", ""10.4271/2012-01-0730"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.06.1015"", ""10.1016/S0034-3617(10)70173-9""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1590/1807-1929/agriambi.v24n3p187-193,REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL,0828 Agricultural Engineering,Development of mortar for laying and coating with pineapple fibers,"ABSTRACT Brazil is one of the largest producers of pineapple in the world, which, in addition to bringing substantial benefits, contributes to increasing waste generation in the stages of processing, aiming at its consumption. The Brazilian environmental legislation has been increasingly more restrictive with respect to the disposal of solid waste, whether domestic, industrial or agro-industrial, which has stimulated studies related to the use of these materials in several matrices. This study aimed to evaluate the potentiality of using the natural fiber of pineapple (Ananas comosus), extracted from its leaves, as reinforcing material in cementitious composites. For this purpose, natural fiber extracted from the pineapple crown was incorporated in different percentages in relation to the cement mass: 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10%, and the fibers obtained were submerged in aqueous NaOH solution with 5% concentration in volume, for 1 h at room temperature. The following variables were evaluated: consistency, water retention, incorporated air, mass density in hardened state, mechanical strength, water absorption by immersion and capillarity, besides verifying the influence of the mode of fiber incorporation. It was observed that the treatment with NaOH solution and the percentage of natural pineapple fiber incorporated in up to 5% in relation to the cement mass form mortars with technological feasibility.","[{""name"": ""Afonso R.

The use of animal fur (goat) in synthesis could assist in turning waste to wealth. Thus, potentials of animal fur in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AF-AgNPs), its biological activities and safety through cytogenotoxicity were investigated. Animal fur (1 g) was hydrolyzed with 100 ml of 0.1 M NaOH at 90 °C for 1 h, cooled and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min. The extract (1 ml) was added to 1 mM AgNO3 (40 ml) to reduce Ag+ to its nanoparticles. The AF-AgNPs was characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Larvicidal, antioxidant, anticoagulant and thrombolytic potentials of AF-AgNPs were studied. Onion bulbs (20) were exposed to 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 μg/ml of AF-AgNPs solution for its cytogenotoxicity study with AgNO3 solution and distilled water as controls. Microscopic (24, 48 and 72 h) assessment of the onion cells and macroscopic (72 h) evaluation of the roots were also studied. The AF-AgNPs solution was brownish with surface plasmon resonance at 419 nm. Evaluation of FTIR spectra showed that protein molecules were used as capping and stabilization agents. The AF-AgNPs had size range of 11.67-31.47 nm, caused 60-100% mortality of exposed Anopheles mosquito larvae in 12 h, and scavenged DPPH (40-59%) and hydrogen peroxide (75-94%). The nanoparticles also exhibited anticoagulant and thrombolytic potentials on human blood with 25% lysis compared to 13% observed for only extract.

10.13031/trans.13643,TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE,0828 Agricultural Engineering,"A REVIEW OF GRAIN KERNEL DAMAGE: MECHANISMS, MODELING, AND TESTING PROCEDURES","HighlightsPublished literature on grain kernel damage during handling is reviewed.Types and sources of grain kernel damage are discussed.Factors affecting the level of grain kernel damage are outlined.Models to predict grain kernel damage and corresponding test devices are summarized.Abstract. Grain kernel damage during harvest and handling continues to be a challenge in grain postharvest operations. This damage causes physical and physiological changes to grain, which reduces the grain quality and leads to significant yield loss. During harvesting and handling, grain kernels are subject to complex loading conditions consisting of a combination of impact, shear, and compression forces. The main damage mechanisms include impact, which causes external and internal cracks or even fragmentation of the kernel; attrition, which generates fine material; jamming, which deforms and breaks kernels due to high compressive forces; and fatigue, which produces broken kernels and fine material via repeatedly applied loads. Grain kernel damage accumulates as the grain moves through harvesting and handling operations. Harvesting is the major cause of cracks and breakage, while conveying after drying produces fine material. This article provides a comprehensive review of the types of grain kernel damage, sources of grain kernel damage, factors affecting damage, predictive damage models, and the experimental methods used to assess the damage. This review shows that although there is considerable empirical data focused on kernel damage, there is a lack of generalizable mechanics-based predictive models. Mechanics-based models are desirable because they would be useful for providing guidance on designing and operating grain handling processes to minimize kernel damage and thus improve grain quality. In addition, several damage models developed for non-grain particulate materials based on fracture mechanics are reviewed. With some modifications and detailed property analysis, there is potential for adapting the models developed for inorganic materials to predict grain kernel damage.

Denitrifying bioreactors enhance the natural process of denitrification in a practical way to treat nitrate-nitrogen (N) in a variety of N-laden water matrices. The design and construction of bioreactors for treatment of subsurface drainage in the U.S. is guided by USDA-NRCS Conservation Practice Standard 605. This review consolidates the state of the science for denitrifying bioreactors using case studies from across the globe with an emphasis on full-size bioreactor nitrate-N removal and cost-effectiveness. The focus is on bed-style bioreactors (including in-ditch modifications), although there is mention of denitrifying walls, which broaden the applicability of bioreactor technology in some areas. Subsurface drainage denitrifying bioreactors have been assessed as removing 20% to 40% of annual nitrate-N loss in the Midwest, and an evaluation across the peer-reviewed literature published over the past three years showed that bioreactors around the world have been generally consistent with that (N load reduction median: 46%; mean ±SD: 40% ±26%; n = 15). Reported N removal rates were on the order of 5.1 g N m-3 d-1 (median; mean ±SD: 7.2 ±9.6 g N m-3 d-1; n = 27). Subsurface drainage bioreactor installation costs have ranged from less than $5,000 to $27,000, with estimated cost efficiencies ranging from less than $2.50 kg-1 N year-1 to roughly $20 kg-1 N year-1 (although they can be as high as $48 kg-1 N year-1). A suggested monitoring setup is described primarily for the context of conservation practitioners and watershed groups for assessing annual nitrate-N load removal performance of subsurface drainage denitrifying bioreactors. Recommended minimum reporting measures for assessing and comparing annual N removal performance include: bioreactor dimensions and installation date; fill media size, porosity, and type; nitrate-N concentrations and water temperatures; bioreactor flow treatment details; basic drainage system and bioreactor design characteristics; and N removal rate and efficiency.

A multitude of investigations have been published during the years regarding solvolysis of newly produced composite laminates and known thermoset composition (epoxy, polyester, and vinyl ester). However, a real wind turbine blade is more complex and constitutes of thermosets, thermoplastics, and other materials such as balsa wood. It is a very challenging task to separate these materials from each other within the wind turbine blade structure, so the premise for recycling is a mixed waste stream where little is known about the chemical composition. In the present study, the solvolysis process for GFRPs based on sub/supercritical water at 250-370 °C and 100-170 bar process conditions with catalyst (acid and base) and additives (alcohols and glycols) was studied and optimized. The samples used are representative for End-of-Life wind turbine blades. The aim is therefore to investigate if it is possible to develop a general process that can accept all material constituents in a real wind turbine blade, resulting in recycled glass fibers and a hydrocarbon fraction that can be used as a refinery feedstock.","[{""name"": ""C Mattsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A André"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Juntikka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T Tränkle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Sott"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.04.013"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.08.041"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.01.004"", ""10.1007/s42452-020-2195-4"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2017.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2008.02.008"", ""10.1177/0731684414555745"", ""10.3390/pr7010022"", ""10.1016/S0032-3861(03)00324-0"", ""10.1016/j.polymer.2004.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2005.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2014.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.10.014"", ""10.1177/0731684412453512"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.013"", ""10.1039/C5GC01048A"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.063"", ""10.1021/ie990690j"", ""10.1080/02773810902961104""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Polymers and Plastics', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.13031/trans.14110,TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE,0828 Agricultural Engineering,IRRIGATION SCHEDULING FOR AGRICULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES: THE PROGRESS MADE AND THE PATH FORWARD,"HighlightsThe progress made in agricultural irrigation scheduling in the past ten years and the current challenges are discussed.The main scientific scheduling strategies are based on soil water status, plant characteristics, and crop modeling.Challenges include large time and data requirements and availability of decision support systems.Opportunities include integration of scheduling strategies and demonstrating their effectiveness through local studies.Abstract. Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining the appropriate amount and timing of water application to achieve desired crop yield and quality, maximize water conservation, and minimize possible negative effects on the environment, such as nutrient leaching below the crop root zone. Effective irrigation scheduling has been shown to save water, save energy, and help agricultural producers achieve improved yields and quality. However, scientific irrigation scheduling methods generally have remained limited to mostly research applications with relatively low adoption by irrigators. There are several main approaches to irrigation scheduling, including those based on soil water status, plant characteristics, and/or crop modeling. Each of these approaches has advantages as well as limitations and sources of uncertainty and variability, depending on application conditions. This article summarizes progress made in the U.S. in each of the main scheduling approaches in the past ten years (since the 2010 Decennial Irrigation Symposium) and existing challenges and opportunities that should be considered moving forward. This article is intended to guide future research and extension projects in improving adoption of scientific irrigation scheduling approaches.

Those materials are also recognized as Thermal Protection System Materials (TPSMs). The structural materials used during the high-temperature oxidizing environment are mainly limited to SiC, oxide ceramics, and composites. In addition to that, silicon-based ceramic has a maximum-use at 1700 °C approximately; as it is an active oxidation process over low temperature and water vapor environment condition. However, a great emphasis is required for developing structural materials in oxidation and rapid heating environment where the temperature is greater than 1700 °C. This review covers briefly all main types of Thermal Protection Systems (TPSs) and all the materials are used to fabricate them with the maximum operational temperatures. Also, it covers the promised UHTMs (SiC, ZrB2, HfB2, SiB6 and B4C) which are currently using for several aerospace applications, especially for TPS.

On the one hand there is the need for finding a balance between the preservation of the aesthetic appearance and the historical values, but on the other hand, finding the space where to effectively integrate the systems might be quite challenging. The solar systems can be divided in photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal (ST) systems. Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) and Building Integrated Solar Thermal (BIST) are PV or ST panels integrated into the building envelope, combining the energy generation with other functions, such as noise, weather protection, thermal insulation, sun shadow, and other aspects. Nowadays, the dynamism of the market allows to design highly compatible products which look like traditional architecture materials. This situation fosters the integration of these products in the BIPV and BIST systems within the heritage sites, especially thanks to the use of advanced customisation processes, special and low-reflecting glasses, and innovative cost-competitive coatings. There is a limited number of studies on the application of these technologies in heritage contexts, due to the presence of architectonic, conservative, and cultural barriers. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the available literature on the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in heritage sites and buildings, which would foster the preservation of their cultural and natural values as well as reducing primary energy consumption, increasing comfort levels, minimizing environmental impacts, and improving technical quality and economical outlays. A common framework will thus defined to support restorers, historic conservators, and energy experts and to facilitate the diffusion and application of RES in heritage contexts. This conceptual framework will provide industries and academics with operative strategies and will encourage their diffusion and application in sensible contexts.","[{""name"": ""E Lucchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C S Polo Lopez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Franco"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.08.085"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.07.058""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Building and Construction', 'Conservation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"
10.13031/trans.13620,TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE,0828 Agricultural Engineering,"PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF IRRIGATION ON THE US GREAT PLAINS","Highlights Irrigation is key to the productivity of Great Plains agriculture but is threatened by water scarcity. The irrigated area grew to &amp;gt;9 million ha since 1870, mostly since 1950, but is likely to decline. Changes in climate, water availability, irrigated area, and policy will affect productivity. Adaptation and innovation, hallmarks of Great Plains populations, will ensure future success. Abstract. Motivated by the need for sustainable water management and technology for next-generation crop production, the future of irrigation on the U.S. Great Plains was examined through the lenses of past changes in water supply, historical changes in irrigated area, and innovations in irrigation technology, management, and agronomy. We analyzed the history of irrigated agriculture through the 1900s to the present day. We focused particularly on the efficiency and water productivity of irrigation systems (application efficiency, crop water productivity, and irrigation water use productivity) as a connection between water resource management and agricultural production. Technology innovations have greatly increased the efficiency of water application, the productivity of water use, and the agricultural productivity of the Great Plains. We also examined the changes in water stored in the High Plains aquifer, which is the region’s principle supply for irrigation water. Relative to other states, the aquifer has been less impacted in Nebraska, despite large increases in irrigated area. Greatly increased irrigation efficiency has played a role in this, but so have regulations and the recharge to the aquifer from the Nebraska Sand Hills and from rivers crossing the state. The outlook for irrigation is less positive in western Kansas, eastern Colorado, and the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles. The aquifer in these regions is recharged at rates much less than current pumping, and the aquifer is declining as a result. Improvements in irrigation technology and management plus changes in crops grown have made irrigation ever more efficient and allowed irrigation to continue. There is good reason to expect that future research and development efforts by federal and state researchers, extension specialists, and industry, often in concert, will continue to improve the efficiency and productivity of irrigated agriculture. Public policy changes will also play a role in regulating consumption and motivating on-farm efficiency improvements. Water supplies, while finite, will be stretched much further than projected by some who look only at past rates of consumption. Thus, irrigation will continue to be important economically for an extended period. Sustaining irrigation is crucial to sustained productivity of the Great Plains “bread basket” because on average irrigation doubles the efficiency with which water is turned into crop yields compared with what can be attained in this region with precipitation alone. Lessons learned from the Great Plains are relevant to irrigation in semi-arid and subhumid areas worldwide.

These machines need to achieve high power densities while reducing electrical heat losses to minimize the required cryogenic power and subsequent additional weight. Hydrogen powered all-electric planes provide a design space where ac losses are manageable. However, the high electrical frequencies in high-speed fully superconducting machines pose a significant challenge to reducing armature ac losses. In high-speed applications, coupling loss in the SC armature coils dominates and becomes a barrier for practical application of these machines. In this paper a fully superconducting machine is proposed for a hydrogen powered regional all-electric plane. An air core design is considered utilizing low ac loss MgB2 wires. The design is targeted to achieve 50 kW/kg specific power while requiring ac losses to be less than 3 kW. This study explores the possibility of replacing a passive iron shield with active shielding coils to contain the magnetic flux inside the machine while reducing weight and increasing power density. The study focuses on minimizing weight as well as ac losses in the armature coils. An optimization algorithm is used to determine the trade-offs between iron shield and active shield coil designs. Results show that optimal designs for electric propulsion eliminate the passive shield in favor of active shielding coils - increasing the power density of the machine while maintaining the outside flux density below standard safety limits.","[{""name"": ""T Balachandran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N Salk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K S Haran"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ESARS-ITEC.2018.8607734"", ""10.2514/6.2018-5000"", ""10.1109/TASC.2019.2906655"", ""10.1109/TASC.2018.2823503"", ""10.1109/PECI.2015.7064939"", ""10.1109/IEMDC.2015.7409294"", ""10.1109/TASC.2017.2651118""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Engineering']","['Condensed Matter Physics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0702 物理学', 0.731), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7181)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

The objective of this paper is to review microplastics and analyze its possible impact on wildlife and seabird. Seabirds are upper-trophic level predators in marine ecosystems, feed on zooplankton, fish, and squid. Microplastics in seabirds have been reported in many countries, including the USA, Canada, Brazil, Japan, China, the Netherlands, and North Pacific region, involving albatrosses, petrels, storm-petrels, fulmars, cormorants, shearwaters, penguins, and many other seabird species. Microplastics were accidentally ingested because of their resemblance to the fish, plankton, or from ingestion of microplastics that already occurred inside fish food. Types of microplastics were pellet, fragment, film, fiber, foamed plastic and styrofoam. Microplastics might decrease feeding stimuli by producing a false sense of fullness, causing the bird to stop eating, resulting in malnutrition and death. Other harmful impact on birds are interrupting nutrient absorption, disrupting reproductive problems, and hindered growth and survival of chicks. Study on microplastics in Indonesia is in progress, by using Little-black cormorant to represent seabirds.","[{""name"": ""N K Y Susanti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Mardiastuti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Y Wardiatno"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.09.025"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0193308"", ""10.1021/es2031505"", ""10.5772/intechopen.71494"", ""10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.031"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2004.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2008.10.018"", ""10.3354/meps037295"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.03.008"", ""10.1590/S1516-89132009000200011"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.112"", ""10.1098/rstb.2008.0242""]",['Environmental Science'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Pollution']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)]]"

The accumulation of biogenic amines in foods is mainly due to the presence of bacteria able to decarboxylate certain amino acids. Biogenic amines are formed when the alpha carboxvl group breaks away from free amino acid precursors. They are colled after the amino acid they originated from. The main biogenic amines producers in foods are Gram positive bacteria and cheese is among the most commonly implicated foods associated with biogenic amines poisoning. The consumption of foods containing high concentrations of biogenic amines has been associated with health hazards and they are used as a quality indicator that shows the degree of spoilage, use of non-hygienic raw material and poor manufacturing practice. Biogenic amines may also be considered as carcinogens because they are able to react with nitrites to form potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines.

In the current study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by green approach from methanolic leaf extract ofBlighia sapida. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging assay, determination of total reductive potential, total phenolics content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) of the synthesized AgNPs. SEM analysis revealed that the size of the synthesized silver nanoparticles ranged from 50-70 nm with maximum UV-vis absorbance at 413 nm. DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of the synthesized AgNPs increased in a dose dependent manner as compared to ascorbic acid the standard reference used. This result confirmed thatBlighia sapidais a potential biomaterial for synthesizing AgNPs which can be exploited for its antioxidant activity.","[{""name"": ""AO Akintola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""BD Kehinde"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""PB Ayoola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""AG Adewoyin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""OT Adedosu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JF Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SB Ogunsona"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb27444.x"", ""10.26719/1998.4.2.350"", ""10.1136/jcp.54.3.176"", ""10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.001"", ""10.1073/pnas.91.23.10771"", ""10.1007/BF02253564"", ""10.1113/expphysiol.1997.sp004024"", ""10.1096/fasebj.6.9.1612291"", ""10.1093/jn/122.suppl_3.636"", ""10.1021/jf0303924"", ""10.1002/jsfa.2740310705"", ""10.14720/aas.2006.87.2.15105"", ""10.1016/j.addr.2009.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2007.05.009"", ""10.1021/nn300652p"", ""10.1002/jbm.b.31615"", ""10.1021/nn3008383"", ""10.1016/j.addr.2011.10.007"", ""10.7897/2230-8407.080457"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0473-z"", ""10.1016/j.foodres.2004.05.003"", ""10.1080/15563650600584410"", ""10.1016/S0021-9673(99)01281-9"", ""10.1186/1746-4269-6-12"", ""10.5530/pj.2018.2.63"", ""10.1007/s12668-015-0181-x"", ""10.1155/2011/650979"", ""10.1002/ptr.687"", ""10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00355.x"", ""10.1080/13102818.2017.1282836"", ""10.1016/S0378-8741(03)00036-9"", ""10.1016/j.sjbs.2013.02.003"", ""10.1021/jf0307595"", ""10.1006/abbi.2001.2692"", ""10.1021/np9904509""]","['Materials Science', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Plant Science', 'Pharmacology']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('1007 药学', 0.7158), ('1008 中药学', 0.7084), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7039), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.6954), ('1001 基础医学', 0.6922)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('1007 药学', 0.768), ('1008 中药学', 0.754)]]"

When operating the diesel engine on natural gas with an additional portion of the diesel fuel are distinctive features of the processes of mixture formation and combustion, there is heterogeneity of the combustible mixture in the cylinder, more fuel evaporation and other aspects of the processes of formation of the fuel-air mixture and its combustion. Consequently, the use of alternative fuels with different chemical composition leads to distinctive indicators of the combustion process. Therefore, for the scientific representation of the real picture of the combustion process in a diesel engine running on natural gas, it is necessary to conduct an indication of its working process and a detailed description of the combustion process.","[{""name"": ""O P Lopatin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00986445.2017.1353500"", ""10.1016/j.eneco.2010.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2017.09.086"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2015.11.048"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2017.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.jngse.2015.12.007"", ""10.18412/1816-0395-2018-10-54-59"", ""10.1134/S0040601517120060"", ""10.1080/15435075.2017.1324790"", ""10.18412/1816-0395-2019-9-60-65"", ""10.1016/j.pecs.2016.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.12.104"", ""10.1016/j.fuel.2017.09.086"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.020""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Fuel Technology', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.7498), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7446)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

In fact, biogas has been well expected to substitute current conventional sources of energy. The main composition of biogas includes methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is accompanied by different contaminants in varied quantities such as ammonia (NH3), water vapour (H2O), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), methyl siloxanes, nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons. Biogas has been widely utilized as either engine fuel or starting material for chemicals, hydrogen and/or synthesis gas productions. For certain applications, a certain purity degree of biogas is required. Technically, the presence of trace components in biogas has been known to negatively affect engine performance. Therefore, a removal of contaminants, particularly H2S and CO2, is expected to significantly improve biogas quality, thus enhancing its performance in various applications. Besides, the removal is performed to meet standardized gas specifications for its usage as vehicle fuel or being injected into a natural gas grid. In practices, different methods for biogas cleaning and upgrading have been recognized, in which differ in terms of functions, efficiency, and required quality of input gas. This study, therefore, aims at reviewing various H2S removal-based biogas cleaning techniques during and after digestion process.","[{""name"": ""D Andriani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Rajani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kusnadi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Santosa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Saepudin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Wresta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T D Atmaja"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s12010-013-0652-x"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2012.04.029"", ""10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.02.033"", ""10.1080/15435075.2015.1018992"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.06.029"", ""10.1007/s12649-016-9826-4"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.086"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/100/1/012177"", ""10.18331/BRJ2017.4.4.6"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2013.04.066"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.204"", ""10.1016/j.bej.2008.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.psep.2013.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.08.015"", ""10.2225/vol10-issue4-fulltext-6"", ""10.1016/S1389-1723(00)80029-8"", ""10.1002/bit.20443"", ""10.1002/bit.260290216"", ""10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00482-0"", ""10.1016/S0032-9592(98)00139-3""]","['Engineering', 'Chemical Engineering']","['Process Chemistry and Technology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7622), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.761)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
