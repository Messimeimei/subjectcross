10.1162/leon_a_02003,LEONARDO,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,Crypto Art A Decentralized View,"Abstract Crypto art is limited-edition digital art, cryptographically registered with a token on a blockchain. Tokens represent a transparent, auditable origin and provenance for a piece of digital art. Blockchain technology allows tokens to be held and securely traded without the involvement of third parties. Crypto art draws its origins from conceptual art—sharing the immaterial and distributive nature of artworks, the tight blending of artworks with currency and the rejection of conventional art markets and institutions. The authors propose a collection of viewpoints on crypto art from different actors within the system: artists, collectors, gallerists, art historians and data scientists. A set of emerging themes and open challenges surfaces.","[{""name"": ""Massimo Franceschet"", ""affiliation"": [""Massimo Franceschet, Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics, University of Udine.

Visual indeterminacy describes images that appear to depict real scenes, but on closer examination, defy coherent spatial interpretation. GAN models seem to be predisposed to producing indeterminate images, and indeterminacy is a key feature of much modern representational art, as well as most GAN art. The author hypothesizes that indeterminacy is a consequence of a powerful-but-imperfect image synthesis model that must combine general classes of objects, scenes and textures.","[{""name"": ""Aaron Hertzmann"", ""affiliation"": [""Adobe Research 601 Townsend St San Francisco, CA 94103 U.S.A.""]}]","[""10.1023/A:1026553619983""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Theories of aesthetic value are typically individualistic, in the sense that the paradigms they are designed to capture, and the questions to which they are offered as answers, center the individual’s engagement with aesthetic value. Here I offer some considerations that suggest that such individualism is a mistake and sketch a communitarian way of posing and answering questions about the nature of aesthetic value.","[{""name"": ""Nick Riggle"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA""]}]","[""10.2307/2026797"", ""10.1111/phpr.12641"", ""10.1353/hph.2014.0020"", ""10.1111/phpr.12727"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691517.003.0011"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197625798.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayaa006"", ""10.1080/24740500.2017.1287034"", ""10.1086/662744"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz024"", ""10.1080/00048400903207104"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy044"", ""10.1111/phpr.12747"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2012.01429.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01519.x"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2006.00007.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays038""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In maintaining that the experience of the sublime is best conceived as aesthetic awe, I draw from historical theories of the sublime as well as recent work in empirical psychology.","[{""name"": ""Robert R Clewis"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy, Gwynedd Mercy University, Gwynedd Valley, PA 19437, USA""]}]","[""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01340"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00509"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139018098"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511978920"", ""10.1515/9780804798587"", ""10.1111/jaac.12060"", ""10.1037/a0027200"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00271.x"", ""10.1037/pspp0000120"", ""10.1111/jaac.12258"", ""10.1037/aca0000204"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00891"", ""10.1080/02699930302297"", ""10.5840/philtoday201155162"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9873-z"", ""10.1111/jaac.12595"", ""10.1037/rev0000213"", ""10.1163/22134913-00002051"", ""10.1037/aca0000273"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139775304"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.1997.tb00529.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayaa047"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.4.0541"", ""10.1037/rev0000187"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198747758.001.0001"", ""10.1080/17439760.2018.1484940"", ""10.1037/emo0000450""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

10.1093/aesthj/ayaa006,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Schiller on Freedom and Aesthetic Value: Part I,"Abstract In his Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man, Friedrich Schiller draws a striking connection between aesthetic value and individual and political freedom, claiming that, ‘it is only through beauty that man makes his way to freedom’. However, contemporary ways of thinking about freedom and aesthetic value make it difficult to see what the connection could be. Through a careful reconstruction of the Letters, we argue that Schiller’s theory of aesthetic value serves as the key to understanding not only his view of aesthetic engagement, but also his distinctive account of individual and political freedom. In Part I, we develop a reconstruction of Schiller's view that aesthetic value is the only path to individual freedom and in Part II we analyze how Schiller connects aesthetic value to political freedom. In the end, we show that Schiller defends a non-hedonic, action-oriented, communitarian theory of aesthetic value and a theory of freedom that makes the aesthetic not just supererogatory but fundamental for any fully autonomous life. Although we have lost touch with this way of thinking about aesthetic value and freedom, we submit that it is illuminating for contemporary thinking about both.","[{""name"": ""Samantha Matherne"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard University""]}, {""name"": ""Nick Riggle"", ""affiliation"": [""University of San Diego""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Second, I argue that the same set of imaginative activities that grounds this type of aesthetic experience also contributes to achievements of understanding. Third, I show that my unified account of imagination has important implications: it sheds light on two puzzling phenomena, the aesthetic value of science and the cognitive value of art.","[{""name"": ""Angela Breitenbach"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cambridge""]}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Neuroscience']","['Psychiatry and Mental health', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7419), ('0402 心理学', 0.7366)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

It addresses the controversial elevation of some artists over others and accounts for these choices, arguing that the art market alienates AI artists from their work. Finally, it proposes that AI art’s interactions with art institutions have not promoted new creative possibilities but have instead reinforced conservative forms and aesthetics.","[{""name"": ""Kieran Browne"", ""affiliation"": [""Kieran Browne, Australian National University, Research School of Humanities & the Arts, Canberra ACT 0200.

This assumption seems to entail not only that facility with imagining will vary from one person to another, but also that people can improve their own imaginative capacities and learn to be better imaginers. This paper takes up this issue. After showing why this is properly understood as a philosophical question, I discuss what it means to say that one imagining is better than another and then discuss the kinds of imagination training and techniques that might be employed in an effort to get better at imagining. The discussion of these techniques draws insight from consideration of other skills-based activities, as well as from consideration of the creation of art and our engagement with literature and poetry. Over the course of this discussion, we also gain further insight into the nature of imagination.","[{""name"": ""Amy Kind"", ""affiliation"": [""Claremont McKenna College, USA""]}]","[""10.1037/0033-295X.100.3.363"", ""10.4324/9781315180809"", ""10.2307/2025838"", ""10.4324/9781351199797-17"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00042.x"", ""10.1017/apa.2017.10"", ""10.4324/9781315180809-33"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716808.003.0001"", ""10.2307/2185044"", ""10.2307/2183914"", ""10.1086/203305"", ""10.1111/phc3.12359"", ""10.1080/10413209108406438"", ""10.1016/0001-6918(53)90012-2"", ""10.1111/nous.12144"", ""10.2307/2107292"", ""10.1016/S0001-2092(06)62917-7""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

However, does art contribute something unique to political discourse, or does it merely reflect the insights of political science and political philosophy? Here I argue for indispensability of art to political discourse by building on the debate about artistic cognitivism, the view that art is a source of knowledge. Different artforms, I suggest, make available specific epistemic resources, which allow audiences to overcome epistemic obstacles that obtain in a given ideological situation. My goal is to offer a general model for identifying cognitive advantages for artworks belonging to distinct artforms and genres (e.g. satire, visibility-raising artworks, caricatures, and so on), in a way that can account for each artwork’s historical and cultural specificity. More speculatively, however, my account also comments on the ancient struggle between philosophy and the arts as competing modes of persuasion, and expands our notion of legitimate political discourse to include a greater plurality of discursive genres.","[{""name"": ""Vid Simoniti"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Liverpool , UK""]}]","[""10.1111/cons.12005"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2009.00186.x"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.00048"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198826903.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781444315592.ch18"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-15388-6_3"", ""10.7551/mitpress/1564.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.4.0331"", ""10.1111/japp.12347"", ""10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2"", ""10.1177/0090591704265729"", ""10.2307/1600311"", ""10.1002/9780470696675""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In the last ten years or so considerable light has been shed by empirical psychologists on a related notion of ‘awe’, and a fruitful dialogue between aestheticians and empirical psychologists has ensued. It is the aim of this paper to synthesize these advances and to offer what I call a ‘two-tiered’ theory of the sublime that shows it to be a coherent aesthetic category. On this theory, sublime experiences begin in an ‘awe response’ (the ‘thin sublime’) and might, with the additional element of temporally-extended reflection, turn into a ‘thick sublime’ response. Building on accounts of the sublime as a species of ‘aesthetic awe’ (Clewis, 2019a and 2019b; Arcangeli, et al., 2020) I aim to show that this two-tiered theory helps to explain why sublime experiences seem to have a basic, primordial core, but also seem to be historically and culturally quite variable (as Nicolson, 1963 [1959]; Battersby, 2007; and McMahon, 2017 have stressed). On this model, the cultural and historical variability comes in largely at the point of the temporally-extended reflection characteristic of the thick sublime, due to the cognitive stock that the subject brings to the encounter. Thus, sublime experiences really lend themselves to being interpreted quite variously by the subject (as well as by the theorist) of these experiences, as, for example, affording insight into the Divine, our moral vocation, or our metaphysical unity with the entire universe, among other lofty thoughts.","[{""name"": ""Sandra Shapshay"", ""affiliation"": [""City University of New York, USA""]}]","[""10.5040/9781350038950.ch-009"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01340"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199329397.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139018098"", ""10.1093/0199259658.001.0001"", ""10.1080/02699931.2012.683852"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511978920.015"", ""10.1016/0304-422X(86)90003-3"", ""10.1111/jaac.12060"", ""10.1002/0470013494.ch16"", ""10.2307/303363"", ""10.1037/aca0000204"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00891"", ""10.1093/mind/os-IX.34.188"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511978920.010"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804656"", ""10.1080/02699930302297"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2016.00536"", ""10.1111/jaac.12595"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658442.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198528975.003.0004"", ""10.1057/9781137313713.0011"", ""10.1196/annals.1280.029"", ""10.1080/02699930600923668"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.4.0541""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sensory Systems', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7388), ('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7302)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Despite its importance, he says little about it. He characterizes aesthetic ideas as representations of the imagination and says that the gift of artistic genius is the inscrutable capacity to envision them. Furthermore, they are counterparts of rational ideas. Works of art thus sensibly present rational ideas; the pleasure they occasion is a consequence of the enriching process of reflection upon the wealth of content they sensibly present. The purpose of this article is to ask whether all rational ideas have aesthetic ideas as counterparts, and so can be presented in art, or whether only some do and which. The answer should reveal what, for Kant, is the subject-matter of art. I argue that for Kant art is concerned with the range and variety of human freedom as well as with its highest fulfillment in morality.","[{""name"": ""Ido Geiger"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511612671"", ""10.1080/0960878042000253123"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayl023"", ""10.1080/00048400701571677"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayn019"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00243.x"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2020.1779124"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/7.3.250"", ""10.1111/ejop.12524"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53517-7_6"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511814433"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804649"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804656"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791925"", ""10.1515/kant.1984.75.1-4.65"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays058"", ""10.1515/kant.2010.002"", ""10.1111/0021-8529.00018"", ""10.1515/hgjb-2017-0107"", ""10.1017/S1369415418000079"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpaa005"", ""10.1515/kant-2018-0002"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayi035"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/30.1.71"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2011.695_13.x"", ""10.1080/00201750510022727""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Such epistemic value might take the form of knowledge (for ‘cognitivists’) or understanding (for ‘neo-cognitivists’). Both camps may be sorted according to a further distinction between views explaining fiction’s epistemic value either in terms of the author’s engaging in a form of telling, or instead via their showing some state of affairs to obtain, a special case of which is the provision of self-knowledge. Fictional works that show rather than tell often employ thought experiments. The epistemic value of some fictional works is indicated by their enabling of empathy, itself illuminated via the psychological process of experience-taking. Whether a fictional work offers epistemic value by telling or showing, there is, in principle, no bar to its being able to deliver on what it offers, and consumers of fiction who exercise epistemic vigilance may gain either knowledge or some degree of understanding from their engagement with it.","[{""name"": ""Mitchell Green"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2010.01433.x"", ""10.1080/09658211.2012.682067"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayab072"", ""10.3758/s13421-020-01047-z"", ""10.1111/jaac.12270"", ""10.1162/POSC_a_00128"", ""10.1057/9780230227453_8"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2012.00331.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0012"", ""10.1163/18756735-09603013"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00144.x"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195182637.003.0021"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199283781.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781444302813.ch4"", ""10.1002/9781444315592.ch18"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198715719.003.0016"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-56883-6_4"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.701"", ""10.2307/48616060"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.00152"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.4.0331"", ""10.1037/a0027525"", ""10.1126/science.1239918"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz040"", ""10.1017/apa.2017.16"", ""10.1177/0963721416649347"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297023.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12068"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198798347.001.0001"", ""10.1163/18756735-09603015"", ""10.1007/s12136-021-00467-z""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

We commonly describe music as “heavy,” whether as criticism or praise. But what does “heavy” mean? How is it applied as an aesthetic term? Drawing on sociological and musicological studies of heavy metal, as well as recent work on the aesthetics of rock music, I discuss the relevant musical properties of heaviness. The modest aim of this article, however, is to show the difficulty, if not impossibility, of this seemingly straightforward task. I first address the difficulties of identifying the defining features, or “Gestalt,” of heavy metal that would allow us to treat heaviness as a genre concept. Next, I discuss both the merits and the limits of analyzing heaviness in terms of an aesthetics of “noise” in rock music developed in recent philosophy of music. In the remaining sections, I consider other nonaesthetic features relevant to aesthetic judgments of heaviness and show that the term ‘heavy’ is conceptually inarticulable, if not irreducible. This, I conclude, has partly to do with the radically different, sometimes incompatible, musical properties present in the perception of musical heaviness.","[{""name"": ""Jason Miller"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Warren Wilson College, Asheville, NC, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/jaac.12351"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.1.0023"", ""10.1515/9781474465489-006"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac57.2.0193"", ""10.1386/mms.4.1.95_1"", ""10.1111/phc3.12145"", ""10.2307/2182490"", ""10.1111/j.1533-1598.2003.tb00114.x"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1220q3v"", ""10.2307/2183933"", ""10.1080/19401159.2013.846655"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac53.1.0078""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"
10.1162/leon_a_02054,LEONARDO,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,Slow Looking at Slow Art The Work of Pierre Bonnard,"Abstract Slow looking is an increasingly prevalent strategy for enhancing visitor engagement in the gallery, yet there is little research to show why looking at artworks for longer should be beneficial. The curator of a recent exhibition of Pierre Bonnard at the Tate Gallery in London encouraged viewers to look slowly in order to enrich their experience of Bonnard’s paintings. This article explores some of the reasons why Bonnard’s work, in particular, rewards the viewer who spends more time studying it. The authors draw on various scientific studies of the ways in which observers process color contrasts, spatial configuration and figure-ground segregation in artworks and in everyday vision. They propose that prolonged interactions with works of art can facilitate perceptual learning, and they suggest ways in which these effects could be empirically studied using psychological methods.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Chamberlain"", ""affiliation"": [""Rebecca Chamberlain, Goldsmiths, University of London, 8 Lewisham Way, New Cross, London, SE14 6NW, U.K. Email: r.chamberlain@gold.ac.uk.""]}, {""name"": ""Robert Pepperell"", ""affiliation"": [""Robert Pepperell, School of Art & Design, Cardiff Metropolitan University, 200 Western Avenue, Cardiff, CF5 2YB, U.K. Email: rpepperell@cardiffmet.ac.uk.""]}]","[""10.2190/5MQM-59JH-X21R-JN5J"", ""10.1177/2041669517694184"", ""10.1037/11526-000"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0099019"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.53.1.0106"", ""10.1016/j.visres.2008.06.010"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.07-11-03416.1987"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2011.00104"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-07830-6"", ""10.1068/i0668"", ""10.1163/22134913-00002056"", ""10.1037/a0029333"", ""10.1006/cogp.1996.0018"", ""10.1016/j.brainresbull.2007.04.009"", ""10.1016/0028-3932(95)00014-T"", ""10.1068/p5262""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sensory Systems', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7388), ('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7302)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

According to ethicism, aesthetically relevant ethical flaws in artworks count as aesthetic flaws and aesthetically relevant ethical merits count as aesthetic merits. In this paper, I argue that ethicism’s most significant argument, the Merited Response Argument (MRA) (and other moralist arguments like it) suffers from an ambiguity that makes it either unsound or uninteresting. Specifically, the notion of an artwork’s ‘prescribing’ a response, central to MRA, is ambiguous between merely attempting to elicit a response from appreciators as appropriate to a work, and endorsing a response as appropriate to relevant parts of the actual world. While the first sense of ‘prescribe’ does the aesthetic work, the second does the ethical.","[{""name"": ""Nils-Hennes Stear"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Southampton and Uppsala Universitet""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Law', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

By distinguishing how statues speak at the locutionary level versus at the illocutionary level, or what they say versus what they do, we obtain the resource for addressing two topics. First, we can explain what makes statues distinct from street art. Second, we can explain why it is mistaken to criticize—or to defend—the continuing presence of statues based only on what they represent. Both explanations are driven by the same core idea: the significance of statues arises primarily from what they do and not what they say.","[{""name"": ""David Friedell"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department, Union College , Schenectady, NY , USA""]}, {""name"": ""Shen-yi Liao"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department, University of Puget Sound , Tacoma, WA , USA""]}]","[""10.1093/aesthj/ayv030"", ""10.1111/jaac.12261"", ""10.1111/jaac.12325"", ""10.1007/s11406-007-9065-9"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198738831.003.0001"", ""10.5840/wpr19931021"", ""10.4324/9780429462573-10"", ""10.1111/ejop.12573"", ""10.1111/papq.12000"", ""10.1111/phpr.12701"", ""10.1111/papa.12162"", ""10.1353/cjp.0.0050"", ""10.1023/B:LING.0000010803.47264.f0"", ""10.1080/00048400802370334"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199236282.001.0001"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201642215"", ""10.1111/papq.12279"", ""10.1086/707215"", ""10.2307/431994"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac52.1.0013"", ""10.26556/jesp.v18i1.696"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2006.00195.x"", ""10.5840/tpm20209189"", ""10.1111/jopp.12176"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.12582"", ""10.1007/BF00188849"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201642218"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.12580""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Law']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Paradigmatic experiences of the sublime, such as gazing up at the starry night sky, or out at a storm-whipped sea, lead in a moral or religious direction depending on the cognitive stock brought to the experience, since they typically involve a feeling of awe and reflection on the peculiar situation of the human being in nature. The monumental is a similar aesthetic category, integrally intertwined with the political, but, by contrast, has garnered almost no attention from aestheticians. My main goal in this paper is to sketch a theory of ‘the monumental’ as an aesthetic category—one that is a species of the sublime but differs qualitatively from the natural/environmental sublime in significant ways, and thus merits a distinctive label. In doing so, I aim to shed light on the nature and power of monuments specifically, and to begin to address a lacuna in our understanding of a long-standing and culturally important form of public art.","[{""name"": ""Sandra Shapshay"", ""affiliation"": [""Hunter College and the Graduate Center, CUNY, New York, NY, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00306.x"", ""10.5040/9781350038950.ch-009"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01340"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139018098"", ""10.1111/jaac.12596"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/36.3.223"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511978920"", ""10.7312/evan18758"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001"", ""10.1037/aca0000204"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00891"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac54.1.0015"", ""10.1080/02699930302297"", ""10.1111/jaac.12595"", ""10.1515/9780691186658-010"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays067"", ""10.1057/9781137313713"", ""10.1111/jaac.12600"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198747758.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This paper offers a definition of street art as an art kind or art form based on its essential value: its subversiveness. It argues that street art is essentially subversive in virtue of using public space as a technical resource. By hijacking a portion of the urban landscape with its colourful forms and witty designs, street art challenges familiar ways of practising the city, while creating a ‘temporary autonomous zone’ of free expression. There, corporate control over the city’s visible surfaces is ridiculed and people reclaim their right to use the city. In this sense, street art functions as a carnivalesque tactic of social resistance, favouring the emergence of alternative ways to imagine our urban life and our uses of public space. By considering its subversiveness, one can also explain how street art (i) significantly differs from official public art; (ii) includes graffiti as its original and most radical style.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Lorenzo Baldini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/13604810903529142"", ""10.1093/monist/onx033"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv030"", ""10.1353/aq.2007.0077"", ""10.1111/jaac.12261"", ""10.1177/1470412915592883"", ""10.1080/01944360108976352"", ""10.1080/00233609.2012.762804"", ""10.1080/00233609.2015.1095797"", ""10.1111/jaac.12325"", ""10.1375/acri.35.2.165"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2011.00849.x"", ""10.2307/2169636"", ""10.1177/1206331213512052"", ""10.1386/vi.7.1.19_1"", ""10.1111/papq.12279"", ""10.1080/10304312.2013.854867"", ""10.1080/21502552.2014.878487"", ""10.1111/jaac.12280"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2009.02.003"", ""10.1017/S0031819100065785""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Although some philosophers claim that aesthetics falls within the scope of rationality, a non-akrasia constraint prohibiting certain combinations of attitudes is yet to be developed in this domain. This essay is concerned with the question of whether such a requirement is plausible and, if so, whether it is an actual requirement of aesthetic rationality. Ultimately, this paper defends the view that aesthetics is no different from other domains in that it requires coherence between a subject’s mental states (in the aesthetic case, between what is judged and what is aesthetically liked).","[{""name"": ""Irene Martínez Marín"", ""affiliation"": [""Uppsala University , Sweden""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199685523.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781118609088"", ""10.1080/00455091.2015.1118231"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.50.4.0001"", ""10.1093/mind/fzz018"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.004"", ""10.5840/logos-episteme20211211"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577703"", ""10.1111/nous.12310"", ""10.5840/jphil201811538"", ""10.1007/s11098-021-01775-1"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9570-8"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199547975.001.0001"", ""10.1086/698732"", ""10.2307/432348"", ""10.2307/2564667"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-5265-1_10"", ""10.1111/nous.12026"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac34.1.0051"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1196-2"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9651-8"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2010.01398.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-009-9418-2"", ""10.1007/s11406-017-9905-1"", ""10.1515/9783110496765-006"", ""10.1080/00048408012341341"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199753673.003.0002"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayj020"", ""10.1111/j.1755-2567.2009.01049.x"", ""10.1017/S0265052500001734"", ""10.1111/phpr.12246"", ""10.1111/nous.12362"", ""10.1111/mila.12070""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

However, contemporary ways of thinking about freedom and aesthetic value make it difficult to see what the connection could be. Through a careful reconstruction of the Letters, we argue that Schiller’s theory of aesthetic value serves as the key to understanding not only his view of aesthetic engagement, but also his distinctive account of individual and political freedom. Whereas in Part I, we developed a reconstruction of Schiller's view that aesthetic value is the only path to individual freedom, in Part II we analyze how Schiller connects aesthetic value to political freedom. In the end, we show that Schiller defends a non-hedonic, action-oriented, communitarian theory of aesthetic value and a theory of freedom that makes the aesthetic not just supererogatory but fundamental for any fully autonomous life. Although we have lost touch with this way of thinking about aesthetic value and freedom, we submit that it is illuminating for contemporary thinking about both.","[{""name"": ""Samantha Matherne"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard University""]}, {""name"": ""Nick Riggle"", ""affiliation"": [""University of San Diego""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

We further argue that fictions are more likely to be a bad influence than a good one.","[{""name"": ""Kris Goffin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Birkbeck, University of London, London, United Kingdom"", ""Department of Philosophy, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"", ""Research Group of Quantitative Psychology and Individual Differences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium""]}, {""name"": ""Stacie Friend"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Birkbeck, University of London, London, United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1037/0022-3514.91.4.652"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-00952-7"", ""10.1111/papq.12302"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.005"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2014.06.007"", ""10.1111/jaac.12440"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1138741600006491"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.853"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5760.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5797.001.0001"", ""10.1037/xge0000395"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01520.x"", ""10.3366/olr.1991.006"", ""10.1186/s40359-019-0299-7"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2012.00331.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.007"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.701"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.102.1.4"", ""10.1037/a0015575"", ""10.1075/upal.35.14hak"", ""10.1080/13869790500095962"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198713241.003.0004"", ""10.1075/ssol.3.1.08joh"", ""10.1126/science.1239918"", ""10.1037/a0036260"", ""10.1002/9781444302813.ch3"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00073.x"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2015.08.002"", ""10.1126/science.159.3810.56"", ""10.1017/S0140525X09000855"", ""10.1027/1864-1105/a000249"", ""10.1037/aca0000089"", ""10.2307/j.ctt5vjmwc"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00376"", ""10.1177/0146167205284004"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163607"", ""10.1037/pspa0000064"", ""10.1111/j.2041-6962.2011.00069.x"", ""10.1177/0146167203256906"", ""10.1080/02699931.2017.1279591"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199325603.003.0003"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226767307.001.0001"", ""10.1086/448328"", ""10.1111/jasp.12279"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/68.1.27"", ""10.1111/j.1751-2409.2011.01032.x"", ""10.1126/science.1178358"", ""10.1016/j.obhdp.2015.04.002"", ""10.1177/0276236621996244"", ""10.5334/jopd.ac"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2418-09.2009""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

An Empirical Study,"Abstract Philosophers often consider better compliance with prevalent pre-theoretical intuitions to be an advantage of a theory of ontology of musical works. However, despite many predictions of what these intuitions on relevant questions might be, so far there is only one experimental philosophy study on the repeatability of musical works by Christopher Bartel. We decided to examine the intuitions concerning the individuation of musical works by creating scenarios reflecting the differences in the positions of musical ontologists: pure and timbral sonicism, instrumentalism, and contextualism. The results show that emotional expressivity, instrument, timbre, and images evoked in the listeners were not considered as properties individuating musical works. However, the musical works were held to be different if the composers were different. In most cases, the participants had clear intuitions. Pure sonicism, complemented with additional stress on significance of the composer’s creativity, seems to be the most intuitive position.","[{""name"": ""Elzė Sigutė Mikalonytė"", ""affiliation"": [""Vilnius University""]}, {""name"": ""Vilius Dranseika"", ""affiliation"": [""Vilnius University""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Music', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Many of those working in the field of literary studies oppose this idea. But it is not clear exactly how works of literary art embody knowledge and understanding and how literary studies can bring these to the light. After all, literary works of art are pieces of fiction, which suggests that they are not meant to represent the actual world. How then can they deliver knowledge and understanding? I argue that literature and literary studies confer knowledge and understanding in at least five ways: they give us insight into the work and the world of the work of art in question, they shape our intellectual virtues, they invite us to apply various hypotheses, they deliver moral propositional knowledge, and they increase or bring about full understanding with respect to meaning, virtue, and significance. In the course of my argument, I refer at several junctures to Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the D’Urbervilles and Edith Wharton’s Summer, in order to illustrate each of these claims.","[{""name"": ""Rik Peels"", ""affiliation"": [""Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Close examination of thirteenth‐century paintings from Arabic manuscripts, considered alongside textual sources, reveals how images may contribute to the study of slavery in the premodern Middle East. In particular, these paintings confirm the link between domestic service and the trade in black African slaves. They also suggest that if skin colour did not determine enslavement, it might have shaped the perception of slaves and the division of labour among them. This essay further attends to the semantic operations of slavery within the picture. One of its suggestions is that images of slaves functioned as signs of pure labour, as well as liminal figures, framing, highlighting, and creating a contrast with light‐skinned Arab characters, mostly seen engaged in acts of discourse and leisurely activities. A visual dialectic seems to be at work, creating a series of asymmetrical relationships, between light‐skinned and dark‐skinned, freedom and slavery, speech and labour, high culture and servitude. Such a dialectic may ultimately be read as a comment on the mechanisms and limits of archival power.","[{""name"": ""Lamia Balafrej"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Archeology', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

According to skeptics, these processes limit an agent’s intentional control over the features of the resultant “automatic images,” which in turn limits the artistic potential of the work, and the form as a whole. I argue that this is true only if intentional control is understood to mean that an agent produces the features of the work by their own bodily movements alone. Not only is this an unrealistic standard to uphold, but I show that a definition of intentional control based on the skeptic’s position does not prohibit an agent from realizing the features of an image by means beyond their own actions. An agent can exercise intentional control over the features of an image if they successfully anticipate the effect that the remote consequences of their actions will have on these. This, I argue, entails that to exert intentional control over the features of an image is to exercise “creative agency,” which is a species of executive agency. Consequently, I defend the idea that the origin of automatic images in creative agency grounds their artistic significance.","[{""name"": ""Claire Anscomb"", ""affiliation"": [""Aesthetics Research Centre, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/jaac.12137"", ""10.1007/s13194-020-00310-z"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199694853.003.0003"", ""10.1163/9789004335349"", ""10.4324/9781315266688"", ""10.1111/jaac.12404"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac49.1.0023"", ""10.1002/9780470774922"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199694853.003.0004"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226370330.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199278067.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781119053194"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199665778.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-8365.12115"", ""10.2190/EM.28.1.f"", ""10.1086/448116"", ""10.1086/448062""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The most popular version of value empiricism, and a dominant view in contemporary philosophical aesthetics more generally, is aesthetic hedonism. Hedonism restricts the grounds of aesthetic value to the pleasure enjoyed in the right kind of experience. But hedonism does not enjoy any clear advantage over a more permissive alternative version of value empiricism. This alternative is aesthetic liberalism. On this view, an object’s aesthetic value is fully grounded in any value—not just the hedonic value—of a correct and complete experience of its sensory features. To demonstrate the advantages of liberalism over hedonism, I apply both views to analyze the aesthetic value of the Spring Temple Buddha and Anselm Kiefer’s Seraphim. I detail four advantages of liberalism over hedonism, and I conclude by defending liberalism from two kinds of objection.","[{""name"": ""Antonia Peacocke"", ""affiliation"": [""Stanford University""]}]","[""10.1007/s11098-011-9755-9"", ""10.5840/jphil201811538"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.12026"", ""10.5840/jphil201110838"", ""10.1017/S0953820812000052"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198767213.003.0004"", ""10.1080/24740500.2017.1296403"", ""10.4324/9781315148496-2"", ""10.1086/662744"", ""10.1080/00048400903207104"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00199.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01519.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316286777""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

But there is another type of aesthetic idea: ‘Beauty (whether it be beauty of nature or of art) can in general be called the expression of aesthetic ideas: only in beautiful nature the mere reflection on a given intuition, without a concept of what the object ought to be, is sufficient for arousing and communicating the idea of which that object is considered as the expression.’ What are these aesthetic ideas? I argue that Kant is drawing on the idealist conception of art, associated with Vasari, Bellori and Winckelmann, as presenting idealized spatial forms characteristic of natural kinds. He incorporates this conception into his analysis of the beauty of nature and adds that we have non-conceptual access to it. These idealized forms he names aesthetic normal ideas of natural species.","[{""name"": ""Aviv Reiter"", ""affiliation"": [""Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511612671"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780198747116.book.1"", ""10.1080/00048400701571677"", ""10.4159/DLCL.marcus_tullius_cicero-de_inventione.1949"", ""10.1353/hph.2018.0025"", ""10.2307/2215614"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-9719-4_4"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab016"", ""10.1017/9781108992565"", ""10.1111/j.0966-8373.2005.00229.x"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac38.2.0167"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804649"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804656"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139028639"", ""10.1515/kant-2018-0002"", ""10.1515/9783111341965"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac55.4.0387"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487323""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Surely they know that the zombies are not real, and that they cannot really shoot them, but only control a fictional character who does so. Some philosophers of fiction argue that we need the concept of imaginative desires (or ‘i-desires’) to explain situations in which people feel desires towards fictional characters or desires that motivate pretend actions. Others claim that we can explain these situations without complicating human psychology with a novel mental state. Within their debates, however, these scholars exclusively focus on non-interactive fictions and children’s games of make-believe. In this paper, I argue that our experience of immersive, interactive fictions like videogames gives us cause to reappraise the concept of imaginative desires.

How and to what extent does such research contribute to the domain of music? How are the resulting models useful for music practitioners? This article describes work arising from research engaging with composers, musicians and audiences to address such questions: two websites that make their AI models accessible to a wide audience and a professionally recorded album released to expert reviewers to gauge the plausibility of AI-generated material. The authors describe the use of their models as tools for cocreation. Evaluating AI research and music models in such ways illuminates their impact on music-making.","[{""name"": ""Oded Ben-Tal"", ""affiliation"": [""Oded Ben-Tal, Kingston University, Department of Performing Arts, Coombehurst House, KT2 7LA, U.K. Email: o.ben-tal@kingston.ac.uk.

One goal of this paper is to raise awareness of hair discrimination and oppression within the philosophical community. Another is to consider whether current theories of appropriation can account for the wrongness of this widespread phenomenon and, if so, how. We are particularly interested in the special case where one minority group appropriates from another minority group—viz. the appropriation of Black hairstyles by Non-Black Persons of Colour (NBPoC). Our paper highlights the complexity of appropriation claims between competing minority groups—both of which have been oppressed, albeit differently, by White people— due to their multi-ethnic, multicultural and, therefore, intersectional, status.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Mejía Chaves"", ""affiliation"": [""Victoria University of Wellington""]}, {""name"": ""Sondra Bacharach"", ""affiliation"": [""Victoria University of Wellington""]}]","[""10.1111/jaac.12681"", ""10.4236/jss.2014.21010"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201642219"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1224-2"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1223-3"", ""10.1002/9781119118527"", ""10.1080/00497870903238463""]","['Medicine', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Rehabilitation', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.72), ('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7194)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Many country music scholars argue that authenticity claims track attributions of cultural standing or artistic self-expression. However, careful attention to the history of the genre reveals that these claims are simply factually wrong. On the basis of this, we have grounds for dismissing these attributions. Here, I argue for an alternative model of authenticity in which we take claims about the relative authenticity of country music to be evidence of ‘country’ being a dual-character concept in the same way that it has been suggested of punk rock and hip-hop. Authentic country music is country music that embodies the core value commitments of the genre. These values form the basis of country artists’ and audiences’ practical identities. Part of country music’s aesthetic practice is that audiences reconnect with, reify, and revise this common practical identity through identification with artists and works that manifest these values. We should then think of authenticity discourse within country music as a kind of game within the genre’s practice of shaping and maintaining this practical identity.","[{""name"": ""Evan Malone"", ""affiliation"": [""The University at Albany , USA""]}]","[""10.1093/aesthj/ayz055"", ""10.5406/jamerfolk.127.504.0126"", ""10.1111/phc3.12729"", ""10.1080/03007760701682383"", ""10.1525/california/9780520280656.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2013.01.005"", ""10.1111/phpr.12727"", ""10.1080/03007769108591458"", ""10.1111/papq.12301"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1999.tb02821.x"", ""10.1215/9780822397786-019"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226111445.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822397786-014"", ""10.1111/phc3.12145"", ""10.2307/2182230"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac52.1.0127"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac57.2.0221"", ""10.1007/BF01079504""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Sociology and Political Science', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

The authors use a computational method to quantitatively assess the amount of ES in Chinese landscape painting (CLP). The data show that 56.8% of ancient CLPs contain mostly ES, while only 9.4% from modern times do. ES reached its peak during the Yuan dynasty (1271–-1368) and its lowest point in the 1960s. Chan culture, literati ink play, the “exhibition hall effect,” and Maoist politics, as well as other social factors, may have had an impact on this shift. This empirical study indicates that art keeps abreast of current developments: The philosophy, culture, politics and general education of a specific era influence artists’ perception, aesthetics and creative output.","[{""name"": ""Guoyan Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Guoyan Wang, Department of Digital Communication, Room 5146, Building 5, Dushu Lake Campus of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.

I propose that the relationship between the comedian and her audience is understood by way of trust, where the comedian requires the trust of her audience for her humor to succeed. The comedian may hold (or fail to hold) the trust of the audience in two domains. She may be trusted as to the form of the humor, such as whether she is joking. She may also be trusted as to the content of the joke. This approach has two distinct virtues. The first is that it makes sense of partial successes. These are cases where the humor neither completely succeeds nor fails because the audience does not fully trust the comedian. The second is that it explains intuitions about ethically dubious humor and why certain classes of humor, especially those dealing in racialized and gendered identities, are more readily (but not necessarily) accepted from humorists of those identities.","[{""name"": ""DANIEL ABRAHAMS"", ""affiliation"": ["" Department of Philosophy  University of Glasgow  Glasgow  G128LP  United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199740192.003.0005"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199552221.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu015"", ""10.1111/j.2153-960X.2012.00546.x"", ""10.1093/analys/anv037"", ""10.1353/phl.1998.0014"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511519888"", ""10.1111/nous.12000"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9027.001.0001"", ""10.1086/233694"", ""10.1002/9781444307795"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-14382-4"", ""10.5840/filmphil2007115"", ""10.1007/s10677-009-9203-5""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Kind-centred analyses posit that we should abandon the project of giving a general theory of art and focus instead on giving theories of the arts. The main difficulty, however, is to explain what makes a given kind an art-kind in the first place. Kind-centred theorists have passed this buck on to appreciative practices, but this move proves unsatisfactory. I argue that the root of this dissatisfaction stems not from the act of kicking the can down the road, but from not kicking it far enough. The missing ingredient, I argue, is a notion of convention which does the work of marking the difference between art and non-art for a given physical medium.","[{""name"": ""Michel-Antoine Xhignesse"", ""affiliation"": [""University of British Columbia""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In this essay, I set these experiments within their appropriate intellectual, scientific, and philosophical context in order to show that, its minor scientific importance notwithstanding, this onetime excursion into empirical research provided an early onset for Wittgenstein’s career-long exploration of the philosophically pervasive implications of aspects. Dramatically moving beyond the conceptual limitations, which were inscribed by Charles Myers’s scientific program, Wittgenstein got a glimpse of a philosophical angle, which was bound to become very important to him not only in aesthetics, but also for his overarching philosophical development. He became interested in what we actually do when we re-phrase, compare, come up with good similes in order to illuminate something definite within the space of possibility, so a new aspect may come to life.","[{""name"": ""Eran Guter"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/832011""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Philosophy'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Whereas the first wave (including Frank Bowling and Anwar Shemza) sought to reconcile their late colonial backgrounds with the tenets of high modernism – the autonomy of the artwork, the disinterested beholder, and universalist claims of timeless aesthetic value – the second wave (including Rasheed Araeen and Gavin Jantjes) turned to minimalism, performance, and photo‐text to de‐centre modernism's core assumptions that relied on formalist discourse. Collage and montage practices among the UK‐born third wave (including Sonia Boyce, Maud Sulter, and Donald Rodney), which entailed the hyphenation of cross‐cultural elements, thus call for a deeper look at transculturation processes active since modernism's beginning, but which were not previously recognized on account of formalist hegemony.","[{""name"": ""Kobena Mercer"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

I also argue that the theory of work-performance defended in the book fits much more naturally with a contextualist ontology of musical works than with the Platonist ontology Dodd defends in Works of Music (2007), despite his arguments to the contrary in the afterword of the new book. Finally, I argue that the reasons he gives for preferring a ‘tradition-based’ over a ‘historicized’ theory of the understanding of classical scores are not convincing.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Kania"", ""affiliation"": [""Trinity University, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01345.x"", ""10.5840/monist201295432"", ""10.1111/jaac.12348"", ""10.1093/0199241589.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608775.003.0008"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608775.003.0013"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays068"", ""10.1093/mq/LXVI.2.205"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9999-z"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2012.00546.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198859482.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199367313.013.47"", ""10.1111/jaac.12715"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2008.00288.x"", ""10.4324/9781315210629"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199730766.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2025596"", ""10.2307/3332814"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayq029"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/35.4.338"", ""10.1111/jaac.12370"", ""10.1002/9780470776186"", ""10.1111/jaac.12089"", ""10.2307/2214597""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music', 'Law']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

It is of particular importance to the arts because creativity is often found at the intersection of cultural boundaries. Much of the popular discourse on cultural appropriation focusses on the commercial use of indigenous or marginalized cultures by mainstream or dominant cultures. There is, however, growing awareness that cultural appropriation is a complicated issue encompassing cultural exchange in all its forms. Creativity emerging from cultural interdependence is far from a reciprocal exchange. This insight indicates that ethical and political implications are at stake. Consequently, the arts are being examined with greater attention in order to assess these implications. This article will focus on appropriation in literature, and examine the way appropriative strategies are being used to resist dominant cultural standards. These strategies and their implications will be analyzed through the lens of Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of minor literature.","[{""name"": ""Paul Haynes"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Business and Management, Royal Holloway, University of London , UK""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203420447"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp058"", ""10.1017/S0307883318000287"", ""10.4324/9780203241783"", ""10.1080/13688799890174"", ""10.1080/12259276.2006.11666009"", ""10.1080/15348430902973450"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.00090"", ""10.1177/1359183518782719"", ""10.2307/1185715"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201642219"", ""10.1177/1474022215613608"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz010"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00277.x"", ""10.1080/00335639709384181"", ""10.1353/jhi.2000.0010"", ""10.5479/sil.447686.39088007511512"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2005.00190.x""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Health', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

I go on to propose a definition of tattoo art that distinguishes it from other uses of tattooing, and from other forms of visual art. I argue that tattoo art is an art form that creates artworks in living skin, and that the living body is an essential component of and contributor to the artwork. This gives rise to several other distinctive features of tattoo art, in particular that it reconfigures in interesting ways the relationships between artist, artworks, and viewers. Like street art, tattoo art by its nature resists inclusion in and valuation through art institutions such as galleries and museums.","[{""name"": ""Laura Sizer"", ""affiliation"": [""Hampshire College""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Different versions of this theory have been suggested by Gregory Currie, Peter Lamarque, Stein Haugom Olsen, and Nicholas Wolterstorff. The general idea behind the approach is that fictional characters are to be analysed in terms of roles, which in turn can be understood as sets of properties (or alternatively as kinds or functions from possible worlds to individuals). I will discuss several advantages and disadvantages of this approach. I will then propose a novel hyperintensional version of role realism (which I will call impossibilism), according to which fictional names are analysed in terms of individual concepts that cannot be matched by a reference (a full-blooded individual). I will argue that this account avoids the main disadvantages of standard role realism.","[{""name"": ""Daniela Glavaničová"", ""affiliation"": [""Slovak Academy of Sciences""]}]","[""10.1111/1468-0114.00032"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139235990"", ""10.1007/s11098-009-9479-2"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198812791.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2215787"", ""10.1111/j.0029-4624.2005.00541.x"", ""10.1111/1468-0068.00358"", ""10.11612/resphil.2016.2.93.1"", ""10.1080/00048408812343531"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-8812-3"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674794.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199647057.003.0014"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21395-8_16"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198709008.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF02380932"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199928385.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199577460.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199262543.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02550-1"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.2003.tb00266.x"", ""10.1515/9783110849264"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-6980-3""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

They are not the result of sui generis, dedicated speech acts of a specific kind, on a par with assertion. The view had earlier many defenders, and still has some. Stefano Predelli enlists considerations derived from Searle in support of his radical fictionalism. This is the view that a sentence of fictional discourse including a prima facie empty fictional name like “Emma Woodhouse” in fact “is not a sentence, and it encodes no proposition whatsoever.” His argument is broadly abductive; he claims that this view affords compelling explanations of features of fictions he finds well-established, among them that fictions without explicit narrators nonetheless have covert ones. Here I take up his arguments, in defense of the dedicated speech act view. I thus address pressing issues about the status of fictional names and the nature and ubiquity of narrators in fictions.","[{""name"": ""Manuel García-Carpintero"", ""affiliation"": [""LOGOS/BIAP, Department of Philosophy, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198831525.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00273.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01362.x"", ""10.2307/2183752"", ""10.1111/j.0029-4624.2005.00541.x"", ""10.2307/2219853"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1093/0199256284.003.0008"", ""10.1007/s11098-008-9292-3"", ""10.1007/s11098-009-9485-4"", ""10.1017/S003181910001696X"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199567881.003.0010"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayt021"", ""10.1163/18756735-09603013"", ""10.1111/jaac.12660"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy054"", ""10.1111/phpr.12552"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511674716"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0364-2"", ""10.1007/BF02385199"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2005.00180.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00274.x"", ""10.1515/jlt.2011.006"", ""10.1515/jlse.2011.004"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-4104-4_20"", ""10.1093/0195032047.003.0015"", ""10.1515/tl-2017-0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195111040.003.0006"", ""10.1353/phl.1993.0079"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198778158.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.2002.tb00242.x"", ""10.1007/s10670-017-9959-2"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198790358.001.0001"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00101"", ""10.2307/468422"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198798347.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02550-1"", ""10.1353/phl.1983.0059"", ""10.2307/2025831"", ""10.1353/phl.1983.0004"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/38.2.167"", ""10.1515/tl-2017-0007""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1093/jaac/kpab040,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Poetry and the Possibility of Paraphrase,"AbstractWhy is there a long-standing debate about paraphrase in poetry? Everyone agrees that paraphrase can be useful; everyone agrees that paraphrase is no substitute for the poem itself. What is there to disagree about? Perhaps this: whether paraphrase can specify everything that counts as a contribution to the meaning of a poem. There are, we say, two ways to take the question; on one way of taking it, the answer is that paraphrase cannot. Does this entail that there is meaning mysteriously locked in a poem, meaning that cannot be represented in any way other than via the poem itself? If that were so it would have profound implications for poetry’s capacity to convey insight. We suggest reasons for thinking that the entailment does not hold. Throughout, we connect the traditional debate over paraphrase, which has largely been conducted within the fields of philosophy and literary theory, with recent empirically oriented thinking about the communicability of meaning, represented by work in pragmatics. We end with a suggestion about what is to count as belonging to meaning, and what as merely among the things that determine meaning.","[{""name"": ""Gregory Currie"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of York, Heslington, York YO, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Jacopo Frascaroli"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of York, Heslington, York YO, UK""]}]","[""10.5040/9781350928565"", ""10.1007/s11098-005-3019-5"", ""10.1111/mila.12329"", ""10.1111/mila.12327"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0607-x"", ""10.5840/philtopics199725118"", ""10.1086/648610"", ""10.1111/jaac.12234"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01481.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9329.2009.00442.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199603671.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2009.00189.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2009.00190.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayt048"", ""10.1007/BF00160894"", ""10.1093/scan/nsx069"", ""10.1057/978-1-349-73908-0_12"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2019.01.005"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139028370""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

How can we make sense of pitying Anna Karenina when we know there is no such person? In this paper I argue that contrary to the usual interpretation, the question of rationality has nothing to do with the Paradox of Fiction. Instead, the real problem is why there is a divergence in our normative assessments of emotions in different contexts. I argue that explaining this divergence requires a more nuanced account of the rationality of emotion than has previously been proposed. One advantage of my proposal over alternatives is that it helps to explain one way we can learn emotionally from fiction and imagination.","[{""name"": ""Stacie Friend"", ""affiliation"": [""Birkbeck, University of London""]}]",[],"['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The authors describe the graphics and audio systems of these works, particularly the procedural generation and visual effects and the creative exploitation of these effects within an art installation. The authors mix “real” and “unreal” features and effects, inspired by surrealist art, to create highly immersive psychedelic organic experiences for the viewer-participant. Interface simplicity and discoverability is critical for VR exhibitions, as is the balance between an experience constrained by an artist's choices and a freer (but riskier) one with greater public choice. Public gallery installation of Mutator VR creates special challenges.","[{""name"": ""William Latham"", ""affiliation"": [""William Latham, Department of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London, U.K. Email: w.latham@gold.ac.uk.""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen Todd"", ""affiliation"": [""Stephen Todd, Department of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London, U.K.""]}, {""name"": ""Peter Todd"", ""affiliation"": [""Peter Todd, Department of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London, U.K.""]}, {""name"": ""Lance Putnam"", ""affiliation"": [""Lance Putnam, Department of Computing, Goldsmiths, University of London, U.K. Email: l.putnam@gold.ac.uk.""]}]","[""10.1147/sj.284.0548""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7662), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7556)]]"

Interest in these ideas has been steadily growing in the art world, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States. Following on from a period of renewed institutional engagement with the politics of identity, this phenomenon also reflects the rise of ‘crip theory’ as an intersectional discourse that purports to offer insights beyond the traditional remit of disability studies. With the recent politics of austerity responsible for insolvency, dispossession and vulnerability on a mass scale, some even propose thinking of the present at large as ‘crip times’. Others caution against galleries and museums turning real people living with disabilities into a Zeitgeist. This essay explores these debates in relation to the work of Carolyn Lazard and Jesse Darling, two artists based on opposite sides of the Atlantic, who take a contrasting approach to the representation of sickness and vulnerability.","[{""name"": ""Giulia Smith"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Medicine', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Physiology']","[[('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"

By introducing the notion of the ‘niche’ (‘aesthetic niche’) as a key term in an empirically and evolutionarily informed aesthetics, this paper aims to take a fresh look at these and similar questions. It also aims to shed new light on the development and functioning of the aesthetic capacity in humans and its trans-generational transmission. Drawing on recent research developments in evolutionary biology, developmental psychology, and cognitive sciences, I shall argue that the human aesthetic capacity—which I understand as the capacity, involving perceptual, cognitive and emotional processes, to enter into a pleasurable/non-pleasurable and expressive relation with objects, artworks, natural phenomena, or other people—relies on constructed environmental resources (that is, on a niche) for its emergence and its ontogenetic development.","[{""name"": ""Mariagrazia Portera"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Literature and Philosophy, University of Florence, Florence, Italy""]}]",[],"['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The only differences are that, in the case of fiction-directed emotions, fictional truth rather than truth is relevant to fittingness, and salience in the context of engaging with the fiction replaces salience in the real context. Other asymmetries between the aptness criteria of fiction- and reality-directed emotions that seem to conflict with this claim are reducible to these two differences or stem from the failure to distinguish between emotions directed towards the content of a fiction and the fiction itself.","[{""name"": ""Moonyoung Song"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Maryland""]}]",[],"['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Unlike media and television scholars, who have been appreciative of the informative capacity of television fiction, philosophers have been less willing to acknowledge the way in which these works contribute to our understanding of our social reality. My aim here is to provide one such account, grounded in aesthetic cognitivism, that is, the view that fiction is a source of knowledge. Focusing on crime and courtroom dramas, I start by offering some examples of the cognitive benefits available in some of these series and I argue that the more beneficial cases establish superior mimetic relations with reality, enhancing their capacity to present ethically challenging issues. I then examine whether the fictional dimension of these works presents an obstacle to their informative potential and I conclude that it does not. A central aspect of my account is the claim that the degree of cognitive benefit depends on the underlying narrative strategy of the series. Specifically, there are clues in any given show, including the treatment of ongoing characters, which signal the extent to which it can be taken as mimetically reliable and thus, cognitively valuable. I complete my account by addressing anti-cognitivists’ arguments which call to doubt the informative aspect of television series and their capacity to address ethical concerns.","[{""name"": ""Iris Vidmar Jovanović"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of Rijeka , Rijeka , Croatia""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198831525.001.0001"", ""10.1093/monist/onv039"", ""10.1001/archpedi.160.4.348"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198715719.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0195128923.003.0010"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayac005"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0012"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199647019.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197507247.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198805403.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45992-5"", ""10.5040/9798216036302"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpaa007"", ""10.5406/15437809.57.1.02"", ""10.4324/9780203866856""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Law', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

But what constitutes this ‘belonging’ precisely? This paper proposes that belonging, in the targeted sense, is determined by meaningful connections between an object or practice and the relevant culture—in other words, connections that could be described as the thing’s ‘meanings’. Such meanings primarily include relations of causality, teleology, and symbolic representation. After expounding this account, the paper closes with a word of caution. The term ‘belongs’ is sometimes ambiguous, indicating both affiliation and legal or moral property rights. Despite this, belonging as affiliation or meaningful connectedness is not equivalent to rightful ownership. Nor does the former, by itself, entail the latter.","[{""name"": ""Joshua Lewis Thomas"", ""affiliation"": [""The Open University, UK""]}]","[""10.2307/2182440"", ""10.1080/20518196.2017.1244327"", ""10.1037/14040-000"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201642219"", ""10.2307/2202065"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00277.x"", ""10.1080/05568641.2017.1422793"", ""10.1046/j.0264-3758.2003.00251.x"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2005.00190.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5930.2007.00359.x"", ""10.1002/9780470694190""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Groove talk is widespread among musicians and audiences, and considerable importance is placed on generating and appreciating grooves in music. However, musicians, musicologists, and audiences use groove attributions in a variety of ways that do not track one consistent underlying concept. I argue that there at least two distinct concepts of groove. On one account, the groove is “the feel of the music” and, on the other, the groove is the psychological feeling (induced by music) of wanting to move one’s body. Further, I argue that recent work in music psychology shows that these two concepts do not converge on a unified set of musical features. Finally, I also argue that these two concepts play different functional roles in the appreciative practices of jazz and popular music. This should cause us to further consider the mediating role genre plays for aesthetic concepts and provides us with a reason for adopting a more communitarian approach to aesthetics that is attentive to the ways in which aesthetic discourse serves the practices of different audiences.","[{""name"": ""Evan Malone"", ""affiliation"": [""University at Albany , SUNY, Albany, New York , USA""]}]","[""10.1525/mp.2020.38.1.1"", ""10.1525/mp.2013.30.5.497"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00462"", ""10.1177/1029864913486793"", ""10.1525/mp.2002.19.3.387"", ""10.1037/a0024208"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2006.00219.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01483.x"", ""10.2307/852198"", ""10.1111/phpr.12727"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00894"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2014.00454"", ""10.1093/mind/fzz054"", ""10.1111/papq.12279"", ""10.1525/mp.2002.19.3.285"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4120.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab060"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01036""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Music', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

White’s AI systems produce images that will be interpreted as abstract artworks by human viewers, but which also confront human audiences with the realization that what is here deliberately rendered indeterminable for them will remain near-perfectly legible for AI-powered image recognition systems. This difference in perceptual and interpretive agency foregrounds an underlying politics of visual indeterminacy. White’s projects thus increase awareness of how machine vision—for example in automated online filtering systems—can diminish the horizon of what human audiences can or cannot see in an AI-driven digital cultural landscape, and how, in the process, underlying biases are normalized and human viewers become habituated to the dramatic shrinking of perceivable/viewable online image content mediated by AI.","[{""name"": ""Martin Zeilinger"", ""affiliation"": [""Martin Zeilinger, School of Design & Informatics, Abertay University, Bell Street, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland, U.K. Email: m.zeilinger@abertay.ac.uk.""]}]","[""10.1162/leon.2006.39.5.394"", ""10.3389/fnhum.2011.00084"", ""10.1386/jvap.10.1.21_1"", ""10.1162/leon_a_01930""]",['Neuroscience'],['Cognitive Neuroscience'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

He argued that the word ‘beautiful’ is neither the name of a particular perceptible quality, nor the name of whatever produces a certain psychological effect, and unlike ‘good’, it does not stand for a family-resemblance concept either. Rather, the word ‘beautiful’ has different meanings in different contexts as we apply it according to different criteria. However, in more advanced regions of aesthetics the word ‘beautiful’ ceases to play an important role. Instead, we judge things to be more or less correct according to genre-specific standards or criteria, which in an aesthetic discussion are presupposed, rather than argued for. Finally, Wittgenstein came to realise that providing support for an aesthetic appraisal according to some given criteria is not the only and perhaps not even the main focus of aesthetic discussion. More interesting to him became the idea of a puzzle or perplexity in aesthetics, which he discussed in greater detail in his 1938 lectures.","[{""name"": ""Severin Schroeder"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In one view, comedians are hailed as providing genuine social insight and telling truths. In the other, comedians are seen as merely trying to entertain and not to be taken seriously. This tension raises a foundational question for the aesthetics of stand-up: Do stand-up comedians perform genuine assertions in their performances? This article considers this question in the light of several theories of assertion. We conclude that comedians on stage do not count as making genuine assertions-rather, much like actors on a stage, they merely pretend to perform speech acts. However, due to norms of authenticity that govern stand-up comedy, performers can nonetheless succeed in conveying genuine insights. Thus, our account accommodates both the seemingly incompatible aspects of our ordinary appreciation of stand-up comedy and points toward deeper philosophical understanding of stand-up comedy as a unique art form.","[{""name"": ""JESSE RAPPAPORT"", ""affiliation"": ["" Department of Philosophy  ashington University in St. Louis  St. Louis  Missouri  63130""]}, {""name"": ""JAKE QUILTY-DUNN"", ""affiliation"": ["" Philosophy Department  Baruch College  New York  10010""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00820.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198245537.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226924601.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.1986.tb00522.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12711"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511605970.011"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayr006"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu015"", ""10.5840/monist20058817"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5760.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198798422.001.0001"", ""10.1353/phl.1998.0014"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2005.00178.x"", ""10.1515/humr.2010.001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199251520.003.0006"", ""10.5840/monist20058815"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-6472-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139173438"", ""10.1007/s10677-009-9203-5""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The main goal of this article is to support Walton’s view by providing a full account of photographic transparency. I will argue that the transparency that characterizes photography is not metaphorical but in fact exhibits all the essential properties of transparent materials. To understand how a photograph can be transparent, one must understand the special type of causal connection between a photograph and what it shows. Building on Fritz Heider’s work, I will argue that photography is a visual medium, like air, water, glass, or mirrors, capable of transmitting the visual properties of distant objects to the perceiver.","[{""name"": ""Vivian Mizrahi"", ""affiliation"": [""Thumos Research Group, University of Geneva, Campus Biotech, Geneva, Switzerland""]}]","[""10.1080/00048405985200141"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu098"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2004.00152.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551277"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/36.1.30"", ""10.1093/mind/112.447.433"", ""10.1038/scientificamerican0474-90"", ""10.1080/00048402.2018.1481119"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu101"", ""10.1086/448116"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv042"", ""10.1086/448287"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316286777""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This article deploys Friend’s notion of genre in order to improve the influential characterization of science fiction proposed by Darko Suvin and to defend it from a criticism recently raised by Simon Evnine. According to Suvin, a work of science fiction must concern “a fictional ‘novum’ (novelty, innovation) validated by cognitive logic.” While Suvin conceives of his characterization as a necessary and sufficient condition for membership in the genre, I propose to cast the notions of “fictional novum” and “cognitive validation” as standard features of the genre, which works of science fiction should have but might lack. I argue that this amended version of Suvin’s characterization can better account for two basic properties of science fiction as a genre, namely its historicity and its relevance to appreciation. Lastly, I show that the amended version can shed some light on the affinity between works of science fiction and philosophical thought experiments.","[{""name"": ""Enrico Terrone"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Antichità, Filosofia Storia (DAFIST), Università degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2015.00382.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511616037"", ""10.1093/0199256284.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01345.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/44.3.297"", ""10.1111/misp.12037"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2012.00331.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayt021"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayi032"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00234.x"", ""10.1515/9781400868995"", ""10.5749/j.ctt189tts8"", ""10.2307/2025324"", ""10.2307/2182230"", ""10.4159/harvard.9780674423145"", ""10.1093/019924443X.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2005.00202.x"", ""10.2307/2183933"", ""10.4324/9780203030622""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In contrast, the hallowed works of China's classical antiquity, the bronzes, are generally believed to have been monochrome works. In recent years, however, many varieties of bronzes have been unearthed with polychrome ornamentation including sacrificial vessels, figural sculptures, mirrors, lamps, weapons, and personal ornaments. This article summarizes and interprets the current evidence for painting on early Chinese bronze artifacts based on recent archaeological discoveries and on newer advances in technical analysis. In particular, I show that the practice of applying paint to bronzes goes far beyond embedding pigment into the intaglio channels of bronzes such as occurred during the Shang and Western Zhou eras. I also demonstrate that especially in the Warring States and early imperial periods, painted coloration on bronzes took off in diversely rich and compelling ways. This article highlights the various modes and techniques of painting bronze in early China, and offers several hypotheses as to why such polychrome ornamentation was desirable in early China, reconciling those motives with our quite different modern sensibilities.","[{""name"": ""Allison R.

While broadly Kantian aestheticians have defended the claim that there is a distinct way that we attend to objects in aesthetic experience, Kant himself is not usually acknowledged as offering an account of aesthetic attention. On the basis of Kant’s more general account of attention in other texts and his remarks on attention in the Critique of the Power of Judgment, I reconstruct Kant’s account of aesthetic attention. On his account, aesthetic attention is simultaneously directed at the form of an object and at the judging subject’s own mental states as she attends to the object. In the experience of beauty, we specifically attend to the harmonious relation between the faculties of imagination and understanding.","[{""name"": ""Jessica J Williams"", ""affiliation"": [""University of South Florida""]}]","[""10.1093/0199247315.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00048400701571677"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayr031"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804649"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804656"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791925"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/39.4.392"", ""10.2307/2215615"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp043"", ""10.1515/9780691214122"", ""10.1017/9781108344005"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658442.001.0001"", ""10.1515/kant-2018-0002"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayi035"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2011.592327"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/32.2.149"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2012.716194"", ""10.1353/hph.2006.0075"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511487323""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

According to him, compliance with a work’s score can be sacrificed in cases where it conflicts with interpretative authenticity. Stephen Davies and Andrew Kania reject this view, arguing that, if a performer intentionally departs from a work’s score, she is not properly instantiating that work and hence not producing an authentic performance of it. I argue that this objection fails. A detailed analysis of work-performance practice reveals, first, that the normative scope of interpretive authenticity encompasses the practice of composing musical versions and that, second, when performers sacrifice score compliance to maximize interpretive authenticity, they are performing the target work by means of performing a version of it. By means of the nested types theory, I then show how performances produced in this way can be properly formed instances, and hence authentic performances, of their target work.","[{""name"": ""Nemesio G.

As evidenced by abstract art theoreticians, one can think of an abstract picture as a tree of elementary shapes interacting according to a short list of compositional laws such as occlusion, exclusion and bordering, and by rendering rules such as transparency, tessellation and color selection. Randomizing the shape generator and the composition and rendering laws yields an algorithm generating random abstract textures. We have designed a user-friendly online tool that implements this algorithm.","[{""name"": ""Luis Alvarez"", ""affiliation"": [""CTIM, Departamento de Informatica y Sistemas, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Campus de Tafira, 35017, Spain.

Placing these works at the crux of period discourses about the body in the Anglophone world, this essay explores the function and popularity of portraiture in mid‐eighteenth‐century New England. Specifically, it analyses Copley’s techniques for depicting flesh and reads them in relation to nascent formulations of race, arguing that the artist's portraits helped construct whiteness as a perspicacious state and a biological inheritance. They located sensorial capacity in the white body; visualized its transmission across generations; and, thereby, attempted to mitigate the sitters' anxieties about their tenuous place in the racial imaginary. Long understood to mediate the ambivalent relationship between Britain and its American colonies, Copley's portraits emerge here as actors in the distinctly circum‐Atlantic networks that united these regions.","[{""name"": ""Nika Elder"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Museology'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Aligning itself with the interdisciplinary field of transgender studies, the essay models one version of how art historians might teach a sceptical history of the nude in which we leave open the multiple and transformable genders that can be proposed by it. This essay argues that even a canonical episode about a non‐trans artist such as Manet (and his scandalous display of Olympia in 1865) contains ample opportunities (in both the contemporary criticism and art‐historical literature) to address transgender, non‐binary, and intersex themes. To question the equation of seeing and knowing when confronted with a naked body is both an ethical and a methodological imperative for art history – a field that traffics in nudes as central to its defining narratives.","[{""name"": ""David J.

I am skeptical of this sentiment, and in what follows I aim to demonstrate why. I suspect AI generated images can be considered artworks; more specifically, that generative AI programs are, in many cases, just another tool artists can use to realize their creative intent. I begin with an overview of how generative AI programs, like OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, work. Then, leveraging work by Claire Anscomb, I argue that generative AI programs are a new technique of automatic image-making that affords creative agency to its users, thereby qualifying the images they create as artworks. Finally, I show many of the objections brought against AI artworks—including accusations of plagiarism and artistic devaluation—are due to the social backdrop in which we currently find them, rather than the technology itself. In the end, I aim to open the door to further aesthetic debate concerning AI generated images and art.","[{""name"": ""Kathryn Wojtkiewicz"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department, Georgetown University , Washington, DC 20007 , USA""]}]","[""10.3390/arts6040018"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab054"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198819653.013.5"", ""10.1145/3442188.3445922"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac53.3.0251"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayi015"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2006.00016.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199665778.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11023-021-09568-5"", ""10.1007/s13347-016-0230-6""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In this article, I extend on these discussions and offer a theory of guilty pleasures. Informed by queer and critical approaches to affect and minor aesthetic categories, I argue that guilty pleasures are characterized not by a specific medium or style, but rather by their ability to evoke pleasure interrupted by a meta-response of guilt. This experience is activated by the outmoded, saccharine, or naff qualities of an object. I contrast guilty pleasures with good-bad art, painful art, and objects that foster akrasia, and provide an extended examination of naff, another minor aesthetic category with roots in Polari (a once-secret queer dialect) that intersects aspects of camp, heteronormativity, and Lauren Berlant’s notion of “cruel optimism.” I ultimately argue that guilty pleasures are far from a simplistic category of low art enjoyed with indifference. Instead, I perceive guilty pleasures as always enjoyed with a degree of criticality or skepticism that is tethered to the beholder’s taste, life experiences, and values.","[{""name"": ""Melinda Reid"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Art and Design, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia""]}]","[""10.1163/ej.9789004156708.i-308"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199285556.003.0006"", ""10.1007/s10790-016-9569-2"", ""10.4324/9781315763057"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/30.2.117"", ""10.5130/csr.v24i1.5303"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195104707.003.0005"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac50.4.0307"", ""10.1016/j.poetic.2014.10.003"", ""10.1111/phc3.12558"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.51.3.0058"", ""10.1163/9789401203425"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.3.0499""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Although recent attempts to answer these questions can be found in contemporary literature, in this paper I examine the answers defended by the early phenomenologist Edith Landmann-Kalischer. I show that Landmann-Kalischer answers the demarcation question by blending together a cognitivist account of aesthetic judgment with an objectivist account of beauty, and that she builds an account of aesthetic normativity on this cognitivist and objectivist basis. I contend that her subtle and unified account of aesthetic demarcation and normativity has advantages over other competing hedonist and Kantian views and, as such, merits further consideration in contemporary debates.","[{""name"": ""Samantha Matherne"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard University""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The interviews point to intense affective and existential experiences, in which encounters with art can be genuinely transformative. We focus on Dufrenne’s notion of ‘adherent reflection’ and Dewey’s notions of ‘doing and undergoing’ to understand the intentional structure and dynamics of such experiences, concluding that being moved contains two merged forms of intentionality: one overt aspect of perceptual intentionality directed at the work, and a covert affective intentionality directed back at oneself in one’s situated existence. These are operational simultaneously but can work in loops, one leading to an intensification of the other and vice versa. As such, these analyses emphasize the value of phenomenological interviews and advance the integration of phenomenological and pragmatist thinking in the context of aesthetic experience.","[{""name"": ""Simon Høffding"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Carlos Vara Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tone Roald"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00201740701489245"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.53.1.0106"", ""10.1080/20539320.2019.1589042"", ""10.1111/cura.12344"", ""10.1007/s11097-021-09744-z"", ""10.1007/s11097-009-9135-5"", ""10.1007/s11097-006-9022-2"", ""10.1007/s11097-021-09756-9"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01526.x"", ""10.1007/s11097-021-09737-y""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

Manet's Olympia in the Age of Comparative Anatomy,"Among the most‐cited jibes directed at Manet’s Olympia in 1865 was a comment by the little𠄉known critic, Amédée Cantaloube, in a short‐lived periodical, Le Grand Journal, that dubbed the reclining nude ‘a kind of gorilla’. Through a close reading of the layered associations with this primate, only named in 1847, this essay locates the painting’s subject within contemporary excitement over the possible capture of a living specimen by adventurer Paul Du Chaillu, and scientific as well as popular debates over the links between humans and higher mammals. Using a piecemeal way of reading the body consistent with the methods of comparative anatomists, critics saw the disjointed body of Olympia as not only that of a prostitute but also sub’human. Cantaloube’s extreme language also reflected repressed fears of interspecies coupling and the linked possibility of miscegenation, particularly topical in light of the end of the Civil War in April 1865.","[{""name"": ""Anne McCauley"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Medicine', 'Neuroscience']","['Neurology', 'History', 'Pathology and Forensic Medicine']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7465), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7432)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('1012 法医学', 0.7527), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7148)]]"

I focus on two aspects of Kant’s theory that might otherwise be taken to support an individualist reading, namely, Kant’s emphasis on aesthetic autonomy and his characterization of judgments of taste as involving demands for agreement. I argue that the full expression of autonomy in fact requires being a member of an aesthetic community and that within such a community, judgments of taste are issued as invitations to others to engage their faculties towards the goal of shared aesthetic appreciation.","[{""name"": ""Jessica J Williams"", ""affiliation"": [""JESSICA J.

Works of AA (often) fail to satisfy established criteria for originality, such as creative labour and transformative use. As such, appropriation artists are often subject to copyright lawsuits and defend their work under the fair use doctrine of US copyright law. In legal cases regarding AA and fair use, judges lack a general principle whereby they can determine whether or not the offending party has ‘transformed’ the original work. Further, it is not the case that there is some antecedent fact that could determine the outcome one way or another. I diagnose debates surrounding the transformative nature of works of AA as cases of ‘metalinguistic negotiation’ over what concepts we should attach to terms like ‘copy’, ‘transformative’, and ‘work of art’.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth Cantalamessa"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Miami""]}]",[],"['Business, Management and Accounting', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Law', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Marketing']","[[('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

In response, humans need to reimagine cities as places for interspecies cohabitation.

The authors illustrate the implications of this dependence by designing and discussing nesting structures for the powerful owl (Ninox strenua). The project shows that prosthetic habitats can serve as useful provocation for thinking about interspecies cultures.

Puy’s hypothesis is relevant to two topics in cognitive psychology and experimental philosophy. The first topic is the prevalence of teleological reasoning about various objects and its influence on persistence and categorization judgments. The second one is the importance of an artist’s intention in the categorization of artworks. We tested the teleological hypothesis across three studies. Vignettes in these three studies describe a musical work being changed in some of these aspects: (1) purpose either changed or retained; (2) score either changed or retained; (3) change is made either by the same or a different composer. The results suggest that teleological considerations impact judgments on the persistence of musical works, but this impact appears to be relatively weak. The results also suggest that persistence judgments strongly depend on whether acoustical properties were changed, while whether the change was made by the original composer seems to be relatively unimportant.","[{""name"": ""Elzė Sigutė Mikalonytė"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Philosophy, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania""]}, {""name"": ""Vilius Dranseika"", ""affiliation"": [""Interdisciplinary Centre for Ethics & Institute of Philosophy, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland"", ""Institute of Philosophy, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania""]}]","[""10.1016/0010-0277(95)00699-0"", ""10.1080/03610911003650383"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2004.10.002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1207-3"", ""10.1007/s13164-013-0142-7"", ""10.1037/0012-1649.35.6.1440"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2009.01.001"", ""10.1037/a0030399"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691494.003.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511529863.009"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz051"", ""10.1163/15685373-12342181"", ""10.1111/tops.12111"", ""10.5040/9781350038950.ch-005"", ""10.1111/jaac.12651"", ""10.1037/aca0000174"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0555-6"", ""10.1111/nous.12123"", ""10.1111/cogs.12725"", ""10.1111/cogs.12818"", ""10.1017/S1930297500004770""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

After all, is it simply comic relief that wounded nations, communities, or individuals seek? Tragedy has long been cast as memory and mourning while comedy offers for the masses a Nietzschean moment of joyful forgetting and for the Stoic mind a measure of transcendence from our grief. The latter view came into prominence for modern American culture with the nineteenth-century satirist Mark Twain, who wrote that “the secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow,” which has been interpreted through the often-quoted formula: comedy is tragedy plus time. The assumption is that we need some distance emotionally in order to mock or transcend the tragic. While we grant the humor of transcendence can produce some momentary relief through emotional distance, we wonder if there might be another way that humor can deal with suffering? Popular psychology often speaks of five stages of grief, and while that progression seems too linear and simplistic, we find that the now much more inclusive comic stage has something to offer their audiences struggling to make sense of a volatile world.","[{""name"": ""CYNTHIA WILLETT"", ""affiliation"": ["" Philosophy Department  Emory University  Atlanta  Georgia  30307""]}, {""name"": ""JULIE WILLETT"", ""affiliation"": ["" Department of History  Texas Tech University  Lubbock  Texas  79409""]}]","[""10.2307/j.ctv34wmmdh"", ""10.1515/9781400866908"", ""10.1353/book.33137"", ""10.7312/mcaf13880"", ""10.4324/9781315657738""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"
10.1093/jaac/kpab021,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Seeing in Mirrors,"Abstract Notwithstanding Plato’s venerable opinion, many people nowadays claim either that mirrors are not pictures, or that, if they are such, they are just transparent pictures in Kendall Walton’s sense of a particular kind of picture (causally based representations, Peircean indexes, namely, natural signs, which are grasped by means of a perceptual experience of transparency—seeing-through—that lets one literally see the object perceived through the picture). In this article, however, I want to argue that mirrors are bona fide pictures. For they are grasped via what, as I assume in the article, makes a picture a picture, that is, a representation with a figurative value, namely, a depiction; namely, a certain seeing-in experience. This is the sui generis perceptual experience that Richard Wollheim originally appealed to. Once this experience is suitably reconceived, one can show how it successfully applies to mirrors as well, in order to prove that they are bona fide pictures. From an aesthetical point of view, this is an important result. For it shows that the class of pictures is broader than what people nowadays think and is closer to the original intuition sustaining Plato’s opinion.","[{""name"": ""Alberto Voltolini"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy and Education Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy""]}]","[""10.1017/S0140525X00038188"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199585960.003.0009"", ""10.1057/9780230365292_11"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac49.1.0023"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00295.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00800.x"", ""10.1093/analys/ans119"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/40.1.21"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy031"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.3.0227"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2011.00320.x"", ""10.1080/00048402.2018.1481119"", ""10.1007/s11097-011-9219-x"", ""10.1057/9780230297531"", ""10.1007/s11098-016-0752-x"", ""10.1057/9781137263292"", ""10.1007/s13164-019-00456-7"", ""10.1111/papq.12296"", ""10.1086/448287"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316286777.009""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Initially, there might seem to be a tension between “the comedic” and “roasting” or “insult.” The comedic is concerned with the funny or mirth while insults are mean-spirited in nature, tools of injury. So how can the two be combined to produce something fun? In this article, I entertain a few views that attempt a resolution of this apparent tension. I conclude with a proposal that suggests when they are successful, roasts employ mechanisms that redirect attention from the joke's content to its formal properties; it is when those mechanisms fail that roasting becomes disagreeable.","[{""name"": ""LUVELL ANDERSON"", ""affiliation"": ["" Philosophy Department  Syracuse University  Syracuse  New York  13244""]}]","[""10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee925"", ""10.1515/9783110354003"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu015"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199552221.001.0001"", ""10.1353/phl.1998.0014"", ""10.1353/book9014"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.00087"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2005.06.004"", ""10.1177/0891241615605218"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.625.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199275731.003.0008"", ""10.1016/0024-3841(92)90025-E""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Specifically, Kant’s text appears to be imbued with the following two tensions. First, there appears to be a conflict between his commitment to the view that mere sensations cannot function as vehicles for the communication of aesthetic ideas and his claim that musical tones, on account of being mere sensations, can express aesthetic ideas. Second, his description of musical form as consisting of a play of aesthetic ideas that leave behind no thoughts appears to be incongruous with his formulation of aesthetic ideas as free imaginative representations that contain a wealth of thoughts and meanings. If what it means to express aesthetic ideas is precisely to stimulate much thinking, then how can an object exist that expresses aesthetic ideas, but without leaving any thoughts behind? I attempt to resolve these two perceived tensions by proposing a distinction between reflective and non-reflective aesthetic ideas communicated by form and mere sensations respectively.","[{""name"": ""Mojca Kuplen"", ""affiliation"": [""Alfred University, NY""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511499968.007"", ""10.1353/jae.0.0019"", ""10.1080/00048400701571677"", ""10.1007/978-94-017-3234-5_7"", ""10.1093/mind/LXXXIX.353.67"", ""10.5840/swphilreview201228246"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195182637.003.0021"", ""10.1515/9783110345339-020"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-53517-7_6"", ""10.1057/9780230389076"", ""10.1515/kant.1984.75.1-4.65"", ""10.1111/jaac.12076"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.3.0251"", ""10.1353/phl.0.0023"", ""10.1111/0021-8529.00018"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac14.2.0218"", ""10.1111/jaac.12322"", ""10.1515/9783110467888-319""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The author's strategies for interpreting the huge range of content added to the website-score draw upon Schubert's suggestions, the interdisciplinary rigor advocated by Jennifer Walshe, Henri Bergson's theories of comedy and the author's own experience as a composer-performer. These strategies are devised so that, despite the hundreds of compositional contributors, in performance, the final piece is perceived as an “Alexander Schubert work.”","[{""name"": ""Zubin Kanga"", ""affiliation"": [""Royal Holloway, University of London, Music Department, Royal Holloway, Egham Hill, Egham TW20 0EX, U.K. Email: zrkanga@gmail.com.

Some highly altered or contaminated environments may occasion powerful and insightful aesthetic experiences. In this article, I discuss some arguments that have been offered in favor of the view that this mismatch is not possible when we appreciate a particular environment with full awareness of its damaged or altered condition. I show that these arguments are not conclusive and that there is room for valuable experiences of damaged or highly altered environments. Our knowledge of the damaged condition of an environment, while perceptually significant, does not necessarily make the resulting aesthetic experience to be negative. Finally, I show that these cases do not necessarily diminish the role that aesthetics can play in shaping our environmental sensibility and commitments.","[{""name"": ""María José Alcaraz León"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of Murcia , Murcia , Spain""]}]","[""10.1080/13668790500518024"", ""10.1017/S1358246111000221"", ""10.3197/096327114X13947900181112"", ""10.5840/enviroethics19846114"", ""10.1111/jaac.12586"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.005"", ""10.1086/233273"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.004"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01520.x"", ""10.1007/BF00354537"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.007"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190096342.001.0001"", ""10.3197/096327198129341500"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayq051"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511554605.003"", ""10.3197/096327196776679320"", ""10.5840/enviroethics200527141"", ""10.1111/jaac.12601"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.3.279"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199205240.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv026"", ""10.2307/3332625"", ""10.1111/jaac.12594"", ""10.1080/09502380802245829"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/37.4.393"", ""10.5840/enviroethics201234321"", ""10.2307/2026228""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1093/jaac/kpac049,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,On Resisting Art,"Abstract What responsibilities do audiences have in engaging with artworks? Certain audience responses seem quite clear: for example, audiences should not vandalize or destroy artworks; they should not disrupt performances. This paper examines other kinds of resisting responses that audiences sometimes engage in, including petitioning the artist to change their works, altering copies of artworks, and creating new artworks in another artist’s fictional world. I argue for five claims: (1) while these actions can sometimes infringe on the rights of artists, the rights of artists are not absolute; (2) the fact that such actions are based on mistaken interpretations of the artworks has no normative weight; (3) there can be reason to object to additions and alterations whose conception of the artwork is morally worse than the original (and so, there can be reason to support additions and alterations whose conception is morally better); (4) petitioning raises special moral problems; and, most important, (5) some of these actions are valuable because they involve creative and aesthetic activity. Those acts of audience resistance that are creative, morally improve on the original work, and that minimize the infringement of the artists’ rights are good, and should be encouraged.","[{""name"": ""James Harold"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Mount Holyoke College , South Hadley, MA 01075 , USA""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01389.x"", ""10.1086/292775"", ""10.1111/jaac.12021"", ""10.1111/jaac.12091"", ""10.1007/BF00354537"", ""10.1086/519226"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab078"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2008.00168.x"", ""10.5040/9781350928541"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01480.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198768692.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197519769.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350895737.0006"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226460383.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01529.x"", ""10.1023/B:PHIL.0000014533.94297.6b"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/36.3.239"", ""10.1080/24740500.2017.1287034"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197507247.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190052089.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2215115"", ""10.1002/9780470776186"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.1974.tb00353.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139165860.003"", ""10.2307/2026228""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Neuroscience']","['Law', 'Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In this discussion note, I reject Mahon’s conclusion that novels never lie. I argue that a central premiss in his argument—that novels do not contain assertions—is false. Mahon’s account underdetermines the content of literary works; novels have rich layers of content and can contain what I call ‘profound’ assertions, and ‘background’ assertions. I submit that Mahon therefore fails to establish that novels never lie.","[{""name"": ""Daisy Dixon"", ""affiliation"": [""Peterhouse, University of Cambridge , UK""]}]","[""10.1086/233273"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511605970"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz006"", ""10.1080/00048409512346581"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-5265-1_3"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac43.3.0257"", ""10.1080/00048409912349061"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195379990.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz034"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199603688.001.0001"", ""10.1086/448096"", ""10.1093/screen/24.2.2"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz008"", ""10.1111/nous.12282""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

I also show how most of the significant figures in the relevant literature address the indirect form of the question anyway—needlessly, if I am right. Finally, I consider whether some version of the indirect question is more philosophically interesting, connecting it to the so-called ‘qua problem’.

I bring these two together by analyzing the hit television series Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. According to my interpretation, the series is informative about our social world, and it raises philosophical concerns about it. This makes it well-equipped to fulfill the educative function attributed to mass art by Noël Carroll, and to stand out as an example of what he calls popular philosophy. To support this interpretation, I rely on contemporary views regarding the nature of our engagements with fictional narratives. I then explore how philosophical concerns are generated and I elaborate on the role they have in deepening one’s understanding of one’s social circumstances. I further show how the series provides innovative and independent philosophical knowledge by means specific to the medium of generic serialized fiction. The central part of my argument is an analysis of the narrative strategies which enable the informative and philosophical aspects of the series to generate the series’ educative function.","[{""name"": ""Iris Vidmar Jovanović"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia""]}]","[""10.1163/24684309-12340004"", ""10.1002/9781444317916.ch5"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2010.00200.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190496869.001.0001"", ""10.1353/phl.1994.0054"", ""10.1002/9781118322925"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu061"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199299522.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316335604"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9973.2011.01684.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190610784.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00225.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199570171.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199647019.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781444317916.ch9"", ""10.2307/3333572"", ""10.1002/9781444317916.ch10"", ""10.1525/9780520943919"", ""10.1002/9781444317916.ch15"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199330812.001.0001"", ""10.1080/10848770.2018.1438872"", ""10.4000/estetica.6695"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00226.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Law', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

These proximal modalities are thought to deliver only sensory pleasures, not the complex, world-directed perceptual states that characterize aesthetic experience. In this paper, I argue that this tradition fails to recognize the perceptual possibilities of haptic touch, which allows us to experience properties of the objects with which we make bodily contact, including their weight, shape, solidity, elasticity, and smoothness. These features, moreover, may be indicative of how well-suited an object is for its function, and in feeling them we can thus feel the positive aesthetic quality of functional beauty.","[{""name"": ""Tom Roberts"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Exeter, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2006.00439.x"", ""10.1353/cjp.2010.0000"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199964369.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09515089.2011.556610"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2008.00285.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01350_2.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190904876.001.0001"", ""10.1016/0010-0285(87)90008-9"", ""10.3758/APP.71.7.1439"", ""10.1080/00048402.2016.1263870"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00244.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716778.003.0011"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.630.x"", ""10.1080/00048402.2019.1640754"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199205240.001.0001"", ""10.1080/09672550802110827"", ""10.1080/00048402.2011.598173"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00504.x"", ""10.1080/713931200"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190089818.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00258.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01350_1.x"", ""10.1037/0003-066X.51.11.1134"", ""10.2307/2183933"", ""10.2307/2018286""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sensory Systems', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7388), ('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7302)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The results show that viewers respond predictably to most Gestalt principles and that there are nuances to note when it comes to better understanding the role of visual attention in the closure principle and competing principles. In addition, the results reveal a fundamental distinction between visual attention and visual perception. By grasping this critical difference between attention and perception, designers may become more successful in applying Gestalt principles to their design.","[{""name"": ""Xinran Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""Xinran Hu, Ernest G.

They have suggested that this poses a hitherto unacknowledged challenge to time travel theories. I argue that their conclusion depends on some unstated essentialist assumptions about metaphysics of art and the status of representations. By relaxing these assumptions, I show that Dummett and McCall’s scenarios contain no causal loop involving artistic value, and thus pose no new problem for time travel theories.","[{""name"": ""James W McAllister"", ""affiliation"": [""Universiteit Leiden""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

For example, when successful, both tend to elicit laughter, and many magicians regularly perform in comedy clubs. Nevertheless, the close relationship between magic and comedy is poorly understood. The goal of this article is to explore this relationship and to defend the thesis that magic is actually a form-arguably a limit case-of stand-up comedy. This requires first introducing definitions of both stand-up comedy and magic. The core argument then deploys one of today's best-developed philosophical theories of comic amusement to show that magic, when successful, is humorous. In this way, the article contributes to our understanding of both the emotional response to magic and the nature and scope of comedy. The article begins with an analysis of Steve Martin's 1968 TV debut on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, in which he performs a “socko-boffo comedy routine” that seamlessly integrates absurdist comedy with magic tricks.","[{""name"": ""JASON LEDDINGTON"", ""affiliation"": ["" Department of Philosophy  Bucknell University  Lewisburg  Pennsylvania  17837"", "" Centre for Philosophical Psychology  University of Antwerp  Antwerp  Belgium""]}]","[""10.1111/phc3.12240"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac57.2.0145"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780199552221.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jaac.12678"", ""10.5840/jphil20081051025"", ""10.1023/A:1008290415597"", ""10.1111/jaac.12290"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206179.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12320"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-14382-4""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In particular, an increasing number of artists work with machine learning and other adaptive systems. Through the author's own engagement with such systems, an analysis of adaptive agents is provided within the broader context of behavior aesthetics. As a result, the author proposes an aesthetic framework for understanding behaviors that accounts for the observer as an adaptive perceiving agent, the unfathomable character of machine learning systems and the morphology of behaviors as a time-based phenomenon.","[{""name"": ""Sofian Audry"", ""affiliation"": [""Sofian Audry, Ecole des medias, Université du Québec à Montréal, 405 Sainte-Catherine E., Pavillon Judith-Jasmin, 3rd floor, Room J-3295, Montréal QC H2L 2C4, Canada.

10.1093/jaac/kpab004,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Authorship and Creation,"Abstract Artworks have authors. According to Christy Mag Uidhir, this simple assumption has significant consequences for the ontology of artworks. One such consequence is that artworks cannot be identified with abstract entities: if there are works of art, they are concrete entities. Therefore, one cannot create an abstract work of art. Mag Uidhir presents a novel challenge against abstract creationism, the view that certain kinds of art objects are abstract artifacts. This article has two aims. First, it provides a defense of abstract creationism against Mag Uidhir’s arguments. Second, it argues that creation, even in the case of concrete artifacts, is never purely causal: to create an artifact is to bring about the conditions on which the created object ontologically depends. I conclude that a properly developed account of creation provides a better understanding of the question of how one comes to create an artifact, be it abstract or concrete.","[{""name"": ""Nurbay Irmak"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511487545"", ""10.1111/jaac.12431"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/44.2.113"", ""10.4324/9781315266619"", ""10.1111/jaac.12377"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.52.2.0008"", ""10.1007/BF00141341"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjps/axr011"", ""10.1111/jaac.12271"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.2.105"", ""10.1163/9789401209182_005"", ""10.1007/s10670-018-0001-0"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.52.2.0030"", ""10.1007/s10670-017-9915-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198732532.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0457-6"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.52.2.0023"", ""10.2307/2025596"", ""10.1007/s11098-017-1011-5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199665778.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199245363.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198735595.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9973.2008.00524.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayt026""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Philosophy', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1093/jaac/kpab003,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Art Criticism in the Contracted Field,"Abstract Just over a decade-and-a-half ago, a roundtable discussion published in the pages of October worried that the periodic renewal of critical discourses had slowed to a standstill and that art criticism was faced with obsolescence. Such an obsolescence should be understood in a broadly Hegelian manner: the danger is not that art criticism would disappear from the cultural field, but that it will continue—although drained of its previous necessity. Such fears perhaps run the risk of exaggeration, yet this article shall suggest that there seems a sense in which the field of art criticism has contracted in recent years. Self-reflexivity in art and the popularization of “para-curatorial” approaches, for instance, often underpin the artwork discursively before the arrival of art criticism upon the scene. To be sure, such circumstances are viewable positively as interdisciplinary dialogical opportunities, but the negative flipside here is that art criticism’s potential contribution becomes increasingly minimized. From another angle, critics such as Isabelle Graw have contended that the economic-cultural regime of post-Fordism, with its attention on intellectual labor and knowledge production, might actually hold possibilities for the contemporary art critic—but even here, I argue, art criticism becomes contracted, albeit in the other meaning of the word.","[{""name"": ""Matthew Bowman"", ""affiliation"": [""Fine Art Department, University of Suffolk, Ipswich, Suffolk, United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1002/9780470712726"", ""10.1162/016228702320218475"", ""10.1007/s10767-006-9006-9"", ""10.4324/9780203881125"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811753.010""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Two aspects of the aesthetic experience are considered: the special intensity that climaxes elicit, and the diversity of the cognitive content they generate, which can include both aesthetic and non-aesthetic properties. The climax is experienced in a state of absorption triggered by a set of strategies of temporal prolongation related to the main suspenseful moments and plotlines, to character engagement, and to the multiplot structure, involving the content of the narrative itself (narrative absorption) and the aesthetic qualities that define it (artifact absorption). The source of this absorption during the climax lies in the interplay between emotion and cognition in a temporal process that may last for a whole series. To demonstrate this idea, this study identifies key narrative comprehension processes, drawing on the explanatory potential of mental model theory to clarify the importance of memory and interrelated inferential processes. The aim of this research is to contribute to explanations of the role of the climax in serialized television and other artistic works.","[{""name"": ""Héctor J Pérez"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Audiovisual Communication, Documentation and History of Art, Campus de Gandia, Universitat Politécnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain""]}]","[""10.1111/jaac.12416"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00322.x"", ""10.5040/9781628928327.ch-001"", ""10.3758/s13423-016-1051-4"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays068"", ""10.1080/10509208.2020.1747354"", ""10.1111/jaac.12031"", ""10.1016/j.jcps.2016.06.005"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2249.2011.00327.x"", ""10.1093/mts/mtu004"", ""10.1075/lal.27.03kui"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2008.05.026"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190867133.001.0001"", ""10.1353/tae.2018.0036"", ""10.1080/02699930903498186""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Gender Studies']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)]]"

Recent discussions of aesthetic understanding have associated it with aesthetic justification and with understanding why, for example, a given object is aesthetically valuable. I introduce a notion of aesthetic understanding as a form of objectual understanding, which I refer to as ‘appreciative understanding’. Appreciative understanding is related to and partly constituted by an agent’s capacity to comprehend and experience an artwork holistically and to communicate effectively regarding its particular aesthetic character and value. I then argue for the understanding account of aesthetic judgement on which the paradigmatic form of aesthetic judgement is grounded on appreciative understanding. This argument partly consists in demonstrating how the understanding account can explain the autonomy of aesthetic judgement. In closing, I explore the potential of the understanding account to explain the structure of our appreciative practices. That is, I put forward the view that our appreciative practices are structured so as to promote appreciative understanding.","[{""name"": ""Jeremy Page"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780190860974.003.0007""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In this paper, I will argue that relying on aesthetic testimony seems problematic because we are attached to an ideal of aesthetic authenticity and feel that living up to this ideal is anathema to simply relying on aesthetic testimony.","[{""name"": ""Felix Bräuer"", ""affiliation"": [""Universität Mannheim , Germany""]}]","[""10.1017/S001221731300111X"", ""10.1007/978-3-658-29661-2_6"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/43.4.386"", ""10.1215/00318108-111-2-167"", ""10.1215/00318108-2006-010"", ""10.1007/s11098-004-7825-y"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226249605.001.0001"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577703"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511498923"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00131.x"", ""10.1086/648610"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199213306.001.0001"", ""10.1111/nous.12092"", ""10.1111/nous.12344"", ""10.1111/j.1533-6077.2007.00125.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00042.x"", ""10.5840/jphil201110838"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2012.00873.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199285891.003.0007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.615.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199573004.003.0010"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00664.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199219162.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199573004.003.0011"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199276011.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00316.x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5930.2011.00532.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv032"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/19.4.331"", ""10.5840/jphil201110837"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2004.tb00384.x"", ""10.1111/phpr.12255"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayw089"", ""10.1093/mind/fzz054"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1223-3"", ""10.1023/A:1011843723057"", ""10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175"", ""10.1093/analys/anab019"", ""10.1111/phpr.12467"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00455.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays062"", ""10.1177/0001699313498263"", ""10.2307/2183262"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190859565.013.32"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2013.12.005"", ""10.1007/s11098-013-0112-z"", ""10.11647/OBP.0083"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu099"", ""10.2307/2998423""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

It examines variations on standard criticisms of Lewis’s account, aiming to show that, if developed as Lewis suggests in his 1983 Postscript A, his proposals on the topic are—as Hanley puts it—‘as good as it gets’. Thus elaborated, Lewis’s account can resist the objections, and it offers a better picture of fictional discourse than recent resurrections of other classic works of the 1970s by Kripke, van Inwagen and Searle. The turn that Lewis suggests and the paper recommends draws on the remaining outstanding contribution from that time: Walton’s.","[{""name"": ""Manuel García-Carpintero"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198831525.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01362.x"", ""10.2307/2183752"", ""10.1080/00048402.2018.1435698"", ""10.1007/BF00166384"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayaa036"", ""10.1111/1468-0068.00358"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198735595.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00048409312345022"", ""10.2307/2219853"", ""10.1007/s11229-021-03055-1"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1093/mind/C.399.325"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv031"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2007.00215.x"", ""10.1515/9783110348552.153"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199674794.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198846376.003.0004"", ""10.1080/00048402.2016.1149736"", ""10.1111/jaac.12397"", ""10.1080/17503280.2021.1923145"", ""10.1017/S003181910001696X"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00250.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12660"", ""10.1017/9781108698283.023"", ""10.1080/17503280.2021.1923146"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab062"", ""10.4324/9781003139720-8"", ""10.1080/713659790"", ""10.1007/BF02385199"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-2506-5_27"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/64.1.93"", ""10.1093/pq/pqab014"", ""10.1515/9783110348552.13"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199928385.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00173970"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198815068.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp072"", ""10.2307/2216219"", ""10.1111/j.1755-2567.1988.tb00716.x"", ""10.2307/3685273"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/28.1.165"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195111040.003.0006"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199647019.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayx028"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2007.501.x"", ""10.1353/phl.1993.0079"", ""10.1023/A:1004239709212"", ""10.1023/A:1005341818171"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198778158.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198854128.001.0001"", ""10.1305/ndjfl/1039540770"", ""10.1007/s10992-005-9005-8"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5163.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198846376.003.0002"", ""10.1007/1-4020-2301-4_11"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199647057.003.0012"", ""10.2307/468422"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.01330.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198798347.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10988-020-09321-8"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.2003.tb00266.x"", ""10.1353/phl.1983.0059"", ""10.1007/s11229-006-0001-5"", ""10.1111/phis.12107"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv013"", ""10.1111/jaac.12341"", ""10.1111/jaac.12620"", ""10.1111/jaac.12332"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy020"", ""10.1111/phpr.12660"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-72658-8"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00367.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv053"", ""10.1007/s11098-020-01451-w"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198846376.003.0005""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Loos’s influence has been debated in the context of determining Wittgenstein’s relation to modernism, as well as in attempts to come to terms with his work as an architect. This paper looks in a different direction, examining a remark in which Wittgenstein responded to Heidegger’s notorious pronouncement that ‘the Nothing noths’ by reference to Loos’s critique of ornamentation. Wittgenstein draws a parallel between the requirement to start philosophy with an inarticulate sound and the need, in certain cultural periods, to highlight the borders of tablecloths using lace. Paying heed to Wittgenstein’s remark sheds further light on a Loosian influence at work in his thinking about modern civilization, both in his well-known ‘Lectures on Aesthetics’ and in the earlier notes from his 1930 lectures at Cambridge.","[{""name"": ""Andreas Vrahimis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-319-04199-5_29""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Heidegger’s anti-scientism leads him to an alētheic view of artworks which precedes and exceeds any possible aesthetic reduction. Wittgenstein also rejects the relevance of causal explanations, psychological or physiological, to aesthetic questions. The main aim of this paper is to compare Heidegger with Wittgenstein, showing that: (a) there are significant parallels to be drawn between Wittgenstein’s and Heidegger’s anti-scientism about aesthetics, and that (b) their anti-scientism leads both towards partly divergent criticisms of what I will call ‘aestheticism’. The divergence is mainly due to a broader metaphilosophical disagreement concerning appeals to ordinary language. Thus situating the two philosophers’ positions facilitates a possible critical dialogue between analytic and continental approaches in aesthetics.","[{""name"": ""Andreas Vrahimis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/ejop.12213"", ""10.1111/ejop.12165"", ""10.1057/9781137384287_2"", ""10.1515/9783110325522.267"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2010.00408.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv045""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

These forms of musical badness, however, are not primarily compositional deficits, but either (a) that the performer simply cannot competently deliver the music to their audience, inducing laughter, or (b) that the performer exhibits some form of disrespect, provoking anger. Such laughter or anger stems from failure of the expected relationship between a performer and their audience, that is, a social failure. After surveying a range of musical faults, the article examines the causes of laughter in general and in relation to some of examples of risible “bad” music. Similarly, the causes of social and moral anger in general are examined, and several cases of anger-inducing musical performances are presented. The article concludes with a consideration of the broader implications of these responses to “bad” music for theories of emotional expression in music, the relationship between aesthetic and moral judgments, and the centrality of musical performances as opposed to works in discussions of musical expression and value.","[{""name"": ""Justin London"", ""affiliation"": [""Music, Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, USA""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203938133"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2008.00230.x"", ""10.1017/S1752196314000364"", ""10.1002/9780470774922"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz012"", ""10.1093/0199241589.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/19.4.302"", ""10.1002/0470013494.ch3"", ""10.4324/9780203309049_chapter_1"", ""10.7591/9781501727306"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2006.00219.x"", ""10.1016/j.actpsy.2015.12.005"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195114713.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195309799.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199583560.003.0012"", ""10.3758/s13428-017-0892-8"", ""10.2307/764150"", ""10.4324/9780203309049_chapter_6"", ""10.1111/spc3.12383""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Music', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

I present two problems for this view. First, I provide reason to deny that these sentences are abbreviations. In short, these sentences have aesthetic properties that we should not expect of abbreviations. Second, I argue that the apparent truth of these sentences would not be explained even if they were abbreviations. An alternative is presented that avoids these problems.

10.1093/aesthj/ayad007,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Towards an Aesthetics of Archery,"Abstract This article discusses the relationship between archery and aesthetics, developing two central claims. First, in order to deliver successful results, the archer should attend not only to efficiency, technique and equipment tuning but also to the aesthetic experience; second, archery shooting methods embody and express ‘life-issue’ statements and desires concerning our relationship with the world. Depending on the archer’s shooting style, i.e., depending on the way in which a shot is executed and performed, the archer’s ‘sportive philosophy’ is, so to speak, unfolded and made apparent. Specifically, I will argue that instinctive archery strives for flexibility and versatility toward the environment and with respect to one’s own body, whereas non-instinctive approaches sharpen effectuality and results by flattening the surroundings and limiting one’s own performative freedom. Exploring this idea, I will discuss the aesthetic underpinnings of archery, also showing in which ways different shooting methods lay the ground for irreducible aesthetic experiences of self-expression.","[{""name"": ""Enea Bianchi"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Galway , Ireland""]}]","[""10.1080/00071005.1990.9973844"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/14.3.197"", ""10.2307/3332478"", ""10.1515/9781474443418"", ""10.1080/00948705.1988.9714459"", ""10.1080/00948705.2003.9714639"", ""10.1080/00948705.2012.725903"", ""10.1080/00948705.2012.725901"", ""10.14712/23366052.2016.12"", ""10.1080/00948705.2012.725898"", ""10.1080/17511321.2015.1048821"", ""10.1080/00948705.1974.10654082"", ""10.1080/00948705.1975.10654100"", ""10.1080/17511321.2013.873072"", ""10.1080/00071005.1970.9973287"", ""10.2307/25528380"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-8805-7"", ""10.1080/00948705.1974.10654084"", ""10.15373/2249555X/JAN2014/175"", ""10.2307/3332634"", ""10.1080/00948705.2003.9714562""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In foregrounding precolonial calculation tools as the basis for a new data visualization method, they present questions about how scientists might negotiate multiple interrelated variables in their research, opening more possibilities for narrating complex causes and effects of anthropogenic climate change and facilitating discussions about the relationship between climate change and settler-colonialism through visual means. While data science has historically prioritized Cartesian and Euclidean geometry as the most efficient tools for data visualization, the authors draw on Indigenous calculation tools that allow for more visual and semantic flexibility than the x-y axis.","[{""name"": ""Katie Anania"", ""affiliation"": [""Katie Anania, School of Art, Art History & Design, and University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68588, U.S.A.

Yet the diary is a form of writing that relinquishes authorial control to the passing moods and contingencies of the day. The diarist writes hastily, automatically, involuntarily, thereby giving access to insights unavailable to deliberation. An account of Roland Barthes's Mourning Diary, 2009, and his reflections on the diary as a form of writing serve to introduce the diaristic work of two contemporary artists, Moyra Davey and Susan Morris. Their work is directly informed by Barthes's and others' experiments with a mode of address that is intimate, but also de‐centred and fragmentary.","[{""name"": ""Margaret Iversen"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

We label these: Documentation, Disruption, Recognition, Participation, Imagination, and Beauty. Each has a compelling tradition of theory and application, augmented, extended, and sometimes challenged by the thirteen fresh and provocative contributions in the special issue. Yet, we ask, if both politically minded artists and culturally minded activists are convinced of the power of art to provoke social change, and if we live a world that by almost all measures is now saturated with politically inclined, aesthetically informed practices, interfaces, objects, and texts, why does art not seem to be making a difference? Clearly, we need to think harder about the relationships between art and action, a task the articles assembled here call upon us to take seriously.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Holm"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Humanities, Media, and Creative Communication, Massey University , Wellington , New Zealand""]}, {""name"": ""Elspeth Tilley"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Humanities, Media, and Creative Communication, Massey University , Wellington , New Zealand""]}]","[""10.1093/jaac/kpad002"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad001"", ""10.1080/14742837.2012.708922"", ""10.1016/j.biopsycho.2015.01.008"", ""10.3402/egp.v7.23231"", ""10.1177/1354856514541353"", ""10.4337/9781781957240.00021"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad007"", ""10.1080/15299732.2014.867571"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad004"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0233378"", ""10.1353/bhb.2016.0011"", ""10.1215/01610775-3710429"", ""10.1080/00393541.2013.11518910"", ""10.1111/j.1475-5661.2009.00354.x"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad003"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad005"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad014"", ""10.1353/nlh.2021.0004"", ""10.1080/0950236X.2021.1971747"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac52.1.0099"", ""10.1215/08992363-4189143"", ""10.1080/00131946.2015.1075989"", ""10.1177/1468796819833871"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad012"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad013"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac54.3.0281"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226002422.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-89078-0_15"", ""10.7312/mill20142"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad009"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad010"", ""10.5040/9780755695201"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad008"", ""10.1111/jade.12290"", ""10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.03.010"", ""10.1515/9781400847358"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayab018"", ""10.1037/aca0000247"", ""10.1057/9780230242425"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad006""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Although not directly aimed at acquiring knowledge, this process often leads to an enhanced understanding or improved epistemic grasp of the object of appreciation itself and the world. On this conception, aesthetic value acts as an invitation to engage in a series of contemplative and reflective processes during which we rely not only on the perceptual, imaginative, and affective abilities which have occupied such a central role in aesthetic theory, but also on our capacities for sense-making, problem-solving and theory-building. Cases of intelligible beauty or aesthetic value should thus lie at the heart of accounts of aesthetic experience.","[{""name"": ""Elisabeth Schellekens"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden""]}]","[""10.5040/9781350928565"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-01342-5_2"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139225281"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199573011.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac53.4.0393"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.00048"", ""10.1353/phl.2020.0000"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192858016.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001"", ""10.2478/disp-2021-0014"", ""10.1080/00048409512346541"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198859482.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.12063"", ""10.5840/philtopics19972518"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2006.00211.x"", ""10.1111/phpr.12641"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199299522.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00144.x"", ""10.5040/9781350928541"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/35.1.26"", ""10.1093/aesthj/aym039"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.4.0331"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804656"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays003"", ""10.5040/9781350289543"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/32.4.295"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.00070"", ""10.1111/jaac.12170"", ""10.1017/epi.2016.4"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2004.tb00384.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195140248.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190052089.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.3.279"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198717959.001.0001"", ""10.2307/jj.18254729.9"", ""10.1080/00048409512346551"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199278350.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2182490"", ""10.2307/2183262"", ""10.4324/9781315112640-2"", ""10.1093/arisup/akac003"", ""10.2478/disp-2021-0014"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy044"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/32.3.191"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/59.1.215"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpac053"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2012.01429.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199261871.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Though clearly related to the black‐and‐white paintings that propelled Riley to international fame in the 1960s, these new works represented a notable change in the artist's methods, combining an intuitive arrangement of colour with a simple compositional motif: the stripe. While determinedly abstract, the imaginative origins of Riley's stripe paintings are registered in many of the titles that they carry: Ka (1980); Ra (1981); Luxor (1982); Winter Palace (1981). This essay reconsiders the making, display and reception of Riley's so‐called ‘Egyptian palette’ within a longer history of encounter and exchange between Britain and Egypt, ranging across more than a century of military occupation and resistance, Cold War entrenchment, and neoliberal diplomacy. In doing so, it situates Riley's work between colonial and post‐colonial ways of seeing.","[{""name"": ""Richard Johns"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Archeology', 'History', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

Este artículo explora la flor que corona este cactus (de diez pulgadas de ancho) y las numerosas variantes de este motivo exhibidas en 64 textiles wari. Las representaciones artísticas de la flor corresponden estrechamente con sus partes botánicas, su botón (que contiene ovario/óvulo/semillas) más su punta central vertical (estilo, estigma) flanqueada por tallos con puntas (filamentos, anteras). La revelación de estos componentes interiores evoca de forma abstracta la flor en plena floración. Este motivo es asignado a partes del portador de báculo (renombrado ser en transformación), incluyendo el elemento ocular y las emanaciones auditivas y de vocalización. Así, transmiten la experiencia de trance multisensorial del ser en transformación catalizada por la ingesta de chicha de san Pedro. Las imágenes del cactus son emparejadas sistemáticamente, e incluso fusionados, con motivos de la flor y las hojas de la vilca, a los que añado la corteza del árbol dentada. Este emparejamiento de las dos plantas sagradas proclama un poder visionario específico de las tierras altas y sugiere que estas plantas fueron consumidas ritualmente de manera simultánea, incluso mezclándolas.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca R.

I propose a particular kind of definition, a disjunctive definition, which comprises extant theories of art. I co-opt arguments from the philosophy of science, likening the concept ‘art’ to the concept ‘species’, to argue that we ought to be theoretical pluralists about art. That is, there are a number of legitimate, perhaps incompatible, criteria for a theory of art. In this paper, I consider three: functionalist definitions, procedural definitions, and an intentional-historical definition. The motivation for this pluralism comes from an analysis of practice, because the term is of apparent value to practitioners. However, a closer analysis of the concept reveals that, while disjunctive definitions help us to understand how we use certain terms (in other words, their pragmatic value), they lack ontological import. In sum, I attempt to glean lessons from the philosophy of science about the philosophy of art. If my analysis is correct, we ought to be eliminative pluralists about art as a concept.","[{""name"": ""Caleb Hazelwood"", ""affiliation"": [""Duke University""]}]","[""10.1128/AEM.00298-09"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01345.x"", ""10.2307/3332789"", ""10.1111/jaac.12222"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9999-z"", ""10.1086/392628"", ""10.1093/mind/LXVII.267.317"", ""10.1086/289182"", ""10.5840/jphil200810531"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199591558.001.0001"", ""10.1007/BF00127698"", ""10.1016/S0168-6445(00)00040-1"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2005.00202.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9973.2010.01678.x"", ""10.2307/1219444"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00246.x"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac15.1.0027"", ""10.1111/jaac.12218""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Around 1910, Roger Fry drew on histories of world art and international art historiography to cast post‐impressionism as putatively universal, a style that was not just a new development, but was a rediscovery of a natural form of artistic creation. Seen this way, post‐impressionism also had the potential to go global: to have a causal role in the development of multiple international modernisms following its spatial circulation across the globe. The essay goes on to explore first how even within Britain local variations and divisions quickly came to undercut this specifically British articulation of a universal style. It then turns to aspects of post‐impressionism's subsequent circulations in India, Nigeria, Japan, and China to examine further how its putative universalism was transformed in a variety of locally specific ways.","[{""name"": ""Sam Rose"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

The authors formulate the generation of PMA as an adaptive dual-to-single image translation problem. The authors’ proposed model analyzes the appearance of one portrait and one map image using two encoder networks and utilizes their hidden encodings as representations of the portrait and map image to generate new PMA using a decoder network. An adaptive style harmonization module is proposed to fuse the two hidden encodings. Optimized by cycle-consistency constraint, the model can produce new PMA images without baselines.","[{""name"": ""Yuxin Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Yuxin Zhang, NLPR, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science and School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China.

We examine one recent attempt, which holds that the correct account of art must recognize the plurality of concepts of art. However, we criticize this account of concept pluralism as being unable to offer an explanation of why some concept is an art concept. Instead, many of the disagreements over the definition of art could be reconciled by recognizing that works of art can be valued in a plurality of ways.

The arguments brought forth by Sidney Geist and Dario Gamboni illustrate the pitfalls and controversy of subjective visual analysis and how a perceptual phenomenon can mislead our conclusions.

On my account, snobs sincerely attempt to identify and correctly evaluate the aesthetically relevant features of an object, but they get things wrong, and their getting things wrong is explained by the fact that they under-value that which they associate with being lower-class. We can see the need for this account by reflecting on examples, and can distinguish it from existing accounts of snobbery by thinking about when and why evidence of snobbery constitutes higher-order evidence against one’s aesthetic judgements. Existing accounts either are consistent with snobs’ aesthetic judgements being flawless, and thus not undermined by evidence of snobbery, or they imply that the canonical reasoning-process for arriving at aesthetic judgements has been bypassed altogether. On my account, by contrast, snobbery does not bypass the canonical aesthetic reasoning-process but distorts it in systematic and predictable ways.","[{""name"": ""Zoë A Johnson King"", ""affiliation"": [""Harvard University , USA""]}]","[""10.1093/bjaesthetics/38.2.150"", ""10.1086/233321"", ""10.1111/phis.12137"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac53.4.0379"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.005"", ""10.1215/00318108-2006-035"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001"", ""10.1111/nous.12344"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.615.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayr005"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy024"", ""10.1353/phl.1997.0010"", ""10.1002/9781118869109.ch36"", ""10.1215/00318108-112-4-447"", ""10.1215/00318108-114-4-497"", ""10.2307/2182490"", ""10.2307/2183262"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/48.1.1"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayi016"", ""10.1111/1468-0068.36.s16.10"", ""10.5840/philtopics20184616"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00051""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1111/1467-8365.12681,ART HISTORY,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,"On Islam and Portraiture: Lithography, Glass Painting, and Photography in Senegal","Scholars have for decades challenged the popular belief that Islam is intrinsically and implacably hostile to anthropomorphic art. Rooted in this literature, this essay argues that Islam was responsible for popularizing portraiture in Senegal, which previously featured none. With the founding of local Sufi brotherhoods such as the Mouridiyya in the 1880s, the eminence of religious leaders led to an unprecedented demand for their portraits. Glass painting became the privileged medium for reproducing images that appeared in other media, such as lithographs or photographs. Inspired by the respect for Muslim saints inherent in Sufi practices, the widespread desire to display portraits in one's home and for one's personal devotional practices made this genre indispensable. Rather than concentrating on any one medium, this essay focuses on the theoretical and formal interaction among chromolithographs, photographs, and glass paintings, and the migration of images across the three between the 1910s and the 1950s.","[{""name"": ""Giulia Paoletti"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Anthropology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

The authors suggest this arises from an overly instrumental view of STEM. While STEAM has arisen as a pushback paradigm, the application of STEAM in schools is challenging, and educators are often unclear about connecting STEM and the arts. The authors suggest envisioning STEAM through natural disciplinary interconnections. They focus on the integration of language arts and figurative thinking to blur the boundaries of STEM and the arts, and offer examples of figurative language—such as metaphor, linguistic etymology and synecdoche—for framing STEM teaching and learning.","[{""name"": ""Danah Henriksen"", ""affiliation"": [""Danah Henriksen (educator, researcher, educational psychologist), Division of Educational Leadership & Innovation, Arizona State University, P.O.

10.1162/leon_a_02400,LEONARDO,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,Novelty and Utility: How the Arts May Advance Question Creation in Contemporary Research,"Abstract This paper builds on research around novelty and utility to argue that the value of arts thinking should be applied in the generation of scientific questions. Arts thinking is often playful, less goal oriented, and can lead to new modes of questioning. Scientific thinking often solves an existing question, serves a purpose in solving the question, and must be predictable. The “problem of the problem” is that asking creative questions is the linchpin of the quality of research across the sciences, just as the best of art “does things” that make us move and feel moved; yet we posit that it is useful to consider that what each teaches and celebrates typically tends more toward either utility or novelty as an entry point. A new theoretical basis is presented in identifying questions primarily based on novelty rather than utility, and a catalogue of methods proposed for creating questions to employ in education, practice, and project planning.","[{""name"": ""Johannes Lehmann"", ""affiliation"": [""Johannes Lehmann, School of Integrative Plant Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.

10.33134/eeja.211,ESTETIKA-THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Non-standard Emotions and Aesthetic Understanding,"Winner of the Fabian Dorsch ESA Essay Prize.For cognitivist accounts of aesthetic appreciation, appreciation requires an agent (1) to perceptually respond to the relevant aesthetic features of an object o on good evidential grounds, (2) to have an autonomous grasp of the reasons that make the claim about the aesthetic features of o true by pointing out the connection between non-aesthetic features and the aesthetic features of o, (3) to be able to provide an explanation of why those features contribute to the overall aesthetic value of o. In this framework, aesthetic emotions have traditionally been confined to the level of aesthetic perception (1) and dismissed from the process of reason-giving (2, 3). I argue that this dismissal is due, firstly, to a questionable perceptual reading of the connection between emotional experience and value, and, secondly, to a narrow focus on the basic emotions. My argument will reveal that the non-standard or ‘intellectual’ emotions, the emotions which are in fact most important to appreciation, can play a significant epistemic role in our appreciative practices. They can do this because they (a) help us to deliberately focus our attention and (b) place the appreciator in a state of second-order awareness of their mental states. I conclude the paper by showing how these two epistemic tools (a, b) can help the appreciator to meet the explanatory/justificatory conditions (2) and (3).","[{""name"": ""Irene Martínez Marín"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5406/jaesteduc.50.4.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195111040.003.0013"", ""10.2307/429992"", ""10.1177/0959354319853632"", ""10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00042.x"", ""10.5840/faithphil201128119"", ""10.1177/1754073909103593"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0003"", ""10.1017/S135824611800067X"", ""10.1037/0033-295X.84.3.231"", ""10.1017/epi.2015.59"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayj020"", ""10.1093/0198238991.003.0003""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Philosophy', 'Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In short, they assume that, according to our modal talk and intuitions, musical works are modally flexible entities; since types are modally inflexible entities, musical works are not types. I argue that Rohrbaugh’s and Hazlett’s arguments fail and that the type/token theorist can preserve the truth of our modal claims and intuitions even if types are modally inflexible entities. First, I consider two alternatives for the type/token theorist proposed in recent literature about the topic: the created types’ solution and the created abstract objects’ solution. I argue that none of them is attractive for the type/token theorist because they do not preserve the theoretical advantages of type/token theories to explain musical works’ repeatable nature. Then, I focus on the arguments’ common premise that musical works are modally flexible entities. A deeper analysis of musical practice will show that this premise is not true: our modal claims do not imply that musical works could have had different intrinsic but, instead, extrinsic properties. Finally, I show how the nested types theory may offer a satisfactory explanation of this fact and how it captures the truth of our modal talk about musical works.","[{""name"": ""Nemesio García-Carril Puy"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department, University of Murcia , Murcia 30003 , Spain""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780199241576.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays068"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00173.x"", ""10.1007/BF00367469"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1207-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511620188"", ""10.1007/s10670-007-9073-y"", ""10.1007/BF00413498"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198250470.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2025596"", ""10.1007/BF00354100"", ""10.1111/jaac.12651"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199243778.001.0001"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00182"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayt026""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

With this larger question in mind, I will consider: (1) the issues in musical aesthetics that led to what Kivy termed his enhanced formalism, (2) his conception of expressive properties in music and how a distinction between having and understanding an emotion can help clarify this issues here (that is, where what we gain in human understanding from having had the emotion is not contained within the experience of that emotion itself), and, most importantly for Kivy’s larger mystery, (3) the way that counterpoint, in an often unrecognized way, can present mimetic content of a kind that can explain the sense of musical profundity that it often awakens. It may turn out that absolute music’s profundity can be explained by the resonances this kind of layered and complex music has with the living, the ordering, the making sense, of a life.","[{""name"": ""Garry L Hagberg"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy, Bard College, Annandale-On-Hudson, New York, NY, USA""]}]","[""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.4.343"", ""10.5840/harvardreview2014213"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190669447.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199347773.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199263655.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Music', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In Section II, I classify accounts of photography as either single-stage or multi-stage. In Section III, I analyze the historical basis for single-stage accounts. In Section IV, I explain why the single-stage view led scientists to postulate “latent” photographic images as a technical phenomenon in early chemical photography. In Section V, I discredit the notion of an invisible latent image in chemical photography and, in Section VI, extend this objection to the legacy of the latent image in digital photography. In Section VII, I appeal to the dependency relation to explain why the notion of a latent image makes the single-stage account untenable. Finally, I use the multi-stage account to advance debate about “new” versus “orthodox” theories of photography.","[{""name"": ""Dawn M Wilson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Languages and Philosophy, University of Hull, Hull, Yorkshire, UK""]}]","[""10.1111/jaac.12404"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00193.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12662"", ""10.4324/9781315211169"", ""10.1002/9781119053194"", ""10.1111/jaac.12654"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01496.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp036"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00182"", ""10.1111/jaac.12649"", ""10.1080/00223638.1996.11737656""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'History', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

10.1215/00666637-8866680,ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory; 0303 Sociology,Iconographic Volatility in the Fuxi-Nuwa Triads of the Han Dynasty,"Abstract Over the span of some two hundred years, from the late Western Han to the late Eastern Han, triad images featuring a prominent central being flanked by two smaller, snake-bodied figures, occurred on murals and carved stones in Henan, Shandong, and adjacent areas. The iconographic schema of the flanking figures, Nüwa and Fuxi, appears mature and stable, with their identities consistently determined by their half-human, half-serpent, and gendered bodies as well as by the divine objects they hold—sun and moon, compass and T square, numinous mushrooms. The iconography of the third being, however, appears far less consistent and somewhat elusive, yielding many different identifications by scholars. The seemingly anomalous pictorial program speaks to the issue of iconographic volatility in Han art. Looking across the corpus of triad images, this essay identifies the volatile third being as the Grand One, and proposes that its figural metamorphoses were predicated on the amorphousness of the supreme deity of Daoist cosmogony. Distilling the three most important formal aspects of the Grand One—a therianthropic being, a forceful facilitator, and a regal icon—this essay argues that the triad images embodied a coherent program depicting the cosmogonic origin of the world that began with the Grand One conjugating yin and yang, associated with Nüwa and Fuxi respectively. The emergence of this triad imagery coincided with evolving Daoist thought during the Han dynasty.","[{""name"": ""Yanlong Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/02549948.1958.11730971"", ""10.2307/3250440"", ""10.1080/02549948.2015.1106833"", ""10.1017/S0362502800005460"", ""10.2307/3249974""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

We are surprised, curious, and baffled when we cannot explain how the magic we are witnessing is possible. We generally understand the events to be illusions. But how is it possible to be moved by something we know to be unreal? This problem is related to the paradox of fiction in aesthetics. Here, we introduce the problem in the domain of theatrical magic, discuss possible solutions, and present a tentative account that allows us to accommodate inconsistent, seemingly incompatible beliefs at different representational levels in the viewers’ mind.","[{""name"": ""Pablo R Grassi"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tübingen, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Max-Plank Institute for Biological Cybernetics , Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Vincent Plikat"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tübingen, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Max-Plank Institute for Biological Cybernetics , Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Hong Yu Wong"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tübingen, Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Max-Plank Institute for Biological Cybernetics , Germany""]}]","[""10.1037/11164-000"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198850670.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8516.003.0021"", ""10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11227.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

I start by illustrating how reflection on cases involving higher-order evidence engages with well-established concerns in aesthetics—specifically, how it might reveal tensions within and between widely recognized aesthetic ideals governing aesthetic judgement. Next, I show how attention to higher-order evidence in relation to aesthetic judgement might expose limitations or assumptions of theories in epistemology, where the nature and significance of higher-order evidence with respect to belief is the focus of much recent attention. The aim is not to resolve the issues but to demonstrate the significance of higher-order evidence in aesthetics and, in doing so, encourage work on the topic in and across aesthetics and epistemology.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Whiting"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Southampton , UK""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00631.x"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/36.3.223"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00366.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199698370.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-43893-1_9"", ""10.1086/233371"", ""10.1111/papq.12155"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0005"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01520.x"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2005.00055.x"", ""10.1111/phpe.12026"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9753-y"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198249856.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp052"", ""10.5840/jphil201811538"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-0085-3"", ""10.5840/monist198366214"", ""10.1007/978-1-137-33475-6_3"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayq051"", ""10.2307/432348"", ""10.1057/9780230294899_9"", ""10.5840/jphil2005102933"", ""10.1086/671402"", ""10.1111/nous.12344"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00134"", ""10.5840/jphil201110838"", ""10.1111/nous.12026"", ""10.1002/tht3.193"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199285891.003.0007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.615.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691517.003.0003"", ""10.1111/papq.12225"", ""10.4324/9780429325328"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2008.00325.x"", ""10.1111/phpr.12090"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198714590.003.0004"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv032"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198847205.003.0006"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2016.1192484"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayl019"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198810322.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2004.tb00384.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays060"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayw089"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy043"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy024"", ""10.1086/381694"", ""10.1017/S1358246114000265"", ""10.1111/ejop.12007"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192862952.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00391.x"", ""10.1111/nous.12006"", ""10.1007/s11098-011-9718-1"", ""10.1086/664753"", ""10.1111/papq.12089"", ""10.1093/0198238991.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198829775.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jaac.12580"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz053"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9572-6"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.51.3.0058"", ""10.1093/aesthj/44.3.277"", ""10.1111/rati.12324"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.2012.01429.x"", ""10.1093/analys/67.3.223"", ""10.1086/664749"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy010"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu099"", ""10.1111/nous.12138"", ""10.1093/analys/anaa056"", ""10.1093/pq/pqaa045"", ""10.1111/phpr.12246""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

I move beyond this method by thinking about how such self‐aware paintings could likewise thematize the potential fictiveness of visual experience. In so doing, I examine scientific medicine prevalent in Caravaggio's age to explain the ambiguities, dislocations, and shifting identities raised in part by a reading of the canvas's self‐reflexivity and to shed light on its sensual power. I argue that this painting shows Narcissus's own narcotic‐induced hallucination and could have cued a similar response in the painting's early modern beholders. The Narcissus both portrays a physical and emotional malaise and functioned as an instrument for alleviating it in the observer, first through an amplification of symptoms and then by opening a speculative route.","[{""name"": ""Susanna Berger"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

They experimented with textile technologies and construction methods to design, fabricate and analyze three-dimensional dynamic materiality in electronic textiles (e-textiles). The focus was on sensor structures achieved by knitting, weaving, pleating and coating techniques. The analysis of measurements of electrical resistance between one and 36 sensing areas per sample demonstrate the added value of folds integrated into textile sensor structures. The authors discuss types of folding and their aesthetic, textural and sensorial advantages.

Jesse Prinz has recently proposed a reductionistic version of sentimentalist aesthetics, suggesting that it is the discrete feeling of wonder that makes an experience aesthetic. In this contribution, we draw on Prinz’s proposal in order to outline a novel version of a sentimentalist theory. Contrasting Prinz’s focus on a single emotion, we argue that an aesthetic experience is rudimentarily composed of a plurality of emotions. We acknowledge and discuss significant problems that follow from such a theory, arguing that a pluralist version of sentimentalism is nonetheless the soundest position within sentimentalist aesthetics.","[{""name"": ""Rasmus Rosenberg Larsen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Sackris"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-1-4020-5265-1_7"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0008""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sensory Systems', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7388), ('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7302)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Mondrian rarely ventured into architectural design, and his unique interior design of “Salon de Madame B … à Dresden” was not executed. The authors discuss physical constraints and perceptual factors that conflict with neoplastic ideals. Using physical and virtual models of the salon, the authors demonstrate challenges with perspective projections and show how such distortions could be minimized in a cylinder. The paradoxical percept elicited by a “reverspective” Mondrian-like space further highlights the essential role of perceptual processes in reaching neoplastic standards of beauty.","[{""name"": ""Jasmina Stevanov"", ""affiliation"": [""(researcher), Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London, U.K. Email: Jasmina.Stevanov@rhul.ac.uk."", ""JASMINA STEVANOV, trained as a painter and an experimental psychologist, completed her doctoral training under supervision of Akiyoshi Kitaoka, the world-renowned researcher of visual illusions.

10.1093/aesthj/ayac048,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Environmental Virtue Aesthetics,"AbstractHow should we characterize the interaction between moral and aesthetic values in the context of environmental aesthetics? This question is important given the urgency of many environmental problems and the particular role played by aesthetic value in our experience of environment. To address this question, we develop a model of Environmental Virtue Aesthetics (EVA) that, we argue, offers a promising alternative to current theories in environmental aesthetics with respect to the relationship between aesthetics and ethics. EVA counters environmental aesthetic theories that focus more narrowly on scientific knowledge and ground aesthetic value in ways that obfuscate pluralistic modes of appreciation of and relationships with natural and semi-natural environments. To develop EVA, we work with a revised notion of respect and engage with ideas concerning the development of aesthetic sensibilities, care, and virtuous aesthetic appreciation. EVA has the potential to support forms of human-nature co-flourishing, as well as constituting an aesthetic grounding for ecological citizenship.","[{""name"": ""Nicole Hall"", ""affiliation"": [""Texas A&M University , USA""]}, {""name"": ""Emily Brady"", ""affiliation"": [""Texas A&M University , USA""]}]","[""10.1515/9781474465380"", ""10.3197/096327121X16141642287683"", ""10.5840/pcw20018224"", ""10.5840/enviroethics200123135"", ""10.1163/156853502760184595"", ""10.3197/096327110X519844"", ""10.1111/jaac.12586"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199290345.001.0001"", ""10.1086/292054"", ""10.1080/00455091.1992.10717273"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac55.4.0355"", ""10.3197/096327108X303828"", ""10.1177/096327199200100307"", ""10.1093/aesthj/aym022"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9752.1990.tb00233.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511554605.003"", ""10.3197/096327196776679320"", ""10.1007/978-94-007-2825-7_1"", ""10.1111/1467-9833.00164"", ""10.1111/jaac.12598"", ""10.5840/monist19927527"", ""10.4324/9780203495452"", ""10.5040/9781472545374"", ""10.1111/jaac.12593"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199278350.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350134225"", ""10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee090"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/37.4.393"", ""10.5840/enviroethics201234321"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198789956.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jaac.12599"", ""10.3167/ares.2018.090109""]","['Environmental Science', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Geography, Planning and Development', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

This article offers a critical reading of Iyer’s much-cited theory on rhythmic enaction. We locate the sonic environment approach in Iyer’s theory, and criticize him for advancing a one-to-one relationship between everyday perception and full-fledged aural competence of jazz musicians, and for comparing the latter with non-symbolic behaviour of non-human organisms. As an alternative, we suggest a Merleau-Ponty-inspired concept of rhythmic enaction, which we call the enactive communicative approach. Key to this approach is the fact that jazz musicians play by ear, and that the beat emerges because of reciprocal, real-time aural communication. From this perspective, we outline the temporality of a jazz beat as a holistic and dialectical temporal structure. Throughout the discussions, we use John Coltrane’s ‘Trane’s Slo Blues’ as a point of reference.","[{""name"": ""Mattias Solli"", ""affiliation"": [""Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway""]}, {""name"": ""Thomas Netland"", ""affiliation"": [""Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511518317"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226044521.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315857671"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262019958.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11097-007-9076-9"", ""10.1007/s11097-005-9002-y"", ""10.1007/s11245-008-9042-3"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198786849.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11097-009-9136-4"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794325.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198846345.001.0001"", ""10.2466/pms.1958.8.3.87"", ""10.1007/s11097-021-09748-9"", ""10.1525/mp.2002.19.3.387"", ""10.2307/j.ctv513dpm"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01548"", ""10.1080/03007760600670372"", ""10.7551/mitpress/2004.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1029864915593333"", ""10.2307/j.ctv43vs1w"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6730.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11245-017-9484-6"", ""10.1023/A:1020368120174"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6541.001.0001"", ""10.1353/hph.2006.0075""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

We see testimonial injustice in how courts and police do not give credibility to drill artists’ testimonies about the storylike nature of their songs, and these credibility deficits are based in racist stereotypes about black criminality and believability. We see contributory injustice in how courts and police, through wilful ignorance, see drill music as violent and criminal rather than expressive and fictional – as drill artists do – which thwarts drill artists’ ability to contribute to shared knowledge.","[{""name"": ""Tareeq Omar Jalloh"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Sheffield , UK""]}]","[""10.1080/02691728.2011.652211"", ""10.1177/0038026119842480"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjc/azz086""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Les différences d’interprétation entre, d’une part, André Levinson, célèbre critique de danse parisien, historien, Russe émigré en France, et, d’autre part, Federico de Onís, philosophe espagnol, lui aussi expatrié, qui créa le département de littérature espagnole à la Columbia University, viennent éclairer l’idée du « classique » et la façon dont celle-ci put être utilisée pour caractériser l’art de La Argentina, bien qu’il fût infléchi par les notions de modernisme et de danse folklorique. Au moment où Levinson écrivait sur La Argentina, il produisait le concept du ballet néo-classique fondé sur ses principes techniques historiques. Ce faisant, il développait un modèle esthétique général du classicisme dans le mouvement qu’incarnait pour lui un corps se dilatant vers l’extérieur, lancé dans l’espace selon des trajectoires multidirectionnelles. Il considérait en revanche que la danse espagnole était « orientale » puisque ses mouvements étaient concentriques. Cet article analyse les stratégies rhétoriques employées par Levinson pour appréhender la danseuse espagnole comme l’autre du « classique » ainsi défini, tout en affirmant qu’elle parvient à une expression classique de l’identité nationale espagnole du fait même de cette altérité. Federico de Onís, quoiqu’il n’eût pas l’habitude d’écrire sur la danse, affirmait au contraire que le nationalisme de La Argentina lui était très personnel, fondamentalement gestuel et rythmique. Il proposa donc une notion du nationalisme de la danse espagnole fondée sur l’individualité plutôt que sur la théorie d’une forme esthétique.","[{""name"": ""Mark Franko"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Archeology'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)]]"

An analysis of the new Christian Art Gallery and its objects that date from the eighth through the twentieth century illuminates the ways in which the ACM engages with global art histories in a permanent gallery and not only through special exhibitions. This essay begins with a history of the ACM and its transition from a museum for the “ancestral cultures of Singapore” to one with a new mission focusing on multicultural Singapore and its connections to the wider world. Hence, taking a thematic approach, the ACM's new galleries question how museums generally display objects along national lines or regional boundaries. This essay also brings attention to the multiple mediums and functions of Christian art from both the geographical locations that usually are associated with Asian art and also from cultures that are rarely taught or exhibited, such as Timor-Leste, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. While showcasing the different moments that Christianity came to Asia, the museum also emphasizes the agencies of Asian artistic practitioners in those global encounters. Although appreciative of the ways in which the ACM's Christian Art Gallery reveal the various tensions within global art histories and break down hegemonic constructions of Christian art from Asia, this essay also offers a critique. Highlighting this unusual engagement with Christian art by an Asian art museum, the new gallery reveals that museums and exhibitions can add to the conversations on global art histories.","[{""name"": ""Sujatha Arundathi Meegama"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1142/9789812791283_0007"", ""10.1017/S1479591409000023"", ""10.5092/jhna.2013.5.2.16"", ""10.1080/13527250500160484"", ""10.1111/cura.12230"", ""10.1093/jhc/fhw019"", ""10.1525/california/9780520286061.003.0004"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1qnw8bs.11"", ""10.1111/muan.12003"", ""10.1179/1468273713Z.00000000060""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

In this article, I argue that its evolutionary origins are intrinsically intertwined with the incremental anatomical, cognitive, social, and technological evolution of the hominin lineage. I propose an account of the evolution of Plio-Pleistocene hominins, focusing on traits that would be later implicated in music making. Such traits can be conceived as comprising the musicality mosaic or the multifaceted foundations of musicality. I then articulate and defend an account of protomusical behaviour, drawing theoretical licence from the social brain framework of Robin Dunbar and colleagues, as well as the evolutionary framework for human culture and cooperation developed by Kim Sterelny. The role of gene-culture co-evolution and niche construction is brought to the fore in articulating the evolutionary account. Finally, I defend the view that music subsequently developed via processes of social learning and cumulative culture.","[{""name"": ""Anton Killin"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Bielefeld University , Germany"", ""Joint Institute for Individualisation in a Changing Environment, Bielefeld University and University of Münster , Germany"", ""Evolution of Cultural Diversity Initiative, Australian National University , Australia""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199604715.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9781316471449"", ""10.1002/evan.20222"", ""10.1038/nature08169"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.053"", ""10.1098/rsif.2011.0258"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691517.003.0002"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658541.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11245-019-09671-4"", ""10.1038/s41559-017-0112"", ""10.1023/A:1023980201043"", ""10.1038/21310"", ""10.1038/srep11320"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(1998)6:5<178::AID-EVAN5>3.0.CO;2-8"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199227341.003.0008"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01138"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199583560.003.0002"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199227341.003.0002"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2013.02.044"", ""10.1098/rstb.2011.0218"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198786856.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9781400873296"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195320510.003.0003"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107444973"", ""10.1177/2059204317751971"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61052-4_6"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780192895950.013.18"", ""10.1007/978-4-431-55997-9_12"", ""10.1006/jhev.2000.0435"", ""10.1017/S0140525X20000345"", ""10.1007/s11229-022-03491-7"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199227341.003.0009"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511803178"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190854614.003.0009"", ""10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199234080.001.0001"", ""10.1002/evan.21560"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139149327.007"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139149327.008"", ""10.4159/9780674972988"", ""10.1007/978-94-015-1059-2"", ""10.1017/S0140525X20000333"", ""10.1006/jasc.1998.0350"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197531389.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctt17kk95h"", ""10.1006/jasc.1993.1006"", ""10.1007/978-94-011-0998-7_5"", ""10.1073/pnas.1404212111"", ""10.1126/science.1227608"", ""10.2307/2802697"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190854614.003.0014""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

I argue that, while some contemporary artworks may indeed be perceptually indistinguishable from ordinary objects, these works are distinguishable not only by means of meaning but also by means of a non-perceptual aesthetic experience. I then discuss two theories that might provide a model of such an aesthetic experience. First, I focus on James Shelley’s theory of non-perceptual aesthetic experience conceived as a representation of non-perceptual aesthetic properties. Second, I discuss Jérôme Dokic’s adverbialist theory, which sees aesthetic experience as a combination of non-aesthetic attitudes. I argue that the adverbialist model is the most promising candidate for solving our problem. The model must be extended, however, if it is to account for pragmatic attitudes in response to artworks.","[{""name"": ""Tomáš Koblížek"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781503621848-009""]",['Neuroscience'],['Cognitive Neuroscience'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

This concerns the more precise determination of the drawing materials used and the reconstruction of the genesis of the drawings discussed. The material analysis allows us to decide whether and how Rembrandt’s inks can be used to determine authorship at all. The “material turn” in drawing studies thus intervenes in the discussion about authorship and opens up a broader production aesthetic perspective.

In depicting at the cup’s stem the image of the ancient wrestler Milo of Croton carrying a bull, Jamnitzer alluded to an emblem decorating the city hall to pun on the associations with strength in the recipient’s last name. The iconography of the vessel thus bound the owner of the object to the virtues promoted in the building of governance at the same time that it demonstrated the goldsmith’s virtuosic balancing of weight. The cup thus makes visible the material and metaphorical links between the skills of the goldsmith’s craft and the ethics and politics of the free imperial city.","[{""name"": ""Shira Brisman"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Pennsylvania, Department of the History of Art, Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe History of Art Building , 3405 Woodland Walk , Philadelphia , PA , Vereinigte Staaten""]}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

In the first section, I present some common features of bearing witness, as conceptualized within media studies and journalism. Then I explain how artworks placed in the streets can bear witness in a similar way. I argue that witness-bearing art transmits knowledge about certain unjust and harmful events, which then places a moral burden or responsibility on the viewer. To defend this view, I offer some examples of activist art that bears witness to certain events. I suggest that witness-bearing art is placed in the streets in order to make certain truths publicly available, by offering evidence of them embedded in the artwork. The final section considers why the bearing witness is especially effective for activist art. Witness-bearing art plays a crucial knowledge-transmitting function, one which enables art to engage in creative activism. I conclude by considering how witness-bearing art offers a powerful and persuasive voice for the oppressed.","[{""name"": ""Sondra Bacharach"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Victoria University of Wellington , Kelburn, Wellington 6140 , New Zealand""]}]","[""10.1093/aesthj/ayv030"", ""10.1111/jaac.12261"", ""10.4324/9781315146133"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71422-6"", ""10.1111/jaac.12325"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpac038"", ""10.1080/14742837.2021.1967125"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpac040"", ""10.1057/9781137498694"", ""10.1177/0263276408099017"", ""10.1111/ejop.12573"", ""10.1111/phpr.12701"", ""10.1111/papa.12162"", ""10.1016/j.ccs.2016.06.001"", ""10.5840/tpm20209189"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayab018"", ""10.1111/1467-9752.12582"", ""10.1177/0163443711422460"", ""10.1177/016344370202400509""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Philosophy', 'Law']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

This work would seem to be a useful resource for historians of Chinese art since it provides accounts of paintings by artists whose works are no longer extant. But there is one major problem: the book is a forgery. What is more, Zhang also forged paintings to match the documentation he created, so he could also profit from trading in them. Interestingly, the book also echoes unfounded claims registered in art-historical writings of the time, wherein leading critics and connoisseurs, including Dong Qichang (1555–1636), propounded completely contrived arguments by which they tried to establish legitimate lineages in Chinese art. Such propositions represent, borrowing from Eric Hobsbawm's insight, a kind of “invented tradition,” a fictional history of practice and artifact that runs as some thought it ought to have, rather than as it did. By looking into all the three major components of forgeries in early modern China that are referenced throughout Zhang Taijie's catalog—(1) fabricated texts, (2) forged paintings, and (3) fake histories/theories—this paper aims to explain how Baohuilu facilitated Zhang's candid desire for fame and profit in the booming art market of the time, while unveiling certain cultural, social, and genealogical anxieties and tensions negotiated in the form of art-historical theories.","[{""name"": ""J.

10.1093/aesthj/ayad045,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,"Art, ethics, and the relativism of distance","Abstract To what extent, and on what grounds, can we ethically evaluate art from a generative context that is at some significant distance from our present reception context—at enough distance, at least, so that the two contexts differ, in important ways, in aspects of their moral outlooks? This paper has four aims. The modest task of the paper is to show that this question is much more difficult than has been recognised. The somewhat more ambitious goal is a methodological intervention: it is to highlight the need for interdisciplinary research that illuminates the socio-historical specificities of remote generative contexts in a way that allows us to see the relevant ways in which the moral outlooks overlap with ours (or do not). In relation, the third aim of the paper is to argue, with reference to Bernard Williams’s ‘relativism of distance’, that there are some cases in which the moral outlooks of a work’s generative and reception contexts differ so significantly that the warrant for our moral judgments of remote artworks is attenuated—if it exists at all. Finally, we try to demonstrate how the sort of interdisciplinary collaboration we’re advocating might inform our moral judgments of art—more specifically, in a way that invites a degree of quietude or uncertainty about remote artworks that are deeply morally troubling in our present reception context. We do this with reference to the paintings of Titian.","[{""name"": ""Ted Nannicelli"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Communication and Arts, The University of Queensland , Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Bubenik"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Communication and Arts, The University of Queensland , Australia""]}]","[""10.1111/nous.12151"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197507247.001.0001"", ""10.2307/468547"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0017.2011.01428.x"", ""10.1093/aristotelian/75.1.215"", ""10.1515/9781400826735.62""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

10.1093/aesthj/ayab019,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Aesthetic Self-Forgetfulness,"Abstract Intense aesthetic experiences are often described in terms of self-forgetfulness, where the perceiver becomes immersed in the aesthetic phenomenon to the extent of losing consciousness of being the subject of the experience. Although such experiences have been described from the early eighteenth century onwards, there is still a surprising lack of detailed investigation on the precise nature of aesthetic self-forgetfulness. What happens in this experience, and precisely what is the ‘self’ that is forgotten? Building on phenomenological theories of self-consciousness, I argue that aesthetic self-forgetfulness cannot be understood as an absolute eradication of the self, as a pre-reflective self-consciousness stays intact even in deeply immersive aesthetic experiences. Thus, I argue that talk of self-forgetfulness is to some extent misleading, and the changes in the subject’s self-relation during aesthetic experience is better understood in terms of an altered sense of agency.","[{""name"": ""Harri Mäcklin"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Helsinki, Finland""]}]","[""10.1016/j.compind.2009.12.005"", ""10.1057/978-1-137-51299-4_6"", ""10.1007/s13164-014-0222-3"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2006.00211.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00659-4"", ""10.1080/20539320.2019.1589042"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-0846-4"", ""10.1007/978-94-024-1597-1"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804656"", ""10.1515/9783110933727"", ""10.4324/9780203694367"", ""10.1515/9783110884937.105"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6541.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In this paper, I reconstruct the view of imagination, as the cognitive faculty primarily responsible for perception and appreciation of such ‘systems’, that undergirds these claims, and argue that it is to be understood as aiming at ideal ends – in the first instance, at beauty or an order among variety (systematicity). Smith thus offers a distinctive view of aesthetic imagination, as neither freely playing nor imitative (two common views of imagination both in his time and ours) but rather as aiming at, and progressively realizing non-rational norms of order (again, at least in the first instance, an ideal of beauty).","[{""name"": ""Rachel Zuckert"", ""affiliation"": [""Northwestern University , USA""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139023399"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198238089.001.0001"", ""10.3366/jsp.2011.0009"", ""10.1515/9783110325942.273"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840876.003"", ""10.1017/9781108973335"", ""10.2307/2185873"", ""10.1215/00222909-3855722"", ""10.1093/mts/mtab012"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/60.1.19"", ""10.1080/09608780500293042"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190690120.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190860974.003.0007""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

It addresses and challenges the accretion of historical myths around Hosmer's sculpture, its models, and its modern interpretations through the written and visual sources available to her in the nineteenth century. I draw attention to the conflation of key historic events in Rome, the execution of Beatrice Cenci, and the production of Stefano Maderno's Saint Cecilia. These narrative parallels and an emphasis on identifiable women's bodies has led to scholarship repeating the rumour of Hosmer's aristocratic model, which I demonstrate is problematic for evidentiary and interpretative reasons.

As an art critic, Lee maintained an ambivalent position with regard to portraits. Her familiarity with the new psychology informed a response whereby resonance could shift the sensorial boundaries of the genre beyond its function as likeness. By engaging with Lee's interrogation of the voice of portraits, both in art writing and fiction, the essay examines a series of queer attempts to challenge the authority of the look to identify, define or consume the subject of portraiture.

Taking Lorenz's butterfly as a starting point, the author's science theater project Chaos Cabaret seeks to explore the nuances of chaos theory through performance and music.","[{""name"": ""Emma Weitkamp"", ""affiliation"": [""Emma Weitkamp, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of England, Frenchay Campus, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, BS16 1QY, U.K. Email: Emma.weitkamp@uwe.ac.uk.""]}]","[""10.1080/13569780903072174"", ""10.1080/21548455.2010.544090"", ""10.1177/0963662510394278"", ""10.1136/medhum-2016-010959"", ""10.1080/21548455.2014.947349"", ""10.1080/17533015.2016.1251475"", ""10.1179/030801802225005617"", ""10.1179/030801802225003268"", ""10.1353/nar.2011.0012"", ""10.3138/md.42.3.411"", ""10.3138/md.40.1.1"", ""10.1175/1520-0477-50.5.345"", ""10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020<0130:DNF>2.0.CO;2"", ""10.1162/LEON_a_00641"", ""10.1007/s11071-016-3213-3""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

How one fat person acts becomes representative of a broader pattern of behavior that all fat people are presumed to share, shaping the way we understand fatness. This way of generalizing presents fatness as a singular experience, reducing fat people to a monolithic narrative that often reinforces anti-fat bias. How do we avoid this reduction? How can we responsibly depict fat characters without perpetuating negative stereotypes about real fat people? Using the case of “Fat Thor” from Avengers: Endgame, I propose the beginnings of an account of responsible artistic agency which can be used to improve the ways that marginalized communities are depicted in art, with a particular focus on fat communities. Central to this account are two features: inclusion of and deference to members of the communities depicted from a variety of backgrounds throughout the production process, and mindfulness of the preexisting narrative web built around the communities depicted. I will use this discussion to highlight the need for a drastic shift in how we consider marginalized populations in art—in reimagining both who tells their stories, and what stories are told on their behalf.","[{""name"": ""Cheryl Frazier"", ""affiliation"": [""Auburn University , Auburn, AL , USA""]}]","[""10.1056/NEJMoa1606148"", ""10.1038/oby.2011.378"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198716778.003.0003"", ""10.1111/jaac.12681"", ""10.1080/14680777.2012.724026"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197519769.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315551463"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-76783-3_16"", ""10.1002/9781119118527""]","['Health Professions', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Food Science', 'Pharmacy', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('1007 药学', 0.7325), ('1008 中药学', 0.7122)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

Taking the wall paintings of Cubiculum B from the Villa Farnesina as a case in point, the article demonstrates that these images display an interest in interlocking planes of colour and shape that might be described as formalist. It juxtaposes this visual evidence with overlooked passages in ancient texts to explore how such effects were conceptualized in ancient Roman thought. What emerges is a model of aesthetic value that foregrounds terpnopoietic planar effects of colour and shape above those of mimetic representation – so long revered as the most important artistic practice theorized in the classical world. This paradigm of visual value is employed in relation to both figural and non‐figural works alike. The absence of these surface effects in the standard narrative of classical art becomes testimony to that narrative's limitations.","[{""name"": ""Nicola Barham"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Virtue aesthetics encourages a re-focusing of philosophical attention onto the aesthetic character traits of agents, in the same way that virtue ethics and virtue epistemology have encouraged us to focus on moral and intellectual traits. In this paper, I aim to contribute to the development of virtue aesthetics by discussing aesthetic courage, the aesthetic analogue of one of the most widely acknowledged moral virtues. In addition to proposing an account of the nature of this trait, I also argue that aesthetic courage is vital for any sort of aesthetically virtuous life. It is not possible to possess any aesthetic virtue without possessing aesthetic courage. It is important, therefore, for any future development of virtue aesthetics to acknowledge the central importance of aesthetic courage.","[{""name"": ""Alan T Wilson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bristol""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Alphonse Legros,"This essay asks why the art of Alphonse Legros (1837–1911) remained inconspicuous in the art history of the past generation, when the study of the nineteenth century played such a prominent role in the discipline. Legros's realist and politically committed practice is eminently suited to the art‐historical methods that dominated that period. He was an associate of Courbet and Whistler, and his work attracted comment from Charles Baudelaire, Walter Pater, and Roger Fry. Why, then, has he remained virtually invisible to art historians? The essay explores three ‘scandals’, or art‐historical blind spots, which have made Legros's art difficult to interpret: his decision to abandon Parisian modernism and ‘become British’; his choice of subject matter involving religious observance; and his lifelong commitment to the art of the past. It argues that Legros's example offers fresh insights into these three areas of growing concern to the art history of the future.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth Prettejohn"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Second, I argue that there is no reason to prefer fictional creationism over weak fictional antirealism but there is very good reason to prefer the latter over the former.

Scholars have dated the temple to the first half of the seventh century, primarily on account of early inscriptions from the site and the style of the door frames. Few monuments survive from this nascent stage of structural North Indian temple architecture, and the Muṇḍeśvarī temple is intriguing because it is an anomaly in terms of its size, composition, and the shape of its plan. This study argues that the Muṇḍeśvarī temple has been misdated, and presents a systematic architectural analysis that highlights multiple features and irregularities that are incompatible with early North Indian design. The paper proposes that, rather than being seventh century, the octagonal shrine was built about a millennia later, in the sixteenth–seventeenth century, incorporating doorways and moldings salvaged from the ruins of the seventh century temples that once graced the hilltop. The latter part of the article considers how the Muṇḍeśvarī temple came to be buried by the end of the eighteenth century, and questions whether the Archaeological Survey of India might have altered the temple's appearance during the reconstructive work they undertook at the start of the twentieth century.","[{""name"": ""Fiona Buckee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3250169"", ""10.2307/j.ctv301gh6.13""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Religious studies', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

By parameterizing various font attributes, such as color and aspect ratio, the authors are able to generate artistically styled fonts in almost unlimited variations to suit any type of design requirement. The authors demonstrate their experiments on generating fonts in an abstract style similar to Kandinsky's, built on a collection of the artist's styled patterns. The approach generates fonts composed of vector strokes and is thus highly scalable, limited only by the computer hardware.","[{""name"": ""Kang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Kang Zhang, Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083-0688, U.S.A.

I discuss early natural history illustrations of bowerbirds along with Darwinian anthropologies of art, which bring human and avian aesthetic practices into dialogue. Finally, I draw on Richard Prum's theories on aesthetic evolution, Elizabeth Grosz's posthumanist perspective on art's origins, the emerging discipline of multispecies ethnography, and Indigenous Papuan understandings of the bowerbird, to ask how art historians might begin to restore human animals to a larger ecology of creative beings.","[{""name"": ""Nina Amstutz"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

While I agree with the key insight of C. Thi Nguyen and Matthew Strohl (Philosophical Studies 176 (2019): 981-1002) – namely, that style appropriation is sometimes found objectionable because group intimacy is believed to have been breached – I disagree with their core claim that the settled beliefs of the group cannot be wrong about whether its group intimacy has, in fact, been compromised in this way. I accept that facts about group intimacy can generate normative reasons concerning style appropriation, but develop a distinctive account of how this comes to be so: one which holds that such facts are independently grounded, rather than being decided by group opinion (as Nguyen and Stroll think). This alternative picture of how group intimacy grounds normative reasons does better justice to the intuitive thought that reality, including its normative regions, is belief-independent. The paper ends with some replies to potential objections.","[{""name"": ""Julian Dodd"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leeds""]}]","[""10.1007/BF00485244"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1224-2"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1223-3"", ""10.1093/pq/pqv026"", ""10.2307/2216786"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2005.00190.x"", ""10.1002/9780470694190""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

We argue that one advantage of this view is that it explains various putative norms on the formation and revision of aesthetic judgement. We begin by setting out our proposed explananda and a sense in which they can be understood as governing the correct response to putative higher-order evidence in aesthetics. We then summarise some existing discussions of expressivist attempts to explain these norms, and objections raised to them. This will allow us to identify the pitfalls that a good expressivist explanation needs to avoid. Finally, we sketch our preferred version of aesthetic expressivism which includes as a crucial part a hypothesis concerning the distinctive expressive function of aesthetic practice. We then consider how this theory can explain the putative aesthetic norms whilst avoiding the previous objections.","[{""name"": ""Jon Robson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Nottingham, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Neil Sinclair"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Nottingham, UK""]}]","[""10.1093/bjaesthetics/43.4.386"", ""10.1007/s11098-005-2012-3"", ""10.1017/S0265052500002880"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9674-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198784647.003.0003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198249856.001.0001"", ""10.5840/jphil201811538"", ""10.1111/phc3.12040"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00134"", ""10.5840/jphil201110838"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayl019"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00316.x"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-5265-1_8"", ""10.1093/mind/fzz054"", ""10.2307/1522825"", ""10.1086/498462"", ""10.1017/S1358246114000265"", ""10.1111/phpr.12363"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198866107.001.0001"", ""10.1080/0020174X.2016.1208918"", ""10.1093/aesthj/44.3.277"", ""10.4324/9780429030215-19"", ""10.4324/9781003184225-4"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2012.00329.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In short, consuming works of interactive fiction involves imagining the story from the protagonist’s perspective.","[{""name"": ""Paal Fjeldvig Antonsen"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Bergen""]}]","[""10.1515/9783110877335-002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1093/owc/9780199536313.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00437.x"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00492.x"", ""10.1080/00048402.2016.1149736"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00250.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511674716"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.5840/jphil20081051025"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-2557-7_19"", ""10.2307/2184843"", ""10.2307/2184519"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00290.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12355"", ""10.1111/jaac.12269"", ""10.1111/jaac.12358"", ""10.1023/A:1022225203544"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8349.2011.00200.x"", ""10.1002/9781444310177"", ""10.2307/2025831"", ""10.4324/9781315210377-8""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The paper provides an overview of the Kantian origins of Schiller’s aesthetic programme (Section 1). It then considers Schiller’s critique of the perceived failings of the Kantian and Enlightenment republican models of ethical value and political emancipation (Section 2) before turning to his positive alternative aesthetic programme (Section 3).

10.1111/1467-8365.12509,ART HISTORY,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,Rudimentary Things: Becoming an Object in the Performances of Skip Arnold,"Skip Arnold's performances consist of an attempt to become an object, typically by way of a singular action repeated or sustained over a difficult duration. As such, in actions since the early 1980s, he has created bluntly mimetic embodiments of a statue, gargoyle, scarecrow, fountain, or freight. In Marks (1984), Closet Corner (1987), and Hood Ornament (1992), I argue, the categories of the object and the subject vacillate in their distinctness, in such a way that the resulting work of art overtakes or undermines the integrity, or ontological safety, of the body that performs it. In Shoot Me (1992), however, becoming an object raises political questions about the uneven distribution of the right to full subjectivity and the threat or disaster of being turned into an object (for example, a corpse) against one's will. Arnold's performances therefore revel in the difficulties of approaching (or ‘pornotroping’) human subjects as mute or inactive things, and the vital, consequential liveliness of objects in performance.","[{""name"": ""Dominic Johnson"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Others argued that such a change serves to whitewash legacies of racism and cultural genocide. In this paper, I show that these concerns are unfounded. The first concern is not supported by law or the history of our titling practices; and the second concern misses the mark by ignoring the gallery’s substantial efforts to avoid just such an outcome. Picking up on a suggestion from Loretta Todd, I argue that we can use Aboriginal Title as a model for thinking about the harms perpetuated by cultural appropriation, and the practices we should adopt to mitigate them.","[{""name"": ""Michel-Antoine Xhignesse"", ""affiliation"": [""British Columbia, Canada""]}]","[""10.3138/jcs.31.1.60"", ""10.4324/9781315720401"", ""10.2307/430537"", ""10.1353/fro.2005.0030"", ""10.1111/0047-2786.t01-1-00007"", ""10.1080/00048402.2018.1488267"", ""10.1002/9780470694190""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Law', 'Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Some philosophers argue that motor responses to dances are an important part of dance appreciation. Proponents of such a claim are often backed with support from cognitive science. But it has not remained uncontroversial. Despite its controversy, the concept of motor response remains under-analyzed. As a result, assumptions about the idea and purpose of motor response get borrowed from cognitive science. I argue that one such assumption, that motor response is supposed to be veridical, runs us into several problems. It runs us into something of a paradox, where it is claimed that motor responses happen as part of our general perception of movement. However, few people experience such responses. Furthermore, it seems that the motor responses that are appropriate for a dance might not be the ones the dancer is feeling. As a result, we should prefer an account of motor response that emphasizes its flexibility and its ability to change and adapt to the movement we see.","[{""name"": ""Ian Heckman"", ""affiliation"": [""University of British Columbia , Vancouver, BC V5N 1S1 , Canada""]}]","[""10.1093/cercor/bhi007"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.065"", ""10.1007/s00426-009-0262-y"", ""10.1111/jaac.12007"", ""10.1007/s13164-015-0259-y"", ""10.1068/p5203"", ""10.1111/jaac.12010"", ""10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.033"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.071"", ""10.1111/jaac.12009"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199539956.003.0004"", ""10.4324/9780203840702"", ""10.1111/jaac.12008"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00244.x"", ""10.1080/13869790600641848"", ""10.1111/jaac.12006"", ""10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0504-04.2004"", ""10.1007/s11098-020-01526-8""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In this article, I give an ameliorative analysis of these concepts. On what I call the Capacity View, the distinction between low, middle, and high art depends on the relation between an artwork’s perceiver (specifically her aesthetic responsive capacities) and the perceived artwork. Though the Capacity View may not align perfectly with folk usage, the view is worth our attention due to three attractive upshots. First, it explains how an artwork’s status level can be elevated or lowered over time and why biases can lead to mistaken judgments about such statuses. Second, it sheds light on the idea of cultural inheritance and why certain forms of aesthetic deference may be justified. Finally, it explains how high, middle, and low art each make distinctive contributions to the good life.","[{""name"": ""Ting Cho Lau"", ""affiliation"": [""Arthur J.

I argue this qualifies as “receptivity to a situation,” which is neither fully active nor merely passive and emerges as a necessary element of the intentions made apparent by such cave art. I argue against prominent interpretations of cave art, including the shamanist account and propose a structural interpretation attentive to particular cases. Seen in this way, cave art displays intentions that are analyzable as having a tripartite structure: mentally directed, embedded in actions and receptive to a situation. Moreover, the latter is the medium through which the other two elements are conjoined. Drawing on a range of archaeological and philosophical resources from both analytical philosophy and phenomenology, I argue that what I call cave art’s “intentional story” is important for the philosophy of intentions more generally.","[{""name"": ""Fiona Hughes"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Philosophy and Art History, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, UK""]}]","[""10.1007/s10816-020-09479-2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511761454"", ""10.2307/278380"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511720185"", ""10.1093/0199246270.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226145006.001.0001"", ""10.1080/13869790701834599"", ""10.1002/9781118241912"", ""10.1515/9780748629381"", ""10.1093/mind/fzt061"", ""10.4324/9780203818336"", ""10.1146/annurev-anthro-102116-041354"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511550843.011"", ""10.1086/203629"", ""10.1007/s10816-011-9105-4"", ""10.1007/s10699-015-9409-z""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Anthropology', 'Paleontology']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7076), ('0709 地质学', 0.7071)]]"

But the mass‐produced objects that he famously chose and inscribed with his name were also a response to another paradigm of early twentieth‐century modernism: that of primitivism. Indeed, it is surprising to discover the extent to which the immediate culture from which the readymades emerged was one saturated in notions about the so‐called ‘primitive’, the result of a sudden influx of African art into New York in the years following the First World War. This essay re‐situates the readymades within this historical context and posits that they allegorized primitivism. It is equally argued that the profound impact of African art on the development of twentieth‐century modernism exceeds traditional art‐historical narratives. If Duchamp's primitivism has remained largely invisible it is because of the ways in which the primitive (as a set of ideas about art that are racial in origin) has been corralled within Western modernism.","[{""name"": ""Thomas Folland"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

To do so, I argue for an agent-centred approach—a focus on appropriators more than appropriation. In my view, cultural misappropriation involves agents who exhibit disregard toward a relevant culture and its members. I argue further that this approach improves upon recent alternative philosophical approaches to cultural appropriation, which I divide into two camps: toleration-based and power-based.","[{""name"": ""Rebecca Tuvel"", ""affiliation"": [""Rhodes College, USA""]}]","[""10.4000/transtexts.1064"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199665655.001.0001"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201137214"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00586.x"", ""10.1177/1468796819866498"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract201642219"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1224-2"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1223-3"", ""10.4159/9780674043527"", ""10.1002/9780470694190""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

A través de una metodología cualitativa, basada en una etnografía con agrupaciones femeninas que tocan y bailan en la ciudad de Arica, se profundiza en el rol de las afrochilenas en la construcción y difusión de las narrativas sonoras y dancísticas del ritmo. Entre los resultados se destaca su práctica como una forma de reivindicar las demandas feministas. Se concluye que el Tumbe Carnaval, como herramienta artístico-política, ha sobrepasado las aspiraciones exclusivamente afrodescendientes, llegando a ser un medio que denuncia el racismo estructural y las desigualdades de género.","[{""name"": ""Isabel Araya"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

The original rubbings were made from ancient inscribed stone monuments, and the book's immediate audience was the aficionados of such objects, scholars of epigraphy and evidential research. A technique that exactly conveyed the material condition of those aged rubbings was important to these scholars. Huang Yi chose the outline method called shuanggou, which traced the broken boundaries between figure and ground. This old method for copying calligraphy usually involved two stages—outlining and filling in—so that the final product reproduced a simulacrum of the original calligraphy. Huang Yi left his reproductions at the outline stage, however, which resulted in strange, warped, and broken figures that merged figure and ground, calling attention to the illegibility of many of the characters reproduced in the rubbings and evacuating the calligraphy of brushwork. This essay analyzes the figures of Engraved Texts within the context of a broader epigraphic aesthetic that permeated calligraphy and painting circa 1800. It goes on to suggest that Huang Yi's choice of shuanggou outlines, while firmly rooted in an epigraphic obsession with the material past, also marked the horizon of a changing attitude toward brushwork, and had more in common with modern methods of visualizing the world, such as the drafting techniques later implemented in engineering schools during the modernizing reforms of the late nineteenth century.","[{""name"": ""Michael J.

Commissioned by the Yongzheng emperor (r. 1723–1735) and completed in the second year of the Qianlong emperor's reign (1736–1795), the painting is a rare example of Qing court art that reveals how Qianlong furthered his father's artistic vision while formulating his own in the first fifteen years of his long tenure as ruler. This vision involved how to reinterpret and reinvent the Chinese painting tradition through time-honored themes. The article is divided into four sections. In the first, it brings attention to the salient and crucial but long neglected stylistic features of the painting—those that emphasize theatricality and spectatorship. These interconnected features link and characterize the paintings commissioned by Yongzheng. The second section shifts to discuss the emerging cultural agenda of Yongzheng as seen through the manner in which court art references the Chinese painting tradition. The most remarkable act regards the reinterpretation of old painting themes that include Qingming shanghe and Baijun tu (One Hundred Horses). The third section analyzes how the paratextual elements of Qingming shanghe, especially Qianlong's poem and inscription, inform us of the emperor's views about the production mechanism of court painting and the political meaning of this work. The last section, based on Qianlong's understanding of the painting, highlights the emperor's cultural agenda associated with the idea of yuanben, which pointed to new versions of old themes made by his painting academy.","[{""name"": ""Cheng-hua Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

I argue, first, that fictionality does not confer immunity to ethical criticism and, second, that the stance adopted by the stand-up artist is not fully analogous to a fictive one in any event. Whatever the case with respect to the adoption of an alternative persona, the stand-up artist refers in his or her pronouncements to the actual world in a way that a fiction does not. That also suggests susceptibility to ethical criticism, just for different reasons.","[{""name"": ""E.M.

Close examination of surviving works and the traces of the practice in his archives reveals montage making to be intimately connected to Grosz's exchanges with other artists over a long period and to his work in other media. Most significantly, montage making was deeply implicated with his own changing attitude towards the avant‐garde. Dada was not a stable concept that could be reinitiated untransformed, nor was montage a static category. An examination of Grosz's participation in the reception of practices such as collage and photomontage is coupled here with reflection on the relationship between montage and processes of memorialization and recollection to demonstrate their unexpected interconnection.","[{""name"": ""Michael White"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

With an extra emphasis on Reybrouck’s much-cited affordance-driven theory, I locate fundamental premises in the affordance concept. By initiating a dialogue with Gadamer’s perspective, I suggest a slight yet important shift of perspective that allows us to see an autonomous, transformative, and intrinsically active ‘ideality’ potentially emerging in music. In the final section, I try to demonstrate how Gadamer’s perspective is supported by recent empirical studies on communicative musicality and child development, and allows us to see how protoversions of the transformative ‘ideality’ are already present at the beginning of human life.","[{""name"": ""Mattias Solli"", ""affiliation"": [""Norwegian University of Science and Technology , Norway""]}]","[""10.4324/9781315858067"", ""10.1002/j.2167-4086.2004.tb00151.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511615924"", ""10.1207/S15326969ECO1502_5"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195151947.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11097-007-9076-9"", ""10.1007/s11245-008-9042-3"", ""10.1007/s11097-009-9136-4"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198794325.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198846345.001.0001"", ""10.1162/002409403322258781"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521801931.003"", ""10.4324/9781410600479"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804656"", ""10.1037/pmu0000228"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.55.1.0035"", ""10.1007/s11097-010-9152-4"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199556137.003.0011"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2013.01003"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198804352.003.0004"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11smsmz"", ""10.1386/jmte.3.2-3.141_1"", ""10.1515/semi.2001.045"", ""10.1007/s12304-012-9144-6"", ""10.1007/s12304-013-9192-6"", ""10.3390/bs5010001"", ""10.7202/1051398ar"", ""10.7202/1076194ar"", ""10.14746/ism.2019.19.4"", ""10.4324/9781315621364-4"", ""10.1177/1029864915593333"", ""10.1007/s11097-016-9477-8"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.55.4.0082"", ""10.5406/15437809.56.1.06"", ""10.2174/1874350101508010174"", ""10.1093/med:psych/9780199586066.001.0001"", ""10.1177/10298649000030S109"", ""10.1080/00754170500079651"", ""10.4324/9781315735290-20"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8308.2004.00242.x"", ""10.1177/1029864911435734""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Developmental and Educational Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7692), ('0401 教育学', 0.7489)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

While Vietnamese artists did not develop a considerable body of work that can match the grandiose works of socialist realism under Josef Stalin, some artists did work in a socialist realist style that merged academic oil painting styles with local themes. This essay examines the work of Vũ Duy Nghı̃a (1935–2022), Lê Huy Tiếp (b. 1950) and Đào Châu Hải (b. 1955), who studied in the Soviet Union during this period and integrated various painting methods, styles and techniques into their art works. The legacy of Soviet–Vietnam relations is a still largely understudied field. While archival sources are difficult to access, the essay relies on interviews with two of the living artists. It looks into the significance of studying in the Soviet Union for these art workers, and assesses the impact that it had on the development of Vietnamese culture overall.","[{""name"": ""Natalia Kraevskaia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nora Annesley Taylor"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In this article, I look at two Neo-Confucian Korean philosophical contexts—the Four-Seven debate and Book of the Imperial Pivot—and suggest that metaphors are philosophically expedient in two further contexts: when both intellect and emotion must be addressed; and when the aim of philosophizing is to produce behavioral change. Because Neo-Confucians had a conception of the mind that closely connected it to the heart (心 xin), metaphor’s empathy-inducing and perspective-giving capacities made it an especially helpful mode of philosophizing in the history of Korean philosophy.","[{""name"": ""Hannah H Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department, Macalester College , Saint Paul , MN , USA""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2009.00186.x"", ""10.1086/447969"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0516-z"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190492014.001.0001"", ""10.25024/kj.2012.52.3.177"", ""10.1163/15406253-0470102006"", ""10.3390/rel9110374"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199357666.003.0004""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It clarifies two roles of mental imagery in relation to poetry—as an effect generated by poetry and as an efficient means for understanding and appreciating poetry. The article also relates mental imagery to the discussion on the ‘heresy of paraphrase’. It argues against the orthodox view that the imagistic effects of poetry cannot be captured by prosaic paraphrase, but points to features of poetry that can shape aspects of mental imagery that are liable to be lost in paraphrase.","[{""name"": ""Michelle Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""michelle liu, Leverhulme Early Career Fellow, University of Hertfordshire , Hatfield , United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093639"", ""10.1016/j.bandl.2009.07.002"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02249.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9264.2010.00288.x"", ""10.1080/10926488.2018.1481257"", ""10.1007/s11098-021-01628-x"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab040"", ""10.1086/447971"", ""10.1093/aristotelian/83.1.67"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0607-x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9329.2009.00442.x"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2009.00190.x"", ""10.53765/20512201.29.5.176"", ""10.1111/1468-0017.00205"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0392-y"", ""10.1093/monist/onx024"", ""10.1016/j.cortex.2017.07.006"", ""10.1017/apa.2020.29"", ""10.1016/j.tics.2015.08.003"", ""10.2307/1772291"", ""10.1016/j.cognition.2009.02.011"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00326"", ""10.1080/00455091.2018.1442965"", ""10.1080/00455091.2017.1378534"", ""10.1016/j.pragma.2019.01.005"", ""10.1016/S0079-7421(03)44002-4"", ""10.1002/ejsp.661"", ""10.1111/1467-9280.00430"", ""10.3758/BF03196557"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511499968.010""]",['Psychology'],"['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1111/1467-8365.12631,ART HISTORY,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,Maternities: Dorothea Tanning's Aesthetics of Touch,"This essay explores the concern in Dorothea Tanning's work of the late 1960s and early 1970s with touch, contiguity, and the concept of maternity. In addition to a series of paintings and drawings that connote intimacy and whose titles allude to maternity, during this period Tanning also gave form to a group of soft sculptures, which similarly evince a preoccupation with closeness and touch, and indicate a form of intimacy that challenges the limits of the individual subject. Tanning's engagement with these themes, the essay argues, resonates closely with the feminist poetics developed around the same time by poststructuralist theorists such as Hélène Cixous, Julia Kristeva, and Luce Irigaray. I propose that Irigaray's theories of maternity, subjectivity, and non‐phallocentric language offer a particularly rich set of analytical tools with which to understand Tanning's work. Through establishing the affinities between Tanning and Irigaray, I suggest, we can better understand the intellectual currents that flowed between poststructuralist feminism and surrealist women's work of this period.","[{""name"": ""Anna Watz"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

10.1111/jaac.12763,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Is Stand-Up Comedy Art?,"ABSTRACTStand-up so closely resembles-and is meant to resemble-the styles and expectations of everyday speech that the idea of technique and technical mastery we typically associate with art is almost rendered invisible. Technique and technical mastery is as much about the understanding and development of audiences as collaborators as it is the generation of material. Doing so requires encountering audiences in places that by custom or design encourage ludic and vernacular talk-social spaces and third spaces such as bars, coffee houses, and clubs. Cultivating uncultivated speech and cultivating real audiences in found settings form the background of developing the stand-up comedian, neither of which lend themselves to the conservatory tradition we think of when we think of the development of artists. This article addresses two areas of the overall question of stand-up as art, starting with the ontological question of stand-up comedy: if it is an art where is it located, and what we may mean by “artworks” and “artworld” in stand-up comedy? Then I consider whether stand-up comedy as practiced can be reconciled with several recent definitions for art and note some of the special conditions and contexts for stand-up.","[{""name"": ""IAN BRODIE"", ""affiliation"": ["" Department of Literature, Folklore and the Arts  Cape Breton University  Sydney  Nova Scotia  B1P 6L2  Canada""]}]","[""10.2307/778937"", ""10.1525/aa.1992.94.4.02a00090"", ""10.1146/annurev.an.19.100190.000423"", ""10.14325/mississippi/9781628461824.001.0001"", ""10.1080/14790726.2016.1184681"", ""10.1146/annurev.an.16.100187.002123"", ""10.1002/9780470774922"", ""10.1093/0199241589.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203390795_chapter_18"", ""10.1111/jaac.12222"", ""10.1515/9780773571990"", ""10.1111/jaac.12088"", ""10.2307/540948"", ""10.1111/jaac.12450"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198163329.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctv69th1v"", ""10.2307/539181"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2006.00219.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01483.x"", ""10.5325/studamerhumor.5.1.0093"", ""10.2307/2025596"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac50.2.0117"", ""10.1080/0300776032000117003"", ""10.1080/00043249.1968.10793875"", ""10.2307/455800"", ""10.2307/800062"", ""10.2979/JFR.2008.45.1.37"", ""10.7330/9781607324928"", ""10.1163/22145966-90000097"", ""10.2307/539912"", ""10.3758/BF03330380"", ""10.4324/9781315544861-3"", ""10.2307/538358"", ""10.1080/02699930302296"", ""10.2307/3814039"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac15.1.0027""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Reading stand-up as a genre of diaspora culture meant to contend with issues of antiblack racism, economic and social marginalization, and the legacy of (neo)colonialism, this article examines the ways humor and comedy manifest transnational intimacies and affinities via the circulation of black women's comic culture. Black women's stand-up comedy enables us to orient our understanding of the inextricable link between aesthetic choices and diaspora as the locus of the production of blackness, and as a particular sensibility rooted in the struggle against colonialism, antiblack racism, and the struggle for human rights and recognition.","[{""name"": ""JESSYKA FINLEY"", ""affiliation"": ["" American Studies and Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies  Middlebury College  Middlebury  Vermont  05753""]}]","[""10.2307/23823874"", ""10.1215/9780822385103"", ""10.2979/meridians.11.2.1"", ""10.1515/humr.2011.028"", ""10.1353/anq.2011.0001"", ""10.1177/1363460716640730"", ""10.1080/00141844.2012.669776""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

The installation provided an interactive experience of the evolution of a complex bicontinuous structure of two immiscible fluids. The evolution is driven by the surface tension of the interface of the two fluids, which results in a continuous reduction of the interface area. The process is mathematically described by a partial differential equation, which is numerically solved. In each time step, the structure, visualized by the fluid-fluid interface, is rendered and shown on an elastic display. According to the deformation of the display, the corresponding time frame is projected. By pushing against the elastic display, one therefore can interact with the structure and evolve it in time in a playful and intuitive manner.","[{""name"": ""Florian Stenger"", ""affiliation"": [""Florian Stenger (researcher), Dresden University of Technology, Department of Mathematics, 01062 Dresden, Germany..""]}, {""name"": ""Axel Voigt"", ""affiliation"": [""Axel Voigt (researcher, designer), Dresden University of Technology, Department of Mathematics, 01062 Dresden, Germany..

Questions concerning authenticity have been at the forefront, and this has led to a focus on the scroll's impressive documentation, which begins with two poetic inscriptions contemporary to Su Shi, including one by the famed calligrapher Mi Fu (1052–1107). Yet, while scrutiny of the painting and its documentation has made a strong case for authenticity, it has largely avoided two seals on the painting that claim the actual authorial presence of Su and Mi. It is argued in this article that those two seals, which some have attributed to the later collector Yang Zun (ca. 1320–after 1368), should in fact belong to Su Shi and Mi Fu. Acknowledging their true provenance consequently provides an extraordinary entrée to reconstructing the dates and circumstances of both the painting and Mi's poetic inscription. Beyond this, we gain a glimpse of how the literati creatively employed inscriptional practices to enhance the communicative function of painting and calligraphy in the late eleventh century.","[{""name"": ""Peter C.

It focuses on an unfinished portrait of the artist's oldest and dearest friend, Jean‐Pierre‐François Gilibert. I argue that Ingres foregrounded the physical allure and fashionability of his friend in this portrait, thereby overtly specularizing and covertly eroticizing him. The portrait is read as an artefact of an early ‘romantic’ phase of the two men's friendship, one that had to be disavowed in order for them to achieve heterosexual adulthood in accordance with the period's growing dichotomization of homosocial and homoerotic bonds between men. I trace the processes through which Ingres initially disavowed Gilibert – and ultimately, retrospectively re‐embraced him – via the complex role that the latter's portrait played in the decades‐long evolutionary saga of its erstwhile pendant, Ingres's celebrated Self‐Portrait at the Age of Twenty‐Four.","[{""name"": ""Andrew Carrington Shelton"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

The authors thus extend the dyad sense-nonsense by introducing the concept no-sense, situated between sense and nonsense, and by extending the concept sense to the concept poly-sense. The authors construct a mathematical model of these concepts and related processes using structures such as logical calculus, logical variety and logical prevariety. This approach accords with Leonardo da Vinci’s opinion that “no human investigation can claim to be scientific if it doesn’t pass the test of mathematical proof.”","[{""name"": ""Mark Burgin"", ""affiliation"": [""Mark Burgin, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, U.S.A.

Instead of creating a singular subject that indexes the artist's self, this work deploys diverse pictorial and literary tropes to construct multiple personae, enabling the viewer (including the artist) to shift among them. The scroll effects the viewer's movement from one subject position to another, undermining the binary of spectator and spectacle, heterosexual relationship and homosocial bond, and subject and object. Engaging with Bruno Latour's actor-network theory, this article argues that if we do not assume a direct alignment between the subject of representation and the represented subject, a literati artwork can become a mediator of multiple shifting “selves” rather than an extension of a singular, unified “I.” Literati art thus functions not merely as a repository of self-expression but also as a generative mediator of identities and social relations. In staging multivalent modes of engagement, Seiko's scroll ultimately offers an alternative perspective on the role of subjectivity in the interpretation of literati art.","[{""name"": ""Yurika Wakamatsu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1515/9781503619821-009"", ""10.1353/nlh.2011.0045"", ""10.2307/3045734"", ""10.2307/2652032"", ""10.4000/extremeorient.94"", ""10.1017/S0021911808001794"", ""10.1353/late.1992.0006"", ""10.2307/3250007"", ""10.1215/23290048-2887565"", ""10.1515/9780804765916-015""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

On the exterior faces of the sarcophagus, the anonymous artist simulated a three-layered space, imagining the deceased's wooden coffin (the inner layer) contained in his burial chamber (middle layer), which in turn is embraced by a complex three-dimensional natural and supernatural world (the outer layer). In the middle layer, eight figures cast a slant gaze from behind four windows at filial paragons dwelling in the outer layer. This gaze was used as a rhetorical device to bridge the physical and psychological gap between the gazers and those upon whom they gaze. Evoking the idiom found in medieval Chinese texts of “watching the ancients as neighbors,” the artist defined the deceased as a neighbor of the ancient filial paragons who dwell in an ideal landscape as recluses. In addition to the visual analysis of the sarcophagus, this article also examines the epitaph buried along with the sarcophagus. While the carving praises the private virtue of the dead, the text paints another rosy picture of the deceased prince as a good official. Eventually, the image and text were used in tandem to create a perfect image of the deceased.","[{""name"": ""Jie Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/3177344"", ""10.1353/jas.2012.0027"", ""10.1080/02549948.2015.1106833"", ""10.7817/jameroriesoci.135.3.433"", ""10.2307/2928779""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

As long as we are focusing on the social context of the artworks or the artist’s intention, this epistemic asymmetry remains, given that we have vastly more information about the social context of the artworks or the artist’s intention when it comes to ‘Western’ art—again, because of the historically contingent differences in record-keeping and the survival rate of such records. If we want to overcome the epistemic asymmetry between ‘Western’ and ‘Non-Western’ art, we need to look elsewhere. I will argue, using Franz Boas’s work, that we should look for formal features. In order to avoid the epistemic asymmetry that follows from the historically contingent fact that we have more information about some cultures than about others, we need to start our analysis with formal categories.","[{""name"": ""Bence Nanay"", ""affiliation"": [""Centre for Philosophical Psychology, University of Antwerp , Belgium""]}]","[""10.2307/3046281"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226451664.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199277346.001.0001"", ""10.1126/science.aax0868"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658442.001.0001"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780198826613.003.0007""]",['Neuroscience'],['Cognitive Neuroscience'],"[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

In the last decade, water has featured as a major thematic or visual trope in artworks made with, for or about the Internet. From Helen Marten's Evian Disease (2012) to Hito Steyerl's Liquidity Inc. (2014), this essay considers why the image of water has provided such a powerful and provocative visual metaphor for new digital technologies. I analyse how the image of water has been used to map out a series of key relationships between information technology, finance and the environment. Drawing these fields together through the themes of transparency and opacity, order and chaos, I argue that the image of water serves as a shorthand for making art in a time of crisis: a representation of a meltdown that is at once both metaphoric and all too real. At stake in this is the idea that the repeated and recurrent use of images of water in recent art reveals not simply how but crucially why a new set of narratives about digital technology has emerged since 2008: narratives in which a historical language of immaterial flows has now come to be superseded by one of material realities.","[{""name"": ""Cadence Kinsey"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],['Human-Computer Interaction'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)]]"

The ongoing ecocide which we, in a state of abject detachment, are witnessing and abetting calls out for artists to reconnect and reengage with the nonhuman world that has been deemed valueless by our civilization. Countering the disenchantment of nature wrought by scientism, human-centrism, and above all capitalism necessitates a dissolving of the barriers we set up between ourselves and our environment, a task which can be only accomplished via religion or art: an art—like field recording—which affords reconnecting its audience with the enchantment of the ignored world surrounding them. In this article, Toshiya Tsunoda’s exemplary Somashikiba (2016)—recorded in locations forgotten by civilization—will be examined via interpretive tools adapted from Ueda Shizuteru’s Kyoto School aesthetics and Takahashi Mutsuo’s poetics. Ueda’s philosophy offers a way of understanding perception which eliminates the subject-object division. Takahashi’s project of recovering the spirituality of place through poetry is a model of historically and politically engaged art. Looking, as these contemporary Japanese thinkers have done, to the precapitalist, pre-formalist past to rediscover (sound) art’s function as a medium which reconfigures the listener’s perception of reality, I argue for the urgency of sound art such as Tsunoda’s which aids in the re-enchantment of the world to a future beyond capitalist, humanist “civilization.”","[{""name"": ""Daryl Jamieson"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Design, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan""]}]","[""10.1353/pew.2017.0009"", ""10.1111/jaac.12586"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195151947.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781501396328"", ""10.1111/jaac.12581"", ""10.1215/9780822372714"", ""10.11126/stanford/9780804752992.001.0001"", ""10.5699/modelangrevi.109.4.0873"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004189775.i-505"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/25.3.239"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.2.0101"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00240.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Cultural Studies', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

A natural consequence of the ontological framework of this theory is that musical works change intrinsically through a change in the sonic-structural properties of performances. From this a surprising consequence follows: everyone can change a musical work. Still, it seems that some changes matter more than others. The article offers a revisionary reply to this concern by arguing that normative change is not a change in the ontological nature of the work but rather in its authenticity conditions.","[{""name"": ""Caterina Moruzzi"", ""affiliation"": [""Caterina Moruzzi Universität Konstanz, Germany""]}]","[""10.1093/mind/fzq072"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0378.2012.00546.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198859482.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00371.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1207-3"", ""10.1007/s11098-019-01380-3"", ""10.7591/9781501731631"", ""10.1007/978-94-010-2557-7_9"", ""10.1007/BF00354100"", ""10.1111/jaac.12579"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00182"", ""10.1080/00048409612347421"", ""10.1093/analys/60.1.84"", ""10.1093/019924443X.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2182371"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.1999.tb00068.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Del mismo modo, la etnografía ilustra que diferentes estilos de arte rupestre fueron creados en ocasiones por diversos grupos sociales para variadas funciones dentro de la misma cultura y período.

He is invoked in this role by such authors as Kraut (2007, p. 67), Bonds (2014, p. 5), Robinson (2014), Young (2014, pp. vii, 1, 3–4, 151), Davies (2017) and Kania (2017). His ‘manifesto’ paper (2004) was recently reprinted in Lamarque and Olsen (2018, pp. 574–582). This development is unfortunate, because Zangwill, for all his radical-sounding theses, actually argues against views that hardly anyone holds. What is more, some of his arguments in favour of the obvious seem confused and defective. But as for his really radical thesis that ‘Music, in itself, has nothing to do with emotion’, he provides hardly any justification. What is more, contrary to what Zangwill believes, such justification is not to be found in Hanslick, who in fact sees emotional content as a relatively important element of music.","[{""name"": ""Krzysztof Guczalski"", ""affiliation"": [""Jagiellonian University in Krakow , Poland""]}]","[""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199343638.001.0001"", ""10.7591/9781501733987"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac53.1.0059"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.1.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199228126.003.0004"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.1982.tb00110.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199243167.001.0001"", ""10.2307/431994"", ""10.2307/431480"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac53.1.0049"", ""10.7591/9781501744778"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac52.1.0013"", ""10.1093/0199263655.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199682713.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00272.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12042"", ""10.4324/9780203073797""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Music', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

As a case study, this article considers C.H. Waddington's powerful visual representation of the “epigenetic landscape,” whose purpose is to unify research in genetics, embryology and evolutionary biology. The authors explore the strengths and limitations of Waddington's landscape and attempt to transcend the latter through a collaborative series of exploratory images. Through careful description of this drawing process, the authors touch on its epistemological consequences for all participants.","[{""name"": ""Gemma Anderson"", ""affiliation"": [""Gemma Anderson (artist, academic), University of Exeter, Exeter, U.K..

Can science help explain their existence? Did humans’ investigation of natural phenomena create bits and pieces of dragon lore across cultures? The researchers used a transdisciplinary lens to reveal data unique among extant dragon origin explanations, including fossil evidence and descriptions of Carboniferous-Period plants, dragon folklore descriptions and locations and geographic correlations between the fossils and folklore. The hypothesis is that early humans came across these fossils, constructed meaning for them contextualized by current knowledge of the natural world and created or enhanced dragon lore narratives.","[{""name"": ""DorothyBelle Poli"", ""affiliation"": [""(educator, researcher), Biology Department, Roanoke College, 221 College Lane, Salem, VA 24153, U.S.A..""]}, {""name"": ""Lisa Stoneman"", ""affiliation"": [""(educator, researcher), Education Department, Roanoke College, 221 College Lane, Salem, VA 24153, U.S.A..""]}]","[""10.1080/03115519708619185"", ""10.1080/0015587X.1950.9718012"", ""10.1086/351373""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Atmospheric Science', 'Oceanography', 'Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0706 大气科学', 0.7502), ('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7343)], [('0707 海洋科学', 0.7516), ('0908 水产', 0.7396)], [('0713 生态学', 0.7488), ('0710 生物学', 0.7317)]]"

This is due to a perspective on arguing and disagreeing. Perspectives enable some thoughts and occlude others. We claim that the way some issues are thought of in aesthetics is conditioned by a similar phenomenon we call ‘the Received Image’ (RI), which parallels the influence on ethics of what Bernard Williams called ‘systems of morality’. Peter Kivy argued that disagreements in aesthetics, if genuine, presuppose that contenders are tacit realists about ‘art-relevant properties’: the motivation for arguing lies in making the adversary acknowledge (epistemic) defeat (in pursuing agreement from others). He draws this conclusion from what he sees as a fundamental difference between aesthetics and ethics. However, in our view, Kivy and his opponents in the semantic meta-debate on disagreement think under the aegis of the RI. We look at disagreements about art from a neo-cognitivist perspective, and argue that heuristic similarities between aesthetics and ethics stand out with an understanding-based epistemology coupled with an adequate theory of artistic form: form as a perspective-generating device whose grasping involves ‘infinitely fine adjustments’.","[{""name"": ""Vítor Guerreiro"", ""affiliation"": [""Instituto de Filosoﬁa - Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto, Via Panorâmica Edgar Cardoso , s/n, 4150-564, Porto , Portugal""]}, {""name"": ""Susana Cadilha"", ""affiliation"": [""IFILNOVA - NOVA FCSH , Av.

Various positions have been proposed, and in this paper I defend what I call hypothetical author-hypothetical intentionalism, the position that interpretation is based on the intention attributed to the author constructed from the work. There are three aims to achieve: (1) to give a general account of hypothetical author-hypothetical intentionalism; (2) to present a moderate version of hypothetical author-hypothetical intentionalism; (3) to defend the moderate version of hypothetical author-hypothetical intentionalism against actual intentionalism and actual author-hypothetical intentionalism. Against the current trend that focuses on actual authors, I hope to show that the hypothetical author account is still a sustainable contender in the intentionalist debate.","[{""name"": ""Szu-Yen Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""Soochow University , Taiwan""]}]","[""10.1093/bjaesthetics/36.3.223"", ""10.1111/1467-9973.00131"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayr006"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1093/mind/C.399.325"", ""10.1093/mind/102.407.413"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551277"", ""10.1093/0199256284.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2005.00195.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199202423.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350928510"", ""10.58519/aesthinv.v4i2.11917"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2006.00016.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12158"", ""10.1515/9783110201727"", ""10.1086/448178"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206179.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp072"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198767213.001.0001"", ""10.1111/sjp.12269"", ""10.1093/0199278067.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jaac.12395"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/22.3.245"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/ayi003"", ""10.1086/448144"", ""10.2307/2185429"", ""10.2307/j.ctv20pxz5d"", ""10.1353/phl.1987.0033"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac52.2.0193"", ""10.1002/9780470776186"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2006.00221.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayq022"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198798347.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781315187136-13"", ""10.1111/jaac.12116"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/19.1.3"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/41.2.192"", ""10.1353/lit.2015.0036"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195177947.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

It brings together a range of essays in different formats by artists and art historians on topics and methods that have been central to the AHRC‐funded Black Artists and Modernism project from which it emerges. In particular, the introduction centralizes the lack of attention paid to the material and conceptual nature of artworks made by Black British artists, and asks how a reappraisal of their work can contribute to an expanded understanding of modernism. Re‐evaluating David Medalla's participatory artwork A Stitch in Time (1967–72), which originated in the late 1960s but has since taken on multiple lives in various locations across the globe, we consider why and how it continues to be occluded from orthodox narratives of conceptual art.","[{""name"": ""Sonia Boyce"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dorothy Price"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Design faculty and doctoral students are hindered in this work by the curricular content and pedagogy of the terminal master's degree. Students graduate from professional MFA design programs often unprepared to pose truly researchable questions, recognize multiple research paradigms and their corresponding standards, structure methodologically rigorous investigations or even author papers longer than a few pages. These shortfalls persist in the scholarly pursuits of many design faculty and extend to the institutional adoption of alternate evaluation criteria from the research thresholds in other fields. Strengthening of the quality in doctoral research and supervision, therefore, depends to some extent on rethinking master's study in design.","[{""name"": ""Meredith Davis"", ""affiliation"": [""Meredith Davis (educator), 3105 Janice Road, Raleigh, NC 27614, U.S.A.""]}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

To understand this claim, we must have a working definition of the term ""cheap art"", which I develop in the first section. In doing so, I focus on four features of cheap art, united by the core idea of anti-elitism, that make it well suited to support creative activism: (1) Cheap art is light, quick, sloppy, and easy to do. (2) Cheap art is made from cheap materials. (3) Cheap art rejects the idea of art as a business created for the artworld elite and aims instead to provide art of the people and for the people. (4) Cheap art challenges its audience members rather than seeking to placate or soothe them. After a brief defense of the claim that cheap art is in fact art, I discuss each aspect in detail, emphasizing its advantages for creative activism. I close with two suggestions for evaluating cheap art, which I argue can be extended to creative activism more broadly.","[{""name"": ""Cathleen Muller"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy and Religious Studies Department, Marist College , Poughkeepsie, New York , USA""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00498.x"", ""10.1162/105420499760347333"", ""10.2307/2022937"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac33.4.0419"", ""10.1353/rdt.2010.0022"", ""10.17077/0021-065X.2206"", ""10.1057/9781137498694"", ""10.2307/1144868"", ""10.1111/phc3.12145"", ""10.4324/9781315850115"", ""10.1111/jaac.12414"", ""10.1215/01903659-2008-026""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The installation comprises multiple agents, distributed in space, that are heard from afar as an incoherent cloud of murmurs. Each agent responds to a visitor's proximity by becoming more visually bright, semantically coherent and sonically clear, revealing a different personal account of a sexual assault survivor.","[{""name"": ""Şölen Kıratlı"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California, Santa Barbara Media Arts and Technology Program 3309 Phelps Hall Santa Barbara, CA 93106 U.S.A.""]}, {""name"": ""Hannah E.

This collaboration led to the development of a novel method of investigating the subconscious brain using films as well as insights on how to create more empathy-evoking films. Finally, the author discusses the relationship between social bias and boundaries of collaboration between filmmaking and neuroscience.","[{""name"": ""Mamdooh Afdile"", ""affiliation"": [""Mamdooh Afdile, Aalto University, Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Finland.

Looking closely at Adrian Piper’s Four Intruders Plus Alarm Systems (1980), I consider why this is an important concern for activist art and assess three different responses in relation to Piper’s work. What I call the ‘conciliatory stance’ recommends that when activist artists encounter misunderstanding, they should downplay their experimental artistry in favor of fitting their work to their audience’s appreciative capacities. What I call the ‘steadfast stance’ recommends that activist artists have reason to use their privilege of artistic exceptionalism to challenge their audience’s expectations, even if this leads to misunderstanding. I claim that a middle position, which I call ‘liberal conciliation’, best balances the demands for actual change placed on activism and the experimental means that artists bring to activism.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Earley"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department, University of Warwick , Coventry , UK""]}]","[""10.5406/jaesteduc.50.4.0001"", ""10.5406/15437809.56.1.01"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198826903.001.0001"", ""10.1111/jaac.12633"", ""10.1086/589532"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayn058"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9570-8"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197519769.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz007"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-17657-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929023.001.0001"", ""10.1111/sjp.12301"", ""10.5749/j.ctvb1hrcf"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays023"", ""10.1111/jaac.12414"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayab018""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Philosophy', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Participants were asked to view monocularly and binocularly. Their average forward-backward (anteroposterior) body sway root mean square (rms) velocity was significantly greater viewing it monocularly. Participants showed diverse reactions to the artwork, yet comments mainly concerned apparent movement and depth. The authors conclude that binocular viewing facilitates viewer appreciation of the proximity of the central X, thus requiring less energy to keep the body stable. This study confirms the artist’s success in involving viewers actively in their aesthetic experience through their eye and body movements.","[{""name"": ""Lindsey M.

First, I discuss Heidegger’s interpretation of art following his assessment of the failure of metaphysical language to ‘unconceal’ the truth of Being. Second, I analyse, with specific reference to his interpretation of Hölderlin, what I reckon to be the core thread of Heidegger’s philosophy of art, namely his antisubjectivism. Third, I turn to Hegel’s end of art thesis, showing how for him, as well as for Heidegger, the highest function of art is necessarily connected to antisubjectivism, and hence, under the conditions of modernity, is a thing of the past. Finally, I address Heidegger’s reference to Hegel’s thesis, and claim that, while Hegel fully remains within the horizon of modernity, thus affirming the irreversible pastness of art, Heidegger envisages the possibility of abandoning the fundamental orientation of modernity, and hence of revoking the thesis of the pastness of art.","[{""name"": ""Alberto L Siani"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Pisa""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

El análisis realizado muestra que las aves de presa constituyen la fauna más representada en el sitio, registrándose un énfasis en la unidad pico-cabeza, la cual actúa como sinécdoque del animal figurado.

I argue that this account is methodologically and existentially unacceptable: methodologically because it is overly speculative, and existentially because it betrays authentic existence. I critique Gadamer from the perspective of William James’ Pragmatism and argue, inverting Gadamer’s main thesis, that hermeneutics should be reduced to aesthetic experience. The meaning that emerges in aesthetic experience does not ‘rise up’ from the depths but is immanent in what James calls ‘pure experience’. The unfathomable, therefore, is not a glimpse into the metaphysical abyss but a phenomenological insight into the immanent structure of experience.","[{""name"": ""Mark Gilks"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Kent""]}]","[""10.3366/edinburgh/9780748686223.001.0001"", ""10.1037/10004-000"", ""10.2307/468585""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Health', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7421), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7304)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The purpose of this essay is to explore the semiotics and phenomenology of this specifically Jewish visual idiom, and to suggest that its presence lies at the intersection of language, philosophy, poetry, and history. In the Mahzor, zoocephaly signals distinction that collapses temporalities, tests the limits of alterity, and engages in a sophisticated word–image play that strives to establish visceral connections with the community of the manuscript's users. Hammelburg zoocephali invoke the fragility of the human condition by establishing reverberating relationships between themselves and other inhabitants of the Mahzor's pages: echoes of many, avatars of none. Outwardly monstrous yet emphatically human, these zoocephali prove to be particularly excellent images to think with about the place of Hebrew manuscripts in the long history of medieval visual culture.","[{""name"": ""Elina Gertsman"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Religious studies', 'Archeology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

What, according to him, is the function of the aesthetic? My answer consists of three parts: first, I argue that Wittgenstein finds himself in an aporia of normative consciousness – that is to say, a problem with regard to our awareness of the world in terms of its relation to a norm. Second, I argue that the function of Wittgenstein’s aesthetic writings is to deal with this aporia. Third, through a comparison with Friedrich Schlegel’s writings on allegory, I try to show that the way in which Wittgenstein resolves the aporia renders him a Romanticist philosopher. The point of an aesthetic interaction, for Wittgenstein, is that it can render clear what cannot be described without running against the walls of our cage: the absolute. Through aesthetic interactions we are able to (indirectly) access a ground for norms by which we experience ourselves as unconditionally bound.","[{""name"": ""Clinton Peter Verdonschot"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/CBO9781139164382""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Philosophy'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Having demonstrated that these words were used in very different semantic contexts in the beginning, middle, and end of the century, the article presents semantic network diagrams which further demonstrate the distinctness of noun from adjective. I argue that while ‘beautiful’ is suspended in a semantic space that is recognizably aesthetic, ‘beauty’ is not. Furthermore, that which is deemed ‘beautiful,’ according to the evidence presented here, presents something of a challenge to received narratives of how the concept of aesthetics developed throughout the eighteenth century.","[{""name"": ""John Regan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, United Kingdom""]}]","[""10.1075/ijcl.21.2.01bak"", ""10.1075/ijcl.20.2.01bre"", ""10.1515/9780823254415"", ""10.2307/j.ctt22726zj"", ""10.1075/fol.2.1.03stu""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Finance', 'Museology']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7025), ('0714 统计学', 0.696)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

It argues that mere real things and artworks not only belong to different categories, but that these categories are themselves of different kinds—the former being closed, and the latter open. Viewing mere real things through the lens of art leads to confusion. Amending Goodman’s question, ‘When is art?’, this article suggests that one can only arrive at working definitions of what constitutes both an artwork and a mere real thing on the basis of contingent function. The adequate analysis of any given thing or action necessitates viewing it in accordance with an appropriate paradigm, whether that of an artwork, a thought experiment, or even a prank.

The fourteenth-century murals at the Tibetan temple of Shalu integrate pictures with long passages of Tibetan texts and select inscriptions that explain the powers of seeing paintings. The murals combine and mix media—books, paintings, cloth—into expressive wholes that ultimately argue that walls are in fact much more than walls. The paintings find ways to make the temple's book collections more accessible. Here we find a public art effort that weaves together a compelling argument for why religious texts and religious art both “work” for and on their audiences. Shalu was a grandly expanded temple showing off its resources and its connections in a broader cosmopolitan sphere of production and exchange. Its walls were designed to weave media together, finding ways to celebrate and explain larger and newer corporate productions (book projects, larger monasteries). An intentional play of materiality (clay, cloth, book) emphasized by the inscriptions and performed in the pictorial compositions assists in the imaginative act of directly seeing deities, while also playing with the awareness that acts of imagination entail the play of just-like/seeing-as. Since neither clay nor cloth nor word on their own are adequate vessels for representing an enlightened being, here they collaborate with each other and with viewers in the imaginative act, promising that the deity, like the teachings, can be directly experienced.","[{""name"": ""Sarah Richardson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/156852707X244306"", ""10.2307/3250123""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Religious studies', 'Anthropology', 'Geography, Planning and Development']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)]]"

Cases are presented in which this evidential rule, and not some rule that invokes counterfactuals or intentions, is what explains what is fictional. Applications are made to the question of interpretive pluralism and the problem of imaginative resistance. In the background is pluralism about fictionality: the evidential rule is one of a variety of rules that are needed to account for what is fictional in a story.","[{""name"": ""Bradford Skow"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge, MA , USA""]}]","[""10.1093/oso/9780198831525.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00048409312345022"", ""10.5325/j.ctv14gp0qq.20"", ""10.1007/978-1-349-00146-0"", ""10.1111/jaac.12397"", ""10.1080/00048402.2016.1149736"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206179.003.0019"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu027"", ""10.1002/9780470776186"", ""10.1111/j.0031-8094.2005.00419.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-007-9198-5"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/19.1.3"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00367.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Philosophy', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Law']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

What are the epistemic and methodological problems it has addressed, and how? What is the field heading towards in the current scholarly environment? A self-reflexive conception of the history of EA is still lacking, although EA research is acquiring more and more perspectives from different disciplinary viewpoints. I will present a bird’s-eye view of EA by identifying and positioning three of its major currents in relation to each other.

Methods are divided into two basic categories, beginning with translations from 2D graphic conventions to those that incorporate 3D mesh geometries. They are first discussed in principle and thereafter demonstrated on actual gaze data of sculptural reproductions. The tracing of eye movements of objects in the round required consideration of variables typically unaccounted for in conventional eye-tracking visualization, most importantly with regards to the moving position of the viewing eye. A major advantage of 3D visualizations is the capacity to present gaze information simultaneously on obverse, reverse, and oblique surfaces of perceptual attention. The included methods provided for effective communication of a subject’s perceptual distribution over potentially complex stimulus geometries.","[{""name"": ""Eugene Han"", ""affiliation"": [""Eugene Han, Department of Art, Architecture, and Design, Lehigh University, 113 Research Drive, Building C, Bethlehem, PA 18015, U.S.A.

Whereas the figure of the sitter, and even the background, are highly finished, the bust is sketched in the most general of outlines. The painting's purposeful incompleteness, this essay argues, stems from Velázquez's experience as a censor of royal portraits. These images were subjected to strictures because they were said to be surrogates of the monarch rather than mere representations. By suspending work on the king's bust in the painting, Velázquez astutely fulfilled the demands of depicting a fellow artist at work on his most important commission, while circumventing the subtle codes for making royal images. Although there was concern that the larger corpus of kingly portraiture could be destabilized by exemplars that did not fit its general parameters, individual artists and monarchs actually developed idiosyncratic solutions for representing the king with some frequency. Velázquez's portrait, which represents one such solution, is examined alongside, and contrasted against, a number of other examples, in order to demonstrate the flexibility of this seemingly rigid image type.","[{""name"": ""Adam Jasienski"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Political Science and International Relations', 'Museology', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

Relic value includes an object’s age, aura, originality, authenticity, and epistemic value. Aesthetic value is connected to how an object looks, sounds, or tastes. Practical value involves whether a thing can be used as designed—whether a book can be read, a building occupied, a car driven. I argue that while these are all legitimate values, it is impossible for a restorer to maximize them all. I conclude that restoration inexorably involves aesthetic choices; there is no supreme value to be maximized and we should be pluralists about the right balance of values. Restoration is like baking a cake; there are many wrong ways to do it, but there are many right ways as well.","[{""name"": ""Steven D Hales"", ""affiliation"": [""Bloomsburg University , USA""]}]","[""10.1038/29667"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226351223.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayt013"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2006.00211.x"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11270.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190904876.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/21.4.336"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayw041"", ""10.1111/phc3.12379"", ""10.2307/20646641"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/38.1.66""]","['Environmental Science', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Geography, Planning and Development', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7657), ('0705 地理学', 0.7617)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

The extent to which the painting is regarded as a typical example of the style is called its style prototypicality. The authors propose a method of quantifying style prototypicalities and conduct an experiment to validate this method using the drift rate parameter of the drift diffusion model. This parameter is calculated using participants’ decision-making response times.

Although type realists seem to agree that types, unlike properties, are objects in their own right, they argue that there is a metaphysically intimate tie between the existence conditions of types and properties. In particular, most type realists believe that types are, in a certain sense, determined by the properties that underlie them. I argue that this is a mistake, especially for those type realists who believe that social and cultural types such as works of music and fiction or words are artifacts. I offer an alternative version of type realism where social and cultural types are dependent objects that should be understood in analogy with concrete artifacts.","[{""name"": ""Nurbay Irmak"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Bogazici University , Istanbul 34342 , Turkey""]}]","[""10.1093/bjaesthetics/25.1.43"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayn022"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/44.2.113"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayj004"", ""10.1080/00048402.2017.1281323"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/40.4.424"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s10670-021-00400-1"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.2.105"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02672-6"", ""10.1057/9780230227453_2"", ""10.1080/00455091.2017.1357993"", ""10.1111/jaac.12435"", ""10.2307/2025596"", ""10.1111/jaac.12579"", ""10.1111/jaac.12714"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00182"", ""10.1093/mind/102.407.429"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.1.73"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayt026"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262013017.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Standard interpretations hold that the connection lies in the fact that tragedies depict characters (primarily the hero) exercising autonomy. This paper argues that Schiller also views the experience prompted by tragedy as itself involving autonomy. Drawing on Kant’s discussion of aesthetic “symbols”, Schiller holds that the audience members’ experience at the tragedy is isomorphic with the autonomous exercise of practical reason. Only in this way, I argue, can we make sense of Schiller’s contention that tragedy actively cultivates freedom in its viewers. Additionally, the interpretation shows how Schiller can hold that tragedy yields a kind of cognition of transcendental freedom while maintaining Kantian strictures on noumenal knowledge.","[{""name"": ""Timothy Stoll"", ""affiliation"": [""Timothy StollBirkbeck College, University of London , UK""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511612671"", ""10.1093/actrade/9780198747116.book.1"", ""10.1093/019928282X.001.0001"", ""10.1515/kant-2020-0015"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayl023"", ""10.1080/00048400701571677"", ""10.1515/9783110220049.4.177"", ""10.1515/kant-2020-0016"", ""10.1515/9781438472218-004"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/33.4.333"", ""10.1515/9781400859382"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139172516"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840876"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv029"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139170765"", ""10.1093/monist/onz013"", ""10.1111/phc3.12558"", ""10.2307/401291""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Philosophy'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

In this paper, I focus specifically on how artists might make use of AI to create art. Most existing discourse analogizes AI to a tool or collaborator; this focuses our attention on AI’s contribution to the production of an artistically significant output. I propose an alternative approach, the exploration paradigm, which suggests that artists instead relate to AI as a participant: artists create a space for interaction with the AI algorithm by way of their prompts, thereby allowing them to explore the way that the algorithm ‘sees’ and ‘represents’. AI art practised in this fashion bears a striking resemblance to contemporary conceptual and participatory art. Viewing AI art in this way has implications for the appreciation of style in AI art; concerns about novelty and originality; and the assignment of artistic credit and copyright.","[{""name"": ""Anthony Cross"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Texas State University , San Marcos ,""]}]","[""10.1080/0020174X.2023.2261503"", ""10.1145/3475799"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/19.4.302"", ""10.1111/phc3.12760"", ""10.1162/daed_a_01902"", ""10.3390/arts7020018"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199688210.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11229-020-02696-y"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayq029"", ""10.1002/9781119053194"", ""10.1093/pq/pqv026"", ""10.1145/3442188.3445869"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpad046""]","['Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Safety Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)]]"

Using the archive of Mildred Archer (1911–2005), the British Library curator who formalized this approach in Western scholarship in tandem with scholarly commentaries by art enthusiasts P. C. Manuk (1873–1946) and Rai Krishnadas (1892–1980), we highlight the complexities of Company painting as both modality and practice. Providing insight into the little-recognized role of Ishwari Prasad (1870–1949), whom Archer and Manuk lauded as the last living artist of the Mughal tradition, we examine his vanguard formulation of a Kampani qalam (“Company style”), where he reframed Mughal art in the era of Company mercantilism and thriving exchange between European and Indian artists at Patna. Further, Prasad emerges as a key interlocutor between the critic and educator E. B. Havell (1861–1934) and the artist Abanindranath Tagore (1871–1951), integrating Mughal and Company lineages within the growing pan-Asian sensibility at the Calcutta School of Art. Foregrounding Prasad's obscured history illuminates how ideas of Mughal, Company, and Modern art belonged to a common intellectual ferment; yet these approaches took separate paths in post-independence India. In tracing the genealogy of Archer's Company painting, we recover multiple voices and strands of artistry informing its gestation in addition to its colonial legacy, complicating Archer's focus on it as an artistic inheritance of the British Empire.","[{""name"": ""Holly Shaffer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuthika Sharma"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Perceptually based aesthetic properties are used to identify objects, to compare them to others, to evaluate them, and to describe them as we seek to interpret or find meaning in them. This set of activities requires aesthetic properties that do not change, or at least not much, if any degree of normativity is to be maintained. But those aesthetic properties that are derived from our immediate sensations of a garden only describe a garden at a certain time, under certain conditions, in certain states—all of which change constantly. Both descriptions are useful, and perhaps necessary, for appreciating gardens.","[{""name"": ""David Fenner"", ""affiliation"": [""University of North Florida , USA""]}]","[""10.1002/9781444324563.ch10"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199290345.001.0001"", ""10.2979/ETE.2006.11.1.1"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197753590.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01390.x"", ""10.1002/9781444324563.ch13"", ""10.4324/9780203827895""]",['Environmental Science'],['Nature and Landscape Conservation'],"[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

Perhaps that is because several fundamental questions about it remain unanswered: Where and when was it made? Who made it, and for whom? What purpose and meaning did it have for the first people who saw it and those who subsequently came into contact with it? In this essay, I begin to address these elementary questions. I establish that this eleven-foot-long scroll was created in Mewar in western India in 1769, and that since then it has cleaved many realms. Those realms include art and devotion, text and textile, astral science and genealogy, classical epics and vernacular histories, and cyclical time and linear time. I then postulate that understanding this short scroll's ability to nimbly separate and join those realms can help us critically appreciate the forms, layouts, and functions of two other contemporaneous cloth scrolls from the same region that are considerably longer and also have received sparse scholarly attention. Ultimately, I show how micro studies of scrolls and scrolling practices can allow us to understand forms of knowledge in Mewar on the eve of British colonialism, and to participate in challenging certain perceptions of the region's past that remain inflected by James Tod's writings nearly two hundred years after their publication.","[{""name"": ""Nachiket Chanchani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/2801395"", ""10.2307/596305"", ""10.2307/605310"", ""10.1080/00043249.1990.10792720"", ""10.33999/2019.06"", ""10.30610/1.2016.4"", ""10.1017/S0026749X11000527"", ""10.1093/past/38.1.56""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Anthropology', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Utilizing insights from affect theory, cultural psychology, and affective neuroscience, this article argues for the need for pedagogies that substantively engage with the cultural specificity of emotion, affect, and voice to create more just practices and experiences within the training studio and in performance.","[{""name"": ""Christine Hamel"", ""affiliation"": [""Boston University School of Theatre, Boston University ,""]}, {""name"": ""Ann J Cahill"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Elon University ,""]}]","[""10.1002/acp.1290"", ""10.1080/23268263.2019.1543151"", ""10.5040/9781350169623"", ""10.1215/9780822393047-009"", ""10.1080/02699939208411068"", ""10.5325/jspecphil.33.4.0590"", ""10.5325/jspecphil.34.3.0309"", ""10.1080/09502380500365473"", ""10.1037/amp0000147"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.1987.tb01062.x"", ""10.1016/j.iswa.2023.200266"", ""10.2307/1354446"", ""10.1080/23268263.2017.1397254"", ""10.1177/1464700112442635"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00798"", ""10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145102"", ""10.2307/j.ctv11smq37"", ""10.5040/9781350030886"", ""10.1080/23268263.2021.1892960"", ""10.1016/j.tins.2020.09.010"", ""10.1111/sjp.12307""]",['Psychology'],"['Social Psychology', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

But the tradition also acknowledges less paradigmatic cases, including sometimes mathematical structures or abstract concepts. In this paper, we argue that there is also a case for considering phenomenal consciousness—the experiential quality of subjective awareness—as a sublime phenomenon. One appreciates this, we argue, when one is struck by (fitting) awe upon contemplating (a) the perplexing existence of something like phenomenal consciousness in an otherwise completely material universe and (b) the role of consciousness in injecting meaning and value in an otherwise brutally factual reality.","[{""name"": ""Takuya Niikawa"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Humanities, Kobe University, Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Uriah Kriegel"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Rice University ,""]}]","[""10.1093/aesthj/ayaa030"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199579938.001.0001"", ""10.1111/nous.12434"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139018098"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab023"", ""10.1093/mind/xlviii.189.1"", ""10.2307/2103988"", ""10.1007/s11406-017-9814-3"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11006.001.0001"", ""10.1111/nous.12310"", ""10.1111/phpr.12641"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594x.2008.00285.x"", ""10.1093/nc/niz016"", ""10.1111/phc3.12807"", ""10.1093/analys/anz045"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayac022"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0114.1983.tb00207.x"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/43.2.158"", ""10.1080/24740500.2017.1287034"", ""10.4324/9781315148496-2"", ""10.2307/2183914"", ""10.1007/s12152-022-09483-1"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayaa033"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198845850.003.0006"", ""10.1086/664753"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayaa047"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab002"", ""10.4324/9781315396347"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198845850.003.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199917662.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2006.00007.x"", ""10.1080/09608780701605036"", ""10.1007/s11098-018-1090-y"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139165860.003"", ""10.7591/9781501711350""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Such instances challenge not only Benjamin’s claim about the loss of aura but also Goodman’s distinction between autographic and allographic arts. The article proposes to rethink the original/copy dualism from the perspective of the cult image. In the devotional traditions of Graeco-Roman polytheism as well as Christianity and Buddhism, cult images are approached not as representations, but as animated entities endowed with thaumaturgic powers that can be ritually transferred onto copies. From this perspective, replication is not about reproducing more or less faithfully the original, but engendering a double as effective as the original. Finally, the bearing of this perspective on contemporary works of art is considered.","[{""name"": ""Maurizio Peleggi"", ""affiliation"": [""National University of Singapore , Singapore""]}]","[""10.1163/9789004450899"", ""10.1515/9780824862367"", ""10.1515/9781400844425"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199279456.013.0014"", ""10.2307/1483746"", ""10.1163/9789004379121_003"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226259031.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8365.2006.00501.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198280132.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350928541"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8365.1979.tb00031.x"", ""10.2307/1522587"", ""10.1515/9781503619968"", ""10.1057/9780230607149"", ""10.1080/00043249.1990.10792724"", ""10.2307/1291064"", ""10.1007/BF00419336"", ""10.1515/9781503626676"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195147353.001.0001"", ""10.1515/9780691216027"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8365.2006.00498.x""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Our experience of dance thus lends itself to a range of crossmodal judgments, that is, our perception of dance enables us to make claims that purport to be about how bodily movements which can be visually seen fit together with aspects of the music which can be heard or felt. But we are not determined to perceive every case of fit unproblematically. That it is possible one may fail to initially perceive a fit that others claim ought to be viewable suggests that there is a normative dimension to this phenomenon. In this article, I argue that we can explain the source of this normativity with a multisensory account of dance. More specifically, I argue that dance is a novel feature type, a feature of perceptual experience that is essentially multimodal. The basic perception of dance, which grounds more sophisticated forms of judgment concerning crossmodal fit downstream, is the actualization of a unique multisensory capacity that non-inferentially tracks a real, fundamental connection between music and movement.","[{""name"": ""Tyler Olsson"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Auburn University , Auburn, AL , USA""]}]","[""10.1093/pq/pqaa049"", ""10.4324/9781315303673-70"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/43.3.209"", ""10.1073/pnas.0507704102"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691517.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpac055"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0048496"", ""10.1007/s11097-010-9191-x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199347773.003.0005"", ""10.1007/s11098-015-0545-7"", ""10.1073/pnas.1209023110"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2021.09.043"", ""10.7551/mitpress/8466.001.0001"", ""10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00337-3"", ""10.1007/s00426-008-0163-5""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

By projecting Kant’s and Schiller’s conceptions of aesthetic autonomy and the moral relevance of art onto the qiyun-focused context, we see that the reflection on parallels and differences between the two cultural traditions helps to better understand the moral dimension of qiyun aesthetics.","[{""name"": ""Xiaoyan Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Focusing on the seventh-century Cave 209, I examine the first set of mountain panels at Dunhuang, arguing that those polychrome landscapes represent Vulture Peak, the sacred abode of Śākyamuni Buddha. Cave 209 shows how Lady Vaidehī—the protagonist of the Meditation Sutra—emerges as the first female viewer of landscape in Chinese art. Departing from the Meditation Sutra, painters at Dunhuang resituate Lady Vaidehī, the formerly imprisoned royal consort and model Pure Land adept, within mountain ranges where she converses with the Buddha. I argue that Lady Vaidehī's encounter with the Buddha is mapped onto the space of a Dunhuang cave to enable the viewer to assume her position when facing the icon of Śākyamuni surrounded by Vulture Peak. By grappling with Vaidehī's imprisonment, painters use landscape to develop a new spatial imagery of salvation. I maintain that the striking innovations in landscape representation at Dunhuang—achievements that have been seen to anticipate later Tang “blue and green” landscapes—are in actuality based on an effort to visualize Buddhist soteriology in the early seventh century.","[{""name"": ""Anne N.

Johnston [Zhuang Shidun] 莊士敦 (1874–1938), among them an album by the Nanjing painter Chen Shu 陳舒 (active ca. 1649–ca. 1687) from the ex-Qing (1644–1911) imperial collection and an inscribed folding fan. These are now reunited in the library collection of SOAS University of London, where Johnston taught Chinese after his return to Britain in 1931. Together with Puyi's preface transcribed by courtier-calligrapher Zheng Xiaoxu 鄭孝胥 (1860–1938) for Johnston's memoir, Twilight in the Forbidden City (1934), these artworks pave the way for an investigation of the practice of connoisseurship at Puyi's court-in-exile in China's era of modernism, including Puyi's use of the imperial collection and his selection of these gifts even while he was shaping to become Japan's puppet emperor in Manchuria (r. 1934–1945). The study roams beyond the well-known network of Puyi and his court advisers among the yilao 遺老 (Qing “old guard”) to uncover an unexpected modernist connection with the progressive young artist, publisher, and tastemaker Zheng Wuchang 鄭午昌 (1894–1952), a leading actor in the reform of guohua 國畫 ink painting. This study rediscovers how Zheng Wuchang contributed the painting to an inscribed handscroll, Flight of the Dragon (or, A Storm and a Marvel 風異圖), which commemorated, for the court's inner circle, Puyi's dramatic escape from the Forbidden City amid the realities of a modern, Republican world.","[{""name"": ""Shane McCausland"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1017/S1356186300006647"", ""10.1017/S0041977X00075145"", ""10.1215/00666637-3788654""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

However, the genre was not completely abandoned by modern Korean writers. Few critics have noted the continuing role played by the rich Korean fable tradition, which eventually made the reinvention of the genre in the mass media possible. In particular, it is worth noting that there was the emergence of a new subgenre of fable in the late nineteenth century: that is, fabulous court case fiction, which is quite distinct from the Chinese literary tradition that had underprivileged imaginative narrative texts under the absolute domination of Confucian historiography. The genre of fabulous court case fiction makes us reconsider the plurality of narrative forms and various narrative functions. In this study, I examine how imaginative narrative texts such as fables simultaneously pursue the pleasure of storytelling and the purposes of both moral and specialized (legal) education.","[{""name"": ""Sohyeon Park"", ""affiliation"": [""The Academy of East Asian Studies, Sungkyunkwan University , Seoul , Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1515/9780691243757-003"", ""10.25024/kj.2019.59.2.61"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139522502"", ""10.1515/9780691243757-004""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Drawing on Robin Nelson’s multimodal conceptualization of artistic research and Bruno Latour’s model of science as a circulatory system of heterogeneous human and nonhuman phenomena, the author characterizes sci-art as a form of posthuman praxis, which opens new epistemic positions through transversal forms of inquiry, thereby revealing shared human/nonhuman cultures. Sci-art is thus proposed as a means of drawing together humans and nonhumans into more productive, empathic associations.","[{""name"": ""Jacob Thompson-Bell"", ""affiliation"": [""Jacob Thompson-Bell, Leeds Conservatoire, 3 Quarry Hill, Leeds, LS72PD, U.K. Email: j.thompson-bell@lcm.ac.uk.

For Baudelaire, dissonance depends on consonance in order to be perceived at all, a fact which allows us to read the modern not just in terms of a break with the past but also as dependent on it. This essay demonstrates the mutually constitutive nature of consonance and dissonance by placing Baudelaire and Adorno’s writings on dissonance, with reference to the music of Beethoven, into a constellation that allows for insight into the function of ‘modern’ dissonance. It argues that Baudelaire’s approach is both new and dependent on long-standing understandings of dissonance and harmony, and that Adorno’s writings, in conjunction with Baudelaire’s, can make us attentive to the dissonance that operates within harmony rather than standing opposed to it.","[{""name"": ""Joseph Acquisto"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Vermont, USA""]}]","[""10.1515/9781503615335"", ""10.1515/9781400864201"", ""10.2307/3731682"", ""10.1017/CCOL0521772893.010"", ""10.4324/9781315102733-2"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226519876.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198816706.001.0001""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Literature and Literary Theory'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)]]"

While Kant himself would likely side with contemporary theorists who deny that aesthetic considerations, on their own, give rise to oughts and obligations, I argue that Kant’s theory nevertheless gives us resources for explaining the normative force of aesthetic reasons. On this account, while aesthetic properties (in particular, beauty) give us merely enticing or inviting reasons, these reasons acquire greater normative force in the context of aesthetic communities. Insofar as we are members of such communities, we take on special obligations to attend to, appreciate, and preserve particular beautiful objects.","[{""name"": ""Jessica J.

Although this work earned her a fruitful affiliation with the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York, its ‘feminine’ delicacy distinguished it from the bold styles generally associated with the artist's abstract expressionist peers. Revisiting the presupposition of a ‘feminine’ touch, this essay assesses the collages in light of Ryan's expertise as a sewer. Drawing from feminist theories on the significance of everyday embodied knowledge, it is argued that the artist defined the limits of her practice through careful material and tactile choices, demonstrating what is proposed to be a craft expertise engrained over a lifetime of handling threads and fabrics. Such claims, in turn, have broader bearing on how we continue to write about the relationship between modernist art and the structures, skills, and habits of the domestic everyday.","[{""name"": ""Susan Richmond"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

In Georg Simmel’s classic formulation, articles of personal adornment work to enhance an individual’s social persona by magnifying their Ausstrahlung. While medieval Christian devotional jewels were well-equipped to operate in this manner, their true significance lay elsewhere. Objects such as pectoral crosses, reliquary rings, rosaries, and prayer nuts were designed not so much to mediate between self and society, but rather to stage and facilitate an encounter of the self with itself. Focusing on Byzantine devotional neck pendants, or enkolpia, this essay considers how religiously significant wearables participated in introspective spiritual practices aimed at forming and reforming the Christian subject. The essay, more specifically, attends to the enkolpion as an instrument of self-imposed discipline and explores how the corporeal experience of carrying this object and feeling its weight, however minimal, on the body contributed to the wearer’s cultivation of inner vigilance.","[{""name"": ""Ivan Drpić"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Classics', 'Archeology', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.6825), ('0602 中国史', 0.6817)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

While extant treatments of the aesthetics of video games can be used to rebut the strong version, the weak version remains recalcitrant.

More specifically, I examine how cultural memory is formed through cultural artifacts that embody a connection to the past via aesthetic means. My approach is motivated by artifacts from small-scale preindustrial societies, which make it apparent that aesthetic values, rather than being pursued for their own sake alone, enhance other functions, such as maintaining cultural identity and bringing the past into the present. I focus on rock art painting from the Kimberley, Australia, and effigies animated during rituals in New Ireland, Papua New Guinea to argue that, to play a significant role in the formation of cultural memory, aesthetic value must be aligned with implicit conceptions of time which inform the production of artifacts mediating cultural memory. This argument has implications for understanding differences in apprehending memory values and aesthetic values across cultural domains.","[{""name"": ""Ancuta Mortu"", ""affiliation"": [""ANCUTA MORTU, Faculty of Arts, Department of Art History, Masaryk University , Veveří 470/28, Brno-Střed Brno 602 00 , Czech Republic""]}]","[""10.1515/9783110207262.2.109"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511759185"", ""10.1002/9781118253892.ch27"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511626999.018"", ""10.2307/j.ctv177tj8r.5"", ""10.1080/09515080600690573"", ""10.1353/jae.2005.0011"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2004.00156.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2006.00439.x"", ""10.4324/9781003158806-2-6"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192862648.003.0009"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107444973"", ""10.1177/135918359700200102"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198767213.003.0004"", ""10.1002/9781118253892"", ""10.1080/02666286.2001.10435723"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00102"", ""10.1017/S095977431300053X""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Anthropology', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

These judgments follow an evidentiary structure that is common to the evaluation of other aesthetic objects: summary judgments evidenced by the attribution of narrow formal aesthetic properties, “formal-adjacent” aesthetic properties, and relevant contextual relations. Yet, in a garden, these evidencing properties and relations take on forms that are different from those of other aesthetic and/or art objects. In this article, I consider these differences and consider whether aesthetic analyses of gardens rest on one or more conceptual mistakes. In the end, I conclude that we can meet all challenges.","[{""name"": ""David Fenner"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies, University of North Florida , Jacksonville, FL , USA""]}]","[""10.2307/3331996"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/43.2.101"", ""10.2979/ETE.2006.11.1.1"", ""10.1093/oso/9780197753590.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01390.x"", ""10.3368/lj.24.1.85"", ""10.3368/lj.26.2.302"", ""10.1007/BF00419336"", ""10.3368/lj.7.2.149"", ""10.3368/lj.14.1.46"", ""10.4324/9780203589335"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00196""]","['Environmental Science', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)]]"

For Langer, musical time is exclusively felt time, and in this sense, music is ‘time made audible’. However, Langer also postulates a ‘strong suspension thesis’: the swallowing up of clock time in the illusion of felt time. In this essay, we take issue with the ‘strong suspension thesis’, its philosophic foundation and its implications. We argue that this thesis is overstated and misdirecting insofar as it purports to describe what we experience when we hear music with understanding, and that it rests on a contested presupposition concerning the conceptual primacy of memory-time.","[{""name"": ""Eran Guter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Inbal Guter"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

It can even admit non-moral factors as subterranean influences on moral assessment. Nevertheless, the view requires that the characters we most favour are those with the highest moral standing, and this does not seem to be true of the character arc story (Kelly, 2020). Rather, the mixture of good and bad impulses in the protagonist is set off by the unalloyed moral example of the moral centre, a supporting character whose fate may barely interest us. We conclude that narrative theory is better served by allowing the moral hierarchy of a story to differ from the rank order of its allegiances, and hence that audience affiliation is not simply a matter of moral assessment.","[{""name"": ""Rory Kelly"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California , USA""]}, {""name"": ""Samuel Cumming"", ""affiliation"": [""University of California , USA""]}]","[""10.7208/chicago/9780226065595.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12501"", ""10.1111/jaac.12440"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01520.x"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199275731.003.0009"", ""10.1525/9780520943919"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4975.2010.00204.x"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01682.x"", ""10.1515/9783110232424.3.232"", ""10.1177/1745691614556679"", ""10.1093/screen/hjt004""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

I take it as significant that philosophers have turned their attention to “street art” and not, say, “urban outdoor art” or “site-specific art in urban settings.” The “street” in street art seems to imply more than a location or geographic modifier. I consider the further significance of the “street” in street art, and the view, argued or assumed, of the street when philosophers discuss street art. My second target in this article is what I have called the “discontinuity thesis.” This is the idea, defended or assumed in some of the most important philosophical writing about street art, that street art represents a radical break with the artworld and is “antithetical” to it. I argue that the discontinuity thesis is mistaken, and that to understand the larger institutional context of street art we must examine the sociology of artworlds. Street art has followed a familiar process and pioneering street artists are best seen as “mavericks” in Howard Becker’s sense. I argue that seeing street artists in this way can help better understand and appreciate their work.","[{""name"": ""Jeanette Bicknell"", ""affiliation"": [""Independent Scholar , Toronto , Canada""]}]","[""10.15695/amqst.v2i1.46"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv030"", ""10.1093/monist/onx033"", ""10.1111/jaac.12261"", ""10.1111/jaac.12325"", ""10.2307/2022937"", ""10.1111/jaac.12157"", ""10.1111/jaac.12280"", ""10.7710/1526-0569.1545""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies', 'Law']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

The author traces this work back to their earlier piece, Keep This Leaflet. You May Need to Read It Again (2014), a seminal creation in their criptech journey.

Departing from traditional art‐historical accounts which treat Robert Delaunay's simultanism as a painterly, modernist practice, I situate Sonia Delaunay's fashions and her attendant publicity as an avant‐gardist move from art into life. Throughout, the essay traces how Delaunay strategically photographed herself wearing her dresses and promoted the circulation of such photographs within the popular and avant‐garde press as a means of generating visibility and attention for herself as a (woman) artist. Highlighting the gendered constraints that originally led her to the applied arts, the essay ultimately argues that Delaunay offers an early and alternative art‐into‐life narrative of the avant‐garde: one in which a woman artist embraces the everyday and the decorative arts only to turn that embrace into a highly visible, public, and sellable production.","[{""name"": ""Rachel Silveri"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"
10.33134/eeja.289,ESTETIKA-THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory; 0101 Philosophy,Somaesthetics in Baumgarten? The Founding of Aesthetics and the Body,"In the presentation of his project about ‘somaesthetics’, Richard Shusterman claimed that the recurring neglect of the body in aesthetics was disastrously introduced by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762) in his first formulation of aesthetics as a discipline in the mid-eighteenth century. In the present essay I aim to call this thesis into question, investigating for the first time the role of the body in Baumgarten’s thought and focusing on its significance for the founding of aesthetics. First, I consider Baumgarten’s doctrine of the body in general and of the human body in particular, in its relationship with the soul. I then turn to discuss Baumgarten’s resumption of the scholastic discipline of ‘somatology’ as a philosophical investigation of the body in both its theoretical and practical – namely, dietetical, side. On these bases, I deal with two examples of dietetic embellishment of the body, one presented by Baumgarten himself (cosmetics) and the other put forward by his pupil and co-founder of disciplinary aesthetics Georg Friedrich Meier (physical exercise and somatic fine arts). Subsequently, I explore the ways in which Meier and Baumgarten use dietetics to foster beautiful thinking. Finally, I conclude that nascent aesthetics is concerned with the aesthetic care of the body both insofar as the body can be a stage of aesthetic value and insofar as the body is a necessary presupposition for beautiful thinking.","[{""name"": ""Alessandro Nannini"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Computer Science', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Food Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Information Systems']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7748), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7384)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)]]"

Where telling that p proceeds by recruiting an addressee’s capacity to recognize trustworthy informants, showing does not. Instead, showing proceeds by presenting an addressee with a consideration that provides reason to believe that p (other than the reason provided by an informant’s credibility), and so recruits their capacity to respond to those reasons. With this account in place, the paper defends an account of one way in which authors can show their readers that certain moral states of affairs obtain both inside, and outside of, their fictions. It is argued, moreover, that this kind of showing gives addressees access to more than just reasons for moral belief–it also gives them access to the sorts of reasons that enable agents to increase their moral understanding. In virtue of these latter capacities, the showing identified is a way of communicating about morality that is markedly different from the sort of moral testimony that many philosophers have been increasingly interested in of late.","[{""name"": ""Shannon Brick"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University , USA""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1533-6077.2008.00143.x"", ""10.1111/mila.12021"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/43.4.386"", ""10.1093/pq/pqx057"", ""10.1086/233273"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.00048"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511620539"", ""10.1111/jaac.12633"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1080/00048409512346581"", ""10.1017/S1358246100007931"", ""10.1086/292054"", ""10.1007/BF00627678"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511498763"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5760.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203721742"", ""10.1080/00048409512346541"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.2007.01105.x"", ""10.1162/POSC_a_00128"", ""10.7551/mitpress/9780262036535.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198784647.003.0003"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayab060"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199283781.001.0001"", ""10.1002/9781444315592.ch18"", ""10.1163/18756735-09603002"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayac005"", ""10.1086/648610"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2012.00873.x"", ""10.1093/oseo/instance.00037977"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2001.tb00097.x"", ""10.1080/00455091.2013.857136"", ""10.1007/s11229-014-0616-x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00316.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195111040.003.0002"", ""10.5840/schoolman2009863/43"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv032"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198815099.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199647019.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1520-8583.2009.00174.x"", ""10.2307/2216682"", ""10.1007/BF00630629"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayw089"", ""10.1023/A:1011843723057"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511840715"", ""10.1111/0029-4624.00277"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/49.1.67"", ""10.1111/phpr.12467"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610202"", ""10.1057/9780230302457"", ""10.1007/s11098-007-9102-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511977206.012"", ""10.2307/2183262"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9887-6"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayr019"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/32.3.191"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0320-1"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199577507.003.0006"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz015"", ""10.1111/j.1755-2567.1973.tb00629.x"", ""10.2307/2025831"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195111040.003.0003"", ""10.26556/jesp.v8i1.77"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu099"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2003.tb00245.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

More recently, theorists have argued that the phenomenon of imaginative resistance is wider in scope, extending to descriptive claims (e.g., those that are conceptually contradictory). On both sides, though, theorists have focused on cases where imaginative resistance goes right, tracking something that is wrong with the story—that it is morally repugnant, or conceptually contradictory. I use a rarely cited discussion from Kant to argue that imaginative resistance can also occur when something goes wrong with the reader—namely, when a reader imports their own biases into the story, and resists a descriptive claim as a result. In identifying this new class of claims that can meet imaginative resistance, Kant presses the question: when should we cultivate imaginative resistance and when should we fight it?","[{""name"": ""Morganna Lambeth"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2098, USA""]}]","[""10.1111/jaac.12440"", ""10.3366/jsp.2007.5.1.31"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01520.x"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199275731.001.0001"", ""10.5840/philtopics199725123"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511809569"", ""10.1111/papq.12000"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu027"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9678-x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.625.x"", ""10.1080/00455091.2017.1378534"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/68.1.27"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198250890.003.0014""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Across three different case studies, subjects’ fixation patterns were used to propagate Voronoi generating points. Integrating both fixation locations and their respective dwell times, randomized Gaussian distribution provided a technique to augment Voronoi generating seeds and enhance graphical resolution. Color pixel values were then used to fill in resultant Voronoi cells in relation to color values provided by the original stimulus. This analysis allowed for effective differentiation of viewing behaviors between different subjects, with emphasis on a subject’s attentional distribution rather than on graphic icons.","[{""name"": ""Eugene Han"", ""affiliation"": [""Eugene Han, Lehigh University, Department of Art, Architecture, and Design, 113 Research Drive, Building C, Bethlehem, PA 18015, U.S.A.

It depicts teenagers dancing frenetically in front of Mondrian's eponymous painting, its kinetic, neoplasticist language absorbed into their plaid clothes. This essay shows how this painting pulled into its orbit much of the geopolitics of the 1950s. Guttuso's depiction of gyrating youths drew its – mostly negative – energy from events taking place just beyond its frame. It identifies afterimages (Guttuso's painting elicited other paintings); medial crossovers as well as medial denials (namely film, a medium that Guttuso professed to abhor); anticipations thwarted by reversed scenarios (the fiasco of the Soviets and the success of Mondrian at the subsequent Biennale in 1956); and blind spots (nations with no pavilion). Its leitmotif is plaid as a multifarious sign for youthful rebellion, nonchalant bohemianism, lumberjacks and hillbilly folk, solidarity with the working class, and modish sophistication.","[{""name"": ""Romy Golan"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

These objections concern the metaphysics required to make it work. Unlike (some) contextualists, relativists believe that evaluative propositions are not about the relation in which things stand to certain standards. Nevertheless, the truth of such propositions would depend on variable standards. I argue that relativism requires the existence of states of affairs very different from other things known to exist. Furthermore, there seems to be no convincing reason to postulate such entities. However, if they do not exist, then relativism leads to an error theory. That is unattractive, as relativism was meant to preserve the truth of many evaluative claims.","[{""name"": ""Daan Evers"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Groningen""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

This article explores the ontology of digital video through Mulla Sadrā’s (1571–1641) theory of Substantial Motion. Sadrā, a Persian-Islamic existentialist, proposed that substance (material/visible and immaterial/invisible) undergoes an internal change, creating intimate connections between the smallest parts and the One, visible and invisible. We can think of these dynamic connections in terms of pixels and frames. From the view of Sadrā’s substance, pixels are explored as open to change.

It argues that intarsia reconciled different modes: design-drawing, design in wood, and design with wood. These interconnected practices allow us to reconfigure intarsia as a technology created holistically from the correspondence of different human and more-than-human forces, including parasites – such as woodworm and fungi – and elemental factors – such as heat, water and air – all mobilised in active processes of pattern-making. It shows how this “Wood Age” craft is also an ecologically-rooted response to growing concerns about timber availability and forest sustainability. Finally, it proposes for intarsia the concept of reciprocal design, where patterns emerge from continuous correspondence and co-making between human and more-than-human agents.","[{""name"": ""Marta Ajmar"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Engineering'],['Architecture'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0813 建筑学', 0.7506), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7274)]]"

More than one might expect. Belgium’s 1897 International Exposition included a colonial exposition that displayed panoplies and dioramas of items taken under colonial violence in what is today the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These objects came to form the initial collection for Belgium’s Royal Museum for Central Africa, an institution that has in recent years underwent a period of renovation and expansion (reopening in 2018) with the aim of revisiting its history and displays. To create engagement with the museum, its website has offered a feature that allows visitors to curate virtual image boards of objects from the collection, with resulting effects semantically linked to the 1897 Brussels exposition. This online tool, while stemming from an admirable impulse to share curatorial control, falls short by juxtaposing items that tell of traumatic histories with no criticality or contextualizing information. Analyses of visual configurations of this tool, along with comparative examinations of the 1897 displays, offer evidence for this argument, as well as an example of how collections that represent painful histories call for especially thoughtful design of digital, publicfacing tools.","[{""name"": ""Hannah Kiefer"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Archeology', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Walking on Andre's sculptures has often been framed in highly generalized terms, as an almost universally shared experience that prompts an immanent connection between body and matter. To open up a space for addressing the diverse, subjective nature of spectators' experiences when walking on Andre's art, the present study explores how his metal planes have functioned as ‘planes of immanence’, a term drawn from the writings of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. In particular, it considers how the act of treading on Andre's sculptures during moments of protest has contributed to reshaping his planes of immanence, transforming them into surfaces that create new ‘lines of flight’ for contesting power, meaning, and the parameters of knowledge.","[{""name"": ""Michael Tymkiw"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

Moreover, exchanging knowledge with nonacademic stakeholders is a crucial yet often overlooked step in ensuring that research aligns with the needs and reality of knowledge users. This is particularly problematic in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease research, where social stigma and the reliance on quantitative and self-report methods hamper meaningful dialogue between academic researchers, nonacademic stakeholders, and the broader community.

I assert that Dunlap, both as painter and writer, develops an important explanatory model for the local art production of his time. Following from his strongly contextual notion of artistic production, he defines the artwork primarily as a ‘historical document’. On the basis of Dunlap's original, relativist conception of art, the essay proposes a reassessment of the relevance of his paintings as well as a new perspective on one of the key texts of art historiography from the early United States. By closely analysing Dunlap's hitherto neglected self‐portraits, this essay makes a case for the epistemic role that painting played in the development of art‐historical narratives around 1800.","[{""name"": ""Léa Kuhn"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

By that time, the Korean–Cuban friendship had lasted for more than three decades, following its formation after the 1959 Cuban Revolution, and based on the principle of Third World solidarity. But this encounter in 1989 illustrates that their contemporary art was out of sync with one another. The Korean presentation contrasted with the more installation‐oriented, inter‐media works submitted by Cuban artists who were part of the ‘New Cuban art’ wave. As an archeological study on these two starkly different visions of ‘contemporary art’, this essay sustains a bifurcated view onto Pyongyang and Havana as a method with which to reassess the culture of Third World politics and post‐coloniality at the Cold War's end, and to propose a translocational, South‐to‐South method of art history.","[{""name"": ""Sohl Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Sociology and Political Science', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1093/aesthj/ayac072,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,On the Deeply Moving and the Merely Touching,"Abstract Critics often link yet distinguish between ‘moving’ and ‘touching’ characters, scenes and artworks. It has been argued that being moved is a specific emotion, that its formal object is the thin goodness of exemplified final, important and impersonal thick values, and that being touched is an attenuated form of that phenomenon. First, I dispute that the values that move us must be impersonal, since we can be moved by the personal goodness of being loved, free or healthy. Second, I argue that being touched should be considered a distinct emotion type. To support this claim, I refer to apparent differences between the formal objects that the two affective phenomena relate to as well as to dissimilarities in cognitive sophistication and phenomenology. I suggest that we are touched by that which invites love.

The ensemble performs new compositions while also arranging early electronic pieces. In parallel, the project has developed itself as a space to gather information and reflect on sine wave–based music. In this article, the author presents some of the key considerations and challenges in the formation of Ensemble d’oscillateurs. Based on observations made throughout the development of a body of work using these audio oscillators, he then aims to open a discussion on some aspects of the historical trajectory of the use of sine waves in modern music.","[{""name"": ""Nicolas Bernier"", ""affiliation"": [""Nicolas Bernier, Université de Montréal, Music Faculty, Canada.

The ‘explananda’ in the title of this article are things that have been proposed as requiring explanation by any adequate ontology of multiple artworks so conceived. This assumes that the ontology of art is in the business of explaining certain things, an assumption I defend. At least nine purported explananda have been proposed in the relevant literature. I begin by offering a preliminary sketch of these explananda, identifying how they are grounded in our ordinary artistic practice and discourse, and how they have structured recent debates in the ontology of art. I next argue that the notion of ‘instance’ must be understood in a particular way if instance multiplicity is to capture the standard distinction between singular and multiple art forms. I then assess the relative significance and implications of the nine explananda for an adjudication of the debates in the ontology of art. I identify problems for the historically dominant ‘type’ theory of multiples, and propose an alternative account that speaks to all nine explananda. I conclude by reflecting on where this leaves us and how we should proceed.","[{""name"": ""David Davies"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, McGill University , Quebec, H3A 2T7 , Canada""]}]","[""10.1007/978-1-349-20038-2"", ""10.1002/9780470774922"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2009.01345.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12348"", ""10.1093/oso/9780192848864.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/40.4.424"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayr047"", ""10.1163/18756735-90000194"", ""10.2307/2025596"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199988211.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01471.x"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00182"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2005.00202.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195319910.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199385119.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Literature and Literary Theory', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Previously ignored, this signature is important in that, combined with unpublished documents, it sheds light on Benvenuto di Giovanni's youthful career and, more broadly, the first steps of a garzone on their way to becoming a master. The first known signature in Greek ever to appear in fifteenth‐century Italian painting, but enmeshed among pseudo‐scripts, Guasparre and Benvenuto's marks are not proof of antiquarian culture. Instead, this signature begs for a historicized concept of both linguistic knowledge and artistic authorship.

This claim, however, does not explicitly address the fact that not everyone receives the same recognition: it underexplains how certain groups are systemically not acknowledged, respected, or taken seriously. More recent work on narrative co-authoring starts to address this fact by examining how people’s vulnerability to co-authoring depends on the context in which they live. But I argue that this work should be extended to attend to the kinds of vulnerabilities that result from what José Medina calls recognition deficiencies, which become more normalized due to structural oppression, specifically what Iris Marion Young calls cultural imperialism. I then illuminate the kinds of vulnerabilities that result from recognition deficiencies in cases of structural oppression by bringing in work in Black feminist thought and epistemic injustice, particularly that of Audre Lorde and Veronica Ivy, into conversation with narrative scholarship.","[{""name"": ""R Maxwell Racine"", ""affiliation"": [""Miami University , USA""]}]","[""10.1111/jasp.12172"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199230730.001.0001"", ""10.1111/phc3.12336"", ""10.1007/s11017-016-9356-x"", ""10.1353/ppp.2018.0022"", ""10.5206/fpq/2018.4.6233""]",['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It explores the ways in which the historiography of Austrian post‐war modernism has been informed by wider historical assumptions, about the role of the First World War as a cultural‐political caesura, for instance, or by ambivalence about interwar Austrian history and its slide into fascism, or valorization of the avant‐garde.

However, this hypothesis conflicts with the platitude that musical works are appreciated by means of audition: the things that enter our ear canals and make our eardrums vibrate must be concrete, so how can musical works be listened to if they are abstract? This question constitutes the audibility problem. In this paper, I assess Julian Dodd’s elaborate attempt to solve it, and contend that Dodd’s attempt is unsuccessful. Then I discuss what I take to be the ideal response to the audibility problem, and show that it ultimately fails. I contend, consequently, that the project of construing musical works as audible is disheartening. Accordingly, in my last section, I will argue the audibility problem may be satisfactorily resolved without ascribing audibility to musical works.","[{""name"": ""Sofía Meléndez Gutiérrez"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cambridge , UK""]}]","[""10.2478/disp-2020-0016"", ""10.1111/theo.12398"", ""10.1080/00048402.2022.2150246"", ""10.1007/s11098-010-9596-y"", ""10.2307/2023177"", ""10.2307/2023853"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp001"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/40.4.424"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.4.380"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/44.4.342"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00173.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12386"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.12063"", ""10.1007/s11406-019-00073-9"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.2.105"", ""10.1007/s10670-017-9915-1"", ""10.2307/48574438"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511625220"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4629.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198250470.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2025596"", ""10.2307/2940786"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2012.00860.x"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01471.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12651"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab010"", ""10.7312/quin92204"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199277506.003.0009"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayt026"", ""10.1163/9789004368828_002""]","['Computer Science', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The functions and demands for autograph replicas have unique historical and cultural contexts, including conflicts between artists and patrons.

In this article, the author puts forward a definition of creative media accessibility and illustrates it with examples of current professional practice. Situated at the crossroads between creation and translation, these practices point to a new way to approach audiovisual translation and, more importantly, filmmaking itself.","[{""name"": ""Pablo Romero-Fresco"", ""affiliation"": [""Pablo Romero-Fresco, Universidade de Vigo, FFT, Vigo, Pontevedra, Spain.

Formalists prioritize our understanding and appreciation of the music itself. As a result, they demand that any feelings we have in response to music must be directed at the music alone, without being distracted by non-musical associations. To accommodate these requirements, I appeal to a mechanism of contagion that I synthesize with the expectation-based arousal mechanism proposed by Leonard Meyer. This account connects musical expressivity and arousal in a way that formalists have rejected, but I argue that it provides the best explanation of our observations of listener responses while also focusing on the music itself.","[{""name"": ""Tom Cochrane"", ""affiliation"": [""Flinders University, Australia""]}]","[""10.1016/j.cognition.2005.11.008"", ""10.1057/9780230233836"", ""10.1073/pnas.191355898"", ""10.5840/monist200386426"", ""10.1080/00048400902941257"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198238089.001.0001"", ""10.1093/mind/LXXXIX.353.67"", ""10.7591/9781501733987"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199241576.003.0012"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199654888.003.0013"", ""10.4324/9780203721742"", ""10.1093/0195138929.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226333274.001.0001"", ""10.7551/mitpress/6575.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S0140525X08005293"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/39.1.1"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayl007"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00262.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206179.003.0013"", ""10.1111/ejop.12385"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195153170.003.0013"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7470.001.0001"", ""10.1525/mp.2009.26.5.489"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511610202"", ""10.1093/0199263655.001.0001"", ""10.2307/2182490"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00261.x"", ""10.1007/s10790-013-9358-0"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199682713.001.0001"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/44.1.29"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2007.00272.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12042""]","['Computer Science', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

It pictures the mine's Anglo‐American administrators, its primarily Mexican miners, and industry's impact upon the landscape. Despite the seemingly idyllic nature of the genre scene, the Enrequita Mine and its painted portrayal mark a contentious turning point in the economic and political relationship between the United States and Mexico in the mid‐nineteenth century, one whose effects still reverberate today. Two moments of tension between the two nations frame this artwork: the US–Mexican War of 1846–48; and the United States v. Castillero court case and appeals (1857–63). Using an ecocritical approach situating the painting in the geopolitics of extraction, this essay contends that the artwork participated in these territorial disputes by constructing ethnic hierarchy, bolstering legal battles, and not only representing but engendering further capitalist exploitation of the land.","[{""name"": ""Monica Bravo"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Environmental Science'],"['Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)]]"

Though I address the ontological question of how or whether these tracks could be classified as actual cover songs, in this paper I am more concerned with the evaluative question of how we should attempt to appreciate them as such (as we are invited to do, I argue, according to the recordings’ metatextual cues). I will argue that these irreconcilable covers, as I call them, are best appreciated as conceptual artworks that function in a manner somewhat analogous to how Arthur Danto argues that Andy Warhol’s famed Brillo Box sculptures function; prompting us to reflect on the nature of art (and non-art). Through adopting a strategy that is, in some respects, the inverse of Warhol’s, these covers make a similar invitation to listeners to consider the nature of rock covers and covering practices, and to reflect on the stances that we—listeners and artists alike—might take in relation to rock’s past and its ever-available recorded archive.","[{""name"": ""Michael Rings"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department , Siena College, Loudonville, NY, 12211 , USA""]}]","[""10.1111/jaac.12062"", ""10.2307/2022937"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2006.00219.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198250470.001.0001"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab037"", ""10.1111/jaac.12034"", ""10.11647/obp.0293"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01541.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12083""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Music'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

At the beginning of the fourteenth century, a rather small church, dedicated to Saints Joachim and Anna, was built in the Studenica Monastery. The remains of the marble closure slabs testify to the existence of a stone templon.

Building on this premise, we use the concepts of niche construction, scaffolding, coupling, and functional integration to expound on the environmentally situated nature of painters’ studio work. Our analysis shows studios to be multi-resource niches that are customized by artists to support various capacities, states, and actions crucial to painting. When at work in these personalized spaces, painters do not need to rely solely on their “inner” powers of imagination, memory, decision making, and technique to execute their paintings. Instead, with the help of carefully selected resources, they can offload elements of creative mentation and action onto the studio niche and enact different forms of a creative agency. To put more flesh on these ideas, we examine how painters use (1) existing artworks, (2) memory aids, and (3) music to scaffold the creative process.

Philosophers disagree, however, about the exact cause of the ‘contact phenomenon’ and whether there is a difference in the phenomenal character between the pictorial experiences of photographs and handmade pictures so that, if a viewer mistakes the type that a token image belongs to, their sense of contact can alter. I argue that the contact phenomenon is contingent upon, and triggered by, the viewer’s perceptual experience of the image, which may be subject to change depending upon how a viewer attends to an image. I develop a hybrid account to resolve how the perceptual and cognitive aspects of a viewer’s experience interact and produce the complex phenomenology, including conflicting mental states, that a viewer can undergo during the described experiences.","[{""name"": ""Claire Anscomb"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Liverpool , UK""]}]","[""10.3138/sim.6.1.002"", ""10.1080/07481187.2013.788584"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac49.1.0023"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac57.3.0285"", ""10.1177/0956797613479386"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199589760.001.0001"", ""10.1348/135910710X515714"", ""10.1080/15213269.2013.770354"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00800.x"", ""10.1017/apa.2014.24"", ""10.1016/j.dsp.2017.08.009"", ""10.1111/jaac.12290"", ""10.2752/175145109X12532077132473"", ""10.1093/oxartj/kcl030"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01501.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199658442.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00043249.2002.10792133"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2011.01460.x"", ""10.4324/9780429462658-15"", ""10.1207/s15327728jmme1901_5"", ""10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01187"", ""10.1016/j.cag.2017.08.010"", ""10.1111/1746-8361.12049"", ""10.1086/448287""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Apparues en Occident pendant la période couverte par cette étude, les danses hindoues furent principalement exécutées par des danseuses formées dans ce contexte, qui proposaient dans leurs répertoires éclectiques, destinés à un public occidental, des compositions inspirées des traditions de l’Asie du Sud et du Sud-Est. L’essai s’attache dès lors à analyser l’utilisation de l’art indien et du Sud-Est asiatique en tant que source d’inspiration de ces créations. Renvoyant au caractère ancestral et sacré des traditions dont s’inspiraient les danseuses hindoues, les œuvres d’art antique contribuèrent à légitimer leurs propositions chorégraphiques. Par ailleurs, les procédés et les mécanismes que mirent en place ces artistes étaient en phase avec le processus de renouvellement aussi bien de la danse que, plus généralement, de l’art du premier tiers du xxe siècle.","[{""name"": ""Irene López Arnaiz"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Safety Research', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7723), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7531)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Our approach foregrounds the relationship between the activity demanded by some individual literary works and some categories of literary work on the one hand and the way in which those works can make a tangible difference to social reality on the other. We consider three types of active literary engagement: doing philosophy, ideological critique, and necessary rather than contingent performance. Kate Kirkpatrick opens with Kamel Daoud’s The Meursault Investigation (2013), reading the narrator as not only a critic of colonial and postcolonial discourse but also a literary exemplar of the search for justice when it is difficult to know to what level of explanation to attribute its absence. Rafe McGregor demonstrates how the final season of Prime Video’s The Man in the High Castle (2015–19) makes a radical break from the previous three, exposing the misanthropy at the core of right-wing populism and calling for a fundamentally democratic response from the left. Finally, Karen Simecek argues that poetry in performance has a potentially reparative function for the ethically lonely – the vulnerable, the oppressed, and the persecuted – in society.","[{""name"": ""Kate Kirkpatrick"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rafe McGregor"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karen Simecek"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17449855.2019.1603117"", ""10.21071/edmetic.v1i1.2834"", ""10.1353/phl.1998.0047"", ""10.1353/phl.1997.0010"", ""10.2307/j.ctv15vwkgx.6"", ""10.1215/9780822384786-005"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv041"", ""10.1353/phl.2019.0017"", ""10.1093/litthe/fry005""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Law', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

While doing so, it rediscovers what has been regarded as an interesting but derivative object to be a most sophisticated artwork. Fontana's medal was not just an honour: it was a cultural intervention that addressed multiple cultural debates taking place across central Italy, from the nature of emblems to women's worth. While presenting some overlooked sources related to Fontana's medal and contemporary artistic production (a couple of treatises, a guidebook, and a thank you note), the essay introduces three new exemplars of the coin. This new evidence prompts a reconsideration of the circulation of Fontana's medal and the identity of its designer, a question that has so far escaped attention.","[{""name"": ""Emanuele Lugli"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

The Museum of Modern Art,"In 1971, Pakistan‐born lawyer and artist Iqbal Geoffrey (1939–2021) lodged a discrimination case against the Museum of Modern Art in New York. This essay connects Geoffrey's complaint, which he filed with the New York State Division of Human Rights, to MoMA's situation at the centre of activist debates over race and equality during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the museum's prominent role in exporting US art around the world during the Cold War. At a time when Asian modernists received a mostly transactional, diplomatic welcome from US cultural institutions including MoMA, Geoffrey mobilized his legal, artistic, and epistolary practices to stake his claim to permanent belonging within the US art world. Today, his case raises questions over where expanding histories of ‘global modernism’ meet incomplete histories of ‘American’ modernism, against a backdrop and the legacies of the Cold War era.","[{""name"": ""Gemma Sharpe"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Bunraku puppeteering can invoke deep unconscious affective reactions from the audience, overcoming what is known as the uncanny valley effect. The authors analyze Bunraku plays, showing that the music tempo and puppet movements follow the Jo-Ha-Kyū principle, which refers to recursive and fractal artistic modulations such as changes of tempo and rhythm breaks. The authors then illustrate the difference between Bunraku and European dance and finally propose the application of Jo-Ha-Kyū in character animation design.","[{""name"": ""Ran Dong"", ""affiliation"": [""Ran Dong, School of Computer Science, Tokyo University of Technology, Hachioji City, Tokyo, Japan.

In it, the artist discusses training a generative adversarial network (GAN) from images of personal memories. These images are shared here not as public artworks, but as personal photographs: snapshots reproduced and newly imagined by a machine. The essay explores the distortion that AI image generation introduces to memory and imagination, connecting ideas of photography to cybernetics to expose new ways of theorizing the image in the current stage of AI. It concludes that a theory of A imagery may borrow from theories of traditional photography but must examine its distinctions.","[{""name"": ""Eryk Salvaggio"", ""affiliation"": [""Eryk Salvaggio, Rochester Institute of Technology, 490 Hurstbourne Road, Rochester, NY, U.S.A.

Whether an illusion performed on stage or the search for the supernatural, magic is concerned with changing either reality itself or our perception of it. Each new technology takes on a magical role by increasing humans' power to manipulate the world around them. Similarly, magical practices are often labeled arts, and the manipulation of our perceptions by artists often creates quasi-magical experiences. Four approaches to magic in relation to digital art practice—illusionist, alchemist, necromancer and sorcerer—offer a mode of understanding the manipulation of perceptual reality by artists using digital technologies. The framework will then be applied to five such practitioners—Pascal Dombis, Anne-Sarah Le Meur, Antoine Schmitt, Dmitry Morozov and Zaven Paré—who demonstrate the quest for the unknown and the manipulation of knowledge to create a new reality.","[{""name"": ""Garfield Benjamin"", ""affiliation"": [""Garfield Benjamin (postdoctoral researcher), Solent University, East Park Terrace, Southampton, U.K. SO14 0YN..

Sections 1 to 3 comprise an exploration into and analysis of both the traditional understanding of improvisation and composition as opposing categories, as well as the more modern, nuanced view of their interpenetrating natures. I conclude that the former view should be replaced by the latter. Sections 4 and 5 present and subsequently negate two potential failings of my argument. First, I confront the problem posed by Goehr’s work-concept, whose essence is opposed to the spirit of improvisation, but argue that recording allows for the solidification of these improvisations into works. Secondly, I undermine the view that composition is creation ex nihilo whilst improvisation is the mere reworking of old material. I uncover the originality of improvisation and formulae of composition to restore their compatibility and reinforce improvisation’s status as a method of broad- and narrow-sense composition.","[{""name"": ""Katya Davisson"", ""affiliation"": [""Durham University , UK""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511615924"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.jaac58.2.0135"", ""10.1093/0199241589.001.0001"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199284375.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp015"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.jaac58.2.0143"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/40.1.168"", ""10.1111/jaac.12749"", ""10.1002/9780470776650"", ""10.1215/00222909-008"", ""10.3998/mpub.10075702"", ""10.1093/mq/LX.1.1"", ""10.30535/mto.19.2.6"", ""10.1111/1540-6245.jaac58.2.0125""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Computer Science', 'Neuroscience']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Music', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

An exegetical reading of the eight scenes chosen to decorate the walls of the church, however, gives a unitary, programmatic meaning to the décor: an image of the Ecclesia, of the society of the faithful, the decoration enhances the priesthood and recalls its necessary intermediation in the access to salvation. These are the same intentions which shape the illuminated manuscripts of the Liuthar group, especially the Bamberg Collection (Msc. Bibl. 22). As conceived by the Benedictine monks of Reichenau, the project of an ecclesiastical society as propagated in the murals is similar to that promoted shortly before the year 1000 by Cluny and Fleury.","[{""name"": ""Barbara Franzé"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Lausanne, bât.

Taking the awarding of the 1975 national prize of art to the retablista Joaquín López Antay as its fulcrum, it argues that this key event, which has been traditionally regarded as a watershed in the history of Peruvian art, was indeed the logical consequence of how indigenist painters framed the field of artistic production in Peru. It also analyses the simultaneous emergence of an alternative view of popular art that did away with notions of cultural authenticity and national representation.","[{""name"": ""Megan A.

In this paper, I challenge commonly held beliefs that graffiti writing is politically inert. On the contrary, I argue that graffiti writing is an example of creative activism. Rather than being a narcissistic form of vandalism, primarily directed at increasing one’s fame in front of an esoteric group, that is, fellow writers, writing is a form of everyday resistance allowing its practitioners to challenge authoritarian power. In questioning dominant hierarchies, graffiti is a powerful tool to help correct a specific instance of spatial injustice: the unequal distribution of access to urban surfaces for self-expression in the city, where corporations and political elites hold an unjustified monopoly over visual communication.","[{""name"": ""Andrea L Baldini"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Liberal Arts, Alliance University , Bengaluru , India""]}]","[""10.1093/aesthj/ayv030"", ""10.1093/monist/onx033"", ""10.1353/aq.2007.0077"", ""10.1177/1206331210365283"", ""10.1177/1367549412467177"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001"", ""10.7312/gram19038"", ""10.1177/1362480606065908"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8330.2011.00849.x"", ""10.3390/soc10010001"", ""10.4324/9781315150154"", ""10.2307/j.ctv16757rr.25"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199591558.001.0001"", ""10.1177/1470412905054673"", ""10.22439/cjas.v4i1.1765"", ""10.1525/sp.2009.56.1.89"", ""10.1111/jaac.12414"", ""10.5749/minnesota/9780816666676.001.0001"", ""10.1111/nejo.12338""]",['Social Sciences'],['Urban Studies'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

Numerous similarities with religious architecture in Lorraine, the Rhineland, and the Meuse valley reveal the architectural historical significance of Our Lady’s church on the western fringe of the Holy Roman Empire. Inside the church, differences in design are related to the separate spaces used by canons, parishioners, brotherhoods, and the urban commune of Tongeren. The elaborate Rayonnant Gothic architecture of the eastern part of the church bears witness to the prestige associated with the church’s chapter, which claimed an episcopal past.","[{""name"": ""Vincent Debonne"", ""affiliation"": [""Flanders Heritage Agency , Havenlaan 88 bus 5, 1000 Brüssel , Belgien""]}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'History', 'Space and Planetary Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7451), ('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.7369)]]"

Focusing on glass containers used to contain and constitute Buddhist objects in China's Qing dynasty (1644–1911), this essay provides historical and critical views on issues of aura and containment. Primarily, it examines the modalities and experiences of container and containment as expressed in the Qing court's material, religious and political practices. In doing so, the essay highlights the fusional relationship between matter and form, while also apprehending the metamorphosis between image and object in processes of transmedial translation and transcultural crossing or dislocation. It argues that glass containers used to simulate, animate and amplify the ‘aura’ of devotional objects manifested more general religio‐political and intercultural phenomena at that time. Those phenomena in turn invite reflections on material objects' immaterial expressions, and vice versa, in terms of the interplay between formal schema and amorphous force.","[{""name"": ""Lihong Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.31664/zu.2021.109.06,ZIVOT UMJETNOSTI,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,Gender and Class in Interwar Photography: An Interdisciplinary View,"U ovom će se radu, na korpusu fotografija reproduciranih na stranicama specijaliziranih časopisa posvećenih fotografiji koji su izlazili tijekom međuraća, razmotriti uobičajene prakse prikazivanja s problemskim fokusom na rodne i klasne pozicije fotografa i fotografiranog/fotografirane te na odnose društvenosti i moći. Interdisciplinarnim povezivanjem perspektiva, spoznaja i pristupa povijesti umjetnosti te etnologije i kulturne antropologije, ovim će se radom doprinijeti propitivanju „prirodnosti” rodnog i klasnoga mjesta u društvu. Iz cjeline fotografija objavljenih u fotografskim časopisima odabrane su onenjih oko 350 objavljenih između 1927. i 1941. na kojima je prikazan ljudski lik, a razmatranje podrazumijeva napuštanje klasičnoga interpretativnog aparata, estetskih vrednovanja i oslanjanja na uobičajene povijesnoumjetničke interpretacije tih i sličnih slika te se nije obraćala pažnja na stilske preferencije autora ni na formalne značajke fotografije. Metoda kojom se provodila analiza prikazanih likova i situacija oslanja se na analizu sadržaja, preciznije inventara slike, i to prema učestalosti pojavljivanja pojedinih motiva, a glavni aspekti prema kojima su razmatrane odabrane fotografije uključile su reprezentaciju prema zanimanju (profesiji kojom se bavi prikazani lik), prema načinu provođenja slobodnog vremena i prema emociji koju lik iskazuje, a uzeti su u obzir i predmeti koji ga okružuju, poza koju zauzima, radnja kojom je zaokupljen, prostor u kojem je smješten, dobna struktura i dr. Takva metoda rezultirala je kompleksnim razumijevanjem dominantnih prikazivačkih praksi i obrazaca, ali i pretpostavljenih društvenih asimetrija te nas dovela do spoznaja na koji način onovremene fotografije izražavaju, odražavaju, ohrabruju i perpetuiraju stereotipiziranje određenih društvenih skupina. Analizirani prikazi pokazuju da su na fotografijama neke uobičajene situacije ispuštane na račun drugih koje su pak forsirane. Na temelju tih znatnih asimetrija zaključujemo da slika društva koju nam pruža međuratna fotografija nije sušti odraz društva, već posljedica jednog određenog sustava vrijednosti, koji možemo obuhvatiti terminom građanski svjetonazor. Analiza reprezentacijskih obrazaca pokazala je kako su na fotografijama društvene skupine konstruirane po principu rodnih i klasnih binarnih opozicija, uvriježenih u građanskoj imaginaciji. Pa su tako opoziciji muško–žensko pridružene analogne opozicije pamet–ljepota, um–emocije, rad–odmor, ozbiljnost–zabava, duhovnost–erotičnost, dok opoziciju građanstvo–puk prate analogni pojmovi: mozak– trbuh, individualnost–društvenost, duhovnost–pobožnost. Fotografije time potvrđuju kako su žene u društvenom prostoru odvojene negativnim simboličkim koeficijentom od muškaraca, a jednako tako da je puk shvaćen kao negativna referentna točka građanskog načina života. Ovdje je riječ o uspostavljanju matrice predodžbi koje nisu povijesna istina, već konstrukt stvoren na mnijenju, a njihova učestalost i prisutnost u fotografiji i umjetnosti općenito pridonosi naturalizaciji rodnih i klasnih razlika te posljedičnom učvršćivanju i perpetuiranju društvenih asimetrija i nejednakosti.","[{""name"": ""Ana Šeparović"", ""affiliation"": [""Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža, Zagreb, Hrvatska""]}, {""name"": ""Tihana Rubić"", ""affiliation"": [""Odsjek za etnologiju i kulturnu antropologiju, Filozofski fakultet Sveučilišta u Zagrebu, Zagreb, Hrvatska""]}]",[],"['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

They then present a derivative structural analogy to the three classes of molecular bonding as a bridge to microscopic structure. The construction of tensegrity sculptures of particle interactions and covalent molecules using tension and compression components follows. The authors derive and utilize two properties in this analysis: (1) a “simplest tensegrity” subunit structure and (2) interpenetrating, discontinuous compressive components—the tension components may also be discontinuous in a structure. This approach provides new artistic models for molecules and materials and may inform future artistic, architectural, engineering and scientific endeavors.","[{""name"": ""J.

This provocative visual statement is related to the artist’s experience in the city, serving as a gauge of his negative attitude to the local environment, which is confirmed by his own remark that living in Venice “was not for men of drawing.” The Lamentation appears therefore as an early critical contribution in the form of an altarpiece to the long-standing debate over disegno and colorito.","[{""name"": ""Mattia Biffis"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oslo – The Norwegian Institute in Rome , Viale Trenta Aprile 33 , Rome , Italia""]}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['History'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"
10.1111/1467-8365.12648,ART HISTORY,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,Fra Angelico's The Miracle of the Black Leg: Skin Colour and the Perception of Ethiopians in Florence before 1450,"For the high altar of San Marco in Florence, Fra Angelico painted a scene in which Saints Cosmas and Damian graft the black leg of a deceased Ethiopian onto the body of a white European devotee. The white man, upon awaking, ‘saw nothing wrong’. Did he, or his audience around 1440, really have no objection to his new black leg? It would seem that to them the issue was not that the leg was black, but whether or not it came from a Christian. This essay uses Fra Angelico's image to ask broad questions about the contingency of skin colour and its associations in Florence before the advent of the transatlantic slave trade. It reviews the polarized position of recent scholarship on race in premodern Europe and seeks to follow a middle path. The development of this imagery after 1500, especially in Spain, shows racialized hostility towards the Ethiopian, which was not necessarily the case in the early fifteenth‐century examples discussed here. Instead, ideas of unity, rather than difference, will be employed as a framework for interpretation.","[{""name"": ""Scott Nethersole"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Sociology and Political Science'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It makes them hesitant to take part in social activities. The result is loneliness, unhappiness, and depression. If untreated, depression could lead to suicide. Therefore, depression risk factors should be used to identify at-risk groups. Objective: To examine the factors influencing depression in older adults with NCDs. Materials and Methods: The entire sample consisted of older adults aged 60 years with NCDs. A cluster sampling method was used to collect data in Nonthaburi Province, Thailand. Data were collected between January and March 2023, using an interview form with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.708 to 0.903. The data obtained were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Results: Of the 608 participants enrolled, 23.8% were found the risk of depression. The factors influencing depression were alcohol use (AOR 23.14, 95% CI 1.43 to 37.59, p=0.027), no education (AOR 11.14, 95% CI 1.38 to 90.06, p=0.024), insufficient sleep (AOR 7.61, 95% CI 2.16 to 26.82, p=0.002), activities of daily living (ADL) (AOR 4.10, 95% CI 1.23 to 13.70, p=0.022), inadequate diet (AOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.91, p=0.024), loneliness (AOR 2.36, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.42, p=0.007), diabetes mellitus (AOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.67, p=0.022), widowhood (AOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.34, p=0.036), hobbies (AOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.57, p=0.004), and psychological well-being (AOR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.31, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The results of the present study could be used to develop activity programs or guidelines to monitor and prevent depression among older adults with NCDs by public health personnel, village health volunteers, community leaders, neighbors, family members, or elder-care providers.

But how is it possible for a painting to create an atmosphere? My goal in this paper is to provide a partial answer to this question by focusing on the depiction of light. I argue that paintings can elicit experiences of atmospheres in part because they can depict pictorial space as filled with ambient light that has a distinctive phenomenal character. It is in virtue of this distinctive phenomenal character that the depicted ambient light can make a significant contribution to the overall phenomenal character of the experienced atmosphere.,"[{""name"": ""René Jagnow"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of Georgia , Athens, GA 30602-1627 , USA""]}]","[""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199262618.003.0016"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511563744.013"", ""10.7591/9781501733987"", ""10.1177/1477153514528934"", ""10.4324/9780203116623-6"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199215928.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.04.005"", ""10.1515/zfr-2017-0018"", ""10.4324/9781351039260-7"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199278350.001.0001"", ""10.1117/12.876363"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-6593-4_3"", ""10.1177/1477153513506591"", ""10.7551/mitpress/4337.001.0001"", ""10.1007/s11153-007-9147-4""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

The main question that I explore in this article is: are the interpretation- and production-oriented approaches to ethical art criticism essentially disconnected or can there be a connection between them? I argue that in the disjunctivist view, the two approaches are disconnected, for ethical flaws in the production of artworks are never conditioned by ethical flaws in the attitudes expressed by those works and vice versa. I show that disjunctivism is mistaken and defend what I call contextual conjunctivism. In this view, the two approaches can be connected since attitudinal ethical flaws in artworks can indeed cause ethical flaws in their production and vice versa depending on context. I support this view using several examples of controversies about contemporary art.","[{""name"": ""Tomas Koblizek"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Philosophy, Czech Academy of Sciences , Prague , Czech Republic""]}]","[""10.1111/pops.12053"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/36.3.223"", ""10.1086/233273"", ""10.1080/00043389.2019.1643072"", ""10.1111/papq.12104"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.007"", ""10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z"", ""10.1111/j.0021-8529.2006.00247.x"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac54.4.0337"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198767213.003.0003"", ""10.1162/octo_a_00325"", ""10.1111/jaac.12601"", ""10.1080/09528822.2021.1886522"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayi016"", ""10.1111/j.1088-4963.2010.01195.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Law', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

This article examines scenes from the Maitreya murals, highlighting details appearing across the murals that allow us to understand how adherents imagined life in an earthly paradise. Most scenes in the murals accentuate the magnificence of life in Maitreya's terrestrial Buddhaland, characterized by manageable yet rewarding labor and a long life that never ends suddenly, all in a clean urban environment. Hence, in this realm some labor is still required and social hierarchies are maintained. Unlike the celestial realm of Amitābha Buddha, Maitreya's land is ruled by an ideal leader, the Wheel-Turning King Saṅkha. The article concludes by examining the tension between the power of the religious leader and the political ruler, evident even though the paintings do not include representations of Saṅkha himself. Rather, they depict his regalia, his gift, and his family in prominent positions, near Maitreya, thus suggesting that the future Buddha absorbed Saṅkha's political power, which parallels contemporaneous political and religious developments.","[{""name"": ""April D.

We also argue that these fictional truths are subject to being undermined. We propose that the context within which we are to evaluate what is fictionally true changes when a possibility which was previously ignorable is brought to attention. We argue that these cases support a model of fictional truth which makes the conversational dynamics of determining truth in fiction structurally akin to the conversational dynamics of knowledge-ascription, as this is understood by David Lewis’s contextualist approach to knowledge. We show how a number of the rules which Lewis proposes for the case of knowledge-ascription can be employed to develop a novel and powerful framework for the case of truth in fiction.","[{""name"": ""Craig Bourne"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Hertfordshire , UK""]}, {""name"": ""Emily Caddick Bourne"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Manchester , UK""]}]","[""10.1080/00048402.2018.1435698"", ""10.1111/j.1746-8361.2003.tb00259.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199675319.001.0001"", ""10.1080/00048409312345022"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511897498"", ""10.1080/00048402.2016.1149736"", ""10.1007/BF00258436"", ""10.1080/00048409612347521"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2007.501.x"", ""10.1023/A:1004239709212"", ""10.1126/science.185.4157.1124""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

The aim of this article is to circumvent binary, gender-bound approaches to materials. It discusses how elasticity moves from representation (Germaine Richier, Olga Jevrić, Naum Gabo) to materiality and medium, such as nylon and rubber/latex (Rosemary Mayer, Senga Nengudi, Eva Hesse, Claes Oldenburg), leaving behind the paradigm of minimalism in favour of eccentric, bodily and sensuous objects. Rosalind Krauss emphasized how in post-war American art, ‘sculpture and painting have been kneaded and stretched and twisted in an extraordinary demonstration of elasticity’. This breaking out of categories can be seen as a sociopolitical figure of thought, for example in Nengudi’s sculptures, where the (female) body is restrained by the material and enmeshed in a social web of heteronormative ideas, but also in the sociopolitical context, such as the Black Liberation Movement and demonstrations against the Vietnam War.","[{""name"": ""Ursula Ströbele"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['Visual Arts and Performing Arts'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)]]"

Capturing both intuitions, this paper argues for double-standard moralism, the view that fictive imaginings are subject to different moral standards than their real-world counterparts. I show how no account has, thus far, offered compelling reasons to warrant the moral appropriateness of this discrepancy. I maintain that the normative discontinuity between fiction and the actual world is moderate, as opposed to one that leaves fictive engagements wholly exempt from moral evaluations. I propose a way of addressing the gamer’s dilemma that is compatible with a moderate kind of discontinuity. Finally, I contend that the audience is justified in adopting deviant moral attitudes in fictional situations because their consequences largely differ from those that analogous real-world events would have.","[{""name"": ""Mattia Cecchinato"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Oxford , UK""]}]","[""10.1007/s10676-015-9381-x"", ""10.1007/s10676-011-9280-8"", ""10.5040/9781350121904"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayx031"", ""10.2307/2219685"", ""10.1111/jaac.12091"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199656615.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.007"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199263219.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190096342.001.0001"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayp020"", ""10.1023/A:1021372601566"", ""10.1007/s10676-008-9168-4"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0017.2006.00286.x"", ""10.1007/s10677-019-10049-z"", ""10.4159/9780674042605"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01548.x"", ""10.1093/aristoteliansupp/68.1.27"", ""10.1177/0956797613519271"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46595-1""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Playful installations create “portraits” of naturally occurring phenomena. The artworks invite the viewer to witness the spontaneous emergence of patterns and traces induced by water. Facilitated by the artist, the drops and splashes are allowed to manifest in autographic renderings, generated by exposing sensitized substrates to rainfall or to waves.

While the Christological narratives that they commonly depict reveal clear links to the artistic traditions of Western Europe, the plumage that they sport is derived from a family of birds endemic to the Americas. This juxtaposition has inspired the scholars who address them to focus all but exclusively on determining their provenance. Yet their composite nature undermines simplistic notions of origin by suggesting the pathways that they travelled in the early modern world: while the carvings themselves were likely produced by Indigenous artists in central Mexico, the metal cases sported by several examples were made in Europe. After surveying the corpus and its place in previous scholarship, this essay turns to an examination of their reception by elite European audiences. It argues that such viewers drew formal and theological connections between the materials and iconography of these objects that greatly enhanced their potential to serve as effective tools for private devotion.","[{""name"": ""Brendan C.

In contrast to early video experimentations, contemporary computational image processing simulates and manipulates various visual media in a manner well-adjusted for digital computation and display.

This essay describes Villalpando's decision to invest so much pictorial energy in letterforms against this geographic backdrop. Doing so reveals several social registers in which writing had taken on particular professional charge, and opens on to a yet broader artistic sensitivity to writing: its forms and modes of production. The Spanish Empire's extensive bureaucracy of paper made imperial subjects highly sensitive to script's visual and material qualities, such that Villalpando and his fellow artists could capitalize upon them both to produce meaning within their pictures, and to engineer particular constructions of self. In juxtaposing distinct domains of writing – notarial, educational, performative – with paintings, this essay stakes a methodological claim for considering the archive, broadly conceived, as a place just as important for looking as for reading and transcription.","[{""name"": ""Aaron M.

Call this counterfactual reasoning in art criticism. On my account, counterfactual claims about artworks involve comparative aesthetic judgments between actual artworks and hypothetical variations of those works. The practice of imagining what an artwork could have been is critically useful because it can help us understand how artworks achieve specific aesthetic effects. I conclude by responding to an objection to my account on the basis that it violates the widely accepted acquaintance principle in aesthetics, on which aesthetic judgments must be based on firsthand perceptual encounters with their objects.","[{""name"": ""Angela Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, University of Michigan , Ann Arbor, MI , US""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1755-2567.1973.tb00630.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-021-01628-x"", ""10.2307/2678446"", ""10.1086/698732"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2008.00293.x"", ""10.1111/jaac.12406"", ""10.1007/s11098-014-0392-y"", ""10.1093/mind/fzz054"", ""10.2307/2182490"", ""10.2307/2183262"", ""10.2307/778974"", ""10.2307/2183933""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Astronomy, an inherently observational science, affords a case study of a discipline in which controlled experiments cannot be performed. The author argues that in such disciplines maps and mapping serve to interpolate intellectually between observation and experiment. This is particularly noticeable in the early conceptions of cosmos and changes in worldview wherein major cognitive shifts are encoded in maps. With historical advances in map-making techniques, the epistemic purposes served by maps have also evolved significantly. Maps in astronomy today are deployed as powerful visual devices that record and transmute observational data to support theoretical ideas underpinning our current understanding of the cosmos. One example is dark matter maps, which offer compelling indirect evidence for the existence of the elusive dominant matter component that shapes our universe: dark matter.","[{""name"": ""Priyamvada Natarajan"", ""affiliation"": [""Priyamvada Natarajan (astrophysicist), Yale University, Department of Astronomy, 52 Hillhouse Avenue, CT 06511, U.S.A..""]}]","[""10.1086/349045""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Arts and Humanities']","['History and Philosophy of Science', 'Astronomy and Astrophysics']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7193), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7071)]]"

Wyndham Lewis was a fervent supporter and mentor, but his writings on Williams employed clichéd characterizations of primitivism and colonialism that limited a fuller understanding of the artist's intentions for his work. Wilson Harris's more fully considered essays provide an interesting counterpart. Williams's contribution to British modernism of the 1950s, which was largely eclipsed following his departure for Africa and eventual return to Guyana, should, it is argued, be reconsidered as part of a fuller and more inclusive assessment of that period.","[{""name"": ""Allison Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Archeology', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

My argument begins with a summary and critique of an important precedent, Noël Carroll’s essentialist definition of the detached moving image display. The remainder of my discussion concentrates on the structure and dynamics of a particular sort of luminescent display. This display is essential to what I call the cinematic display. As I understand it, the cinematic display is neither the or a medium of cinema nor perforce a vehicle for artistic content. It is, rather, a luminescent display in service of someone’s presentational intentions. I conclude with thoughts about the ontological relation between cinematic displays and works, the latter tentatively defined as a display of expressive or artistic agency.","[{""name"": ""Trevor Ponech"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of English, McGill University ,""]}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-19601-1_2"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511551277"", ""10.7551/mitpress/5792.001.0001"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511674716"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199596201.001.0001"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198865452.001.0001"", ""10.1093/0199278067.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9780203356753"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199862139.003.0006"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190938635.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-19601-1_3""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Literature and Literary Theory', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7442), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7423)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

It shapes how we experience, move through, and attach meaning to space, as well as how space is territorialized and bounded. Street art can be a restructuring force that changes how a space is legible or interpretable to its users, how it is used, how it is experienced, and how it forms a territory with insiders and outsiders. But how street art does this along with what kinds of impact it has varies dramatically from neighborhood to neighborhood. More specifically, the relationship between street art, placemaking, and capitalism is remarkably different in different neighborhoods. Street art can support capitalist placemarketing, or it can work toward secession from the capitalist landscape, either by preserving or by creating alternative place identities. I use three different neighborhoods in New York City—The Bowery, El Barrio, and the South Bronx—as case studies for each of the three phenomena, respectively. I end by examining a paradox that street art faces: explicitly anti-capitalist street art is easily coopted by capitalist forces that seek to commodify its aesthetic, so attempts to use street art to combat capitalist appropriations of space often (though not always) backfire.","[{""name"": ""Quill R Kukla"", ""affiliation"": [""Georgetown University Department of Philosophy,  , Washington, D.C. ,""]}]","[""10.30965/9783846759097_010"", ""10.1093/monist/onx033"", ""10.1111/jaac.12261"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190855369.001.0001"", ""10.1353/lag.2004.0009"", ""10.1080/14649365.2022.2134580"", ""10.1177/12063312221090608"", ""10.1386/vi_00007_2"", ""10.1386/aps.3.2.161_1"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8306.1991.tb01715.x"", ""10.4324/9780203796917""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Urban Studies']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)]]"

The argument for this interpretation knits together Bolzano’s aesthetics, his ethics, and his philosophy of science.

However, as a biocultural phenomenon within a posthuman framework, it manifests a complex lattice of multispecies relationships, microbiopolitics, and metaphorical figurations that are adopted in works of art and biology as medium and content. In this article, the authors analyze artworks and projects that utilize fermentation by artists such as WhiteFeather Hunter, Amor Muñoz, Anna Dumitriu, and others. These works explore fermentation in the creation of biomaterials, its role in foods like cheese, and its status as a metaphorical figuration in hybrid mechanisms that give center stage to fermentation as a biocultural artifact embodying a nature-culture continuum in a microbial postanthropocentric framework.","[{""name"": ""Mariana Pérez Bobadilla"", ""affiliation"": [""Mariana Pérez Bobadilla, Mexico City, Mexico.

He recounts in his memoirs how he ordered the naked “idols” destroyed. While this famed episode of iconoclasm in the Bāburnāma is well known to scholars, three paintings portraying Babur's trip to Gwalior that survive from the multiple illustrated manuscripts commissioned by Babur's grandson Akbar (r. 1556–1605) have eluded close examination. This article probes the divergent representational strategies employed by the artists of those folios tasked with depicting the same scene. I demonstrate how one artist pictorially transformed Gwalior's rock-hewn Tirthankaras into animate idols, another alluded to yet elided their portrayal, and a third bypassed entirely the thorny issue of their representation. I argue that those illustrations constitute a visual emendation to Babur's memoirs that effectively exonerated Babur from any charge of desecrating inert Jain icons—an act by then incongruous with Akbar's policy of ṣulḥ-i kull and the strong Mughal-Jain relations at his court. This proposition is further supported by an original translation of an excerpt from Siddhicandra's (d. ca. 1666) Bhānucandragaṇicarita, a Sanskrit text composed by a Jain monk at the Mughal court. Ultimately, this study contributes to critical discourses on iconoclasm, artistic agency, Mughal-Jain relations, and historical memory by exploring the theoretical issues concerning the depiction of rock carvings and idols in the pictorial afterlife of Babur's encounter with Gwalior's rock-hewn Tirthankaras.","[{""name"": ""Ross Lee Bernhaut"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_8692"", ""10.1163/9789004462083_009"", ""10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_0350"", ""10.1080/19472498.2020.1719755"", ""10.1163/000000099124993040"", ""10.1163/156852005774918813"", ""10.2307/3177288"", ""10.1017/S0020743813000494"", ""10.1163/9789004379121_005"", ""10.1177/0376983615597155"", ""10.1177/0376983613475862"", ""10.1177/0971945813514887"", ""10.1080/05786967.2021.1911735"", ""10.1177/0019464612463806"", ""10.1017/S0026749X2100041X"", ""10.1017/S001041750100353X"", ""10.1163/22118993-90000180"", ""10.2307/3249892"", ""10.2307/3249873"", ""10.1163/22118993-00321P02"", ""10.1163/22118993-90000140"", ""10.1017/S0026749X14000055"", ""10.1215/1089201X-9987801"", ""10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_1125"", ""10.1163/22118993-90000085"", ""10.1163/156852011X614019""]",['Social Sciences'],['Political Science and International Relations'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)]]"

Además, tras desvelar la compleja serie de campañas de renovación que dicho coro sufrió desde la década de 1470 hasta el siglo XVIII, se presenta una hipótesis que identifica los restos materiales de la primera sillería creada por los hermanos Hanequín de Bruselas y Egas Cueman a mediados del siglo XV y explica por qué esta tuvo que ser renovada muy poco tiempo después de su creación.","[{""name"": ""Ángel Fuentes Ortiz"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""María Teresa Chicote Pompanin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/1291549"", ""10.5209/rev_ANHA.2013.v23.41563"", ""10.30965/25890530-0410102003"", ""10.3989/aearte.2020.19"", ""10.1515/jtms-2014-0019"", ""10.1163/9789004289673"", ""10.3989/aearte.2017.07"", ""10.7788/9783412511944.173"", ""10.1515/9783839447413-003"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1453n0p"", ""10.1163/15700674-12342164"", ""10.3989/aearte.2019.09"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198797456.001.0001""]",['Arts and Humanities'],"['Archeology', 'History', 'Conservation']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

In the context of NFTs, this opinion has the significance of finding artistry in the underlying decentralized autonomous consensus-building, and in the context of contemporary art, it has the significance of leading to the revival of early conceptual art. The second half of this statement covers the novelty and feasibility of this opinion, referring to precedents in art and engineering.","[{""name"": ""Kensuke Ito"", ""affiliation"": [""Kensuke Ito, Endowed Chair for Blockchain Innovation, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ward, Tokyo, 7-3-1, Japan.

In the authors’ experiment, portrait artists drew illusions they perceived during a 10-minute eye-to-eye gazing session while paired in dyads with naive participants. Dissociation was measured through standard self-report questionnaires. Results showed that portraits became more abstract and less figurative as the artists experienced higher levels of nonpathological dissociation. Statistically, a significant correlation was found between art-abstraction ratings and dissociation scores by judges and portrait artists, respectively. Findings are discussed in relationship to portraits à la manière de Scipione and Francis Bacon.","[{""name"": ""Giovanni B. Caputo"", ""affiliation"": [""Giovanni B.

I speculate that these tendencies were intensified in Korean cultural traditions by distinctive sociopolitical circumstances of the Joseon period under the dominance of Neo-Confucianism, such as a fixed social hierarchy and Sino-centrist perspectives. This interpretation provides a useful lens for better understanding contemporary Korean artistic practices in both the fine and popular arts.","[{""name"": ""Dobin Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department, University of Iowa, Iowa City , IA 52242 , USA""]}]","[""10.1002/9781118927021"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-2933-1""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Urban Studies', 'Cultural Studies']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0502 外国语言文学', 0.7548), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.7513)]]"

Kant classifies Mannerism as aping, but considers manner the only valid means of artistic expression. These opposed uses of maniera echo a historical controversy, which finds reconciliation in Kant in what I call artistic autonomy. For Kant, artistic expression of genuine originality requires autonomous action, the individual manner in which an artist selects, transforms and applies given academic rules, in a way that renders an aesthetic vision meaningful. His grave concern is that artists, in their aspiration to innovate, might make the freedom to modify and transform rules into the very aim of their artistic endeavor. In order to grasp the full significance of Kant’s view, I examine the contradictory attitudes towards maniera articulated by Vasari and Bellori. Kant’s account of artistic autonomy offers an understanding of artistic succession, different from that of his predecessors.","[{""name"": ""Aviv Reiter"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the Department of General Philosophy, Bar-Ilan University , Israel""]}]","[""10.1017/CBO9780511612671"", ""10.1080/00048400701571677"", ""10.1017/S1369415412000015"", ""10.1353/hph.1997.0076"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab016"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791925.018"", ""10.1515/kant.1984.75.1-4.65"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ays058"", ""10.1515/kant-2012-0023"", ""10.1177/1363460706065048"", ""10.1515/hgjb-2017-0107""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Philosophy'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Plato describes beauty in terms of what it is not (an approach sometimes referred to apophasis, or the via negativa). In this paper, I argue that Platonic apophatic practise in the Hippias Major and the Symposium depicts beauty as an ally to certain aspirations of philosophical discourse. In the first section, I offer some brief prefatory remarks on the nature of apophasis and its presence in Plato’s thinking. In the second section, I provide some background to the dialogue of the Hippias Major and highlight the apophatic nature of the descriptions of beauty offered therein. In the third and final section, I discuss the Symposium, a dialogue within which, in addition to representing beauty apophatically, Plato illustrates how we may become able to achieve some positive, or cataphatic, insights into the nature of beauty. I conclude that the purpose of the Platonic apophatic portrayal of beauty in the Hippias Major and the Symposium is to show that, while beauty cannot be reduced to a series of assertive truth statements, it can nevertheless function as an accessory to other dimensions of philosophical thinking.","[{""name"": ""Catherine Wesselinoff"", ""affiliation"": [""Philosophy Department, The University of Notre Dame Australia , Chippendale, NSW 2008 , Australia""]}]","[""10.1017/S0009838800024873"", ""10.1163/156852864X00195"", ""10.1017/9781108986243.002"", ""10.4324/9780203101377"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511583131"", ""10.5840/philinquiry2015393/436""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Anthropology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

Siqueiros was one of many artists who joined antifascist (and later Popular Front) organizations, and circulated their art beyond the traditional spaces of localized art worlds – into the streets and across national boundaries – to animate a global artistic network. The process of making the period transnational – artists and journal editors' work of clipping, replicating, and reusing images, texts, and ideas in new contexts, with new meanings – created chains of transnational iconography, and rendered montage as the period's central aesthetic. Period debates and polemics, waged at conferences and in journals, weaponized this culture. Siqueiros and Josep Renau's 1939–40 mural for the Mexican Electricians' Syndicate began as a final homage to the fallen Spanish Republic; the transformation of the mural, however, ultimately marked the end of Popular Front art.","[{""name"": ""Jennifer Jolly"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],['History'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)]]"

Designers leverage this principle to imply shapes without explicitly showing them. However, evaluating viewer responses poses challenges. The author conducted a comprehensive eye-tracking experiment to determine when viewers mentally completed a gap in a circle and explored the potential influence of the golden ratio on the closure principle. The golden ratio, approximately 1.618, is associated with visual harmony and is used in art and design to create pleasing proportions. Findings showed that viewers tend to mentally close gaps up to 135° but avoid closure beyond 150°. This suggests the golden ratio’s relevance in applying the closure principle to design.","[{""name"": ""Xinran Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""Xinran Hu, Ernest G.

10.1093/aesthj/ayad046,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,An Analytic of Eeriness,"Abstract In this paper, I analyse the phenomenon of eeriness as a kind of strange aesthetic experience. Beginning with Fisher’s insight (The Weird and the Eerie, 2017) that we can distinguish weirdness and eeriness from uncanniness, I offer an original account of eeriness. I argue that eeriness is the appearance of an underdetermination in the spatio-temporal location of objects of experience, relative to experiencing agent; this underdetermination results in a destabilisation of the “horizon of object-ivity” within which we make sense of the objects of appearance. This has the existential consequence of destabilising the subject’s sense of being-in-the world. I ground the analysis in examples from both fictional and non-fictional contexts to indicate the generality of the analysis.","[{""name"": ""Richard Stopford"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Durham University ,""]}]","[""10.4324/9780203461853"", ""10.1093/oso/9780190666507.001.0001"", ""10.2307/778795"", ""10.1093/0199259747.001.0001"", ""10.5040/9781350252059"", ""10.4324/9780203720714"", ""10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235018.003.0016"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy028"", ""10.4159/9780674286771""]",['Psychology'],['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology'],"[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"

Born in Trinidad, McNish trained in London; her work crosses the line between fine and decorative art; and she brings the history of modern pattern design into dialogue with the history of Black British art. Focusing on her textiles of the 1950s and 1960s, this article foregrounds the multivalence of McNish's practice, exploring the productive tensions and possibilities that arise from her work's location at multiple points of intersection. Examining her treatment of colour and line, it demonstrates that McNish's textiles embody in their complex screen‐printed surfaces the composite, multi‐layered character of cultures and identities. The article considers McNish's participation in activism, and argues that her work prefigures the Black British Art Movement of the 1980s and global postmodern appropriations of the decorative by exploiting the subversive power of pattern.","[{""name"": ""Imogen Hart"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Urban Studies', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

But while “biodiversity” has become a buzzword in media and policy, conservationists have found it difficult to build a common understanding on the nature and severity of biodiversity loss and the means to tackle it. Perhaps surprisingly, many biologists and philosophers have proposed that biodiversity might be best defended with reference to its aesthetic value. This article explores whether aesthetic values could provide strong support for biodiversity conservation. By exploring the question from the viewpoints of species diversity, ecosystem diversity, and genetic diversity, we argue that there is a mismatch between apparent and real biodiversity and that aesthetics can, at best, give only limited support for biodiversity conservation.","[{""name"": ""Jukka Mikkonen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Social Sciences and Philosophy & School of Resource Wisdom, University of Jyväskylä , Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Kaisa J Raatikainen"", ""affiliation"": [""Finnish Environment Institute, Societal Change Unit, Jyväskylä; School of Resource Wisdom, University of Jyväskylä , Finland""]}]","[""10.1038/s41477-021-00912-2"", ""10.1093/biosci/biaa062"", ""10.5840/envirophil20164132"", ""10.2305/IUCN.CH.2016.RLE.3.en"", ""10.1515/9781474465380"", ""10.3197/096327106778226202"", ""10.1016/j.biocon.2013.02.006"", ""10.1002/pan3.10455"", ""10.1080/1090377032000063306"", ""10.1111/jaac.12586"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00310.x"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.2003997"", ""10.1525/bio.2012.62.1.9"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0012568"", ""10.1098/rsbl.2007.0149"", ""10.1007/s10980-007-9110-x"", ""10.1111/j.1468-5930.1989.tb00389.x"", ""10.1073/pnas.1117511109"", ""10.1073/pnas.1701370114"", ""10.5840/enviroethics198911123"", ""10.5840/enviroethics1980217"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226406589.001.0001"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2014.04.002"", ""10.5840/enviroethics201032215"", ""10.1080/13698230903326315"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.03.011"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.08.017"", ""10.1016/j.tree.2021.12.011"", ""10.1007/BF00158868"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511498527.002"", ""10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107935"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.3001640"", ""10.1016/j.biocon.2009.10.003"", ""10.1007/s10539-019-9726-7"", ""10.2752/175303713X13534238631399"", ""10.5840/pcw200310218"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226500829.001.0001"", ""10.1111/geoj.12018"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-10991-2_17"", ""10.3197/096327121X16245253346567"", ""10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127"", ""10.1080/21550085.2015.1018380"", ""10.1017/9781139024105"", ""10.1016/j.tree.2015.08.009"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-384719-5.00003-4"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.3.279"", ""10.1353/cjp.2006.0010"", ""10.1111/japp.12069"", ""10.1126/science.1246752"", ""10.3197/096327117X14809634978519"", ""10.5040/9781509924639"", ""10.1353/pbm.2000.0052"", ""10.1002/9780470751664"", ""10.5840/enviroethics19813248"", ""10.2307/795401"", ""10.5840/enviroethics199820228"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac56.2.0101"", ""10.1038/s41893-019-0267-5"", ""10.1007/s10539-014-9426-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-10991-2"", ""10.1038/s44185-023-00026-2"", ""10.5840/monist20028515"", ""10.3390/d2010127"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-10991-2"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2022.07.066"", ""10.2307/1310054"", ""10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2021.03.060"", ""10.1007/s10745-006-9056-7"", ""10.1007/s10531-018-1509-y"", ""10.5840/enviroethics199517319"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-384719-5.00061-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-10991-2_16"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0283360"", ""10.1038/srep34229"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-29637-7"", ""10.1098/rsbl.2019.0703"", ""10.1098/rspb.2018.0971"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-09084-6"", ""10.1111/jaac.12599""]","['Environmental Science', 'Psychology']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Social Psychology', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

This is often treated as a question about spontaneity, or the experience of control: does the event of having an idea for a new artwork occur unexpectedly and without foresight? I suggest another way of interpreting the question—one that has mostly been neglected by philosophers, and that is not settled by claims about spontaneity. According to that interpretation, the question is about agency: are the events of having ideas for new artworks exercises of mental agency? I argue that the answer is no. I apply the results of this argument to questions about what is and is not intentional in the creative process. I conclude by examining another type of control artists might exercise over their creative mental events, which I call ‘facilitation’.","[{""name"": ""Christopher Prodoehl"", ""affiliation"": [""Barnard College, Columbia University , USA""]}]","[""10.1215/00318108-1539089"", ""10.2307/2185049"", ""10.1007/s11229-018-01933-9"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199225989.003.0009"", ""10.2307/2023177"", ""10.1093/0199246270.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2012.01518.x"", ""10.1111/nous.12092"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511804656"", ""10.12987/yale/9780300087581.001.0001"", ""10.4324/9781351199797-13"", ""10.1086/381695"", ""10.1093/0199278067.001.0001"", ""10.5840/monist197962319"", ""10.1057/9780230294899_14"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195071146.001.0001"", ""10.5840/monist19102037"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199693818.001.0001"", ""10.1007/978-1-4020-5265-1_9"", ""10.2307/2183262"", ""10.1086/426957"", ""10.1111/j.0066-7372.2003.00071.x"", ""10.1093/oso/9780198238256.001.0001"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2006.00628.x"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199261871.001.0001""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

For some, the novel depicts the wonder and vulnerability of a culture of convenience and conformity, while others have suggested that it highlights the gender discrimination faced by women in contemporary Japan. Yet the novel is ripe for analyses from other perspectives. This paper presents one such new approach to analysing Murata’s Convenience Store Woman: its social-cum-auditory aesthetic. The theory of social aesthetics, developed by Arnold Berleant, essentially holds that there are perceptive values to be found not only in objects but also in social situations. The paper will argue that the convenience store’s environment – the social interactions, and soundscape presented in the novel – invokes and evokes a variety of aesthetic qualities, among them ‘acceptance’, ‘sensuousness’, and ‘reciprocity’. Combining a re-reading methodology and an application of Berleant’s social aesthetics theory, I will show how these sensibilities can be observed through the experiences of Keiko Furukawa, a life-long convenience store worker and the novel’s protagonist. Specifically, the focus will be on Keiko’s auditory sensibilities.","[{""name"": ""Garcia Chambers"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/B978-0-12-381431-9.00020-6"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16569-7_2""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

In other words, can such a disagreement be a sign of my failing in my present aesthetic judgement? In this paper, I argue that revising one’s judgement in response to disagreeing with one’s former self is appropriate but only when the former and the present self share the same aesthetic personality. The possibility of failure in one’s aesthetic judgement is therefore bound up, among other things, with facts about one’s aesthetic identity over time. The resulting view has implications for our understanding of the scope of the autonomy in aesthetics and is consistent with empirical evidence regarding the way in which people evaluate aesthetic judgments.","[{""name"": ""Uku Tooming"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/09515089.2021.2014440"", ""10.1215/00318108-2006-035"", ""10.1111/mila.12210"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00656.x"", ""10.2307/45128642"", ""10.5840/jphil201110838"", ""10.1111/1468-0378.00134"", ""10.2307/2564672"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199285891.003.0007"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199669639.003.0002"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayac026"", ""10.1111/j.1540-6245.2010.01398.x"", ""10.1093/mind/fzz054"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayv026"", ""10.1017/S1358246114000265"", ""10.1111/j.1933-1592.2010.00391.x"", ""10.1007/s11098-012-9869-8"", ""10.2307/2183933""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"
10.1093/aesthj/ayac061,BRITISH JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,Aesthetic Austerity in Persuasion,"Abstract How can we distinguish the permissible use of aesthetic features in persuasive communication from their manipulative misuse? The paper reconstructs the basic argument (proposed by Stoics and others in antiquity) that persuasive speech should be aesthetically austere. The argument, it is suggested, is fundamentally sound. But the view it sustains is subject to challenge, on the grounds that it is implausible and impractical in the real world. By making clear the grounds on which the “austere” view is justified, and by making precise the arguments that underlie those challenges, the paper identifies and evaluates three different possible responses to those challenges. The most promising of these accepts the argument for “austerity” but proposes a more moderate interpretation of its conclusion. In doing so, it takes up the challenge of providing a defensible rationale for distinguishing the permissible from the impermissible use of aesthetic features in persuasive communication.","[{""name"": ""Jamie Dow"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leeds , UK""]}]","[""10.1017/S0009838800037034"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199338207.001.0001"", ""10.1017/S1358246118000760"", ""10.1023/A:1020212716425"", ""10.1080/00048409912349061"", ""10.5840/soctheorpract199521120"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199338207.003.0007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9213.2006.454.x""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

While the links between artefacts and society are well understood, there has been little work that finds the opportunity for resistance to violence in these artefacts themselves. Developing a ‘spectrum of violence’ for artefacts, I argue that ambiguous artefacts move us towards non-violence by provoking critique, while absolute artefacts move us away from it by stilling critique. Applying this spectrum to a discussion of a graffitied New York monument in 2020, I propose that the act of ‘refacement’ can turn absolute artefacts into ambiguous ones. In so doing, the artefacts that once upheld colonial values might be transformed to resist them. This paper offers a timely exploration of monuments and violence, and seeks to better understand how cultural artefacts can lay the foundations for a non-violent future.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas Forrest Frayne"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Cambridge , UK""]}]","[""10.1080/13604813.2020.1784578"", ""10.1080/20507828.2021.1924553"", ""10.1080/13602365.2021.1958899"", ""10.7551/mitpress/11681.001.0001"", ""10.7208/chicago/9780226774497.001.0001"", ""10.1215/9780822373551"", ""10.1080/13507480500047811"", ""10.4000/etudesafricaines.20860"", ""10.2307/j.ctv125jqxp.8"", ""10.1215/9780822379799"", ""10.2307/j.ctt1v2xskk"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195314564.001.0001"", ""10.4038/cjmr.v6i1.61"", ""10.1596/978-1-4648-1162-3_es""]",['Social Sciences'],"['Anthropology', 'Urban Studies', 'Law']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0833 城乡规划学', 0.7511), ('0705 地理学', 0.7475)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

One answer to this question holds that finding sexist humour funny reveals that you have sexist beliefs, whilst another holds that it reveals nothing deeper about you at all. I argue that neither of these answers are correct, as neither can capture the feeling of unwilling complicity we often get from enjoying sexist jokes. Rather, we should navigate between these two positions by understanding the sense of humour as a kind of sensibility or taste, analogous to Anne Eaton’s account of erotic taste. This allows for a fleshing out of the purely belief-centred understanding of the sense of humour, adding emotional, perceptual and motivational aspects to it. Finally, I propose that one’s sense of humour is shaped the representations one engages with, which suggests a possible avenue for habituating it in a more egalitarian direction.","[{""name"": ""Zoe Walker"", ""affiliation"": [""Oxford University ,""]}]","[""10.1111/phc3.12240"", ""10.1111/j.1527-2001.1986.tb00522.x"", ""10.2307/2653403"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190257910.003.0012"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9833.1996.tb00225.x"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791925"", ""10.1177/0956797610376073"", ""10.1111/phc3.12320"", ""10.1163/9789004548817"", ""10.1080/00455091.1984.10716369"", ""10.3917/enf.533.0247"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-15202-4_11"", ""10.1348/000712602162553"", ""10.1080/00201748808602144"", ""10.1007/s10677-009-9203-5""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Gender Studies', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7467), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.741)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

10.1215/00666637-9953418,ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory; 0303 Sociology,A Forgotten Family Portrait Irenic Saivism in the Art of Ancient Dasapura,"Abstract Ancient Daśapura was the site of an internally complex Śaiva religious community. The Aulikara rulers used Śaivism as a political idiom to celebrate military might and royal power. Their ministers, the Naigamas, promoted an irenic vision that praised Śiva as a source of protection and prosperity. Attention to those expressions of Śaivism enable us to contextualize one of Daśapura's most famous, yet enigmatic, works of art: an ithyphallic male figure depicted with a double phallus (ca. sixth c. ce). To date, the sculpture has remained impossible to place within the greater artistic landscape of the region. This study proposes a resolution by showing that the icon was conceived as part of a triad of sculptures that included Śiva's wife, Pārvatī, and their son, Skanda. The images of Śiva and Skanda are displayed at the Bhopal Museum, and while their similarities have been noted in previous studies, they have not been viewed as part of a set. The reason for this is their separation from an unpublished Pārvatī that currently is displayed in the Mandasor Archaeological Museum and identified as a yakṣī. When viewed as part of a triad, the double-phallus figure is transformed from an iconographic puzzle into an innovative visual strategy to reconcile what might seem opposing facets of a divine persona—that is, the ascetic and the family man. By presenting these icons as a “family portrait,” this study recontextualizes important works of art from early India and initiates broader considerations of the political and religious ideologies that inspired their production.","[{""name"": ""Elizabeth A.

10.1093/jaac/kpad034,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 0101 Philosophy; 1301 Art Theory,A Dual-Process Model of Xunzi's Philosophy of Music,"Abstract Music, alongside ritual, plays an important role in Confucian moral education. Among all the Confucians, Xunzi gives music the most radical ability to transform people, and this is striking given his pessimistic view of human nature. Though he set the standard for Chinese aesthetics for millennia, there is no systematic account that brings together Xunzi’s various commitments: that only music from virtuous previous dynasties are morally conducive, that music can bring about lasting character change, that even those uninterested in moral cultivation can benefit from music, and that the junzi (“gentleman”) and the xiaoren (“petty man”) derive joy in different ways while listening to music. In this article, I explain why currently existing accounts cannot capture all the commitments, and I turn to analytic aesthetics to provide a new Dual-Process Model of Xunzi’s philosophy of music. Jenefer Robinson’s discussions of “the Jazzercise effect” and emotional misattribution will be key in the new account.","[{""name"": ""Hannah H Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Arizona , USA""]}]","[""10.1353/book18809"", ""10.7312/fras14926"", ""10.1007/s11712-016-9515-9"", ""10.2307/1396785"", ""10.1111/phil.12243"", ""10.2979/philmusieducrevi.23.2.183"", ""10.1007/s11712-013-9331-4"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190498818.003.0007"", ""10.1515/9781400852550"", ""10.1163/9789004423626_008""]","['Neuroscience', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Clinical Psychology', 'Sensory Systems', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7628), ('1011 护理学', 0.7409)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7388), ('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7302)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

A case for aesthetic obligations,"Abstract This paper has two main aims. The first is to examine our normative relations to artworks and cultural artefacts threatened by damage or destruction. The second aim is to develop an argument for the notion of aesthetic obligation, offering an alternative model of explanation of our normative relations to artworks and cultural artefacts which relies neither exclusively on the object of appreciation (‘object-oriented approach’) nor on the appreciating subject (‘subject-oriented approach’). Instead, an aesthetic obligation is held to be directed primarily towards the community which appreciates the object on the grounds of its aesthetic value. That which unites an aesthetic community is the practice of valuing an object for its aesthetic character. The notion of aesthetic obligation thus relies both on the community of subjects which holds an object in high aesthetic regard and that same object’s aesthetic value.","[{""name"": ""Elisabeth Schellekens"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Philosophy, Uppsala University , Sweden""]}]","[""10.1002/9781118609088"", ""10.1111/papq.12346"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayy015"", ""10.2307/26897023"", ""10.1111/j.1540-594X.2008.00283.x"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab060"", ""10.1093/arisup/akac003"", ""10.4324/9780203602263"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107444911""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Social Sciences']","['Philosophy', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Law']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0301 法学', 0.727), ('1012 法医学', 0.7153)]]"

Drawing out the role of remoteness within phenomenological accounts of perception (Husserl and Merleau-Ponty), as well as offering an analysis of a wide range of archaeological evidence, I argue that realism does not capture the specificity of these human representations. In contrast to naturalistic animal representations, humans are consistently represented with a high degree of abstraction e.g. schematisation and abbreviation. I also argue for a site-specific distinction between deep caves and rock-shelters. Following Bourdier (2010) and Pinçon (2012), art at sites such as Roc-aux-Sorciers is best understood as stylised ‘public art’. Meanwhile, the highly expressive and realist art of La Marche is domestic in contrast to the exclusively symbolic art of deep caves. In conclusion I argue that ‘making-remote’ in cave art’s human representations exhibits complex relations to self and others.","[{""name"": ""Fiona Hughes"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Essex , UK""]}]","[""10.3406/galip.1991.2285"", ""10.3406/bspf.1954.3072"", ""10.3406/galip.1971.1384"", ""10.1093/jaac/kpab022"", ""10.4324/9780203994610"", ""10.1093/oso/9780199299171.001.0001"", ""10.2307/j.ctvh1dng1.9""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Social Sciences']","['Archeology', 'Anthropology', 'Paleontology']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7562), ('0602 中国史', 0.7304)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7076), ('0709 地质学', 0.7071)]]"

It engages in close visual readings of Naming the Money (2004), Tousssaint L'Ouverture (1987), and a series of nine paintings Himid has referred to as the Walter Benjamin Kangas (2016), also known as New Kangas from the Archive. Taking different kinds of time as its structural framework, the essay presents new ways of thinking about these artworks that cross past and present narratives of trauma, political agency, subjectivity and change. The essay demonstrates how the use of colour, installation and collage, in a re‐address to history, to art history, to monuments, to time, to memory and to visibility, are central to Himid's practices as an artist: a practice in which she wrests painting from its traditional function as an instrument for white western canon formation, and re‐deploys it in dialogical relation to its origins.","[{""name"": ""Dorothy Price"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

With camps in both disciplines attempting to minimize human intervention in the realm of decision‐making, ‘formalism’ could take on mechanical overtones, thereby linking art and science in profound ways. This essay considers the ways in which the austere abstract paintings of Morris Louis from the years surrounding 1960 bring these dual formalisms into focus. When viewed through the criticism of Clement Greenberg and the near‐unwavering faith President Kennedy's administration placed in new technocratic ways of waging war, Louis's paintings can be seen as beatified expressions of a mechanical rationality that also brought the world to the brink of nuclear apocalypse. Through deep engagement with Greenberg's criticism and media archives, the essay forges links between Greenberg's version of Louis and the dark sides of this rationality. The article concludes by locating ways to consider Louis's paintings outside of the Greenbergian straitjacket – recapturing the strangeness and chaotic nature of the painter's practice.","[{""name"": ""John J.

The review article assesses and extends the understanding and definitions of forms of mandala in India and China, recognizing the distinction between textual accounts of internal, visualized mandalas (bhāvyamaṇḍala), and the external, physical objects (lekhyamaṇḍala). Questions concerning the role(s) of the viewer and the purpose(s) of the Dunhuang shrines for the patrons and designers are also raised. For the patrons and designers, the shrines surely provided opportunities for acts of merit-making and expressions of gratitude for good fortune. For viewers and later visitors, were the shrines coded expressions of discursive Buddhist “meaning” and “repentance rituals,” as Wang mainly argues, or (perhaps also) locales for gestalt experience of the presence of consecrated deities? The attribution of the visual style to a Nepalese-derived Tibetan mode is also examined.","[{""name"": ""Rob Linrothe"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1086/676515"", ""10.1093/jaarel/lfg077"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004160644.i-310.27"", ""10.1163/9789004417731_006"", ""10.1163/ej.9789004182035.i-254.23""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['Religious studies', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0101 哲学', 0.7671), ('0305 马克思主义理论', 0.7585)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

The video, in which Chinese written words become the true protagonists, was originally a commissioned installation presented at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco from October 2012 to January 2013. The article aims to model a form of extremely close analysis of new media art, which borrows vocabulary and methodologies from both art history and media studies. While making a timely contribution to Xu Bing scholarship by focusing on an understudied work in his oeuvre, it also adds new lines of inquiry: first, with regard to text-image reciprocity, which continues to be a focal point in studies of contemporary Chinese art; and second, with regard to animation-calligraphy reciprocity, which begs more critical attention. The Character of Characters, I argue, invokes a double vision that sees words on screen simultaneously as linguistic texts and pictorial shapes, a vision through which and because of which the activities of looking and reading are combined into one.","[{""name"": ""Panpan Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2307/488328"", ""10.1386/ac.14.1.56_1"", ""10.1086/505377"", ""10.1177/1746847711417930""]",['Computer Science'],['Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design'],"[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7662), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7556)]]"
10.1111/1467-8365.12573,ART HISTORY,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory,Writing to Barnett Newman: F. N. Souza and the End of Modernism,"Beginning with an unsolicited letter to Barnett Newman written by the Indian modernist F. N. Souza, this essay seeks to reframe our understanding of the decline of modernism. Art‐historical consensus holds that, as the 1960s progressed, modernist art was swept aside by demands for political engagement to which it could not adapt. Souza's letter complicates this. On one hand, it criticizes Newman's latest paintings for expressing modernist values such as autonomy, transcendence, and universality, for amounting to the claim that ‘colour is ethics’. But on the other, rather than abandoning such concepts, as did most advanced art in the 1960s, Souza demands another, political modernism, one capable of grounding itself in reflection on the movement's historical complicity with colonialism and racism. This was a difficult project, and I reject the view that it was inherently progressive; indeed, I draw out the reactionary attitudes to which it could all‐too‐easily lead. Souza's desire, by 1969, to move beyond these without abandoning the historicity of modernism positions him closer to Newman than his letter suggests. Both proceeded, in ways that refuse the schematic alternatives of traditional art history, by making work that addressed political reality through the reflexive critique of modernism itself.","[{""name"": ""Saul Nelson"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Arts and Humanities', 'Social Sciences']","['History', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

This regional orientalism, with its cosmopolitan claims and internationally networked cultural politics, is located outside Britain's geographic imperium but within its economic networks, unsettling the boundaries of our nationally circumscribed histories of art. Church's interior was informed by his own experience of travel within the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire, and was formed through a transatlantic web of British, French and American artists, dealers and collectors who were organizing and codifying Islamic art for Western consumers and audiences. But many of these objects that travelled across cultures brought with them a range of cultural narratives that only come into view if we expand the geographic scope of our art history beyond the transatlantic nexus to engage contemporaneous networks of state making and art making in the Islamicate world.","[{""name"": ""Mary Roberts"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],['Anthropology'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7437), ('0304 民族学', 0.7365)]]"

And supposing we come to achieve such discernment, how should we properly appreciate the aesthetic qualities we thereby find? To address these questions, Carlson has argued that the aesthetic appreciation of nature ought to be guided by scientific insight. In response, non-cognitivists have levelled criticism and suggested alternatives, yet Carlson’s (2009) scientific cognitivism remains the best-argued approach to nature appreciation in the field. One non-cognitivist position that Carlson rejects—although much too quickly—is Berleant’s (1985)engagement model. The purpose of this paper is to modify and revive that model. Specifically, I will argue that genuine engagement requires a particular form of disinterest. The result is a non-cognitivist approach to the aesthetic appreciation of nature, stronger than the extant alternatives.","[{""name"": ""Benjamin Claessens"", ""affiliation"": [""The Graduate Center, City University of New York , USA""]}]","[""10.1093/aesthj/aym010"", ""10.1017/S1358246111000221"", ""10.1515/9781474465380"", ""10.1111/j.0066-7372.2003.00007.x"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayl024"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511554605.012"", ""10.1080/13668790701345235"", ""10.1016/bs.pbr.2018.03.004"", ""10.5406/jaesteduc.51.3.0026"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198767213.003.0004"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac20.2.0131"", ""10.5840/enviroethics199517319"", ""10.4159/9780674033962"", ""10.1111/jaac.12599"", ""10.1111/1467-9213.12050"", ""10.1007/978-94-009-9860-5_17""]","['Environmental Science', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Nature and Landscape Conservation', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7417), ('0907 林学', 0.7339)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Of the arguments offered in response to Wollheim’s essay, Jerrold Levinson’s intentional-historical theory of art has been one of the most enduring. Levinson was influenced by three key sections of Wollheim’s enquiry: Section 40, which considers the claim that works of art fall under a concept of art, or that we are disposed to regard certain things as works of art; and Sections 60 and 61, which deal with art as a historical phenomenon, and problems arising from its identification and interpretation. To date, these claims have been raised as points of contention in the philosophy of art. This paper takes a different perspective. Wollheim’s understanding of art’s historicity draws explicitly on the literature of theoretical art history. Via Wollheim, old art-historical problems will reappear as new philosophical questions.","[{""name"": ""Jim Berryman"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Glasgow , UK""]}]","[""10.1093/bjaesthetics/34.2.114"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511605970"", ""10.7591/9781501721182"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.3.0327"", ""10.1080/09528822.2011.608957"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/19.3.232"", ""10.2307/431990"", ""10.1111/1540_6245.jaac51.3.0411"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/42.4.367"", ""10.2307/j.ctv1453n0p"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/32.2.153"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/30.3.266"", ""10.1111/jaac.12218""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience']","['Philosophy', 'Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'Cognitive Neuroscience']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)]]"

Besides Wittgenstein’s systematic interests in parallels between music and language, the paper draws on the choice of terminology (such as the comparison of rules to rails) and on Wittgenstein’s own examples of rule-following. More speculatively, the phrasing as well as the solution to what Kripke called Wittgenstein’s sceptical paradox is used as a point of comparison that brings Wittgenstein’s aesthetic innuendos closer not only to mainstream philosophy of language, but due to the antithetical structure of Kripke’s argument also to the broader philosophical and aesthetical tradition, with a particular focus on the great philosophical systems of German idealism.","[{""name"": ""Vojtěch Kolman"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1468-0378.00115"", ""10.1515/9783110294699.171""]",['Arts and Humanities'],['Philosophy'],"[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Starting with the portraits' unusual treatment of the face as deflecting psychological legibility, it argues that the ‘self’ that they figure aligns with that described in contemporary scientific writings, notably by experimental psychologist and psychical researcher Frederic W. H. Myers and physicist Oliver Lodge. Writing from perspectives sympathetic to spiritualism, Myers and Lodge described the self as immortal, composite and mutable, invisible yet physical, exceeding the confines of the material body, and related somehow to ether. This essay draws on the entangled fin‐de‐siècle histories of science and spiritualism (and activates some of Gilles Deleuze's later theories) to argue that De Morgan summoned this self into a form at least contingently visible by exploiting the representational potential of the mutable, imponderable ether and its widely assumed properties: energic, (hyper‐)spatial, temporal, and spiritual.","[{""name"": ""Emma Merkling"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['Visual Arts and Performing Arts', 'History', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.7035), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.691)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Emotional hardcore and the case against beautifying pain,"Abstract Emotional hardcore and other music genres featuring screamed vocals are puzzling for the appreciator. The typical fan attaches appreciative value to musical screams of emotional pain, all the while acknowledging it would be inappropriate to hold similar attitudes towards their sonically similar everyday counterpart: actual human screaming. Call this the screamed vocals problem. To solve the problem, I argue we must attend to the anti-sublimating aims that get expressed in the emotional hardcore vocalist’s choice to scream the lyrics. Screamed vocals help us see the value in rejecting (a) restrictive social norms of emotional expressiveness and (b) restrictive artistic norms about how one ought to express or represent pain in art—namely that if one is going to do so, one must ensure the pain has been ‘beautified’. In developing this second point, I argue that emotional hardcore is well-suited (although not individually so) for putting pressure on longstanding views in the history of aesthetics about the formal relationship between art and human pain.","[{""name"": ""Sean T Murphy"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Languages and Philosophy, Southern Utah University ,""]}]","[""10.1057/9781137313713_9"", ""10.1057/9781137313713"", ""10.3917/dio.201.0127""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Music']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.707), ('0702 物理学', 0.6883)]]"

Examining Benny Nemer’s 2015 experimental audioguide Lilia z Muranowa (The Muranów Lily), commissioned by POLIN, the Museum of the History of Polish Jews, I propose a line of enquiry following a dybbuk-like haunting that the audioguide performs. In doing so, I investigate how desiring, affective speculation, legends and rumours might enable an encounter with history, if we allow ourselves to be haunted by them. I provide a landscape which the listener or the performer of Nemer’s experimental tale may engender with their desire, their body and their fantasy, in order to restore lives lost and forgotten in the archives, through the desiring archival subject: a queer Polish Jew.","[{""name"": ""Aleksandra Gajowy"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Social Sciences'],"['Political Science and International Relations', 'Demography', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7764), ('1204 公共管理学', 0.7587)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"

Meanwhile, this question is important. In the light of this, in this paper, I would like to address it, suggesting a potential answer. I begin by defining what I call ‘novel in the restricted sense’ – the concept that covers all novels except the so-called nonfiction novels, graphic novels, and novels in verse. Then, drawing upon Jerrold Levinson’s approach to defining ‘art’, I provide a definition of the concept that covers nonfiction novels, graphic novels, and novels in verse.

To get closer to an answer, I will first briefly present the argument over audience sensitivity as found in the nonphilosophical literature. Second, I then turn to the philosophical literature and begin from the idea that “funny” is a response-dependent property. I present a criticism of this response-dependence account of “funny” based in the claim that funniness is not determined by what normal audiences actually laugh at, but by what merits laughter. Third, I argue that excessive or deficient moral sensitivity distorts audience receptivity to humor. Fourth, I turn to candidates for ideally sensitive audiences. I conclude by returning to the particular cases of supposed oversensitivity or undersensitivity to jokes to see how we might judge them.","[{""name"": ""PHILLIP DEEN"", ""affiliation"": ["" Philosophy and Humanities  University of New Hampshire at Manchester  Manchester  Pennsylvania  New Hampshire""]}]","[""10.4135/9781446211779"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/36.3.223"", ""10.1093/bjaesthetics/38.4.419"", ""10.1086/233273"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayu015"", ""10.2307/2653403"", ""10.4324/9780203740279"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511663888.007"", ""10.1353/phl.1998.0014"", ""10.4324/9781315112633"", ""10.5840/philtopics199725123"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206179.003.0024"", ""10.2307/j.ctv2nrzhj9.17"", ""10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198714590.003.0003"", ""10.1080/13869790500492466"", ""10.1215/00318108-4173422"", ""10.1086/687336"", ""10.1023/A:1026004412151""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Neuroscience', 'Psychology']","['Social Psychology', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Philosophy']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0101 哲学', 0.772), ('0702 物理学', 0.7246)]]"

Traditionally, it has been seen as a sentimentalized and politically ambiguous representation of the American “middling sort.” What has gone completely unnoticed is that Woodville systematically adapted every single figure and the basic composition from an even better-known painting by another noted genre painter, the 1822 Chelsea Pensioners by David Wilkie. But whereas Wilke presented an idealized depiction of the British “common sort,” Woodville – perhaps because of his perspective from the Revolutions of 1848 in Germany – constructed a critical, declarative, and even edgy view of American democracy compromised by the inherent contradiction of slavery. Such a claim of a direct political message for War News goes against a preponderance of scholarship that positions the artist (and to a degree all antebellum genre painting) as non-committal.","[{""name"": ""Conrad Rudolph"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jason Weems"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Arts and Humanities'],"['History and Philosophy of Science', 'History', 'Museology']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0712 科学技术史', 0.7544), ('0101 哲学', 0.7508)], [('0602 中国史', 0.7697), ('0603 世界史', 0.7625)], [('0601 考古学', 0.7592), ('0602 中国史', 0.7377)]]"

10.1093/jaac/kpae021,JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM,1304 Fine Art; 1301 Art Theory; 0101 Philosophy,Virtual Fictional Actions,"Abstract Virtual fictionalism is the view that virtual reality is a kind of fiction. We imagine that what we see and hear in virtual reality is real, although it is not. The problem with this view is that there are real moral concerns with our use of virtual reality, from violent video games to cases of virtual groping on social platforms. If what we do in virtual reality is just make-believe, the fictionalist cannot explain the real moral harms of our virtual actions. Call this the moral objection to virtual fictionalism. I address the objection in this paper by arguing for a new fictional account of virtual actions. Virtual fictionalists can take virtual actions to be happening within the fiction and consider users to act as characters or actors within the fictional world depicted in the virtual environment. Instead, I argue that virtual actions create fictional representations from outside the fiction; users act in virtual reality as an author might in their work. The alternative I present better addresses the moral objection to virtual fictionalism—it does not conflate the user with a fictional character. Our virtual actions create fictional representations, and we can morally evaluate them as such.","[{""name"": ""Karim Nader"", ""affiliation"": [""Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Philosophy, Cambridge, MA ,""]}]","[""10.1007/s10676-011-9280-8"", ""10.1515/disp-2017-0009"", ""10.2143/EP.17.1.2046957"", ""10.1007/s10676-020-09574-8"", ""10.2478/disp-2019-0004"", ""10.5617/jpg.9230"", ""10.1007/s10676-010-9250-6"", ""10.1111/jaac.12355"", ""10.1111/jaac.12269"", ""10.1111/jaac.12358"", ""10.1002/9781444310177"", ""10.5617/jpg.6035"", ""10.1093/aesthj/ayz049"", ""10.1353/aim.0.0020"", ""10.1093/analys/anaa005""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Human-Computer Interaction', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7429), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7383)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
