10.5038/2375-0901.22.1.1,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering,"COVID-19 and Public Transportation: Current Assessment, Prospects, and Research Needs","The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great challenge for contemporary public transportation worldwide, resulting from an unprecedented decline in demand and revenue. In this paper, we synthesize the state-of-the-art, up to early June 2020, on key developments regarding public transportation and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the different responses adopted by governments and public transportation agencies around the world, and the research needs pertaining to critical issues that minimize contagion risk in public transportation in the so-called post-lockdown phase. While attempts at adherence to physical distancing (which challenges the very concept of mass public transportation) are looming in several countries, the latest research shows that for closed environments such as public transportation vehicles, the proper use of face masks has significantly reduced the probability of contagion. The economic and social effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in public transportation extend beyond service performance and health risks to financial viability, social equity, and sustainable mobility. There is a risk that if the public transportation sector is perceived as poorly transitioning to post-pandemic conditions, that viewing public transportation as unhealthy will gain ground and might be sustained. To this end, this paper identifies the research needs and outlines a research agenda for the public health implications of alternative strategies and scenarios, specifically measures to reduce crowding in public transportation. The paper provides an overview and an outlook for transit policy makers, planners, and researchers to map the state-of-affairs and research needs related to the impacts of the pandemic crisis on public transportation. Some research needs require urgent attention given what is ultimately at stake in several countries: restoring the ability of public transportation systems to fulfill their societal role.","[{""name"": ""Alejandro Tirachini"", ""affiliation"": [""Universidad de Chile""]}, {""name"": ""Oded Cats"", ""affiliation"": [""Delft University of Technology""]}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine']","['Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7106), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7025)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"

Automated pavement crack detection and segmentation using deep learning are more efficient and accurate than conventional methods, which could be further improved. While many existing studies have utilized deep learning in pavement crack segmentation, which segments cracks from non‐crack regions, few studies have taken the exact pavement crack detection into account, which identifies cracks in the images from other objects. A two‐step pavement crack detection and segmentation method based on convolutional neural network was proposed in this paper. An automated pavement crack detection algorithm was developed using the modified You Only Look Once 3rd version in the first step. The proposed crack segmentation method in the second step was based on the modified U‐Net, whose encoder was replaced with a pre‐trained ResNet‐34 and the up‐sample part was added with spatial and channel squeeze and excitation (SCSE) modules. Proposed method combines pavement crack detection and segmentation together, so that the detected cracks from the first step are segmented in the second step to improve the accuracy. A dataset of pavement crack images in different circumstances were also built for the study. The F1 score of proposed crack detection and segmentation methods are 90.58% and 95.75%, respectively, which are higher than other state‐of‐the‐art methods. Compared with existing one‐step pavement crack detection or segmentation methods, proposed two‐step method showed advantages of accuracy.","[{""name"": ""Jingwei Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Highway Chang'an University  Xi'an Shaanxi China"", ""Department of Civil Engineering Monash University  Melbourne Victoria Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Xu Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Highway Chang'an University  Xi'an Shaanxi China"", ""Department of Civil Engineering Monash University  Melbourne Victoria Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Stephen Lau"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering Monash University Malaysia  Bandar Sunway Selangor Darul Ehsan Malaysia""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering Monash University Malaysia  Bandar Sunway Selangor Darul Ehsan Malaysia""]}, {""name"": ""Sang Luo"", ""affiliation"": [""Intelligent Transportation System Research Center Southeast University  Nanjing Jiangsu China""]}, {""name"": ""Vincent Cheng‐Siong Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Information Technology Monash University  Melbourne Victoria Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Ling Ding"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Transportation Engineering Chang'an University  Xi'an Shaanxi China""]}]","[""10.1007/978-981-15-0802-8_1"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:5(484)"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00189"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2829347"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2017.11.013"", ""10.1038/nature21056"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2891167"", ""10.1080/10298436.2016.1155709"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1111/mice.12041"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2005)131:10(771)"", ""10.1007/s00371-018-1515-9"", ""10.1109/5.726791"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2856928"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298965"", ""10.1109/BigData.2018.8622327"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119397"", ""10.1145/3287921.3287949"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.07.008"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2009.00595.x"", ""10.1139/cjce-2013-0508"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.91"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.690"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2577031"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00928-1_48"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2552248"", ""10.1109/WACV.2017.58"", ""10.1080/14680629.2017.1350598"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.04.014"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2910595"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00674.x"", ""10.1111/mice.12409"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.09.019"", ""10.1109/CISP.2010.5646923"", ""10.1016/j.patrec.2011.11.004"", ""10.1109/TIP.2018.2878966""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

10.1111/mice.12561,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Generative adversarial network for road damage detection,"AbstractMachine learning can produce promising results when sufficient training data are available; however, infrastructure inspections typically do not provide sufficient training data for road damage. Given the differences in the environment, the type of road damage and the degree of its progress can vary from structure to structure. The use of generative models, such as a generative adversarial network (GAN) or a variational autoencoder, makes it possible to generate a pseudoimage that cannot be distinguished from a real one. Combining a progressive growing GAN along with Poisson blending artificially generates road damage images that can be used as new training data to improve the accuracy of road damage detection. The addition of a synthesized road damage image to the training data improves the F‐measure by 5% and 2% when the number of original images is small and relatively large, respectively. All of the results and the new Road Damage Dataset 2019 are publicly available (https://github.com/sekilab/RoadDamageDetector).","[{""name"": ""Hiroya Maeda"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Takehiro Kashiyama"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Yoshihide Sekimoto"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Toshikazu Seto"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Hiroshi Omata"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2000)13:1(1)"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00219"", ""10.1109/BigData.2018.8621899"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.21437/Interspeech.2019-3214"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848"", ""10.1111/mice.12497"", ""10.1007/s11263-014-0733-5"", ""10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2018.09.013"", ""10.1111/mice.12458"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.169"", ""10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363678"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-8950-4_27"", ""10.18632/oncotarget.14073"", ""10.1111/mice.12375"", ""10.1109/BigData.2018.8622318"", ""10.1109/5.726791"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.19"", ""10.1109/ICDM.2018.00146"", ""10.1111/mice.12313"", ""10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683590"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2"", ""10.1145/3004725.3004729"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.1111/mice.12359"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00716.x"", ""10.1111/mice.12098"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2017.05.029"", ""10.1145/882262.882269"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.91"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.690"", ""10.1016/j.cag.2006.10.004"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00220"", ""10.1109/BigData.2018.8622354"", ""10.1109/BigData.2018.8622599"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1111/mice.12042"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.1109/ICIP.2016.7533052"", ""10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683197""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

The training of PINNs is simulation free, and does not require any training data set to be obtained from numerical PDE solvers. Instead, it only requires the physical problem description, including the governing laws of physics, domain geometry, initial/boundary conditions, and the material properties. This training usually involves solving a nonconvex optimization problem using variants of the stochastic gradient descent method, with the gradient of the loss function approximated on a batch of collocation points, selected randomly in each iteration according to a uniform distribution. Despite the success of PINNs in accurately solving a wide variety of PDEs, the method still requires improvements in terms of computational efficiency. To this end, in this paper, we study the performance of an importance sampling approach for efficient training of PINNs. Using numerical examples together with theoretical evidences, we show that in each training iteration, sampling the collocation points according to a distribution proportional to the loss function will improve the convergence behavior of the PINNs training. Additionally, we show that providing a piecewise constant approximation to the loss function for faster importance sampling can further improve the training efficiency. This importance sampling approach is straightforward and easy to implement in the existing PINN codes, and also does not introduce any new hyperparameter to calibrate. The numerical examples include elasticity, diffusion, and plane stress problems, through which we numerically verify the accuracy and efficiency of the importance sampling approach compared to the predominant uniform sampling approach.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Amin Nabian"", ""affiliation"": [""NVIDIA  Santa Clara California USA""]}, {""name"": ""Rini Jasmine Gladstone"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign  Urbana Illinois USA""]}, {""name"": ""Hadi Meidani"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign  Urbana Illinois USA""]}]","[""10.1145/116873.116880"", ""10.1111/mice.12517"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2018.06.056"", ""10.1007/978-3-7908-2604-3_16"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35289-8_25"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1007/s004660000216"", ""10.1002/cnm.1640100303"", ""10.1145/1596519.1596520"", ""10.1016/j.tafmec.2019.102447"", ""10.32604/cmc.2019.06660"", ""10.1007/BF01386213"", ""10.1111/j.1749-6632.1960.tb42846.x"", ""10.1111/mice.12376"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-77977-1_36"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2019.109136"", ""10.1137/070709359"", ""10.1145/3079856.3080246"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2019.112623"", ""10.3233/ICA-170551"", ""10.1109/72.712178"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1111/mice.12313"", ""10.1111/mice.12417"", ""10.1111/mice.12510"", ""10.1201/b17476"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2019.109020"", ""10.1111/mice.12359"", ""10.1016/j.probengmech.2019.05.001"", ""10.1115/1.4044507"", ""10.1002/aic.690381003"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2019.06.042"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045"", ""10.1017/jfm.2018.872"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2018.08.029"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.11.033"", ""10.1007/s40304-018-0127-z"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2019.05.027"", ""10.3233/ICA-170540"", ""10.1111/mice.12477"", ""10.1111/mice.12450"", ""10.1016/j.jcp.2019.05.024""]","['Physics and Astronomy', 'Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Statistical and Nonlinear Physics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7443), ('0801 力学', 0.7421)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

10.1111/mice.12564,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Automatic detection method of cracks from concrete surface imagery using two-step light gradient boosting machine,"AbstractAutomated crack detection based on image processing is widely used when inspecting concrete structures. The existing methods for crack detection are not yet accurate enough due to the difficulty and complexity of the problem; thus, more accurate and practical methods should be developed. This paper proposes an automated crack detection method based on image processing using the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), one of the supervised machine learning methods. In supervised machine learning, appropriate features should be identified to obtain accurate results. In crack detection, the pixel values of the target pixels and geometric features of the cracks that occur when they are connected linearly should be considered. This paper proposes a methodology for generating features based on pixel values and geometric shapes in two stages. The accuracy of the proposed methodology is investigated using photos of concrete structures with adverse conditions, such as shadows and dirt. The proposed methodology achieves an accuracy of 99.7%, sensitivity of 75.71%, specificity of 99.9%, precision of 68.2%, and an F‐measure of 0.6952. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect cracks with higher performance than the pix2pix‐based approach. Furthermore, the training time is 7.7 times shorter than that of the XGBoost and 2.3 times shorter than that of the pix2pix. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect cracks with high accuracy.","[{""name"": ""Pang‐jo Chun"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering The University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Shota Izumi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Ehime University Matsuyama Ehime Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Tatsuro Yamane"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of International Studies, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences The University of Tokyo""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2003)17:4(255)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000095"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1023/A:1010933404324"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767851"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939785"", ""10.3390/met9121259"", ""10.1111/mice.12497"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02568-6_8"", ""10.1007/s00138-009-0244-5"", ""10.1109/ICPR.2006.98"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.322"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2006)20:3(210)"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.632"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00445.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-20887-5_6"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2015.01.008"", ""10.1080/15732479.2011.593891"", ""10.12989/sss.2014.14.4.719"", ""10.1111/mice.12501"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.01.036"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298965"", ""10.1016/0029-1021(73)90073-X"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/371/1/012015"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00716.x"", ""10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076"", ""10.1109/TASE.2014.2354314"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.3390/ICEM18-05387"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.02.007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2005.00376.x"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761627"", ""10.1002/ecj.10151"", ""10.1007/s00138-009-0189-8"", ""10.1002/tee.20244"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1111/mice.12477"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000775""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1007/s11116-019-09983-9,TRANSPORTATION,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering,How commuting affects subjective wellbeing,"Abstract Commuting between home and work is routinely performed by workers and any wellbeing impacts of commuting will consequently affect a large proportion of the population. This paper presents findings from analyses of the impact of commuting (time and mode) on multiple aspects of Subjective Well-Being (SWB), including: satisfaction with life overall and the SWB sub-domains of job satisfaction, satisfaction with leisure time availability and self-reported health. Measures of strain and mental health (GHQ-12) are also examined. Six waves of individual-level panel data from Understanding Society (2009/10 to 2014/15) are analysed, providing a sample of over 26,000 workers living in England. Associations between commuting and SWB are identified, paying particular attention to those arising from individual changes in commuting circumstances over the six waves. It is found that longer commute times are associated with lower job and leisure time satisfaction, increased strain and poorer mental health. The strongest association is found for leisure time satisfaction. Despite these negative associations with the SWB sub-domains, longer commute times were not associated with lower overall life satisfaction (except where individuals persisted with them over all six waves). Workers in England appear to be successful in balancing the negative aspects of commuting against the wider benefits, e.g. access to employment, earnings and housing. Differences amongst selected population sub-groups are also examined. The job satisfaction of younger adults and lower income groups are not found to be negatively associated with longer commute times; longer commute times are more strongly negatively associated with the job satisfaction of women compared to men. With respect to mode of transport, walking to work is associated with increased leisure time satisfaction and reduced strain. The absence of the commute, via working from home, is associated with increased job satisfaction and leisure time satisfaction. Overall, the study indicates that shorter commute times and walkable commutes can contribute to improved SWB—particularly through the release of leisure time. But life satisfaction overall will only be maintained if the benefits of undertaking the commute (earnings and satisfactory housing/employment) are not compromised.","[{""name"": ""Ben Clark"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kiron Chatterjee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adam Martin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Adrian Davis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3141/2357-12"", ""10.1080/01441647.2013.815665"", ""10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2014.09.004"", ""10.1016/j.joep.2007.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2010.07.005"", ""10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00235.x"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.09.024"", ""10.1126/science.1103572"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-9765-7"", ""10.1002/hec.3199"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.11.019"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2014-007079"", ""10.1007/s11116-018-9935-y"", ""10.2307/1913646"", ""10.1016/j.chieco.2016.03.002"", ""10.1787/9789264121164-en"", ""10.1787/9789264191655-en"", ""10.1007/s11205-012-0003-2"", ""10.1023/A:1010366321778"", ""10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.07.006"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2014.07.004"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9442.2008.00542.x"", ""10.5255/ukda-sn-6614-9"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2006.02.012""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Social Psychology', 'Transportation', 'Sociology and Political Science']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)]]"
10.1111/mice.12702,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Graph neural network and reinforcement learning for multi-agent cooperative control of connected autonomous vehicles,"AbstractA connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) network can be defined as a set of connected vehicles including CAVs that operate on a specific spatial scope that may be a road network, corridor, or segment. The spatial scope constitutes an environment where traffic information is shared and instructions are issued for controlling the CAVs movements. Within such a spatial scope, high‐level cooperation among CAVs fostered by joint planning and control of their movements can greatly enhance the safety and mobility performance of their operations. Unfortunately, the highly combinatory and volatile nature of CAV networks due to the dynamic number of agents (vehicles) and the fast‐growing joint action space associated with multi‐agent driving tasks pose difficultly in achieving cooperative control. The problem is NP‐hard and cannot be efficiently resolved using rule‐based control techniques. Also, there is a great deal of information in the literature regarding sensing technologies and control logic in CAV operations but relatively little information on the integration of information from collaborative sensing and connectivity sources. Therefore, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning‐based algorithm that combines graphic convolution neural network with deep Q‐network to form an innovative graphic convolution Q network that serves as the information fusion module and decision processor. In this study, the spatial scope we consider for the CAV network is a multi‐lane road corridor. We demonstrate the proposed control algorithm using the application context of freeway lane‐changing at the approaches to an exit ramp. For purposes of comparison, the proposed model is evaluated vis‐à‐vis traditional rule‐based and long short‐term memory‐based fusion models. The results suggest that the proposed model is capable of aggregating information received from sensing and connectivity sources and prescribing efficient operative lane‐change decisions for multiple CAVs, in a manner that enhances safety and mobility. That way, the operational intentions of individual CAVs can be fulfilled even in partially observed and highly dynamic mixed traffic streams. The paper presents experimental evidence to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance CAV operations. The proposed algorithm can be deployed at roadside units or cloud platforms or other centralized control facilities.","[{""name"": ""Sikai Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT) Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA"", ""Lyles School of Civil Engineering Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA"", ""Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jiqian Dong"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT) Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA"", ""Lyles School of Civil Engineering Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA""]}, {""name"": ""Paul (Young Joun) Ha"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT) Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA"", ""Lyles School of Civil Engineering Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA""]}, {""name"": ""Yujie Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT) Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA"", ""Lyles School of Civil Engineering Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA""]}, {""name"": ""Samuel Labi"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Connected and Automated Transportation (CCAT) Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA"", ""Lyles School of Civil Engineering Purdue University  West Lafayette Indiana USA""]}]","[""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1109/IISA.2014.6878812"", ""10.1021/ci00047a033"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1177/003803856900300205"", ""10.1287/moor.27.4.819.297"", ""10.1109/ITEC.2017.7993366"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5747"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917306"", ""10.1111/mice.12495"", ""10.1080/01441647.2010.543709"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2021.103192"", ""10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294550"", ""10.2352/ISSN.2470-1173.2017.19.AVM-023"", ""10.1109/wivec.2013.6698230"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-15024-6_7"", ""10.1145/3308558.3313488"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.02.001"", ""10.1111/1467-8667.t01-1-00311"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-71682-4_5"", ""10.3389/fbuil.2020.590036"", ""10.1007/s10458-019-09421-1"", ""10.1109/MCOM.2015.7355568"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.016"", ""10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968560"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2005)131:10(771)"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.102663"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.11.007"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2016.01.031"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2865575"", ""10.1111/mice.12622"", ""10.1111/mice.12538"", ""10.1111/mice.12451"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.04.026"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.102659"", ""10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207663"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1145/3219819.3220077"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001047"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00112"", ""10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197132"", ""10.1111/mice.12454"", ""10.1002/9780470168073"", ""10.21595/jve.2017.18924"", ""10.1111/mice.12559"", ""10.1111/mice.12533"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-32460-4"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10295"", ""10.1111/mice.12572"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.04.012"", ""10.23919/ACC.2019.8814882"", ""10.1080/15472450.2016.1248288"", ""10.1109/DSN-W.2019.00022"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1111/mice.12558"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.06.002"", ""10.1111/mice.12409"", ""10.1111/mice.12450"", ""10.1111/mice.12289""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"
10.1287/trsc.2020.1000,TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering; 1201 Management Science and Engineering,The Restaurant Meal Delivery Problem: Dynamic Pickup and Delivery with Deadlines and Random Ready Times,"We consider a stochastic dynamic pickup and delivery problem in which a fleet of drivers delivers food from a set of restaurants to ordering customers. The objective is to dynamically control a fleet of drivers in a way that avoids delays with respect to customers’ deadlines. There are two sources of uncertainty in the problem. First, the customers are unknown until they place an order. Second, the time at which the food is ready at the restaurant is unknown. To address these challenges, we present an anticipatory customer assignment (ACA) policy. To account for the stochasticity in the problem, ACA postpones the assignment decisions for selected customers, allowing more flexibility in assignments. In addition, ACA introduces a time buffer to reduce making decisions that are likely to result in delays. We also consider bundling, which is the practice of assigning multiple orders at a time to a driver. Based on real-world data, we show how ACA is able to improve service significantly for all stakeholders compared with current practice.","[{""name"": ""Marlin W.

In the YOLOv4‐ED, EfficientNet is used as the backbone to improve the identification accuracy of indistinguishable defect targets in complex tunnel background and light conditions. Furthermore, DSC block is introduced to reduce the storage space of the model and thereby enhance the detection efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the mean average precision,F1 score,Model Size, andFPSof YOLOv4‐ED are 81.84%, 81.99%, 49.3 MB, and 43.5 f/s, respectively, which is superior to the comparison models in both detection accuracy and efficiency. Based on robust and cost‐effective YOLOv4‐ED, a tunnel lining defect detection platform (TLDDP) with the capacity of automated inspection of various lining defects (i.e., water leakage, crack, rebar‐exposed) is built. The established TLDDP can realize the high‐precision and automatic detection of multiple tunnel lining defects under different lighting and complex background conditions of the practical in‐service tunnel.","[{""name"": ""Zhong Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Central South University Changsha P.R.

We introduce a novel way to exploit drones in same-day home delivery settings: drone resupply. We consider a home delivery system in which delivery trucks are regularly resupplied by drones. Resupply can take place whenever a delivery truck is stationary and a drone can land on the truck’s roof. We introduce the vehicle routing problem with drone resupply to capture and investigate this setting. We develop different algorithms and compare their performance. Finally, we quantify the potential benefits of drone resupply and generate valuable insights for advancing this concept.","[{""name"": ""Iman Dayarian"", ""affiliation"": [""Culverhouse College of Business, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama 35487;""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Savelsbergh"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332;""]}, {""name"": ""John-Paul Clarke"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Aerospace Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332""]}]","[""10.1109/EURONAV.2017.7954199"", ""10.1109/TSMC.2016.2582745"", ""10.1287/trsc.1110.0400"", ""10.2514/6.2005-1023"", ""10.1080/21693277.2016.1195304"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.02.003"", ""10.1002/net.21746"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.04.003"", ""10.1006/jcph.1999.6413"", ""10.1007/3-540-49481-2_30"", ""10.2514/6.2013-4864"", ""10.1177/0954410012440663""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"
10.1111/mice.12567,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Noncontact cable force estimation with unmanned aerial vehicle and computer vision,"AbstractCables and hangers are critical components of long‐span bridges, tension forces of them are needed to be accurately measured for ensuring the safety of bridges. Traditionally, cable tension forces are measured by attached accelerometers or elastomagnetic (EM) sensors, however, applying these sensors into engineering practice are time‐consuming, labor‐intensive, and highly dangerous. To address these problems, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)‐based noncontact cable force estimation method with computer vision technologies was proposed in this article. Basic concept of the proposed method is to use the UAV‐installed camera for capturing vibration images of cables from a certain distance and cable dynamic properties are extracted by analyzing captured images. It includes two aspects: (a) a line segments detector (LSD) was employed for detecting cable edges from captured video and a line matching algorithm was further proposed for extracting dynamic displacements; (b) the frequency difference of adjacent higher modal frequencies identified from relative displacements of the cable was employed for cable force calculation to avoid the difficulty of extracting fundamental frequency from UAV‐captured video. It should be noted that relative displacement herein refers to the difference between displacements of two points on the same cable. Advantages of the proposed method lie in that the proposed LSD and matching algorithm are more robust than traditional correlation‐based algorithm for calculating dynamic displacements of bridge cables and it does not need to adjust predefined parameters (i.e., subset size in correlation‐based algorithms). In addition, the combination of relative displacement and frequency difference‐based cable force estimation has the capability of enhancing the Fourier spectrum magnitude of bridge cables and reducing the effect of UAV motion on extraction of cable vibration frequencies. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method was verified by using an experimental inclined cable and field‐testing data of a long‐span suspension bridge. Results show that calculated cable forces with UAV technology have a good agreement with reference values measured by attached accelerometers and fixed camera, demonstrating correctness and robustness of the proposed method for cable force estimation.","[{""name"": ""Yongding Tian"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Southeast University  Nanjing China"", ""Department of Civil Engineering Monash University  Melbourne Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Cheng Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Southeast University  Nanjing China""]}, {""name"": ""Shang Jiang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Southeast University  Nanjing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jian Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Engineering Mechanics Southeast University  Nanjing China""]}, {""name"": ""Wenhui Duan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering Monash University  Melbourne Australia""]}]","[""10.1088/0964-1726/24/6/065034"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.05.054"", ""10.1002/stc.1889"", ""10.1177/1475921718757405"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2018.02.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000145"", ""10.1177/1475921718806895"", ""10.1080/15732479.2019.1650078"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-74378-3"", ""10.4236/ojapps.2013.31B001"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2016.12.020"", ""10.1016/j.ndteint.2009.11.007"", ""10.1061/9780784479742.165"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2008.300"", ""10.5201/ipol.2012.gjmr-lsd"", ""10.1109/3DV.2014.14"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002321"", ""10.1109/TCE.2005.1467968"", ""10.1177/1475921713500513"", ""10.1111/mice.12353"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2015.07.137"", ""10.1002/tal.1312"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1111/mice.12501"", ""10.1111/mice.12415"", ""10.1002/stc.2286"", ""10.1111/mice.12528"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2017.05.029"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00466.x"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2014.09.063"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2015.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.10.065"", ""10.3390/rs11192207"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.07.293"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2013.67"", ""10.1177/1475921717735326"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2014.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.optlaseng.2008.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.12.029"", ""10.1111/mice.12390"", ""10.1109/TCE.2009.4814407"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2018.10.018"", ""10.1117/12.900350"", ""10.12989/sss.2013.12.3_4.465"", ""10.3390/s17092075"", ""10.1111/mice.12338"", ""10.3390/s18124187"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00727.x""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

However, existing damage assessment methods cannot simultaneously meet these requirements. This study proposes a framework for real‐time regional seismic damage assessment that is based on a Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture. The proposed framework is not specially designed for individual structural types, but offers rapid estimates at regional scale. The framework is built around a workflow that establishes high‐performance mapping rules between ground motions and structural damage via region‐specific models. This workflow comprises three main parts—namely, region‐specific database generation, LSTM model training and verification, and model utilization for damage prediction. The influence of various LSTM architectures, hyperparameter selection, and dataset resampling procedures are systematically analyzed. As a testbed for the established framework, a case study is performed on the Tsinghua University campus buildings. The results demonstrate that the developed LSTM framework can perform damage assessment in real time at regional scale with high prediction accuracy and acceptable variance.","[{""name"": ""Yongjia Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Xinzheng Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Barbaros Cetiner"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering University of California  Los Angeles CA USA""]}, {""name"": ""Ertugrul Taciroglu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering University of California  Los Angeles CA USA""]}]","[""10.1111/mice.12517"", ""10.1002/eqe.474"", ""10.1080/13632460701673076"", ""10.1080/13632460409350521"", ""10.1111/mice.12495"", ""10.1080/13632469.2018.1453420"", ""10.1111/mice.12527"", ""10.1007/s10518-012-9402-7"", ""10.1162/089976600300015015"", ""10.1002/eqe.2268"", ""10.1002/eqe.386"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1997)123:11(1454)"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24797-2"", ""10.1007/s00024-010-0161-6"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2014.12.013"", ""10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735"", ""10.1142/p644"", ""10.1007/978-90-481-9455-1_6"", ""10.1193/1.3606398"", ""10.1142/S0129065704001954"", ""10.1002/eqe.3258"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.10.316"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2013.08.033"", ""10.1785/0120060036"", ""10.1109/CISP.2008.581"", ""10.3390/app9173497"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-3087-1"", ""10.1177/8755293019891724"", ""10.1007/s10518-017-0168-9"", ""10.1002/eqe.695"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109785"", ""10.1007/s10518-015-9772-8"", ""10.1515/revneuro-2018-0050"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2019.115109"", ""10.1002/eqe.1192"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000498"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2009.00595.x"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.2010.5596752"", ""10.1111/mice.12036"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.10.065"", ""10.1109/ICFHR.2014.55"", ""10.1007/s12046-018-0801-6"", ""10.1111/mice.12523"", ""10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003"", ""10.1002/eqe.141"", ""10.3133/fs20103036"", ""10.1111/mice.12316"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2005.07.001"", ""10.1007/s10518-018-00522-y"", ""10.1080/13632469.2016.1160009"", ""10.1007/s11069-016-2307-z"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2019.05.006"", ""10.1007/s11069-019-03626-z""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

The emission of gases and fuel efficiency of vehicles are two important issues. The best way to improve the fuel efficiency is to decrease the weight of vehicle parts. Research and development played an important role in lightweight materials for decreasing cost, increasing ability to be recycled, enabling their integration into vehicles, and maximizing their fuel economy efficacy. There arises a need for developing a novel generation of materials that will combine both weight reduction and safety issues. The application of carbon fibre reinforced plastic material offers the best lightweight potential to realize lightweight concepts. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic has outstanding specific stiffness, specific strength, and fatigue properties compared to commonly used metals. In automotive industry, the advantages of carbon fibre reinforced plastic are reduction in weight, part integration and reduction, crashworthiness, durability, toughness, and aesthetic appealing. Carbon fibre reinforced plastic is a composite material that has been used extensively in various applications such as aerospace industry, sports equipment, oil and gas industry, and automotive industry.

This paper first summarizes periodic defects of the wheels, including wheel polygonisation and wheel corrugation, occurring in railways worldwide. Thereafter, the effects of wheel polygonisation on the wheel–rail interaction, noise and vibration, and fatigue failure of the vehicle and track components are reviewed. Based on the different causes, the formation mechanisms of periodic wheel defects are classified into three categories: (1) initial defects of wheels, (2) natural vibration of the vehicle–track system, and (3) thermoelastic instability.

Using drones to support classical vehicles allows improving delivery schedules as long as efficient solution methods to plan last-mile deliveries with drones are available. We study exact solution approaches for some variants of the traveling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D) in which a truck and a drone are teamed up to serve a set of customers. This combination of truck and drone can exploit the benefits of both vehicle types: the truck has a large capacity but usually low travel speed in urban areas; the drone is faster and not restricted to street networks, but its range and carrying capacity are limited. We propose a compact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for several TSP-D variants that is based on timely synchronizing truck and drone flows; such an MILP is easy to implement but nevertheless leads to competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art MILPs. Furthermore, we introduce dynamic programming recursions to model several TSP-D variants. We show how these dynamic programming recursions can be exploited in an exact branch-and-price approach based on a set partitioning formulation using ng-route relaxation and a three-level hierarchical branching. The proposed branch-and-price can solve instances with up to 39 customers to optimality outperforming the state-of-the-art by more than doubling the manageable instance size. Finally, we analyze different scenarios and show that even a single drone can significantly reduce a route’s completion time when the drone is sufficiently fast.","[{""name"": ""Roberto Roberti"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Supply Chain Analytics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081HV Amsterdam, Netherlands;""]}, {""name"": ""Mario Ruthmair"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Supply Chain Analytics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081HV Amsterdam, Netherlands;"", ""Department of Statistics and Operations Research, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria""]}]","[""10.1287/trsc.2017.0791"", ""10.1287/opre.1110.0975"", ""10.1002/net.21864"", ""10.1002/net.21847"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2017.2824"", ""10.1109/TSMC.2016.2582745"", ""10.1287/trsc.1110.0400"", ""10.1287/trsc.2017.0771"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.11.015"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2019.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.005"", ""10.1002/net.21818"", ""10.1287/opre.2019.1874"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2019.104802"", ""10.1287/ijoc.2018.0826"", ""10.1002/net.21746"", ""10.1287/trsc.2016.0675"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.005"", ""10.1007/s11590-016-1035-3""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

Both of them rely on mass driving data to cover all possible driving scenarios. This study presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning method for decision making of self‐driving cars, which does not depend on a large amount of labelled driving data. This method comprehensively considers both high‐level manoeuvre selection and low‐level motion control in both lateral and longitudinal directions. The authors firstly decompose the driving tasks into three manoeuvres, including driving in lane, right lane change and left lane change, and learn the sub‐policy for each manoeuvre. Then, a master policy is learned to choose the manoeuvre policy to be executed in the current state. All policies, including master policy and manoeuvre policies, are represented by fully‐connected neural networks and trained by using asynchronous parallel reinforcement learners, which builds a mapping from the sensory outputs to driving decisions. Different state spaces and reward functions are designed for each manoeuvre. They apply this method to a highway driving scenario, which demonstrates that it can realise smooth and safe decision making for self‐driving cars.","[{""name"": ""Jingliang Duan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Shengbo Eben Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yang Guan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Qi Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Bo Cheng"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1109/TIV.2016.2578706"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.09.011"", ""10.1002/rob.20258"", ""10.1109/MITS.2011.940472"", ""10.1109/TITS.2010.2046037"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2013.02.001"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2017.08.022"", ""10.1155/2019/1812543"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.312"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1038/nature16961"", ""10.1038/nature24270"", ""10.1007/s10994-016-5580-x"", ""10.1109/IVS.2014.6856582"", ""10.1109/ACC.2012.6315022"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2009.07.008"", ""10.1016/S0004-3702(99)00052-1"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2506602"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2007.02.002"", ""10.1109/IVS.2017.7995694"", ""10.1109/ACC.2012.6315130"", ""10.23919/ECC.2013.6669331"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.11.011"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2283528"", ""10.1155/2014/923632"", ""10.1080/19479832.2016.1188860"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.009""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

First, a model for estimating the trip energy consumption is proposed based on field‐collected data, and the probability distribution function of trip energy consumption considering the stochastic volatility is determined. Second, we propose the charging strategy to recharge buses during their idle times. The impacts of stochastic volatilities on the departure time, the idle time, the battery state of charge, and the energy consumption of each trip are analyzed. Third, an optimization model is built with the objectives of minimizing the expectation of delays in trip departure times, the summation of energy consumption expectations, and bus procurement costs. Finally, a real bus route is taken as an example to validate the proposed method. Results show that reasonable idle times can be generated by optimizing the scheduling plan, and it is helpful to stop the accumulation of stochastic volatilities. Collaboratively optimizing vehicle scheduling and charging plans can reduce the EB fleet and delay times while meeting the route operation needs.","[{""name"": ""Yiming Bie"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation Jilin University  Changchun China""]}, {""name"": ""Jinhua Ji"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation Jilin University  Changchun China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiangyu Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering and Architecture East China Jiaotong University  Nanchang China"", ""School of Design and Built Environment Curtin University  Perth Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaobo Qu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering Chalmers University of Technology  Gothenburg Sweden""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2004)130:1(94)"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115873"", ""10.1287/trsc.2017.0757"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.009"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.118241"", ""10.1111/mice.12446"", ""10.1007/s12469-010-0018-5"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9488(2002)128:4(225)"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.07.007"", ""10.1109/4235.996017"", ""10.1109/TITS.2020.2971686"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.607"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2020.12.009"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2020.04.006"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2006)132:4(331)"", ""10.1145/3319619.3321991"", ""10.1287/opre.1050.0240"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.181"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2019.101530"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2014.08.010"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.02.073"", ""10.1111/mice.12082"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:3(230)"", ""10.1111/mice.12439"", ""10.1007/s12469-011-0049-6"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2012.2235083"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.066"", ""10.1287/trsc.1090.0301"", ""10.1287/trsc.2013.0468"", ""10.1080/15568318.2013.872737"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.009"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00677.x"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2020.102350"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.08.007"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.08.091"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.10.012"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2020.03.099"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114030"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2019.05.006"", ""10.3390/en13082117"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.11.051"", ""10.1007/s00291-015-0398-7"", ""10.1111/itor.12321"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.032"", ""10.1061/JTEPBS.0000306"", ""10.1016/j.ijtst.2017.09.002"", ""10.1007/s12469-017-0164-0"", ""10.1016/j.amc.2007.02.141"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2020.109978"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.03.019"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2016.06.013"", ""10.1111/mice.12193"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116356"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00469.x"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2019.101862"", ""10.1111/mice.12315"", ""10.3390/pr7120888"", ""10.1111/mice.12379"", ""10.1109/TITS.2020.3014097"", ""10.1007/s11356-020-09094-4"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2020.102279"", ""10.1111/mice.12506"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964391""]","['Engineering', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Segmentation is valuable for two significant clinical applications, namely lesion detection and classification, providing means to improve accuracy and robustness. The manual segmentation of polyps in colonoscopy images is time-consuming. As a result, the use of deep learning (DL) for automation of polyp segmentation has become important. However, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting inability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes. Recent transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation both achieve higher performance and generalise better than alternatives, however typically predict a segmentation map of $$\frac{h}{4}\times \frac{w}{4}$$ spatial dimensions for a $$h\times w$$ input image. To this end, we propose a new architecture for full-size segmentation which leverages the strengths of a transformer in extracting the most important features for segmentation in a primary branch, while compensating for its limitations in full-size prediction with a secondary fully convolutional branch. The resulting features from both branches are then fused for final prediction of a $$h\times w$$ segmentation map. We demonstrate our method’s state-of-the-art performance with respect to the mDice, mIoU, mPrecision, and mRecall metrics, on both the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB dataset benchmarks. Additionally, we train the model on each of these datasets and evaluate on the other to demonstrate its superior generalisation performance.Code available: https://github.com/CVML-UCLan/FCBFormer.","[{""name"": ""Edward Sanderson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bogdan J.

A method based on a machine learning algorithm called deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed in this presented research in order to learn better maintenance strategies that maximize the long‐term cost‐effectiveness in maintenance decision‐making through trial and error. In this method, each single‐lane pavement segment can have different treatments, and the long‐term maintenance cost‐effectiveness of the entire section is treated as the optimization goal. In the DRL algorithm, states are embodied by 42 parameters involving the pavement structures and materials, traffic loads, maintenance records, pavement conditions, and so forth. Specific treatments as well as do‐nothing are the actions. The reward is defined as the increased or decreased cost‐effectiveness after taking corresponding actions. Two expressways, the Ningchang and Zhenli expressways, were selected for a case study. The results show that the DRL model is capable of learning a better strategy to improve the long‐term maintenance cost‐effectiveness. By implementing the optimized maintenance strategies produced by the developed model, the pavement conditions can be controlled in an acceptable range.","[{""name"": ""Linyi Yao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Highway and Railway Engineering, College of Transportation Southeast University  Nanjing Jiangsu China""]}, {""name"": ""Qiao Dong"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Highway and Railway Engineering, College of Transportation Southeast University  Nanjing Jiangsu China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiwang Jiang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Highway and Railway Engineering, College of Transportation Southeast University  Nanjing Jiangsu China""]}, {""name"": ""Fujian Ni"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Highway and Railway Engineering, College of Transportation Southeast University  Nanjing Jiangsu China""]}]","[""10.1111/0885-9507.00219"", ""10.1139/cjce-2017-0408"", ""10.1186/s12544-019-0353-9"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2015.2415732"", ""10.1126/science.153.3731.34"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2010)16:1(11)"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.226"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000378"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000556"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000599"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(79)90025-0"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2000)126:5(367)"", ""10.3141/2225-12"", ""10.3141/2366-07"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.1080/0305215X.2011.588226"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2018.05.050"", ""10.1613/jair.301"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2007)133:5(298)"", ""10.1609/aaai.v31i1.10827"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2008.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2019.05.093"", ""10.1109/ETFA.2015.7301554"", ""10.1016/S0965-8564(01)00020-9"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2687620"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2890726"", ""10.1145/3219819.3219993"", ""10.1016/j.future.2019.02.068"", ""10.1287/trsc.28.1.55"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-25808-9_4"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000149"", ""10.1111/mice.12178"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1109/TSG.2018.2834219"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2009.00606.x"", ""10.1111/mice.12422"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2003.10.007"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001047"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1038/nature16961"", ""10.1038/nature24270"", ""10.21437/Interspeech.2015-456"", ""10.1186/s13673-019-0187-4"", ""10.1680/iasma.13.00012"", ""10.1016/0965-8564(94)90035-3"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2016.01.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000563"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2011.01.001"", ""10.1007/s10015-015-0260-7"", ""10.3390/su11030877"", ""10.1177/0361198118822501"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11405-2_7"", ""10.1111/mice.12409"", ""10.1007/s10846-013-9901-z"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000042"", ""10.21037/atm.2019.06.75"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2014.01.001""]",['Engineering'],"['Control and Systems Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Specifically, effective strategies to enhance regional resilience require: (a) developing mathematical models for infrastructure recovery; (b) quantifying resilience associated with the developed recovery process; and (c) developing a computationally manageable approach for resilience optimization. This paper proposes a rigorous mathematical formulation to model recovery, quantify resilience, and optimize the resilience of large‐scale infrastructure. Specifically, a multiscale model of the recovery process is proposed that significantly reduces the computational cost, while favoring practical and easily manageable recovery schedules. To quantify regional resilience, resilience metrics are proposed that capture the temporal and spatial variations of the recovery process. The paper then formulates a multiobjective optimization problem that aims to improve regional resilience in terms of the proposed metrics, while minimizing the recovery cost. Finally, the paper illustrates the proposed formulation by considering interdependent infrastructure in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States.","[{""name"": ""Neetesh Sharma"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, MAE Center: Creating a Multi‐hazard Approach to Engineering University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign  Urbana IL USA""]}, {""name"": ""Armin Tabandeh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, MAE Center: Creating a Multi‐hazard Approach to Engineering University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign  Urbana IL USA""]}, {""name"": ""Paolo Gardoni"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, MAE Center: Creating a Multi‐hazard Approach to Engineering University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign  Urbana IL USA""]}]","[""10.4171/EMSS/2"", ""10.5334/jors.188"", ""10.1193/1.1623497"", ""10.1007/s10479-011-0959-3"", ""10.1193/022912EQS058M"", ""10.1080/23789689.2018.1428162"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2001)127:1(18)"", ""10.1111/mice.12356"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2002)128:10(1024)"", ""10.1080/13632460309350474"", ""10.1111/mice.12171"", ""10.1785/gssrl.82.6.767"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(1998)4:3(118)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)LA.1943-4170.0000212"", ""10.1016/j.amc.2007.10.013"", ""10.2172/1376816"", ""10.1080/23789689.2017.1418547"", ""10.1109/TSMCC.2007.905859"", ""10.1111/mice.12200"", ""10.1080/23789689.2017.1345257"", ""10.1111/risa.12843"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1988)114:3(276)"", ""10.1111/mice.12435""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

In this study, we present a framework to describe the dynamics of congestion propagation and dissipation of traffic in cities using a simple contagion process, inspired by those used to model infectious disease spread in a population. We introduce two macroscopic characteristics for network traffic dynamics, namely congestion propagation rate β and congestion dissipation rate μ. We describe the dynamics of congestion spread using these new parameters embedded within a system of ordinary differential equations, similar to the well-known susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. The proposed contagion-based dynamics are verified through an empirical multi-city analysis, and can be used to monitor, predict and control the fraction of congested links in the network over time.","[{""name"": ""Meead Saberi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Homayoun Hamedmoghadam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mudabber Ashfaq"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Seyed Amir Hosseini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ziyuan Gu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sajjad Shafiei"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Divya J.

With a lockdown that lasted almost three months and an impulse to new normality, transport demand has suffered a considerable impact in the Spanish case. It is mandatory to explore the effect of the pandemic on changes in travel behaviour in post-COVID-19 times. Methodology A nationwide survey was carried out during the lockdown in Spring 2020 to overview the recent changes. The survey collected both stated preferences (socio-demographic characteristics and mobility-related attributes), and revealed preferences (individuals’ habits, especially in the frequency of the trips according to the trip purpose, and opinions regarding the willingness and acceptability of these changes, and which actors would have to drive them, and how) of individuals. This paper aims to study and understand the willingness to adopt a set of measures to improve the safety conditions of public transport and shared mobility services against possible contagion from COVID-19 and the willingness to pay for them. Results The results obtained show that some measures, such as the increase of supply and vehicle disinfection, result in a greater willingness to use public transport in post-COVID-19 times. Similarly, the provision of covers for handlebars and steering wheels also significantly increases individuals’ willingness to use sharing services. However, respondents expect that these measures and improvements would be implemented but maintaining the same pre-COVID-19 prices. The results of this research might help operators deploy strategies to adopt their services and retain users.","[{""name"": ""Samir Awad-Núñez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Raky Julio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Juan Gomez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Borja Moya-Gómez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julián Sastre González"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.amepre.2010.07.011"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2019.102424"", ""10.1016/j.tbs.2018.06.002"", ""10.1080/13545701.2015.1135248"", ""10.1073/pnas.0906910106"", ""10.1002/jmv.25902"", ""10.1007/s11524-011-9603-4"", ""10.1177/1536867x1101100204"", ""10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121"", ""10.1177/1524839911399432"", ""10.3201/eid2605.190995"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104806"", ""10.2307/1912352"", ""10.1080/01441647.2020.1770487"", ""10.1136/bmj.39393.510347.BE"", ""10.1007/s11606-020-05762-w"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.037"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2011.06.003"", ""10.1056/NEJMp2002125"", ""10.1101/2020.03.20.20040055"", ""10.1126/science.1135823"", ""10.1080/01441640600602302"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.07.004"", ""10.1007/s11747-019-00666-6"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2019.04.004"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0181544""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

First, a ring‐type climbing robot system composed of multiple vision cameras, climbing robot, and control computer is developed. By spatially moving the climbing robot system along a target bridge pier with close‐up scanning condition, high‐quality raw vision images are continuously obtained. The raw vision images are then processed through feature control‐based image stitching, deep learning‐based semantic segmentation, and Euclidean distance transform–based crack quantification algorithms. Finally, a digital crack map on the region of interest (ROI) of the target bridge pier can be automatically established. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using in situ test data obtained from Jang–Duck bridge in South Korea. The test results reveal that the proposed technique successfully evaluates cracks on the entire ROI of the bridge pier with precision of 90.92% and recall of 97.47%.","[{""name"": ""Keunyoung Jang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Architectural Engineering Sejong University  Seoul 05006 South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Yun‐Kyu An"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Architectural Engineering Sejong University  Seoul 05006 South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Byunghyun Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering University of Seoul  Seoul 02504 South Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Soojin Cho"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering University of Seoul  Seoul 02504 South Korea""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000802"", ""10.1177/1475921713500515"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000846"", ""10.1016/j.optlaseng.2015.04.013"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.03.020"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2644615"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1016/j.cviu.2007.09.014"", ""10.1109/34.993558"", ""10.1007/s11263-006-0002-3"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.11.013"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.02.160"", ""10.1016/j.patrec.2019.06.018"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1145/1322432.1322434"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2005.00379.x"", ""10.1002/rob.21791"", ""10.1109/CEC.2018.8477790"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.07.008"", ""10.1007/s00138-011-0394-0"", ""10.1177/1475921718821719"", ""10.1111/mice.12375"", ""10.3390/app8122582"", ""10.3390/s17092052"", ""10.1002/rob.21725"", ""10.1109/34.161346"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44854-0"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000879"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.1016/j.optlastec.2018.07.012"", ""10.1109/TIP.2019.2934344"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.01.036"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2006.12.010"", ""10.1007/s10921-019-0586-5"", ""10.1111/mice.12421"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2009.04.003"", ""10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-03039-4_13"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2812141"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.02.021"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1111/mice.12141"", ""10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.09.012"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.1111/mice.12477"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2020.2965097"", ""10.1109/34.888718"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-336156-1.50061-6""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1111/mice.12710,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Hybrid deep learning architecture for rail surface segmentation and surface defect detection,"AbstractRail surface defects (RSDs) are a major problem that reduces operation safety. Unfortunately, the existing RSD detection systems have very limited accuracy. Current image processing methods are not tailored for the railway track and many fully convolutional networks (FCN)‐based methods suffer from the blurry rail edges (RE). This paper proposes a new rail boundary guidance network (RBGNet) for salient RS detection. First, a novel architecture is proposed to fully utilize the complementarity between the RS and the RE to accurately identify the RS with well‐defined boundaries. The newly developed RBGNet injects high‐level RS object information into shallow RS edge features by a progressive fused way for obtaining fine edge features. Then, the system integrates the refined edge features with RS features at different high‐level layers to predict the RS precisely. Second, an innovative hybrid loss consisting of binary cross entropy (BCE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and intersection‐over‐union (IoU) is proposed and equipped into the RBGNet to supervise the network and learn the transformation between the input and ground truth. The input and ground truth then further refine the RS location and edges. Conveniently, an image‐based model for RSD detection and quantification is also developed and integrated for an automatic inspection purpose. Finally, experiments conducted on the complex unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) rail dataset indicate the system can achieve a high detection rate with good adaptation capability in complicated environments.","[{""name"": ""Yunpeng Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety Beijing Jiaotong University  Beijing China"", ""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of South Carolina  Columbia South Carolina USA""]}, {""name"": ""Yong Qin"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety Beijing Jiaotong University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yu Qian"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of South Carolina  Columbia South Carolina USA""]}, {""name"": ""Feng Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of South Carolina  Columbia South Carolina USA""]}, {""name"": ""Zhipeng Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety Beijing Jiaotong University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Limin Jia"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety Beijing Jiaotong University  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1111/0885-9507.00219"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.1989.tb00026.x"", ""10.1007/s11063-020-10197-9"", ""10.24200/sci.2016.2301"", ""10.1111/mice.12530"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001894"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2020.02.099"", ""10.1007/s10479-005-5724-z"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/95"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-58539-6_42"", ""10.1111/mice.12625"", ""10.1108/SR-03-2015-0039"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2815688"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.563"", ""10.1016/0734-189X(85)90125-2"", ""10.1111/mice.12353"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2818882"", ""10.1109/TIP.2016.2602079"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.58"", ""10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2198814"", ""10.1109/TIM.2012.2184959"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2017.11.024"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1109/CVPRW.2017.151"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.324"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00404"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.80"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-33786-4_24"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7299155"", ""10.1109/TSMCC.2007.893278"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.35"", ""10.1111/mice.12528"", ""10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107404"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00766"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28"", ""10.1111/mice.12580"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.02.019"", ""10.1016/j.ultras.2019.106031"", ""10.1111/mice.12488"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00330"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883704"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2984264"", ""10.1109/PHM-Chongqing.2018.00100"", ""10.3390/app8071028"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.06.076"", ""10.1109/CAC.2018.8623082"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10590-1_53"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2016.10.025"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00187"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.31"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2019.03.023"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00262"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00887"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00894"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298731"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-00889-5_1""]","['Engineering', 'Environmental Science']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The ITSCP seeks an efficient schedule for traffic signal settings at intersections with the goal of maximizing traffic flow while considering various factors such as real-time strategies, signal timing constraints, rapid developments in traffic systems, and practical implementation. Since the factors constituting the ITSCP exhibit stochastically complicated interactions, it is essential to identify these factors to propose solution methods that can address this complexity and still be practically implemented. Objective The objective of this review is to provide a survey of problems, methods, and practices in the evaluation of the ITSCP. In this paper, a unified terminology for the ITSCP and a citation network of the current body of relevant research are accordingly presented, and various assumptions, constraints, and solution approaches are summarized. A review across the entire body of knowledge throughout the history of the ITSCP is therefore provided. This review also highlights open issues and challenges that remain to be addressed by future research.","[{""name"": ""Myungeun Eom"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Byung-In Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0041-1647(72)90017-2"", ""10.1016/S0968-090X(00)00047-4"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(88)90040-9"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.08.008"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2012.04.008"", ""10.1016/S0968-090X(97)00012-0"", ""10.17226/22097"", ""10.1109/TITS.2004.838217"", ""10.1287/opre.12.6.870"", ""10.1109/TITS.2006.874716"", ""10.1287/opre.12.6.815"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2006.05.001"", ""10.1287/trsc.5.2.141"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2006.08.002"", ""10.1287/trsc.10.1.1"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2008.01.002"", ""10.1016/0041-1647(77)90006-5"", ""10.3182/20080706-5-KR-1001.01213"", ""10.1016/0041-1647(77)90007-7"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2008.03.005"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(79)90021-3"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2009.04.005"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(84)90028-6"", ""10.3141/2111-01"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2009.0070"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(91)90013-9"", ""10.1109/TAC.2010.2060245"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2009.0096"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(95)00028-3"", ""10.1287/trsc.31.1.5"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.04.005"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.841"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2011.05.007"", ""10.1016/S0947-3580(98)70119-0"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.02.007"", ""10.1002/atr.5670330208"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2259623"", ""10.1109/5326.760570"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.01.003"", ""10.1016/S0968-090X(99)00026-1"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.08.014"", ""10.1016/S0165-0114(99)00034-2"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(99)00034-X"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2015.09.070"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(00)00129-6"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.11.009"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(01)00004-2"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.12.005"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(01)00364-2"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.04.001"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(01)00006-6"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.11.009"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:3(278)"", ""10.1002/atr.1456"", ""10.1109/TSMCA.2003.817394"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.11.016"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(01)00045-5"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.207"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2003.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2017.07.022"", ""10.1109/TITS.2004.838180"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.09.020"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2004.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.01.007"", ""10.1007/s10458-004-6975-9"", ""10.1155/2019/2747569"", ""10.3141/1856-19"", ""10.1109/T-VT.1980.23833"", ""10.1177/0361198113235600102"", ""10.1016/S1474-6670(17)52678-6"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2178836"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2003.819610"", ""10.1287/opre.4.1.42"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(94)90002-7"", ""10.3141/1727-05"", ""10.1109/25.69966"", ""10.1016/S1474-6670(17)62577-1"", ""10.1109/TITS.2004.833763"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2006.02.005"", ""10.1007/s10458-008-9062-9"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.026"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2402438"", ""10.1109/LGRS.2015.2439517"", ""10.1007/s13177-014-0092-1"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.09.011"", ""10.4236/jtts.2019.94031"", ""10.3141/2259-21"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2012.03.004"", ""10.1109/TVT.2013.2241460"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.05.008"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.03.008""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Transportation', 'Control and Systems Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"
10.1111/mice.12580,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Uncertainty-assisted deep vision structural health monitoring,"AbstractComputer vision leveraging deep learning has achieved significant success in the last decade. Despite the promising performance of the existing deep vision inspection models, the extent of models’ reliability remains unknown. Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a crucial task for the safety and sustainability of structures, and thus, prediction mistakes can have fatal outcomes. In this paper, we use Bayesian inference for deep vision SHM models where uncertainty can be quantified using the Monte Carlo dropout sampling. Three independent case studies for cracks, local damage identification, and bridge component detection are investigated using Bayesian inference. Aside from better prediction results, the two uncertainty metrics, variations in softmax probability and entropy, are shown to have good correlations with misclassifications. However, modifying the decision or triggering human intervention can be challenging based on raw uncertainty outputs. Therefore, the concept of surrogate models is proposed to develop the models for uncertainty‐assisted segmentation and prediction quality tagging. The former refines the segmentation mask and the latter is used to trigger human interventions. The proposed framework can be applied to future deep vision SHM frameworks to incorporate model uncertainty in the inspection processes.","[{""name"": ""Seyed Omid Sajedi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, University at Buffalo the State University of New York  Buffalo NY 14260 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Xiao Liang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, University at Buffalo the State University of New York  Buffalo NY 14260 USA""]}]","[""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2829347"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.05.054"", ""10.1111/mice.12517"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.3850/978-981-14-8593-0_5748-cd"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00215"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848"", ""10.1111/mice.12497"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.04.050"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.304"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.243"", ""10.1109/CVPRW.2017.156"", ""10.2749/newyork.2019.0397"", ""10.1111/mice.12351"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1109/LCSYS.2018.2849576"", ""10.1111/mice.12501"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298965"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2017/661"", ""10.1111/mice.12505"", ""10.1111/mice.12476"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001047"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28"", ""10.1201/9780367815646-19"", ""10.2749/newyork.2019.1005"", ""10.1111/mice.12523"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2552248"", ""10.1016/j.eng.2018.11.030"", ""10.1111/mice.12406"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.1111/mice.12500"", ""10.1115/DSCC2019-9186""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12252,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Prospects and challenges of Metaverse application in data-driven intelligent transportation systems,"AbstractThe Metaverse is a concept used to refer to a virtual world that exists in parallel to the physical world. It has grown from a conceptual level to having real applications in virtual reality games. The applicability of the Metaverse in numerous sectors like marketing, education, social, and even advertising exists. However, there exists little or no work on Metaverse applicability to the transportation industry. Data‐driven intelligent transportation systems (DDITS) aim to provide more intelligent systems based on exploiting data. This paper reviews the concepts and features of the Metaverse. Also, the review goes over three dominant DDITS challenges: vehicle fault detection and repair, testing new technologies, and anti‐theft systems. In addition, it highlights prospective Metaverse solutions that apply to the DDITS. Buttressing the utility of Metaverse in DDITS, this paper presents two major case studies: the invisible to visible (I2V) and the Metaverse on Wheels (MoW) technologies. Finally, the influence, limitations, and open issues of Metaverse applications to DDITS are discussed.","[{""name"": ""Judith Nkechinyere Njoku"", ""affiliation"": [""ICT Convergence Research Center Kumoh National Institute of Technology Gumi Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma"", ""affiliation"": [""ICT Convergence Research Center Kumoh National Institute of Technology Gumi Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Gabriel Chukwunonso Amaizu"", ""affiliation"": [""ICT Convergence Research Center Kumoh National Institute of Technology Gumi Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Dong‐Seong Kim"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of IT Convergence Engineering Kumoh National Institute of Technology Gumi Korea""]}]","[""10.3390/encyclopedia2010031"", ""10.1186/s41239-016-0003-4"", ""10.1145/1952712.1952717"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2009.02.014"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2011.01.009"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.128"", ""10.3390/app112311360"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2020.09.249"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3140175"", ""10.1080/15252019.2021.2001273"", ""10.1109/MTS.2018.2826060"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2158001"", ""10.1109/LNET.2021.3057637"", ""10.26599/TST.2020.9010025"", ""10.1016/j.comcom.2021.05.026"", ""10.1109/ICCMC48092.2020.ICCMC-000194"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.185"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2017.07.001"", ""10.1155/2021/3833562"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2934991"", ""10.1515/icom-2021-0029"", ""10.36227/techrxiv.19255058"", ""10.1007/s11036-021-01814-5"", ""10.1109/PerComWorkshops51409.2021.9431024"", ""10.1109/MEMS46641.2020.9056153"", ""10.1353/art.2018.0041"", ""10.32604/cmc.2020.010949"", ""10.32604/iasc.2021.013704"", ""10.1016/j.icte.2021.05.003"", ""10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct54149.2021.00084"", ""10.1089/cyber.2018.0028"", ""10.1287/mnsc.2021.4126"", ""10.3991/ijet.v15i20.16535"", ""10.1080/10494820.2022.2022899"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.04.165"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.02.013"", ""10.1145/3306307.3339844"", ""10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621118"", ""10.1016/j.compedu.2009.10.007"", ""10.1109/ISCTIS51085.2021.00040"", ""10.3390/app10051739"", ""10.1177/2399808318796416"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2017.2735078"", ""10.1007/s10055-020-00489-9"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2019.2959575"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056752"", ""10.1109/ICSE-Companion52605.2021.00048"", ""10.1109/MEES52427.2021.9598614"", ""10.1109/ICECTT.2019.00027"", ""10.1109/ICMTMA.2019.00047"", ""10.1109/AICCSA50499.2020.9316458"", ""10.4271/9780768099713"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2018.2844287"", ""10.1109/PHM-Paris.2019.00018"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2521866"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2016.01.015"", ""10.1109/VRW52623.2021.00246"", ""10.1109/ICTON.2017.8024980"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00771"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2021.03.005"", ""10.23919/DATE51398.2021.9474166"", ""10.1109/ICCE-Berlin47944.2019.8966215"", ""10.1007/s41062‐022‐00763‐6"", ""10.1109/TIV.2018.2886678"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074062"", ""10.1109/TIV.2019.2955903"", ""10.1109/TR.2021.3112538"", ""10.1109/RCoSE.2017.4"", ""10.1109/AUTEST.2018.8532535"", ""10.3390/s19020334"", ""10.1109/IV47402.2020.9304658"", ""10.1109/ICOIN50884.2021.9333987"", ""10.1109/ICOIN50884.2021.9333930"", ""10.1109/ICOIN53446.2022.9687172"", ""10.1109/SmartCloud.2019.00043"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5407"", ""10.1109/TITS.2020.3026309"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2700628"", ""10.2991/icsmim-15.2016.45"", ""10.1109/TMC.2018.2843801"", ""10.1117/12.2203277"", ""10.1109/ICVES.2013.6619601"", ""10.1109/IMIS.2014.98"", ""10.1109/ICAEE.2017.8255459"", ""10.1109/ECACE.2017.7913034"", ""10.1109/WITCONECE48374.2019.9092918"", ""10.1109/ICCES51350.2021.9489106"", ""10.1007/s10639-021-10682-1"", ""10.3389/ffutr.2022.810698"", ""10.3390/computers10080092"", ""10.3389/frvir.2020.00001"", ""10.1145/3532525.3532534"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121778"", ""10.1364/OE.452747"", ""10.1007/s10055-021-00584-5"", ""10.5220/0008877901650172"", ""10.1145/3349537.3352766""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"
10.1111/mice.12674,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Cross-scene pavement distress detection by a novel transfer learning framework,"AbstractDeep learning has achieved promising results in pavement distress detection. However, the training model's effectiveness varies according to the data and scenarios acquired by different camera types and their installation positions. It is time consuming and labor intensive to recollect labeled data and retrain a new model every time the scene changes. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning pipeline to address this problem, which enables a distress detection model to be applied to other untrained scenarios. The framework consists of two main components: data transfer and model transfer. The former trains a generative adversarial network to transfer existing image data into a new scene style. Then, attentive CutMix and image melding are applied to insert distress annotations to synthesize the new scene's labeled data. After data expansion, the latter step transfers the feature extracted by the existing model to the detection application of the new scene through domain adaptation. The effects of varying degrees of knowledge transfer are also discussed. The proposed method is evaluated on two data sets from two different scenes with more than 40,000 images totally. This method can reduce the demand for training data by at least 25% when the model is applied in a new scene. With the same number of training images, the proposed method can improve the model accuracy by 26.55%.","[{""name"": ""Yishun Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Pengyu Che"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Chenglong Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Urban Infrastructure Renewal  Shanghai 200032 China""]}, {""name"": ""Difei Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuchuan Du"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education, Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Urban Infrastructure Renewal  Shanghai 200032 China""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-8667.1989.tb00026.x"", ""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000367"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.24200/sci.2016.2301"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103935"", ""10.22260/ISARC2018/0103"", ""10.3233/ICA-200632"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201823101007"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.21437/Interspeech.2019-3214"", ""10.23919/EUSIPCO.2018.8553388"", ""10.1080/23249935.2017.1378281"", ""10.1145/2185520.2185578"", ""10.3233/ICA-200635"", ""10.1109/MITS.2017.2776148"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2918567"", ""10.1080/10298436.2020.1714047"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2018.09.013"", ""10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363576"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00733.x"", ""10.1111/mice.12458"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.3390/data3030028"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.09.110"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.046"", ""10.3233/ICA-200625"", ""10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363678"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947606"", ""10.1111/1467-8667.00306"", ""10.1155/2018/5989246"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000918"", ""10.13176/11.167"", ""10.1142/S0129065718500156"", ""10.1111/mice.12041"", ""10.1111/mice.12546"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103176"", ""10.1109/JBHI.2020.2979608"", ""10.1109/ICTIS.2017.8047870"", ""10.3233/ICA-200617"", ""10.1142/S0129065720500124"", ""10.1111/mice.12351"", ""10.1080/10298436.2020.1765241"", ""10.1111/mice.12622"", ""10.1111/mice.12561"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378047"", ""10.1007/s42947-019-0096-z"", ""10.1201/9780429457791"", ""10.1177/0361198105194000107"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119397"", ""10.1142/S0129065720500604"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569514"", ""10.1111/mice.12421"", ""10.1109/ICSAI.2018.8599473"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2009.191"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943‐7862.0001570"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943‐7862.0001047"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857905"", ""10.1142/S012906571950014X"", ""10.1023/B:VLSI.0000028532.53893.82"", ""10.3390/app9224829"", ""10.1111/mice.12543"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728529"", ""10.3233/ICA-190613"", ""10.1177/0361198118798474"", ""10.1111/mice.12406"", ""10.1111/mice.12533"", ""10.1007/s42421-019-00005-9"", ""10.3233/ICA-180584"", ""10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053994"", ""10.1088/1361-6501/aa9857"", ""10.3233/ICA-180596"", ""10.1111/mice.12558"", ""10.1111/mice.12448"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00674.x"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00612"", ""10.1111/mice.12042"", ""10.3141/2435-06"", ""10.1111/mice.12409"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00727.x"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000736"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.244""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

This paper places particular focus on the often‐ignored last step of deployment. Our first phase of solution development involved data preparation, model selection, model training, and model validation. Given the necessarily small‐scale nature of construction vehicle image datasets, we propose as detection model an improved version of the single shot detector MobileNet, which is suitable for embedded devices. Our study's second phase comprised model optimization, application‐specific embedded system selection, economic analysis, and field implementation. Several embedded devices were proposed and compared. Results including a consistent above 90% mean average precision confirm the superior real‐time performance of our proposed solutions. Finally, the practical field implementation of our proposed solutions was investigated. This study validates the practicality of deep‐learning‐based object detection solutions for construction scenarios. Moreover, the detailed information provided by the current study can be employed for several purposes such as safety monitoring, productivity assessments, and managerial decision making.","[{""name"": ""Saeed Arabi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering Iowa State University  Ames Iowa""]}, {""name"": ""Arya Haghighat"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering Iowa State University  Ames Iowa""]}, {""name"": ""Anuj Sharma"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering Iowa State University  Ames Iowa""]}]","[""10.1111/0885-9507.00219"", ""10.1007/s11831-014-9135-7"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109721"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.02.031"", ""10.1016/j.jcsr.2018.09.024"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1177/0361198118777631"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00690.x"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2018.05.003"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2437384"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2582924"", ""10.1145/2647868.2654889"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000731"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000562"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1111/mice.12351"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48"", ""10.1111/mice.12313"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000756"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.07.011"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.12.002"", ""10.1111/mice.12359"", ""10.1561/1500000017"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000974"", ""10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2330900"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.033"", ""10.1609/aaai.v31i1.11231"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298594"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.308"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1111/mice.12141"", ""10.1111/mice.12297""]","['Engineering', 'Health Professions']","['Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12051,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Review and performance evaluation of path tracking controllers of autonomous vehicles,"AbstractAutonomous Vehicles (AVs) have shown indelible and revolutionary effects on accident reduction and more efficient use of travel time, with outstanding socio‐economic impact. Despite these benefits, to make AVs accepted by a wide demographic and produce them on an industrial scale with a reasonable price, there are still a number of technological and social challenges that need to be tackled. Path Tracking Controller (PTC) of AVs is one of the high potential subsystems that can be further improved in order to achieve more accurate, robust and comfortable tracking performance. This study provides a critical review and simulation study of several selected techniques used for the design of PTC of AVs. The AVs are assumed to have limited controllability due to non‐holonomic constraints, such as car‐like vehicles and differential drive mobile robots. A detailed discussion will be provided on the simulation outcomes as well as the pros and cons of each technique for the sake of implementation and improvement of state‐of‐the‐art PTC.","[{""name"":

10.1007/s40534-020-00214-x,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Review of research on high-speed railway subgrade settlement in soft soil area,"AbstractConstruction issues of high-speed rail infrastructures have been increasingly concerned worldwide, of which the subgrade settlement in soft soil area becomes a particularly critical problem. Due to the high compressibility and low permeability of soft soil, the post-construction settlement of the subgrade is extremely difficult to control in these regions, which seriously threatens the operation safety of high-speed trains. In this work, the significant issues of high-speed railway subgrades in soft soil regions are discussed. The theoretical and experimental studies on foundation treatment methods for ballasted and ballastless tracks are reviewed. The settlement evolution and the settlement control effect of different treatment methods are highlighted. Control technologies of subgrade differential settlement are subsequently briefly presented.

10.1186/s12544-021-00469-3,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,0823 Transportation Engineering,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the mobility behaviour in Germany,"AbstractBackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to combat it led to severe constraints for various areas of life, including mobility. To study the effects of this disruptive situation on the mobility behaviour of entire subgroups, and how they shape their mobility in reaction to the special circumstances, can help to better understand, how people react to external changes.MethodologyAim of the study presented in this article was to investigate to what extent, how and in what areas mobility behaviour has changed during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. In addition, a focus was put on the comparison of federal states with and without lockdown in order to investigate a possible contribution of this measure to changes in mobility. We asked respondents via an online survey about their trip purposes and trip frequency, their choice of transport mode and the reasons for choosing it in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. For the analyses presented in this paper, we used the data of 4157survey participants (2512 without lockdown, 1645 with lockdown).ResultsThe data confirmed a profound impact on the mobility behaviour with a shift away from public transport and increases in car usage, walking and cycling. Comparisons of federal states with and without lockdown revealed only isolated differences. It seems that, even if the lockdown had some minor effects, its role in the observed behavioural changes was minimal.","[{""name"": ""Juliane Anke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Angela Francke"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lisa-Marie Schaefer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tibor Petzoldt"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1037/0278-6133.24.3.235"", ""10.1017/S1930297500004319"", ""10.1086/655811"", ""10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00668.x"", ""10.1007/s12529-010-9083-z"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0008032"", ""10.1136/jech.57.11.864"", ""10.1007/s12529-015-9465-3"", ""10.1007/s10603-011-9181-6"", ""10.23668/PSYCHARCHIVES.3019""]","['Mathematics', 'Psychology', 'Social Sciences']","['Modeling and Simulation', 'Applied Psychology', 'Transportation']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7573), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.7417)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"
10.1111/mice.12579,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Detecting safety helmet wearing on construction sites with bounding-box regression and deep transfer learning,"AbstractDetecting safety helmet wearing in surveillance videos is an essential task for safety management, compliance with regulations, and reducing the death rate from construction industry accidents. However, it is much challenged by some factors like interocclusion, scale variances, perspective distortion, small object detection, and the carrier recognition of safety helmet. Traditional image‐based methods suffer from them. This article proposes a new methodology for detecting safety helmet wearing, which makes use of convolutional neural network‐based face detection and bounding‐box regression for safety helmet detection. On the one hand, the method can help to recognize the carrier of the safety helmet and detect a multiscale and small safety helmet. On the other hand, deep transfer learning based on DenseNet is introduced and applied using two different strategies, namely, object feature extractor and fine‐tuning for safety helmet recognition. To further improve the recognition accuracy, the network model with two peer DenseNet networks is trained by mutual distillation. Extensive analysis and experiments show that the novel methodology has considerable advantages in detecting safety helmet wearing compared to other state‐of‐the‐art models. The proposed model has achieved 96.2% recall, 96.2% precision, and 94.47% average detection accuracy. These results, precision‐recall (PR) curve, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrate the feasibility of the new model.","[{""name"": ""Jie Shen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering University of Electronic Science and Technology of China  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Xiong"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering University of Electronic Science and Technology of China  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Ying Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering University of Electronic Science and Technology of China  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Wei He"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering University of Electronic Science and Technology of China  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Peng Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering University of Electronic Science and Technology of China  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoyu Zheng"", ""affiliation"": [""HydroChina Chengdu Engineering Corporation  Chengdu China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.comcom.2012.01.005"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00644"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2008.00580.x"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33018231"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00690.x"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727586"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00482"", ""10.1061/9780784479377.024"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.018"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2014.81"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00300"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2018.07.029"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.243"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.08.009"", ""10.3390/app8122400"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00520"", ""10.1111/mice.12267"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.106"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.713"", ""10.1111/mice.12419"", ""10.3233/ICA-180577"", ""10.1111/mice.12359"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000974"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.91"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2577031"", ""10.1109/WIW.2016.045"", ""10.1007/s12205-017-1730-3"", ""10.1111/mice.12454"", ""10.1155/2015/721380"", ""10.1109/CLEI.2013.6670613"", ""10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2014.28"", ""10.1117/12.2520589"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2014.08.011"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01240-3_49"", ""10.3233/ICA-180584"", ""10.3233/ICA-180560"", ""10.1109/IVCNZ.2013.6726989"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2018.03.037"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.596"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001629"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00454"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.319""]","['Engineering', 'Health Professions']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

To avoid this computational burden, a novel crack detection system, namely, fusion features‐based broad learning system (FF‐BLS), is proposed for efficient training without GPU acceleration. In FF‐BLS, a convolution module with fixed weights is used to extract the fusion features of images. Feature nodes and enhancement nodes randomly generated by fusion features are used to estimate the output of the network. Meanwhile, the proposed FF‐BLS is a dynamical system, which achieves incremental learning by adding nodes. Thus, the trained FF‐BLS model can be updated efficiently with additional data, and this substantially reduces the training cost. Finally, FF‐BLS was applied to crack detection. Compared with some well‐known deep convolutional neural networks (VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception, and EfficientNet), the FF‐BLS achieved a similar level of recognition accuracy, but the training speed was increased by more than 20 times.","[{""name"": ""Yang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Macau  Macau China"", ""Guangdong‐Hong Kong‐Macau Joint Laboratory for Smart Cities University of Macau  Macau China"", ""Guangxi Key Laboratory of Disaster Prevention and Engineering Safety Guangxi University  Guangxi China""]}, {""name"": ""Ka‐Veng Yuen"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Macau  Macau China"", ""Guangdong‐Hong Kong‐Macau Joint Laboratory for Smart Cities University of Macau  Macau China""]}]","[""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.1111/mice.12672"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2716952"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2764844"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.195"", ""10.1111/mice.12564"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2009.11.001"", ""10.1111/mice.12497"", ""10.1142/S0129065720500239"", ""10.1109/ICARCV.2016.7838682"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.02.013"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.07.041"", ""10.1148/rg.2017160130"", ""10.1109/IVS.2019.8814000"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.11.018"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2018.2857815"", ""10.1007/s11831-020-09471-9"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.119928"", ""10.1111/mice.12632"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2015.09.116"", ""10.1007/s13349-020-00444-x"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.322"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2011.11.018"", ""10.1111/mice.12550"", ""10.1177/1475921718821719"", ""10.1111/mice.12641"", ""10.1111/mice.12519"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.103019"", ""10.1109/MWC.2016.1600317WC"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2015.01.008"", ""10.1111/mice.12626"", ""10.1111/mice.12620"", ""10.1111/mice.12494"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.106738"", ""10.3233/ICA-200617"", ""10.1002/stc.2504"", ""10.1016/S0013-7944(99)00112-5"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980086"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.1587/transinf.2018EDL8150"", ""10.1111/mice.12313"", ""10.1111/mice.12622"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.01.036"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298965"", ""10.1016/j.ast.2018.09.044"", ""10.1111/mice.12561"", ""10.1142/S0129065720500604"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2924883"", ""10.1088/1361-665X/aaca4d"", ""10.1111/mice.12421"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.01158"", ""10.22260/ISARC2018/0094"", ""10.1111/mice.12613"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1177/1475921718792108"", ""10.1007/s10489-018-01396-y"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.91"", ""10.1142/S012906571950014X"", ""10.3233/ICA-180587"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28"", ""10.1111/mice.12580"", ""10.3233/ICA-190613"", ""10.1007/s12194-017-0406-5"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.308"", ""10.1109/HNICEM48295.2019.9072731"", ""10.3233/ICA-200620"", ""10.1111/mice.12605"", ""10.1016/j.sna.2006.09.004"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2019.2908233"", ""10.1111/mice.12319"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00046"", ""10.1007/s13349-011-0015-7"", ""10.1109/MSP.2018.2825478"", ""10.1088/1361-665X/ab2834"", ""10.3390/s19081843"", ""10.3233/ICA-180596"", ""10.1111/mice.12141"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2009.00647.x"", ""10.1007/s10489-018-01403-2"", ""10.1111/mice.12409"", ""10.1177/1475921720940068"", ""10.1111/mice.12477"", ""10.1177/1475921719837509""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Class imbalance is a fundamental problem in crack segmentation, resulting in unsatisfactory segmentation for tiny cracks. Besides, limited by the local receptive field, CNNs often cannot integrate local features with global dependencies, thus significantly affecting the detection accuracy of tiny cracks across the entire image. To solve those problems in segmenting tiny cracks, a multiscale feature fusion network with attention mechanisms named “Tiny‐Crack‐Net” (TCN) is proposed. The modified residual network was used to capture the local features of tiny cracks. The dual attention module was then incorporated into the architecture to better separate the tiny cracks from the background. Also, a multiscale fusion operation was implemented to preserve the edge details of tiny cracks. Finally, a joint learning loss of the cross‐entropy and similarity was proposed to alleviate the poor convergence induced by the severe class imbalance of the pixels representing tiny cracks. The capability of the network in segmenting tiny cracks was remarkably enhanced by the aforementioned arrangements, and the “Tiny‐Crack‐Net” achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 87.96% on an open‐source data set, which was at least 5.84% higher than those of the six cutting‐edge networks. The effectiveness and robustness of the “Tiny‐Crack‐Net” were validated with field test results, which showed that the intersection over union (IOU) for cracks with a width of 0.05 mm or wider reaches 91.44%.","[{""name"": ""Honghu Chu"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Engineering Hunan University  Changsha China""]}, {""name"": ""Wei Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Engineering Hunan University  Changsha China"", ""Key Laboratory of Damage Diagnosis for Engineering Structures of Hunan Province Hunan University  Changsha China""]}, {""name"": ""Lu Deng"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Engineering Hunan University  Changsha China"", ""Key Laboratory of Damage Diagnosis for Engineering Structures of Hunan Province Hunan University  Changsha China""]}]","[""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103378"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.15446/dyna.v88n217.91879"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103989"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2644615"", ""10.1111/mice.12672"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1109/FG47880.2020.00014"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1155/2011/989354"", ""10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472621"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102913"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2699184"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00742"", ""10.1111/mice.12564"", ""10.3233/ICA-200638"", ""10.3390/app10072528"", ""10.1002/stc.1831"", ""10.1111/mice.12741"", ""10.1111/mice.12632"", ""10.1111/mice.12578"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7299173"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000918"", ""10.1109/CIBCB48159.2020.9277638"", ""10.1111/mice.12550"", ""10.1111/mice.12519"", ""10.1111/mice.12626"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.01.078"", ""10.1111/mice.12622"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.01.036"", ""10.1007/s11042-018-5704-3"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000446"", ""10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2930724"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2017.01.020"", ""10.3233/ICA-200629"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2021.03.091"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103357"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.3390/s21030824"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120474"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2552248"", ""10.1109/TMI.2016.2528162"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01234-2_1"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.164"", ""10.1177/1475921718764873"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103764"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00747"", ""10.1109/ICIP.2016.7533052"", ""10.3390/electronics9081209"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033661"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00894"", ""10.1016/j.patrec.2021.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.patrec.2011.11.004""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

This combined loading problem requires simulation using coupled thermo-mechanical analysis for design evaluation. This work presents a combined thermal and mechanical finite element analysis (FEA) and evolutionary optimization-based novel approach for estimating the optimal design parameters of the ventilated brake disc. Five parameters controlling the design: inboard plate thickness, outboard plate thickness, vane height, effective offset, and center hole radius were considered, and simulation runs were planned. A total of 27 brake disc designs with design parameters as recommended by the Taguchi method (L27) were modeled using SolidWorks, and the FEA simulation runs were carried out using the ANSYS thermal and structural analysis tool. The fatigue life results were analyzed using a three-dimensional (3D) surface plot for the effect of the design parameters on the response, contour plots for the determination of maximum response, and statistical regression analysis for model interpretation and predictive modeling. Finally, the two most accurate and widely used evolutionary optimization algorithms: genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) were applied to determine the optimal design parameters for the ventilated brake disc. The brake disc of design parameters predicted by GA and PSO gives a 12.74% higher fatigue life compared to parametric analysis. These results have shown that the developed approach can be utilized effectively and reliably for solving the design of ventilated brake disc problem in the industry.&lt;/div&gt;","[{""name"": ""Ali Belhocine"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dinesh Shinde"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rahul Patil"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s11668-020-00831-y"", ""10.1016/S0043-1648(03)00146-7"", ""10.1016/j.triboint.2019.05.035"", ""10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2011.08.029"", ""10.1007/s12008-020-00650-3"", ""10.1007/s12239-012-0071-y"", ""10.1007/s12666-014-0468-6"", ""10.1007/s12239-016-0021-1"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2009.11.022"", ""10.4271/2010-01-0075"", ""10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2017.08.013"", ""10.1007/s12206-011-0921-y"", ""10.1007/s12206-009-1116-7"", ""10.1007/s12206-015-0914-3"", ""10.1007/s12541-011-0109-5"", ""10.1007/s12206-018-1125-5"", ""10.1002/pamm.200910239"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2016.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2016.04.009"", ""10.1109/TSMCA.2005.853495"", ""10.1007/s00419-011-0507-2"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2006.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.118847"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-398364-0.00002-4"", ""10.1080/10426914.2012.718473"", ""10.1016/j.cad.2011.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2019.04.040"", ""10.1080/10426910903124860"", ""10.1080/15560350802316744"", ""10.1080/10426914.2017.1303156"", ""10.1080/10426914.2018.1512114"", ""10.1007/s12010-009-8895-2""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1111/mice.13003,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,Hybrid semantic segmentation for tunnel lining cracks based on Swin Transformer and convolutional neural network,"AbstractIn the field of tunnel lining crack identification, the semantic segmentation algorithms based on convolution neural network (CNN) are extensively used. Owing to the inherent locality of CNN, these algorithms cannot make full use of context semantic information, resulting in difficulty in capturing the global features of crack. Transformer‐based networks can capture global semantic information, but this method also has the deficiencies of strong data dependence and easy loss of local features. In this paper, a hybrid semantic segmentation algorithm for tunnel lining crack, named SCDeepLab, is proposed by fusing Swin Transformer and CNN in the encoding and decoding framework of DeepLabv3+ to address the above issues. In SCDeepLab, a joint backbone network is introduced with CNN‐based Inverse Residual Block and Swin Transformer Block. The former is used to extract the local detailed information of the crack to generate the shallow feature layer, whereas the latter is used to extract the global semantic information to obtain the deep feature layer. In addition, Efficient Channel Attention enhanced Feature Fusion Module is proposed to fuse the shallow and deep features to combine the advantages of the two types of features. Furthermore, the strategy of transfer learning is adopted to solve the data dependency of Swin Transformer. The results show that the mean intersection over union (mIoU) and mean pixel accuracy (mPA) of SCDeepLab on the data sets constructed in this paper are 77.41% and 84.42%, respectively, which have higher segmentation accuracy than previous CNN‐based and transformer‐based semantic segmentation algorithms.","[{""name"": ""Zhong Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering and Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation of Rail Transit Engineering Structure Central South University  Changsha P.

Emerging deep‐learning technologies have become effective methods used to overcome this problem. In this study, the authors propose a deep‐learning architecture called Conv‐GCN that combines a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a three‐dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (3D CNN). First, they introduce a multi‐graph GCN to deal with three inflow and outflow patterns (recent, daily, and weekly) separately. Multi‐graph GCN networks can capture spatiotemporal correlations and topological information within the entire network. A 3D CNN is then applied to deeply integrate the inflow and outflow information. High‐level spatiotemporal features between different inflow and outflow patterns and between stations that are nearby and far away can be extracted by 3D CNN. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to output results. The Conv‐GCN model is evaluated on smart card data of the Beijing subway under the time interval of 10, 15, and 30 min. Results show that this model yields the best performance compared with seven other models. In terms of the root‐mean‐square errors, the performances under three time intervals have been improved by 9.402, 7.756, and 9.256%, respectively. This study can provide critical insights for subway operators to optimise urban rail transit operations.","[{""name"": ""Jinlei Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University No. 3 Shangyuancun, Haidian District Beijing 100044 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Feng Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University No. 3 Shangyuancun, Haidian District Beijing 100044 People's Republic of China"", ""School of Highway, Chang'an University Middle‐Section of Nan'er Huan Road Xi'an 710064 People's Republic of China"", ""Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Centre of Rail Transit Line Safety and Disaster Prevention No.3 Shangyuancun, Haidian District Beijing 100044 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yinan Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Information School, University of Washington Seattle WA USA""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaohong Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University No. 3 Shangyuancun, Haidian District Beijing 100044 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(1997)123:4(261)"", ""10.3141/2024-14"", ""10.1080/18128600902823216"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-76837-1_80"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.11.170"", ""10.3390/ijgi8060243"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941987"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.014"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5511"", ""10.1109/YAC.2016.7804912"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0208"", ""10.3390/s17040818"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.3301922"", ""10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00041"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013656"", ""10.1145/3274895.3274896"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/505"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.013"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2019.00936"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.10.011"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.039"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5530"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0112"", ""10.3390/s17071501"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33015668"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0008"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.019"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2012.59"", ""10.1016/j.media.2016.10.004"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.510""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"
10.1186/s12544-020-00439-1,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,0823 Transportation Engineering,State-of-art review of traffic signal control methods: challenges and opportunities,"Abstract Introduction Due to the menacing increase in the number of vehicles on a daily basis, abating road congestion is becoming a key challenge these years. To cope-up with the prevailing traffic scenarios and to meet the ever-increasing demand for traffic, the urban transportation system needs effective solution methodologies. Changes made in the urban infrastructure will take years, sometimes may not even be feasible. For this reason, traffic signal timing (TST) optimization is one of the fastest and most economical ways to curtail congestion at the intersections and improve traffic flow in the urban network. Purpose Researchers have been working on using a variety of approaches along with the exploitation of technology to improve TST. This article is intended to analyze the recent literature published between January 2015 and January 2020 for the computational intelligence (CI) based simulation approaches and CI-based approaches for optimizing TST and Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems, provide insights, research gaps and possible directions for future work for researchers interested in the field. Methods In analyzing the complex dynamic behavior of traffic streams, simulation tools have a prominent place. Nowadays, microsimulation tools are frequently used in TST related researches. For this reason, a critical review of some of the widely used microsimulation packages is provided in this paper. Conclusion Our review also shows that approximately 77% of the papers included, utilizes a microsimulation tool in some form. Therefore, it seems useful to include a review, categorization, and comparison of the most commonly used microsimulation tools for future work. We conclude by providing insights into the future of research in these areas.","[{""name"": ""Syed Shah Sultan Mohiuddin Qadri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mahmut Ali Gökçe"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erdinç Öner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.06.057"", ""10.4103/1463-1741.82959"", ""10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2161577"", ""10.1109/ICCE-Asia.2016.7804762"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2017.04.021"", ""10.1155/2015/979160"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2014.09.003"", ""10.1109/CSIE.2009.63"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2003.819610"", ""10.1080/0305215X.2014.995644"", ""10.2307/3006800"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2019.05.037"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2016.04.207"", ""10.1145/268437.268460"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2015.01.063"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2016.09.009"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.10.066"", ""10.23919/ELMAR.2018.8534608"", ""10.1145/3219819.3220096"", ""10.1109/ICITE.2018.8492537"", ""10.1177/0037549715581473"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795641"", ""10.1109/SITIS.2016.49"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-60749-3_9"", ""10.1109/CCSSE.2016.7784378"", ""10.1109/I2CACIS.2017.8239039"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727804"", ""10.1109/CIST.2016.7804996"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2019.01.046"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2413360"", ""10.1109/TSG.2016.2526032"", ""10.1109/MITS.2016.2605318"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.08.004"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2015.31"", ""10.23919/ELMAR.2017.8124425"", ""10.1287/trsc.2017.0812"", ""10.1287/trsc.2017.0754"", ""10.1109/ASYU48272.2019.8946339"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2019.03.001"", ""10.1109/MCI.2008.930983"", ""10.1504/IJBIC.2011.038700"", ""10.1162/evco.1995.3.2.199"", ""10.5220/0005269302950301"", ""10.3233/IFS-151535"", ""10.1109/ICISIM.2017.8122193"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.008"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2890726"", ""10.3390/s19081776"", ""10.1139/cjce-2014-0503"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.010"", ""10.1002/atr.1274"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2016.07.029"", ""10.3846/16484142.2017.1285813"", ""10.1080/03081060.2017.1314498"", ""10.3233/JIFS-18077"", ""10.1109/CCCS.2018.8586845"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.140"", ""10.1080/21680566.2018.1518734"", ""10.1016/j.matcom.2017.12.003"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2873790"", ""10.1177/1687814016666042"", ""10.1016/j.jnca.2018.07.001"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845673"", ""10.1155/2016/1682394"", ""10.1007/s11036-019-01225-7"", ""10.1177/1687814019842498"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.08.001"", ""10.1111/mice.12272"", ""10.1287/trsc.2017.0760"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.08.014"", ""10.1080/15472450.2018.1501273"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2019.01.012"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2018.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.12.015"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.10.002"", ""10.1177/1687814015613500"", ""10.1080/21680566.2017.1370397"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.378"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795755"", ""10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005732"", ""10.1007/s10462-017-9604-0"", ""10.1109/TCST.2018.2807792"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2878001"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2925134"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2017.03.039"", ""10.1109/TCST.2016.2572169"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2891791"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.01.019"", ""10.1109/ICEEE.2015.7357932"", ""10.3390/su10082849"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2837162"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2018.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.492"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.04.488""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Management Science and Operations Research', 'Building and Construction', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"
10.1287/trsc.2019.0914,TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering; 1201 Management Science and Engineering,Slack Induction by String Removals for Vehicle Routing Problems,"Dedicated algorithm and modeling improvements continue to advance the state of the art with respect to vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Despite these academic achievements, solving large VRP instances sufficiently fast for real-life applicability remains challenging. By exploiting VRP solution characteristics in an effective manner, this paper arrives at a powerful and fast optimization heuristic. Its primary contributions are threefold: a ruin method, a recreate method, and a fleet minimization procedure. The ruin method functions via adjacent string removal, introducing with it a novel property regarding vehicle routing problems that we term spatial slack, whereas the recreate method is categorized as greedy insertion with blinks. Combining these results in slack induction by string removals (SISRs), a powerful ruin and recreate approach. The fleet minimization procedure, meanwhile, introduces an absences-based acceptance criterion that serves as a complementary optimization component for when minimizing the number of vehicles constitutes the primary VRP objective. Together these three elements provide a suite of simple, powerful, and easily reproducible algorithmic methods that are successfully applied not only to the capacitated VRP but also to a wide range of related problems such as pickup and delivery problems and others that include time windows. SISRs serves to strip back the layers of complexity and specialization synonymous with the trend of algorithmic development throughout recent decades. Moreover, such simplicity and reproducibility are shown to not necessarily come at the expense of solution quality, with SISRs consistently outperforming alternative general approaches as well as dedicated single-purpose methods. Finally, aside from performance-related criteria, SISRs also serves to showcase a fresh perspective with respect to VRPs more generally, introducing a range of new terminology and procedures that, it is hoped, will invigorate further research and innovation.","[{""name"": ""Jan Christiaens"", ""affiliation"": [""CODeS, imec, Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, 9000 Gent, Belgium;""]}, {""name"": ""Greet Vanden Berghe"", ""affiliation"": [""CODeS, imec, Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, 9000 Gent, Belgium;""]}]","[""10.1007/s10107-007-0178-5"", ""10.1287/trsc.1070.0209"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2015.10.002"", ""10.1057/jors.1969.75"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(02)00045-0"", ""10.1287/opre.6.6.791"", ""10.1287/mnsc.6.1.80"", ""10.1109/DAC.1981.1585385"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(91)90319-Q"", ""10.1080/01621459.1961.10482090"", ""10.1057/jors.1990.119"", ""10.1287/opre.42.4.626"", ""10.1007/s10107-005-0644-x"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2009.02.017"", ""10.1016/0305-0483(76)90097-9"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(89)90057-X"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-5755-5_2"", ""10.1007/s00291-018-0544-0"", ""10.1287/trsc.2018.0837"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(86)90020-2"", ""10.1126/science.220.4598.671"", ""10.1287/trsc.1090.0301"", ""10.1287/trsc.1090.0290"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2003.10.002"", ""10.1109/ICTAI.2001.974461"", ""10.1002/j.1538-7305.1965.tb04146.x"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2016.12.008"", ""10.1063/1.1699114"", ""10.1016/0191-2607(89)90085-X"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15844-5_54"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2009.06.022"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2009.06.014"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-07557-0_33"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2005.09.012"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(93)90221-8"", ""10.1057/jors.1995.204"", ""10.1016/S0305-0548(03)00158-8"", ""10.1109/TEVC.2008.2011740"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2011.05.005"", ""10.1007/BF02430370"", ""10.1287/trsc.1050.0135"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2004.09.004"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600924"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(90)90091-O"", ""10.1006/jcph.1999.6413"", ""10.1007/3-540-49481-2_30"", ""10.1287/trsc.31.2.170"", ""10.1016/j.orl.2010.05.002"", ""10.1016/S0166-218X(01)00351-1"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2016.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2012.07.018"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2013.09.045"", ""10.1007/s10732-014-9273-y"", ""10.1287/opre.1120.1048"", ""10.2307/3001968"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.004""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

With recent earthquakes worldwide, rapid structural damage inspection and repair cost evaluation are crucial for building owners and policy makers to make informed risk management decisions. To improve the efficiency of such inspection, advanced computer vision techniques based on convolutional neural networks have been adopted in recent research to rapidly quantify the damage state (DS) of structures. In this article, an advanced object detection neural network, named YOLOv2, is implemented, which achieves 98.2% and 84.5% average precision in training and testing, respectively. The proposed YOLOv2 is used in combination with the classification neural network, which improves the identification accuracy for critical DS of RC structures by 7.5%. The improved classification procedures allow engineers to rapidly and more accurately quantify the DSs of the structure, and also localize the critical damage features. The identified DS can then be integrated with the state‐of‐the‐art performance evaluation framework to quantify the financial losses of critical RC buildings. The results can be used by the building owners and decision makers to make informed risk management decisions immediately after the strong earthquake shaking. Hence, resources can be allocated rapidly to improve the resiliency of the community.","[{""name"": ""Xiao Pan"", ""affiliation"": [""International Joint Research Laboratory of Earthquake Engineering Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Department of Civil Engineering The University of British Columbia  Vancouver Canada""]}, {""name"": ""T.

Therefore, it is difficult to develop a mathematical or artificial intelligence model that describes the time evolution of traffic systems. All the while, the ever-increasing demands on transportation systems has left traffic agencies in dire need of a robust method for analyzing and forecasting traffic. Here we demonstrate how the Koopman mode decomposition can offer a model-free, data-driven approach for analyzing and forecasting traffic dynamics. By obtaining a decomposition of data sets collected by the Federal Highway Administration and the California Department of Transportation, we are able to reconstruct observed data, distinguish any growing or decaying patterns, and obtain a hierarchy of previously identified and never before identified spatiotemporal patterns. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how this methodology can be utilized to forecast highway network conditions.","[{""name"": ""A. M. Avila"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""I.

10.1007/s40534-020-00207-w,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Active suspension in railway vehicles: a literature survey,"AbstractSince the concept of active suspensions appeared, its large possible benefits has attracted continuous exploration in the field of railway engineering. With new demands of higher speed, better ride comfort and lower maintenance cost for railway vehicles, active suspensions are very promising technologies. Being the starting point of commercial application of active suspensions in rail vehicles, tilting trains have become a great success in some countries. With increased technical maturity of sensors and actuators, active suspension has unprecedented development opportunities. In this work, the basic concepts are summarized with new theories and solutions that have appeared over the last decade. Experimental studies and the implementation status of different active suspension technologies are described as well. Firstly, tilting trains are briefly described. Thereafter, an in-depth study for active secondary and primary suspensions is performed. For both topics, after an introductory section an explanation of possible solutions existing in the literature is given. The implementation status is reported. Active secondary suspensions are categorized into active and semi-active suspensions. Primary suspensions are instead divided between acting on solid-axle wheelsets and independently rotating wheels. Lastly, a brief summary and outlook is presented in terms of benefits, research status and challenges.

10.1111/mice.12793,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,A deep learning-based image captioning method to automatically generate comprehensive explanations of bridge damage,"AbstractPhotographs of bridges can reveal considerable technical information such as the part of the structure that is damaged and the type of damage. Maintenance and inspection engineers can benefit greatly from a technology that can automatically extract and express such information in readable sentences. This is possibly the first study on developing a deep learning model that can generate sentences describing the damage condition of a bridge from images through an image captioning method. Our study shows that by introducing an attention mechanism into the deep learning model, highly accurate descriptive sentences can be generated. In addition, often multiple forms of damage can be observed in the images of bridges; hence, our algorithm is adapted to output multiple sentences to provide a comprehensive interpretation of complex images. In our dataset, the scores of Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)‐1 to BLEU‐4 were 0.782, 0.749, 0.711, and 0.693, respectively, and the percentage of correctly output explanatory sentences is 69.3%. All of these results are better than the model without the attention mechanism. The developed method makes it possible to provide user‐friendly, text‐based explanations of bridge damage in images, making it easier for engineers with relatively little experience and even administrative staff without extensive technical expertise to understand images of bridge damage. Future research in this field is expected to lead to the unification of field expertise with artificial intelligence (AI), which will be the foundation of the evolutionary development of bridge inspection AI.","[{""name"": ""Pang‐Jo Chun"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering The University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Tatsuro Yamane"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of International Studies The University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Yu Maemura"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering The University of Tokyo  Tokyo Japan""]}]","[""10.1201/9781482289008"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107077"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103116"", ""10.1177/1475921703036169"", ""10.3115/v1/D14-1179"", ""10.20965/jrm.2020.p1244"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2021.3106867"", ""10.1111/mice.12564"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119238"", ""10.3390/met9121259"", ""10.3390/s20102780"", ""10.3390/app11030892"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01059"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.323"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848"", ""10.1111/mice.12497"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15561-1_2"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2020.101126"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103596"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01034"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.02.031"", ""10.1613/jair.3994"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2018.04.002"", ""10.1111/mice.12550"", ""10.1111/mice.12519"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.494"", ""10.1111/mice.12626"", ""10.1617/s11527-021-01646-5"", ""10.1007/s42405-018-0120-5"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2020.01.006"", ""10.1111/mice.12674"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48"", ""10.1609/aaai.v31i1.11197"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103334"", ""10.1111/mice.12622"", ""10.1111/mice.12501"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.01.036"", ""10.1111/mice.12686"", ""10.1111/mice.12561"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.1111/mice.12686"", ""10.1080/01691864.2021.1929471"", ""10.1111/mice.12532"", ""10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01098"", ""10.3115/1073083.1073135"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.10.065"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.131"", ""10.1111/mice.12580"", ""10.1016/S0141-0296(96)00149-6"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.274"", ""10.3390/s20092710"", ""10.3846/jcem.2018.6186"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.308"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298935"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2019.107075"", ""10.5006/3674"", ""10.1111/mice.12563"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.06.130"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.3151/jact.18.493""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1007/s11116-020-10110-2,TRANSPORTATION,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering,What are the determinants of the willingness to share rides in pooled on-demand services?,"AbstractSimulation studies suggest that pooled on-demand services (also referred to as Demand Responsive Transport, ridesharing, shared ride-hailing or shared ridesourcing services) have the potential to bring large benefits to urban areas while inducing limited time losses for their users. However, in reality, the large majority of users request individual rides (and not pooled rides) in existing on-demand services, leading to increases in motorised vehicle miles travelled. In this study, we investigate to what extent fare discounts, additional travel time, and the (un)willingness to share the ride with (different numbers of) other passengers play a role in the decision of individuals to share rides. To this end, we design a stated preference study targeting Dutch urban individuals. In our research, we (1) disentangle the sharing aspect from related time–cost trade-offs (e.g. detours), (2) investigate preference heterogeneity regarding the studied attributes and identify distinct market segments, and (3) simulate scenarios to understand the impact of the obtained parameters in the breakdown between individual and pooled services. We find that less than one third of respondents have strong preferences against sharing their rides. Also, we find that different market segments vary not only in their values of the willingness to share, but also in how they perceive this willingness to share (per-ride or proportional to the in-vehicle time). Further, the scenario analysis demonstrates that the share of individuals who are willing to share rides depends primarily on the time–cost trade-offs, rather than on the disutility stemming from pooling rides per se.","[{""name"": ""María J.

10.1038/s41598-020-61077-0,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,0823 Transportation Engineering,Disparities in travel times between car and transit: Spatiotemporal patterns in cities,"AbstractCities worldwide are pursuing policies to reduce car use and prioritise public transit (PT) as a means to tackle congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The increase of PT ridership is constrained by many aspects; among them, travel time and the built environment are considered the most critical factors in the choice of travel mode. We propose a data fusion framework including real-time traffic data, transit data, and travel demand estimated using Twitter data to compare the travel time by car and PT in four cities (São Paulo, Brazil; Stockholm, Sweden; Sydney, Australia; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We use real-world data to make realistic estimates of travel time by car and by PT and compare their performance by time of day and by travel distance across cities. Our results suggest that using PT takes on average 1.4–2.6 times longer than driving a car. The share of area where travel time favours PT over car use is very small: 0.62% (0.65%), 0.44% (0.48%), 1.10% (1.22%) and 1.16% (1.19%) for the daily average (and during peak hours) for São Paulo, Sydney, Stockholm, and Amsterdam, respectively. The travel time disparity, as quantified by the travel time ratio $$R$$R (PT travel time divided by the car travel time), varies widely during an average weekday, by location and time of day. A systematic comparison between these two modes shows that the average travel time disparity is surprisingly similar across cities: $$R &lt; 1$$R&lt;1 for travel distances less than 3 km, then increases rapidly but quickly stabilises at around 2. This study contributes to providing a more realistic performance evaluation that helps future studies further explore what city characteristics as well as urban and transport policies make public transport more attractive, and to create a more sustainable future for cities.","[{""name"": ""Yuan Liao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jorge Gil"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rafael H.

Vision‐based approaches using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) mounted with high‐resolution cameras have been proposed for this purpose. However, because the camera itself is moving with the UAV, any video obtained will contain both the motion of the structure and the motion of the camera. Planar homography can be used to eliminate the errors induced by the camera movement without the need for camera parameters. However, its direct application to large structures still has limitations, because capturing the undeformed regions, along with the measurement points on the structure, within a single image with sufficient resolution is seldom feasible. In this study, a new framework is presented to address these issues and facilitate the extraction of the structural displacement from videos taken by a UAV‐mounted camera. First, a two‐layer feedforward neural network (FNN) is adopted to obtain the image coordinates of the selected features of the structure on its stationary position, which are further used as homography features. Next, the structural displacement is estimated with the homography transformation matrix determined from the obtained homography features. Finally, the proposed approach is validated on both a six‐story shear‐building model in the laboratory and an elevator tower located in Zhongshan City, China. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.","[{""name"": ""Yufeng Weng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Department of Disaster Mitigation for Structures Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiazeng Shan"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Department of Disaster Mitigation for Structures Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Zheng Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Department of Disaster Mitigation for Structures Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Xilin Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Department of Disaster Mitigation for Structures Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Billie F.

Thus, effective solutions to address the negative impacts that come with rising car-ownership are needed as part of an overall travel demand management strategy. In developed and emerging economies, shared-mobility in the form of car-sharing is becoming popular as potentially low-cost and environmentally sustainable alternative to car-ownership. Yet, our understanding of car-sharing adoption and diffusion factors in developing countries is limited. In this study, we fill this gap by examining car-sharing adoption intentions among young adults aged between 18 and 35 years in Ghana, Sub-Saharan Africa. Using structural equation modelling, we model car-sharing adoption intentions based on a framework that integrates individuals’ perception of the benefits of car-sharing, attitudes towards the environment and technology, trust of stewardship in car-sharing, perception of innovativeness of car-sharing, travel expectations and socio-demographic factors. We found that pro-technology and pro-environmental attitudes correlate positively with perceived benefits of car-sharing. Perceived benefits of car-sharing, in turn, has the largest predictive effect on intentions to car-share. Other factors, including individuals’ previous experience using Uber on-demand taxi services, gender, education, driver’s licensure and expectation of comfortable and fast travel options, all predict car-sharing adoption intentions. While there exists an interest in both station-based and free-floating car-sharing services, more of the would-be users favour the latter than the former. Also, majority of the potential adopters (62%) would join a car-sharing service within the first 1 year of its introduction. An important finding is that dissatisfaction with existing public transit services underpins car-sharing intentions, implying that relying on car-sharing alone to meet travel needs, without a holistic strategy of providing quality and affordable public transit services, could lead to unsustainable outcomes.","[{""name"": ""Ransford A.

The electrochemical repair method is a promising concrete rehabilitation technique with advantages of non‐destructive and economic performance in crack repair, chloride removal, and corrosion protection, which is particularly suitable for structures exposed to marine environments. This work presents an innovative methodology for modeling the mechanical, transport, and chemical process during electrochemical treatment for marine concrete structures. The entire process from concrete cracking up to repairing can be successfully reproduced and digitally visualized. The first sub‐model calculates the corrosion‐induced cracking process at the mesoscopic level with the consideration of local mechanical variances of concrete composites. Then, a reactive transport sub‐model is established to reveal the interactions and electrochemical reactions among various species of ions. A crack repair sub‐model is built to visualize the moving interface between chemical deposition and crack surface. Through combining the three sub‐models, the interconnected influencing factors in practical engineering can be quantitively investigated. The calculation results show that, compared with electrolyte concentration, the influence of current density on crack closure rates are more obvious. Other factors such as steel reinforcement diameter and crack distribution pattern, which have not been previously reported are highlighted. These findings can guide the application of electrochemical repair in practical engineering.","[{""name"": ""Zhaozheng Meng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Qing‐feng Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Jin Xia"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Structural Engineering Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuxin Cai"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Xingji Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology at Weihai  Weihai China""]}, {""name"": ""Yu Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Leo Pel"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Applied Physics, Transport in Permeable Media Eindhoven University of Technology  Eindhoven The Netherlands""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130315"", ""10.1111/mice.12509"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000254"", ""10.1680/macr.2000.52.2.79"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.10.042"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2018.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2017.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2020.103620"", ""10.1177/1056789518773633"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103515"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.05.033"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.09.031"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.117725"", ""10.1007/s11595-019-2169-9"", ""10.1111/mice.12564"", ""10.1111/mice.12208"", ""10.1201/9781003076957-11"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.111392"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2020.107321"", ""10.1201/9781315274508"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2009.07.014"", ""10.1007/s11595-007-6917-x"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2017.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2020.108714"", ""10.1111/mice.12626"", ""10.1111/mice.12620"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.124291"", ""10.1111/mice.12622"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.12.043"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.03.088"", ""10.1016/j.commatsci.2015.01.013"", ""10.1515/CORRREV.2009.27.1-2.53"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.09.063"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112903"", ""10.1016/S0958-9465(99)00016-5"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2020.106317"", ""10.1108/ACMM-12-2014-1473"", ""10.5703/1288284315428"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00716.x"", ""10.1016/1065-7355(95)90037-3"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2003.07.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2001)13:2(136)"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2011.08.026"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.02.028"", ""10.1007/s10704-012-9774-3"", ""10.1111/mice.12657"", ""10.14359/51689360"", ""10.14359/51689485"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2014.10.016"", ""10.1680/macr.2003.55.1.35"", ""10.1016/S0008-8846(01)00650-0"", ""10.1016/j.scriptamat.2005.02.001"", ""10.1139/L07-117"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2006.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2007.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.07.016"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.03.063"", ""10.1680/macr.1992.44.158.63"", ""10.1016/j.powtec.2019.04.083"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.12.038"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2019.03.018"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2012.10.004"", ""10.1007/s10008-012-1935-9"", ""10.1016/0008-8846(93)90089-R"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2020.106974"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2016.09.012"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2009)21:6(244)"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2009.00602.x"", ""10.1016/S0927-0256(00)00177-4"", ""10.1016/j.finel.2005.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120463"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.08.073"", ""10.13168/cs.2019.0037"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.05.027"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2020.103714"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.122806"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2011.08.045"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2011.05.017"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120625"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-0113-1_31"", ""10.1617/s11527-013-0115-4"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2019.106791"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2020.106284"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.126797""]","['Engineering', 'Materials Science']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Bus operating speed guidance on the mid‐blocks and intersection signal adjustment are two main strategies in the proposed method. A forecasting model of bus travel time under the dynamic control method is developed. The objective function is set up by taking into account differences between actual bus headways and dispatching headways, and the scaling ratios of intersection cycle lengths. The optimization model is solved using genetic algorithm. The proposed method is applied to a real bus route in Meihekou city, China, and compared with the current control plan as well as holding strategy. Results show that the proposed method can reduce bus headway deviations in all investigating periods; negative impacts on cars can be limited by setting reasonable values for the parameters.","[{""name"": ""Yiming Bie"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation Jilin University  Changchun China""]}, {""name"": ""Xinyu Xiong"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation Science and Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology  Harbin China""]}, {""name"": ""Yadan Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaobo Qu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering Chalmers University of Technology  Sweden""]}]","[""10.1016/j.trb.2015.09.003"", ""10.1287/trsc.8.2.102"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2018.03.008"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.07.012"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.09.016"", ""10.1007/s10479-014-1663-x"", ""10.3141/2274-11"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(03)00015-8"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2015.08.007"", ""10.1002/atr.1278"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2011.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2009.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2010.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2012.04.005"", ""10.3141/2090-07"", ""10.1016/S0965-8564(97)00016-5"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.08.013"", ""10.3141/1857-06"", ""10.3141/1791-02"", ""10.1057/jors.1983.139"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2015.07.013"", ""10.1002/atr.5670430304"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.01.009"", ""10.1287/trsc.35.3.215.10150"", ""10.3141/1811-19"", ""10.3141/2352-11"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2011.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2009.01.007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00677.x"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2014.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.08.007"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2008.06.038"", ""10.1287/trsc.8.3.248"", ""10.1287/trsc.6.1.52"", ""10.3141/1683-17"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.11.013"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.07.005"", ""10.1080/15472450590934642"", ""10.1111/mice.12360"", ""10.1111/mice.12277"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00468.x"", ""10.1007/s11116-010-9287-8"", ""10.3141/2197-02"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2018.09.007"", ""10.3141/1856-24"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2016.08.040"", ""10.1061/JTEPBS.0000198"", ""10.1007/s12205-018-1491-7"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.06.019"", ""10.3390/su8111170"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2011.07.009"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.06.006"", ""10.1007/s11116-018-9892-5"", ""10.1111/mice.12414"", ""10.1111/mice.12315"", ""10.1080/03081061003732417"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2620483"", ""10.1111/mice.12300"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2568759"", ""10.1111/mice.12289"", ""10.1016/j.ijtm.2005.02.001""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Transportation', 'Control and Systems Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

The novel pixel‐level detection algorithm called DAN‐DeepLabv3+ integrates a dual attention module into the DeepLabv3+ framework in pursue of more precise segmentation results. For one thing, the dual parallel attention module helps to explicitly model rich contextual dependencies over local feature representations in the spatial and channel dimensions. For another, the popular DeepLabv3+ in an encoder‐decoder architecture is useful in capturing multi‐scale contextual information and sharp object boundaries. The DAN‐DeepLabv3+ is applied to an available dataset containing 6666 images, where three types of steel defects are taken by high‐frequency cameras and have been annotated manually. Experimental results show that, compared with other deep learning models, DAN‐DeepLabv3+ based on the Xception backbone exhibits the best segmentation performance under the mean intersection over union (IoU) of 89.95% and the frequency‐weighted IoU of 97.34%. Besides, the F1‐score for the three kinds of defects can reach 86.90%, 99.20%, and 92.81%. From the comparative study, it has been found that the adoption of the dual attention module and DeepLabv3+ contributes to boosting the segmentation performance. The significance of the proposed hybrid model lies in the enhancement in accurately detecting single or multiple steel defects, which has proven to outperform other classical methods.","[{""name"": ""Y.

In this study, we optimize the opportunity fast-charging schedule of transit BEB networks in order to minimize the charging costs and the impact on the grid. Two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations that use different discretization approaches are developed and compared. Discrete-Time Optimization (DTO) resembles a time-expanded network that discretizes the time and decisions to equal discrete slots. Discrete-Event Optimization (DEO) discretizes the time and decisions into nonuniform slots based on arrival and departure events in the network. In addition to the DEO’s higher practicability, the comparative computational study carried out on the transit-bus network in the city of Rotterdam, Netherlands, shows that the DEO is superior to the DTO in terms of computational performance. To show the potential benefits of the optimal schedule, it is compared with two reference common-sense greedy strategies: First-in-First-Served and Lowest-Charge-Highest-Priority.","[{""name"": ""Ayman Abdelwahed"", ""affiliation"": [""Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, 3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands;""]}, {""name"": ""Pieter L. van den Berg"", ""affiliation"": [""Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, 3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands;""]}, {""name"": ""Tobias Brandt"", ""affiliation"": [""Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, 3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands;""]}, {""name"": ""John Collins"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455;""]}, {""name"": ""Wolfgang Ketter"", ""affiliation"": [""Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, 3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands;"", ""Faculty of Management, Economics, and Social Sciences, Cologne Institute of Information Systems and Institute of Energy Economics, University of Cologne, 50969 Cologne, Germany""]}]","[""10.1287/opre.2017.1624"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.09.011"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.058"", ""10.1111/poms.12876"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.152"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2009.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.455"", ""10.1080/15568318.2017.1310962"", ""10.1287/trsc.2013.0468"", ""10.1080/15568318.2013.872737"", ""10.1016/j.epsr.2016.09.032"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958135"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2018.07.010"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.09.014"", ""10.3390/en8054587"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2525800"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.041""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

This method consists of three main parts including a novelty detector based on kernel null Foley–Sammon transform (KNFST), a practical approach to choosing an optimal Gaussian kernel parameter, and a probabilistic method for the threshold estimation. The crux of KNFST is to map all original samples to a kernel feature space and project the kernelized features into a single point in a null space. The proposed threshold estimation method exploits the extreme value theory, the generalized Pareto distribution, and the peak‐over‐threshold. The major contribution of this article is to propose an innovative novelty detection method by a one‐class kernel null space algorithm and a probabilistic threshold estimation approach. Dealing with the problem of environmental variations and estimating a reliable alarming threshold are the main advantages of the proposed method. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are validated by the Wooden Bridge in a laboratory environment and the full‐scale Z24 Bridge. Results demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised learning method highly succeeds in detecting damage even under strong environmental variations.","[{""name"": ""Hassan Sarmadi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil Engineering Ferdowsi University of Mashhad  Azadi Square Mashhad Iran"", ""Head of Research and Development Ideh Pardazan Etebar Sazeh Fanavar Pooya (IPESFP) Company  Mashhad Razavi Khorasan Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Ka‐Veng Yuen"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Macau  Macao China""]}]","[""10.1088/0964-1726/24/6/065034"", ""10.1007/s11831-014-9135-7"", ""10.1111/mice.12517"", ""10.1111/mice.12258"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2013.433"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-3675-0"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.11.045"", ""10.3390/s20082328"", ""10.1177/1475921718800306"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-74690-4_28"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2010.00685.x"", ""10.1177/1475921716639587"", ""10.1016/j.spa.2010.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2006.05.009"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000905"", ""10.1111/mice.12408"", ""10.1002/nme.1964"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2016.02.005"", ""10.1142/p191"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.05.017"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139176224"", ""10.1177/1475921720916923"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00431.x"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.439"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2008.00589.x"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2018.08.022"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2010.08.012"", ""10.1111/mice.12528"", ""10.1111/mice.12059"", ""10.1111/mice.12511"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.1177/1475921716685039"", ""10.1002/9780470061626.shm165"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.01.007"", ""10.1177/1475921713502836"", ""10.1111/mice.12523"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2015.11.008"", ""10.1002/stc.1825"", ""10.1177/1077546319891306"", ""10.1007/s00366-020-01041-8"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.106495"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.01.024"", ""10.1098/rsta.2006.1938"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2014.01.020"", ""10.1111/mice.12372"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2016.11.035"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2016.10.004""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Various types of inspection equipment are applied, such as ground penetrating radar, laser, and LiDAR, but they are usually very expensive and require extensive training and rich experience to operate. To date, track inspections still rely heavily on manual inspections which are low‐efficiency, subjective, and not as accurate as desired, especially for missing and broken track components, such as spikes, clips, and tie plates. To address this issue, a real‐time pixel‐level rail components detection framework to inspect tracks timely and accurately is proposed in this study. The first public rail components image database, including rails, spikes, and clips, is built and released online. A real‐time pixel‐level detection framework with improved real‐time instance segmentation models is developed. The improved models leverage fast object detection and highly accurate instance segmentation. Backbones with more granular levels and receptive fields are implemented in the proposed models. Compared with the original YOLACT and Mask R‐CNN models, the proposed models are able to: (1) achieve 59.9 bbox mAP, and 63.6 mask mAP with the customized dataset, which are higher than the other models and (2) achieve a real‐time speed which is over 30 FPS processing a high‐resolution video (1,080 × 1,092) with a single GPU. The fast processing speed can quickly turn inspection videos into useful information to assist track maintenance.

It results in performance degradation in the application of many model‐based methods, which are usually designed on a numerical model and needed to be applied to a real structure. Such a situation is defined as a cross‐domain SDD problem in this work. This paper aims to address the cross‐domain SDD problem by designing a feature‐extractor to generate both damage‐sensitive and domain‐invariant features, instead of trying to reduce the gap, as the traditional methods do. A domain adaptation (DA) neural network is designed and trained on the data from both the numerical model and the real structure at the same time. In addition, no damage label of the real structure is needed. Both numerical and laboratory experiments show that the proposed method has excellent performance and outperforms the baseline model, a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). This paper provides a new methodology to solve the cross‐domain SDD problem, that is, to learn better features instead of just trying to reduce the gap.","[{""name"": ""Yi‐zhou Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Environment and Civil Engineering Dongguan University of Technology  Dongguan China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhen‐hua Nie"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanics and Construction Engineering Jinan University  Guangzhou China"", ""Key Lab of Disaster Forecast and Control in Engineering Ministry of Education  Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Hong‐wei Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Environment and Civil Engineering Dongguan University of Technology  Dongguan China"", ""Department of Civil Engineering Qinghai University  Xining China""]}]","[""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/24/6/065034"", ""10.1111/mice.12509"", ""10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2020.103932"", ""10.1111/mice.12517"", ""10.1007/s10994-009-5152-4"", ""10.1177/1475921704047500"", ""10.1243/03093247V142049"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2018.01.068"", ""10.3390/s20102780"", ""10.1111/mice.12497"", ""10.2172/249299"", ""10.1002/stc.2433"", ""10.1177/1475921720916881"", ""10.1006/mssp.1997.0139"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.106550"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-13560-1_76"", ""10.1111/mice.12519"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2005.00399.x"", ""10.1002/nme.1964"", ""10.1111/mice.12531"", ""10.1111/mice.12313"", ""10.1111/mice.12501"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1993.1340"", ""10.1111/mice.12548"", ""10.1061/JMCEA3.0000098"", ""10.1111/mice.12528"", ""10.1111/mice.12532"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2009.191"", ""10.1016/0022-460X(91)90595-B"", ""10.1002/stc.453"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9692"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15561-1_16"", ""10.1111/mice.12523"", ""10.1016/S0141-0296(96)00149-6"", ""10.1111/mice.12100"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1998.1878"", ""10.1016/S0378-3758(00)00115-4"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.scient.2012.09.002"", ""10.1080/17747120.2005.9692748"", ""10.1016/S0045-7949(03)00313-4"", ""10.1016/S0045-7949(02)00217-1"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995347"", ""10.1111/mice.12488"", ""10.1098/rspa.2007.1834"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107374"", ""10.1002/stc.144"", ""10.1111/mice.12447"", ""10.1109/ICNN.1988.23914"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1999.2624""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1186/s12544-021-00501-6,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,0823 Transportation Engineering,Picture fuzzy WASPAS method for selecting last-mile delivery mode: a case study of Belgrade,"Abstract Background Last-mile delivery (LMD) is becoming more and more demanding due to an increasing number of users and traffic problems in cities. Besides, medical crises (like the COVID-19 outbreak) and air pollution represent additional motives for the transition from traditional to socially and environmentally sustainable LMD mode. An emerging problem for companies in the postal and logistics industry is how to determine the best LMD mode in a multi-criteria setting under uncertainty. Method For the first time, an extension of the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product ASsessment (WASPAS) method under the picture fuzzy environment is presented to solve the LMD mode selection problem. The introduced picture fuzzy set (PFS) based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method can be highly beneficial to managers who are in charge of LMD since it can take into account the neutral/refusal information and efficiently deal with high levels of imprecise, vague, and uncertain information. The comparative analysis with the existing state-of-the-art PFS-based MCDM methods approved the high reliability of the proposed picture fuzzy WASPAS method. Its high robustness and consistency are also confirmed. The presented method can be used to improve LMD in urban areas worldwide. Besides, it can be applied to solve other emerging MCDM problems in an uncertain environment. Findings A real-life case study of Belgrade is presented to fully illustrate the potentials and applicability of the picture fuzzy WASPAS method.

10.1287/trsc.2022.1163,TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering; 1201 Management Science and Engineering,Microscopic Traffic Modeling Inside Intersections: Interactions Between Drivers,"Microscopic traffic flow models enable predictions of traffic operations, which allows traffic engineers to assess the efficiency and safety effects of roadway designs. Modeling vehicle trajectories inside intersections is challenging because there is an infinite number of possible paths in a two-dimensional space, and drivers can simultaneously adapt their speeds as well. To date, human driver models for simultaneous longitudinal and lateral vehicle control based on the infrastructure characteristics and interactions with other drivers inside an intersection are still lacking. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it proposes an integrated microscopic traffic flow model to describe human-driven vehicle maneuvers under interactions. Drivers plan their heading and acceleration in the predicted future to minimize costs representing undesirable situations. The model works with a joint optimization for an interaction cost term. The weights associated with the interaction cost reflect how selfish or altruistic drivers are. Second, the proposed model endogenously gives the order of vehicles in case of crossing paths. Third, the paper develops a clustered validation method for microscopic traffic flow models with interacting vehicles, which account for interdriver variations. Results show that the model can accurately describe vehicle passing orders of interacting maneuvers, paths, and speeds against empirical data. The model can be applied to assess various intersection designs.

However, the current visual inspection method for identifying and assessing superficial damage on historic buildings is time and labor intensive. In this article, a novel two‐level object detection, segmentation, and measurement strategy for large‐scale structures based on a deep‐learning technique is proposed. The data in this study are from the roof images of the Palace Museum in China. The first level of the model, which is based on the Faster region‐based convolutional neural network (Faster R‐CNN), automatically detects and crops two types of glazed tile photographs from 100 roof images (2,488 × 3,264 pixels). The average precision values (AP) for roll roofing and pan tiles are 0.910 and 0.890, respectively. The cropped images are used to form a dataset for training a Mask R‐CNN model. The second level of the model, which is based on Mask R‐CNN, automatically segments and measures the damage based on the cropped historic tile images; the AP for the damage segmentation is 0.975. Based on Mask R‐CNN, the predicted pixel‐level damage segmentation result is used to quantitatively measure the morphological features of the damage, such as the damage topology, area, and ratio. To verify the performance of the proposed method, a comparative study was conducted with Mask R‐CNN and a fully convolutional network. This is the first attempt at employing a two‐level strategy to automatically detect, segment, and measure large‐scale superficial damage on historic buildings based on deep learning, and it achieved good results.","[{""name"": ""Niannian Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Dalian University of Technology  Dalian China""]}, {""name"": ""Xuefeng Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Dalian University of Technology  Dalian China""]}, {""name"": ""Zheng Zou"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Dalian University of Technology  Dalian China""]}, {""name"": ""Peng Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Architectural Heritage The Palace Museum  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Fei Qi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Architectural Heritage The Palace Museum  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1111/j.1467-8667.1989.tb00026.x"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.04.027"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.23919/ACC.2004.1384458"", ""10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4"", ""10.1177/1475921710388971"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2005.00379.x"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.06.024"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.169"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2014.81"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2017.322"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1126/science.1127647"", ""10.1002/nme.1964"", ""10.1016/j.ndteint.2010.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.06.062"", ""10.3233/ICA-170551"", ""10.1109/CVPRW.2016.98"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.106"", ""10.1111/mice.12313"", ""10.1109/MM.2008.31"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2"", ""10.1109/ICCP.2015.7312681"", ""10.3233/ICA-180577"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00716.x"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2012.00790.x"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2017.05.029"", ""10.3233/ICA-170538"", ""10.1177/1475921710365269"", ""10.1109/TASE.2014.2354314"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.91"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.03.009"", ""10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y"", ""10.1016/j.compag.2006.04.002"", ""10.3233/ICA-180580"", ""10.1111/mice.12411"", ""10.3233/ICA-180560"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000451"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2006.10.002"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1111/mice.12141"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10590-1_53"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.3390/s141019307"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.07.016""]","['Engineering', 'Arts and Humanities', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geology', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Conservation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)]]"

To achieve this, an integrated and expanded user acceptance model is introduced to explain the factors affecting the Behavioral Intention to use the APTS. A total of 316 surveys were conducted, from 275 participants by online surveys and 41 participants by face to face interviews. With the data that are acquired from Public Transportation (PT) users in Istanbul, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) Model is modified and Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, Habit, Trust and Safety, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Risk and Behavioral Intention constructs are utilized in the model. Age, gender and frequency of PT usage are included in the model to examine the moderating effect on the constructs while the model is tested with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The proposed model explains the 72 % of variances in this study which proves that the model has stronger predictive power compared with the previous Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and UTAUT models. Performance Expectancy, Social Influence, Habit, and Trust and Safety constructs are concluded to have significant positive effects on Behavioral Intention. Public usage and acceptance are necessary for the complete utilization of APTS. The findings of these studies are hoped to guide the decision-makers of the PT industry to understand the factors affecting the use and acceptance of APTS and take the actions accordingly.","[{""name"": ""Huseyin Korkmaz"", ""affiliation"": [""Istanbul University""]}, {""name"": ""Akif Fidanoglu"", ""affiliation"": [""Istanbul University""]}, {""name"": ""Salih Ozcelik"", ""affiliation"": [""Istanbul University""]}, {""name"": ""Abdullah Okumus"", ""affiliation"": [""Istanbul University""]}]",[],"['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

With a comprehensive grid search, several stacked models (i.e., chained, parallel) consisting of various machine learning (ML) algorithms and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed to predict the flexural response of SFRC beams. The flexural performance of SFRC beams under bending was assessed based on 193 experimental specimens from real‐life beam models. The ML techniques were applied to predict SFRC beam responses to bending load as functions of the steel fiber properties, concrete elastic modulus, beam dimensions, and reinforcement details. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) of actual versus predicted values. The findings revealed that the proposed technique exhibited notably superior performance, delivering faster and more accurate predictions compared to both the ANNs and parallel models. Shapley diagrams were used to analyze variable contributions quantitatively. Shapley values show that the chained model prediction of ductility index is highly affected by two other targets (peak load and peak deflection) that show the chained algorithm utilizing the prediction of previous steps for enhancing the prediction of the target feature. The proposed model can be viewed as a function of significant input variables that permit the quick assessment of the likely performance of SFRC beams in bending.","[{""name"": ""Torkan Shafighfard"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Fluid Flow Machinery Polish Academy of Sciences Gdańsk Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Farzin Kazemi"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering Gdańsk University of Technology  Gdańsk Poland"", ""Department of Civil, Environmental &amp; Geomatic Engineering University College London London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Faramarz Bagherzadeh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Computer Science University of Bremen Bremen Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Magdalena Mieloszyk"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Fluid Flow Machinery Polish Academy of Sciences Gdańsk Poland""]}, {""name"": ""Doo‐Yeol Yoo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Architecture and Architectural Engineering Yonsei University Seoul South Korea""]}]","[""10.1680/stbu.12.00068"", ""10.1155/2019/8390345"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2005.01.047"", ""10.1016/j.seta.2023.103040"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2022.114575"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.1007/s00158-016-1483-5"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.09.022"", ""10.15632/jtam-pl.55.4.1205"", ""10.1109/TGRS.2023.3334867"", ""10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01537"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2023.110315"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2004)130:3(452)"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2016.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.110926"", ""10.1111/mice.12844"", ""10.1111/mice.12817"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.01.021"", ""10.1111/mice.12564"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2021.12.083"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2022.03.007"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2020.101126"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00752.x"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2012.04.032"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2023.130652"", ""10.1016/j.commatsci.2003.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2019.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.03.225"", ""10.1111/mice.12773"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2022.04.046"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2022.106886"", ""10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100878"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.08.010"", ""10.1111/mice.12915"", ""10.1111/mice.12456"", ""10.1111/mice.12561"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.110927"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.01.008"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2022.114202"", ""10.5772/3162"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.06.003"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.08.032"", ""10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e01655"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2017.05.029"", ""10.1111/mice.12965"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3190448"", ""10.14359/51689360"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2022.11.140"", ""10.1016/j.jmrt.2022.10.153"", ""10.1016/j.addma.2020.101728"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2020.111221"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.12.003"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-45620-0"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2022.09.052"", ""10.1029/2000JD900719"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.05.098"", ""10.1002/suco.201700129"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00449.x"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2010.07.017"", ""10.1155/2018/7390798"", ""10.3390/ma13102225"", ""10.1139/cjce-2015-0384"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.08.099"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.08.029"", ""10.3390/ma15010017"", ""10.1002/suco.201800247"", ""10.1111/mice.12447"", ""10.1111/mice.12753""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1007/s11116-021-10259-4,TRANSPORTATION,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering,Gender differences in active travel in major cities across the world,"AbstractThere is lack of literature on international comparison of gender differences in the use of active travel modes. We used population-representative travel surveys for 19 major cities across 13 countries and 6 continents, representing a mix of cites from low-and-middle income (n = 8) and high-income countries (n = 11). In all the cities, females are more likely than males to walk and, in most cities, more likely to use public transport. This relationship reverses in cycling, with females often less likely users than males. In high cycling cities, both genders are equally likely to cycle. Active travel to access public transport contributes 30–50% of total active travel time. The gender differences in active travel metrics are age dependent. Among children (&lt; 16 years), these metrics are often equal for girls and boys, while gender disparity increases with age. On average, active travel enables one in every four people in the population to achieve at least 30 min of physical activity in a day, though there is large variation across the cities. In general, females are more likely to achieve this level than males. The results highlight the importance of a gendered approach towards active transport policies. Such an approach necessitates reducing road traffic danger and male violence, as well as overcoming social norms that restrict women from cycling.","[{""name"": ""Rahul Goel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oyinlola Oyebode"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Louise Foley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lambed Tatah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Millett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""James Woodcock"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/17450101.2012.696342"", ""10.1080/01441647.2016.1200156"", ""10.1038/s41586-020-2909-1"", ""10.1038/s41562-020-0875-0"", ""10.1080/01441640500175615"", ""10.1016/j.amepre.2005.06.010"", ""10.1136/bjsports-2020-102955"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2007.07.010"", ""10.1057/s41599-020-0500-x"", ""10.1080/01441647.2021.1915898"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102677"", ""10.1111/j.1475-4762.2000.tb00125.x"", ""10.1080/1464936021000032441"", ""10.1007/s11116-006-9105-5"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2011.03.010"", ""10.1093/pubmed/fdy099"", ""10.1111/sms.12581"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.11.003"", ""10.1111/gec3.12461"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102813"", ""10.3390/ijerph9072454"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2012.06.028"", ""10.1123/jpah.2021-0413"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.03.005"", ""10.1007/s11116-021-10228-x"", ""10.1097/HCO.0000000000000437"", ""10.1177/0013916506295571""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

However, both data deficiency and class imbalance hinder the wide adoption of DL in practical applications of SHM. Common mitigation strategies include transfer learning, oversampling, and undersampling, yet these ad hoc methods only provide limited performance boost that varies from one case to another. In this work, we introduce one variant of the generative adversarial network (GAN), named the balanced semisupervised GAN (BSS‐GAN). It adopts the semisupervised learning concept and applies balanced‐batch sampling in training to resolve low‐data and imbalanced‐class problems. A series of computer experiments on concrete cracking and spalling classification were conducted under the low‐data imbalanced‐class regime with limited computing power. The results show that the BSS‐GAN is able to achieve better damage detection in terms of recall and score than other conventional methods, indicating its state‐of‐the‐art performance.","[{""name"": ""Yuqing Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of California  Berkeley California USA"", ""Tsinghua‐Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI) Tsinghua University  Shenzhen China""]}, {""name"": ""Pengyuan Zhai"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of California  Berkeley California USA"", ""Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research University of California  Berkeley California USA""]}, {""name"": ""Khalid M.

Existing approaches mostly capture the static spatial dependency relying on the prior knowledge of the graph structure. However, the spatial dependency can be dynamic, and sometimes the physical structure may not reflect the genuine relationship between roads. To better capture the complex spatial‐temporal dependencies and forecast traffic conditions on road networks, a multi‐step prediction model named Spatial‐Temporal Attention Wavenet (STAWnet) is proposed. Temporal convolution is applied to handle long time sequences, and the dynamic spatial dependencies between different nodes can be captured using the self‐attention network. Different from existing models, STAWnet does not need prior knowledge of the graph by developing a self‐learned node embedding. These components are integrated into an end‐to‐end framework. The experimental results on three public traffic prediction datasets (METR‐LA, PEMS‐BAY, and PEMS07) demonstrate effectiveness. In particular, in the 1 h ahead prediction, STAWnet outperforms state‐of‐the‐art methods with no prior knowledge of the network.","[{""name"": ""Chenyu Tian"", ""affiliation"": [""Tsinghua‐Berkeley Shenzhen Institute Tsinghua Univeristy Shenzhen 510006 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Wai Kin (Victor) Chan"", ""affiliation"": [""Tsinghua‐Berkeley Shenzhen Institute Tsinghua Univeristy Shenzhen 510006 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1080/01441647.2018.1442887"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i01.5477"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/505"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2019/264"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2935152"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.039"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2247040"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2262376"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2019.03.007"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5530"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.014"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5511"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2522428"", ""10.3390/s17040818"", ""10.1177/1550147719847440"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2924971"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33015668"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0008"", ""10.1109/TITS.2020.2993798"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0873"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.102665"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.008"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.03.001"", ""10.1145/3340531.3411940"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2488593"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.01082"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2258916"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70139-4""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Signal Processing', 'Building and Construction', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

However, it is time‐consuming and uneconomical to label the collected images. Hence, it is desired to train an accurate classifier with only a small amount of labeled data. Therefore, this study proposes a semi‐supervised learning algorithm that uses only a small amount of labeled data for training, but still achieves high classification accuracy. In addition, based on the mean teacher algorithm, this study develops a novel uncertainty filter to select reliable unlabeled data for initial training epochs to further improve the classification accuracy. Validation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the model accuracy from 79.26% to 84.36% compared to the traditional supervised learning algorithm with 10% of labeled data in a dataset. From another perspective, compared to supervised learning algorithm, the proposed technique can help reduce the time and cost for preparing the labeled data.","[{""name"": ""Jingjing Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Building, School of Design and Environment National University of Singapore  Singapore Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Qian Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Building, School of Design and Environment National University of Singapore  Singapore Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Yiting Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering National University of Singapore  Singapore Singapore""]}]","[""10.1145/279943.279962"", ""10.1109/TSP.2014.2313528"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.006"", ""10.1142/7566"", ""10.3390/s19245501"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000206"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848"", ""10.1016/j.optlaseng.2019.01.011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.02.013"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103310"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.10.057"", ""10.1111/mice.12578"", ""10.1016/j.optlaseng.2019.06.020"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.04.019"", ""10.1111/mice.12519"", ""10.1007/s00591-010-0080-8"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.01.017"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.04.195"", ""10.1142/S0129065719500102"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.04.013"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2017.2712560"", ""10.3233/ICA-180577"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.01145"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.08.002"", ""10.1109/IISA.2017.8316454"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.1007/s11263-019-01228-7"", ""10.3390/ICEM18-05387"", ""10.1007/s13042-015-0328-7"", ""10.3233/ICA-180580"", ""10.1007/s10994-019-05855-6"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2624938"", ""10.3233/ICA-180560"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2012.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102967"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2017.09.043""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

In order to reduce the labor cost in field detection, researchers have proposed a variety of deep learning (DL)‐based detection techniques for crack recognition. However, some problems still exist in extending these techniques to practical applications, such as data annotation difficulty, limited model generalization ability, and inaccuracy of the DL identification of the actual crack width measurement. In this paper, an application‐oriented multistage crack recognition framework is proposed, namely, Convolutional Active Learning Identification‐Segmentation‐Measurement (CAL‐ISM). It includes four steps: (1) pretraining of the benchmark classification model, (2) retraining of the semisupervised active learning model, (3) pixel‐level crack segmentation, and (4) crack width measurement. Beyond numerical experiments, the performance of the CAL‐ISM is validated for practical applications: (i) bridge column test specimen and (ii) field BHM projects. In conclusion, the obtained results from these applications shed light on the high potential of CAL‐ISM for BHM applications, which is recommended in future deployments for BHM.","[{""name"": ""Yue Zheng"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Bridge Engineering Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center University of California Berkeley California USA""]}, {""name"": ""Yuqing Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of California Berkeley California USA"", ""Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center University of California Berkeley California USA""]}, {""name"": ""Shiyuan Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Bridge Engineering Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Khalid M.

The reference pitch angle and yaw angle are designed in kinematics, based on the time‐varying reference trajectory. Dynamics controllers are developed by incorporating the first‐order filter into the dynamic surface control (DSC), which simplifies the design process and overcome differential explosion in the traditional backstepping. To reduce the influence of the complex unknowns, an adaptive fuzzy‐based DSC scheme is employed to identify the lumped disturbances with arbitrary accuracy and further enhance system robustness. Lyapunov stability analysis demonstrates that tracking errors are bounded and converge to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of zero. Finally, simulation studies and comparisons with DSC scheme are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.","[{""name"": ""Xiao Liang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian Maritime University Dalian Liaoning Province People's Republic of China"", ""Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Technology Harbin Heilongjiang Province People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Xingru Qu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian Maritime University Dalian Liaoning Province People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Ning Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Marine Electrical Engineering, Dalian Maritime University Dalian Liaoning Province People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Rubo Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Dalian Minzu University Dalian Liaoning Province People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Ye Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian Maritime University Dalian Liaoning Province People's Republic of China"", ""Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Technology Harbin Heilongjiang Province People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.margeo.2014.03.012"", ""10.1002/asjc.439"", ""10.1007/s12555-011-0408-8"", ""10.1109/TII.2019.2953973"", ""10.1109/TIE.2015.2477270"", ""10.1007/s40815-017-0386-y"", ""10.1007/s10846-017-0703-6"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2004.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2010.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2015.06.022"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.034"", ""10.1007/s40435-017-0387-6"", ""10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2697399"", ""10.1007/s11370-018-0263-z"", ""10.1007/s11071-015-2551-x"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2016.10.032"", ""10.1002/asjc.840"", ""10.1049/iet-cta.2009.0265"", ""10.1177/1729881418806811"", ""10.1109/TVT.2019.2927893"", ""10.1155/2018/9617410"", ""10.1109/TII.2018.2877046"", ""10.1109/TII.2019.2953973"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.02.017"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2019.2906395"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2016.10.018"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2015.2451116"", ""10.1109/TFUZZ.2018.2838552"", ""10.1016/j.jfranklin.2011.09.015"", ""10.1109/TNS.2015.2464677"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2009.04.004"", ""10.1109/CCDC.2008.4598252"", ""10.1177/1729881417724179""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour, among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning. Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification. This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts: Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.","[{""name"": ""Tarek R.

In this paper, a method of simultaneous and continuous estimation of the forces of multiple cables using a self‐developed microwave interferometric radar was proposed. In the proposed approach, first, the time‐varying modal frequencies are identified by the Hilbert transform algorithm from the displacements of multiple cables, which are monitored by the self‐developed radar, and then, the time‐varying cable forces are obtained by the vibration method. In addition, for the problem of multiple cables located in the same range bin when distance test or the test angle is nonideal, a single‐channel blind source separation algorithm based on vibrational mode decomposition (VMD) and time‐frequency analysis was proposed to separate the cable signals. Furthermore, a method based on the spectrum correlation coefficients was proposed to determine the number of decomposition layers in VMD. The “Nanjing Eye” cable‐stayed footbridge was used to conduct field measurement to validate the proposed method. Field measurement results show a good agreement with reference measurements, which demonstrate that the proposed method can perform well in an actual project for portable and rapid cable force estimation.","[{""name"": ""Wenju Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Southeast University  Nanjing China""]}, {""name"": ""Guangwei Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Southeast University  Nanjing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jian Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Engineering Mechanics Southeast University  Nanjing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.dsp.2015.06.013"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.05.054"", ""10.1016/j.ndteint.2011.04.001"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-04774-4_7"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000421"", ""10.1109/TSP.2013.2288675"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2016.12.020"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0001002"", ""10.3390/rs2010036"", ""10.1016/j.ndteint.2009.11.007"", ""10.1080/15732470903068557"", ""10.1002/stc.435"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00732.x"", ""10.12989/sss.2012.9.6.473"", ""10.1007/s13349-017-0226-7"", ""10.12989/sss.2011.7.4.303"", ""10.1016/j.optlaseng.2009.04.016"", ""10.1002/stc.1634"", ""10.1002/tal.1312"", ""10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2464240"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2014.04.019"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2017.07.043"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/25/5/055008"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)SU.1943-5428.0000146"", ""10.1016/j.ndteint.2004.06.012"", ""10.1002/stc.2286"", ""10.1111/mice.12528"", ""10.21595/jve.2016.17220"", ""10.21307/acee-2016-055"", ""10.1002/stc.2044"", ""10.12989/sss.2010.6.3.309"", ""10.1111/mice.12355"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2018.10.018"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0001337"", ""10.1111/mice.12303"", ""10.1111/mice.12372"", ""10.3390/app7040414"", ""10.1111/mice.12338"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.09.060"", ""10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.02.020"", ""10.1162/089976601300014385""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Accurate identification of crack existence and quantification of crack geometry are thus critical for the decision‐making of maintenance measures. This paper proposes a novel neural network for the detection and evaluation of road cracks at pixel level, which combines the advantage of encoding–decoding network and attention mechanism and can thus extract the crack pixels more accurately and efficiently. The proposed network achieves an excellent detection performance with IOU = 92.85%, precision = 96.90%, recall = 95.36%, F1 = 95.53%. Compared with the other advanced networks, the accuracy of the proposed method is substantially enhanced. The quantitative estimation of key geometrical features of cracks including length, width, and area is successfully realized with the development of a prototype of an intelligent mobile system. Compared with the ground truth, the maximum crack width shows the lowest relative error rate, which ranges −31.75%∼28.57%.","[{""name"": ""Jun Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation Science and Engineering Beihang University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Ye He"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation Science and Engineering Beihang University  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.1109/ISPA.2019.8868619"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.1986.4767851"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.3390/app10228089"", ""10.1111/mice.12564"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00065"", ""10.1111/mice.12550"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103176"", ""10.1111/mice.12519"", ""10.1080/15732479.2011.593891"", ""10.3390/s20030717"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.1111/mice.12622"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.04.005"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.1177/0361198120907283"", ""10.1111/exsy.12647"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00716.x"", ""10.1159/000512985"", ""10.1111/mice.12532"", ""10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103357"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001047"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1016/S0146-664X(77)80024-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28"", ""10.1109/RCAE51546.2020.9294343"", ""10.1002/ecj.10151"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1061/9780784413623.088"", ""10.1111/mice.12141"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.1109/ICIP.2016.7533052"", ""10.1145/357994.358023""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"
10.1186/s12544-020-00427-5,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,0823 Transportation Engineering,Multimodal warning design for take-over request in conditionally automated driving,"Abstract Purpose Humans are required to respond to a vehicle’s request to take-over anytime even when they are not responsible for monitoring driving environments in automated driving, e.g., a SAE level-3 vehicle. Thus, a safe and effective delivery of a take-over request from an automated vehicle to a human is critical for the successful commercialization of automated vehicles. Methods In the current study, a set of human-in-the-loop experiments was conducted to compare diverse warning combinations by applying visual, auditory, and haptic modalities under systematically classified take-over request scenarios in conditionally automated driving. Forty-one volunteers consisting of 16 females and 25 males participated in the study. Vehicle and human data on response to take-over request were collected in two take-over scenarios, i.e., a disabled vehicle on the road ahead and a highway exit. Results Visual-auditory-haptic modal combination showed the best performance in both human behavioral and physiological data and visual-auditory warning in vehicle data. Visual-auditory-haptic warning combination showed the best performance when considering all performance indices. Meanwhile, visual-only warning, which is considered as a basic modality in manual driving, performed the worst in the conditionally automated driving situation. Conclusions These findings imply that the warning design in automated vehicles must be clearly differentiated from that of conventional manual driving vehicles. Future work shall include a follow-up experiment to verify the study results and compare more diverse multimodal combinations.","[{""name"": ""Hanna Yun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ji Hyun Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.7717/peerj-cs.13"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2018.04.001"", ""10.1145/3003715.3005409"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2011.02.001"", ""10.1177/1541931213571433"", ""10.1177/1541931213601971"", ""10.1109/THMS.2017.2674998"", ""10.1007/s12239-020-0074-z"", ""10.5143/JESK.2019.38.3.265"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2015.04.014"", ""10.2466/pms.108.3.825-835"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.788"", ""10.7467/KSAE.2019.27.4.309"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2017.02.023"", ""10.13140/2.1.4592.3842"", ""10.1111/j.1751-5823.2010.00122_6.x"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49448-7_11"", ""10.1145/2799250.2799267"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2018.11.018"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92285-0_57""]","['Engineering', 'Psychology']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"

In particular, a stacked convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is introduced and trained on an in‐house visual dataset from Hurricane Dorian. To account for the ordinality of damage level classes, the cross‐entropy classification loss function is replaced with the square of earth mover's distance (EMD2) loss. The trained model achieves 65.6% building localization precision and 61% (90% considering ±1 class deviation from ground‐truth) classification accuracy. It also exhibits a positive accuracy–confidence correlation, which is valuable for model assessment in situations where ground‐truth information is not readily available. Finally, the outcome of damage assessment is compared with the literature by examining the relationship between building size and number of stories, and severity of induced disaster damage.","[{""name"": ""Chih‐Shen Cheng"", ""affiliation"": [""Zachry Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering Texas A&amp;M University  College Station TX USA""]}, {""name"": ""Amir H.

Although it has been expected that machine learning could be applied to this problem, inspection data sparsely distributed over time are not suitable for machine learning in contrast to the continuous big data usually targeted. This study applies machine learning to a regression model of crack formation and propagation using inspection data to confirm the applicability. It includes the selection of the optimal algorithm, development of the model based on a novel methodology, and factor analysis using the model. Accordingly, the model was constructed by Gaussian process regression and it could appropriately extract the differences in the progress of crack damage due to multiple influential factors. The results demonstrate the excellent applicability of machine learning even to sparse data.","[{""name"": ""Yuriko Okazaki"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Engineering and Design (Kagawa University)  Hayashi‐cho Takamatsu‐shi Kagawa Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Shinichiro Okazaki"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Engineering and Design (Kagawa University)  Hayashi‐cho Takamatsu‐shi Kagawa Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Shingo Asamoto"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Science and Engineering (Saitama University)  Shimo‐Okubo, Sakura‐ku, Saitama‐shi Saitama Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Pang‐jo Chun"", ""affiliation"": [""Graduate School of Engineering (The University of Tokyo)  Hongo, Bunkyo‐ku Tokyo Japan""]}]","[""10.1111/0885-9507.00219"", ""10.1080/07474938.2010.481556"", ""10.1007/s00330-019-06170-3"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/24/6/065034"", ""10.1214/09-SS054"", ""10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.03.003"", ""10.1016/0950-0618(95)00092-5"", ""10.1007/978-0-387-45528-0"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000591"", ""10.1109/IITA.2009.252"", ""10.2166/hydro.2010.032"", ""10.1613/jair.953"", ""10.1145/1007730.1007733"", ""10.3390/ma11112167"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(01)00319-8"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.04.004"", ""10.1561/2000000039"", ""10.3390/app8091470"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2004)130:5(562)"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2008.08.008"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2014.08.029"", ""10.1617/s11527-012-0009-x"", ""10.3141/2283-03"", ""10.1155/2018/5157824"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.039"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2009.10.012"", ""10.1111/1468-0084.00173"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2008.02.008"", ""10.1162/neco.1992.4.3.415"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.3151/jact.1.91"", ""10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.02.003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3828(2006)20:2(146)"", ""10.1016/j.coastaleng.2015.11.010"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2010.12.004"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00716.x"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2017.05.029"", ""10.1007/s41024-016-0019-0"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2002)14:4(327)"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.10.065"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2008.01.014"", ""10.1109/TASE.2014.2354314"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2008.00572.x"", ""10.1016/S0169-7161(04)24011-1"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.01.016"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.09.058"", ""10.3151/jact.15.328"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.08.022"", ""10.1111/exsy.12081"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2006.11.010"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1994)120:7(2123)"", ""10.1007/s11269-015-0962-6"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.03.038"", ""10.1109/IITA.2009.469"", ""10.1007/s00138-009-0189-8"", ""10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00503.x""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

In this paper, we present our analysis about commuting travels of the responses between 23 March and 12 May 2020 from the fourteen countries with 100 or more responses, namely Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Thailand, and the UK. Home office is used typically by between 40% and 60% of working respondents. Among people with workplaces with possibility for home office, the percentage is between 60% and 80%. Among people with workplaces where presence is essential, the percentage does not typically go beyond 30%. This result potentially implies an ultimate magnitude of a strong home office measure. Among those who continued to commute but switched commuting transport modes from public transport to others, the COVID-19 infection risk in public transport is the reason that is most often referred to, but many of those who changed to private cars and to bicycles report reduced travel time, too. Measures to encourage the use of active travel modes where possible are strongly recommended, as this would potentially mitigate undesirable modal shift towards private motorized modes triggered by perception of infection risks while travelling with public transport.","[{""name"": ""Takeru Shibayama"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Fabian Sandholzer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Barbara Laa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tadej Brezina"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],"['Environmental Science', 'Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Transportation']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

Unlike research on many other learning models, the goal of this study is to identify damage with a localization accuracy down to the single structural element, rather than limiting the evaluation to the story scale. The SHM methodology herein discussed, denoted as D2‐DTE, is based on decision trees ensemble and belongs to the class of vibration‐based approaches, being the health assessment of the structure obtained by analyzing dynamic properties of the structural system, namely, mode shapes and natural frequencies. The proposed damage detection method is validated for three different test cases, including both numerical simulations and experimentally recorded data, which consider a wide array of damage configurations, including single and multiple damages; different damage types and severities; and the presence of random noise levels associated with dynamic properties acquisition. The performances of the D2‐DTE are evaluated in terms of accuracy, confidence of probabilistic predictions, and measurements of physical distances in localization errors.

Basically, there are no procedures or guidelines for designing the mega elliptical roundabout in the Highway Capacity Manual, Federal Highway Administration guides or the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' ‘Green Book’. This research therefore presents the best geometric design scenarios of mega elliptical roundabout intersections at various traffic flows for all intersection entrances. The basis for selecting the best scenarios is to achieve minimum delay time, minimum emissions and minimum fuel consumption. This was studied at the intersection of a six-lane divided highway with a four-lane divided highway when the traffic enters from four approaches. Moreover, this research proposes the cases in which the mega elliptical roundabout is better than an interchange (full cloverleaf), and suggests the best time to make a decision to change from a mega elliptical roundabout to an interchange (full cloverleaf). The study was conducted by using Vissim software (version 10.00-02). In total, 1134 scenarios were analysed.","[{""name"": ""Ahmed I. Z.

Gasol offers a wide variety of cost models that allow inferring the gas consumption associated to selected types of EVM instructions and/or inferring the number of times that such types of bytecode instructions are executed. Among others, we have cost models to measure only storage opcodes, to measure a selected family of gas-consumption opcodes following the Ethereum’s classification, to estimate the cost of a selected program line, etc. After choosing the desired cost model and the function of interest, Gasol returns to the user an upper bound of the cost for this function. As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions that access the storage, Gasol uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the selected function. Our tool can be used within an Eclipse plugin for which displays the gas and instructions bounds and, when applicable, the gas-optimized function.","[{""name"": ""Elvira Albert"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jesús Correas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pablo Gordillo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guillermo Román-Díez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Albert Rubio"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-642-54862-8_46"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-69166-2_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_30"", ""10.1145/3167084"", ""10.1145/2993600.2993611"", ""10.1007/3-540-49059-0_14"", ""10.1109/SANER.2017.7884650"", ""10.1145/3276486"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89722-6_10"", ""10.1145/3158136"", ""10.14722/ndss.2018.23082"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330560"", ""10.1145/2976749.2978309"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03427-6_33"", ""10.1145/3274694.3274743"", ""10.1145/3360611"", ""10.1145/3243734.3243780""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Information Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

In this study, we propose to use AVs for solving the first‐mile (FM) problem that aims to transport passengers from their homes to metro stations. Passengers submit travel requests in advance and a fleet operator dispatches AVs and arranges ridesharing in a rolling horizon framework. The ridesharing is implemented by assigning one AV to serve several requests subject to the vehicle capacity, the maximum travel time, and the accessibility constraints. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to determine the AV dispatch and ridesharing schemes for the minimum operational costs. Then, another MILP model with the objective of the maximum user satisfaction is formulated for the purpose of comparison. A cluster‐based solution method is designed to deal with the large‐scale FM problem. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. Results show that ridesharing can reduce both required AV fleet size and vehicle traveled miles. The proposed solution method is able to solve the problem efficiently and fulfil the requirement of online computation.","[{""name"": ""Shukai Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering National University of Singapore  Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Hua Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering National University of Singapore  Singapore"", ""School of Economics and Management Tongji University  Shanghai 200092 China""]}, {""name"": ""Qiang Meng"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering National University of Singapore  Singapore""]}]","[""10.1073/pnas.1611675114"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.06.014"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2008.10.003"", ""10.1287/trsc.1030.0056"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2004.07.077"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.12.001"", ""10.1007/s11116-016-9729-z"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00150"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.05.003"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2490800"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2513071"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2016.05.006"", ""10.1111/mice.12308"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.04.079"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.08.022"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.01.004"", ""10.1287/trsc.2017.0744"", ""10.1007/s12469-010-0016-7"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2011.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2011.07.001"", ""10.1287/trsc.2014.0524"", ""10.1287/trsc.1090.0272"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2018.04.004"", ""10.1038/s41586-018-0095-1"", ""10.1287/trsc.2017.0753"", ""10.1287/trsc.2014.0553"", ""10.1111/mice.12368"", ""10.1177/0278364915581863""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Marketing']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

Although it has vast potential in several applications, it has several challenges in the real‐world. One of the most important challenges is conservation of battery life in devices used throughout IoT networks. Since many IoT devices are not rechargeable, several steps to conserve the battery life of an IoT network can be taken using the early prediction of battery life. In this study, a machine learning based model implementing a random forest regression algorithm is used to predict the battery life of IoT devices. The proposed model is experimented on ‘Beach Water Quality – Automated Sensors’ data set generated from sensors in an IoT network from the city of Chicago, USA. Several pre‐processing techniques like normalisation, transformation and dimensionality reduction are used in this model. The proposed model achieved a 97% predictive accuracy. The results obtained proved that the proposed model performs better than other state‐of‐art regression algorithms in preserving the battery life of IoT devices.","[{""name"": ""Praveen Kumar Reddy Maddikunta"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Technology and Engineering VIT ‐ Vellore Tamilnadu India""]}, {""name"": ""Gautam Srivastava"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Computer Science Brandon University Brandon MB R7A 6A9 Canada"", ""Research Center for Interneural Computing, China Medical University Taichung 40402 Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Thippa Reddy Gadekallu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Technology and Engineering VIT ‐ Vellore Tamilnadu India""]}, {""name"": ""Natarajan Deepa"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Technology and Engineering VIT ‐ Vellore Tamilnadu India""]}, {""name"": ""Prabadevi Boopathy"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Information Technology and Engineering VIT ‐ Vellore Tamilnadu India""]}]","[""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923916"", ""10.1007/s11276-018-1759-3"", ""10.1007/s12243-018-00701-7"", ""10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.010"", ""10.1002/spe.2797"", ""10.3390/app9050848"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2852329"", ""10.3390/s18030878"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2799210"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2019.2952721"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2019.2949088"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2019.04.003"", ""10.1109/JIOT.2018.2823498"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.106537"", ""10.1145/3277883.3277892"", ""10.1109/MNET.001.1900179"", ""10.1109/TII.2019.2917307"", ""10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.02.010"", ""10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164978"", ""10.1109/ICOIN.2015.7057878"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980942"", ""10.1145/3131542.3131544"", ""10.1016/j.comcom.2020.02.065"", ""10.3390/s17092008"", ""10.1049/iet-com.2015.0223"", ""10.1109/ICSENS.2012.6411521"", ""10.23919/VLSIC.2017.8008550"", ""10.1109/TELFOR.2017.8249406"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.08.066"", ""10.1109/AERO.2008.4526631"", ""10.1109/CSE.2009.83"", ""10.1109/IECON.2011.6119679"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2606541"", ""10.1109/TGCN.2018.2801725"", ""10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102379"", ""10.3390/su9040673"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2890685"", ""10.1038/s41560-019-0356-8"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2805189"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.523"", ""10.1109/PERCOMW.2011.5766869"", ""10.3390/genes9020104""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

Monitoring of the struck‐by hazards in terms of spatial relationship between a worker and a heavy vehicle is crucial to prevent such accidents. The computer vision‐based technique has been put forward for monitoring the struck‐by hazards but there exists shortages such as spatial relationship distortion due to two‐dimensional (2D) image pixels‐based estimation and self‐occlusion of heavy vehicles. This study is aimed to address these problems, including the detection of workers and heavy vehicles, three‐dimensional (3D) bounding box reconstruction for the detected objects, depth and range estimation in the monocular 2D vision, and 3D spatial relationship recognition. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed method is expected to estimate 3D spatial relationship between construction worker and heavy vehicle in a real‐time and view‐invariant manner, thus enhancing struck‐by hazards monitoring at the construction site.","[{""name"": ""Xuzhong Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Institute of Construction Management Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Hong Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Institute of Construction Management Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Heng Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Faculty of Construction and Environment, Department of Building and Real Estate The Hong Kong Polytechnic University  Hong Kong China""]}]","[""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.691"", ""10.1061/9780784413029.070"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.304"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001118"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.018"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.03.008"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511811685"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1142/S160994510300025X"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.12.014"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000562"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2017.06.014"", ""10.1109/IROS.2018.8594049"", ""10.1111/mice.12351"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1061/9780784413616.194"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000756"", ""10.1111/mice.12419"", ""10.1111/mice.12387"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001031"", ""10.18517/ijaseit.7.3.2176"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2012.02.011"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.594"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995316"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000332"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.695"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2010.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2015.09.003"", ""10.3233/ICA-180580"", ""10.3233/ICA-180560"", ""10.1061/9780784412329.087"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2012.10.010"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2017.11.001"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000602"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2016.04.009""]","['Engineering', 'Health Professions']","['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Radiological and Ultrasound Technology', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7248), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7169), ('1003 口腔医学', 0.7153), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7145), ('1011 护理学', 0.711)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0804 仪器科学与技术', 0.7506), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7409)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

However, some problems associated with pipeline defect detection, such as data scarcity and defect counting difficulty, need to be addressed. Therefore, a Transformer‐optimized generation, detection, and counting method for drainage‐pipeline defects was established in this paper. First, a generation network called Trans‐GAN‐Cla was developed for data augmentation. A classification network was trained to improve the quality of the generated images. Second, a detection and tracking model called Trans‐Det‐Tra was developed to track and count the number of defects. Third, the feature extraction capability of the proposed method was improved by leveraging Transformers. Compared with some well‐known convolutional neural network‐based methods, the proposed network achieved the best classification and detection accuracies of 87.2% and 87.57%, respectively. Furthermore, the F1 scores were 87.7% and 91.9%. Finally, two pieces of onsite videos were detected and tracked, and the numbers of misalignments and obstacles were accurately counted. The results indicate that the established Transformer‐optimized method can generate high‐quality images and realize the high‐accuracy detection and counting of drainage pipeline defects.","[{""name"": ""Duo Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""Yellow River Laboratory Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China"", ""National Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Major Infrastructure Testing and Rehabilitation Technology Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongyuan Fang"", ""affiliation"": [""Yellow River Laboratory Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China"", ""National Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Major Infrastructure Testing and Rehabilitation Technology Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Niannian Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Yellow River Laboratory Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China"", ""National Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Major Infrastructure Testing and Rehabilitation Technology Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongfang Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Southeast University  Nanjing China""]}, {""name"": ""John Matthews"", ""affiliation"": [""Trenchless Technology Center Louisiana Tech University  Ruston Louisiana USA""]}, {""name"": ""Chao Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Yellow River Laboratory Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China"", ""National Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Major Infrastructure Testing and Rehabilitation Technology Zhengzhou University  Zhengzhou China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.compag.2021.106279"", ""10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.09.017"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/24/6/065034"", ""10.3233/ICA-210652"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2001)15:1(4)"", ""10.1142/S0129065722500381"", ""10.18653/v1/D16-1053"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.006"", ""10.1111/mice.12793"", ""10.1111/mice.12458"", ""10.3233/ICA-210649"", ""10.3233/ICA-200634"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.169"", ""10.3233/ICA-210651"", ""10.1109/TMI.2020.3035253"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2008.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2013.10.012"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102849"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.2175/193864717822156686"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2020.103677"", ""10.3390/rs13050988"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00445.x"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2764861"", ""10.1145/3065386"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.03.028"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000866"", ""10.1142/S0129065721300011"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.01.017"", ""10.3233/ICA-210655"", ""10.3390/sym12040651"", ""10.1109/ICDAR.2017.181"", ""10.1080/14680629.2021.1925578"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.125385"", ""10.1111/mice.12561"", ""10.1142/S012906572150060X"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119397"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.04.013"", ""10.1016/S0926-5805(99)00007-2"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.artmed.2021.102020"", ""10.1111/mice.12792"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.10.065"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001047"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.05.013"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103256"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2005.02.006"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2018.11.083"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.04.116"", ""10.1186/s40537-021-00508-9"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.308"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298594"", ""10.1109/TMI.2016.2535302"", ""10.1016/j.compag.2017.01.001"", ""10.3390/s20123336"", ""10.1111/mice.12481"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103438"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2021.103840"", ""10.1111/mice.12488"", ""10.1016/S0031-3203(97)00037-X"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2020.103524"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1007/s00521-020-05171-4"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.1111/mice.12409"", ""10.3233/ICA-200626"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1920/1/012058"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2020.3004555""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

In this study, a structural displacement estimation technique was developed by fusing asynchronous acceleration and computer vision measurements using a Kalman filter. First, the scale factor, which converts translation from vision measurements (in pixel units) into displacement (in length units), is automatically computed using a natural target (i.e., without any artificial target or any prior knowledge of the target size). Second, an improved feature matching algorithm was developed to better trace the natural target within the computer vision. Third, an adaptive multirate Kalman filter was formulated such that asynchronous computer vision and acceleration measurements with different sampling rates could be seamlessly combined to improve displacement estimation. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed displacement estimation technique were validated by performing shaking table, four‐story building model, and steel box girder pedestrian bridge tests. In all tests, the proposed technique was able to accurately estimate displacements with root mean square errors of less than 3 mm.","[{""name"": ""Zhanxiong Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  Yuseong‐gu Daejeon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Jaemook Choi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  Yuseong‐gu Daejeon Republic of Korea""]}, {""name"": ""Hoon Sohn"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  Yuseong‐gu Daejeon Republic of Korea""]}]","[""10.1109/PESGM.2017.8273755"", ""10.1111/mice.12530"", ""10.1007/11744023_32"", ""10.1002/9780470978160"", ""10.12989/sss.2010.6.9.1025"", ""10.1177/1475921718806895"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000765"", ""10.1002/stc.1829"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000747"", ""10.1145/358669.358692"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2007.00536.x"", ""10.1002/stc.2209"", ""10.1080/15732479.2016.1164729"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.09.014"", ""10.12989/sss.2016.17.4.647"", ""10.1002/nme.2769"", ""10.1016/j.ndteint.2005.12.003"", ""10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94"", ""10.1111/mice.12415"", ""10.1002/stc.2733"", ""10.1007/s001900050236"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000726"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2000)126:12(1413)"", ""10.1111/mice.12505"", ""10.1016/j.ndteint.2004.06.012"", ""10.1111/mice.12549"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00466.x"", ""10.1111/mice.12210"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2013.2275187"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2004.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2014.09.063"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2006.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2016.10.026"", ""10.1111/mice.12481"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2007.00489.x"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0001330"", ""10.1002/stc.1850"", ""10.1111/mice.12338"", ""10.1111/mice.12499"", ""10.1111/mice.12500"", ""10.1111/mice.12241""]","['Engineering', 'Earth and Planetary Sciences']","['Geology', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7517), ('0709 地质学', 0.7482)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Considering the spatial randomness of system properties in geometry, physics and mechanics, the primary work is therefore simulating the uncertainties realistically, representatively and efficiently. With regard to the track irregularity simulation, a model is newly developed to obtain random sample sets of track irregularities by transforming its power spectral density function into the equivalent track quality index for representation based on the discrete Parseval theorem, where the correlation between various types of track irregularities is accounted for. To statistically clarify the uncertainty of track properties in physics and mechanics in space, a model combining discrete element method and finite element method is developed to obtain the spatially varied track parametric characteristics, e.g. track stiffness and density, through which the highly expensive experiments in situ can be avoided. Finally a train–track stochastic analysis model is formulated by integrating the system uncertainties into the dynamics model. Numerical examples have validated the accuracy and efficiency of this model and illustrated the effects of system spatial variability on train–track vibrations comprehensively.","[{""name"": ""Lei Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wanming Zhai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.apm.2017.06.027"", ""10.1016/j.probengmech.2013.08.006"", ""10.1080/00423119508969632"", ""10.1080/00423119608969194"", ""10.1080/00423114.2002.11666248"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2003.06.033"", ""10.1016/S0266-8920(03)00012-2"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.02.084"", ""10.1002/nme.1620330906"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0207(19991110)46:7<1031::AID-NME738>3.0.CO;2-V"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1605085"", ""10.1115/1.4040254"", ""10.1007/978-981-32-9283-3"", ""10.1080/00423110802621561"", ""10.1080/23248378.2018.1503975"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2010.10.007"", ""10.1115/1.3629610"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2004.03.032"", ""10.1016/j.apm.2019.04.037"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.105894"", ""10.1080/00423117908968610"", ""10.1115/1.3629610"", ""10.7498/aps.61.220204"", ""10.1680/geot.1979.29.1.47"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0000871"", ""10.1080/00423119808969553"", ""10.1076/vesd.37.1.59.3538""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

While a clause expresses that at least one literal must be true, a cardinality constraint expresses that at least n literals must be true and a pseudo-Boolean constraint states that a weighted sum of literals must be greater than a constant. These contraints have a high expressive power, have been intensively studied in 0/1 programming and are close enough to the satisfiability problem to benefit from the recents advances in this field. Besides, optimization problems are naturally expressed in the pseudo-Boolean context. This chapter presents the inference rules on pseudo-Boolean constraints and demonstrates their increased inference power in comparison with resolution. It also shows how the modern satisfiability algorithms can be extended to deal with pseudo-Boolean constraints.","[{""name"": ""Olivier Roussel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Vasco Manquinho"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Computer Science'],"['Computer Networks and Communications', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

In this study, an integration of a fully convolutional network with a Gaussian‐conditional random field (G‐CRF), an uncertainty framework, and probability‐based rejection is proposed for detecting pavement defects. First, a fully convolutional network is designed to generate preliminary segmentation results, and a G‐CRF is used to refine the segmentation. Second, epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in the model and database are considered to overcome the disadvantages of traditional deep‐learning methods. Last, probability‐based rejection is conducted to remove unreasonable segmentations. The proposed method is evaluated on a data set of images that were obtained from 16 highways. The proposed integration segments pavement distresses from digital images with desirable performance. It also provides a satisfactory means to improve the accuracy and generalization performance of pavement defect detection without introducing a delay into the segmentation process.","[{""name"": ""Zheng Tong"", ""affiliation"": [""Sorbonne Université Université de Technologie de Compiègne, CNRS  Compiègne cedex France""]}, {""name"": ""Dongdong Yuan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Highway Chang'an University  Xi'an China""]}, {""name"": ""Jie Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation and Logistics East China Jiaotong University  Nanchang China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhenjun Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Materials Science and Engineering Chang'an University  Xi'an China""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2003)17:4(255)"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00189"", ""10.1137/080734510"", ""10.1287/ijoo.2019.0011"", ""10.1111/mice.12263"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46478-7_25"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2699184"", ""10.1111/mice.12495"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2325029"", ""10.5120/17723-8018"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-48308-5_54"", ""10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4"", ""10.1145/2671188.2749408"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.169"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2437384"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.10.123"", ""10.1145/2647868.2654889"", ""10.1177/1475921718768747"", ""10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.01.013"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1109/DCABES.2010.115"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.04.050"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298965"", ""10.3233/ICA-180577"", ""10.1007/s10071-007-0071-x"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.01.089"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.550"", ""10.1016/j.neunet.2016.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.ijar.2018.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2016.10.049"", ""10.1080/14680629.2017.1308265"", ""10.1111/mice.12406"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.04.097"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.02.081"", ""10.1016/j.ijar.2017.10.028"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.357"", ""10.1111/mice.12411"", ""10.3233/ICA-180560"", ""10.1016/j.image.2018.08.003"", ""10.1111/mice.12319"", ""10.1111/mice.12367"", ""10.1007/s00138-009-0189-8"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.1109/ICIVC.2016.7571265"", ""10.1016/j.patrec.2011.11.004""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

A You Only Look Once v4 (YOLOv4) network was used to detect multicategory damage (fine crack, wide crack, concrete spalling, exposed rebar and buckled rebar). Depthwise separable convolution was introduced into YOLOv4 to decrease the computation cost without reducing accuracy. Finally, the damage detection method and assessment method were integrated within a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate the post‐earthquake reinforced concrete (RC) structural damage assessment. The test results by GUI indicate that the improved object network can get accurate detection results, and the preliminary safety assessment method can judge the damage level and failure mode.

However, it is difficult to achieve self‐learning and learning from human experience with manual as well as automated design methods. Also, many existing approaches require predefined numbers of horizontal points of intersection or vertical points of intersection as input. To address these issues, this study employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize mountainous railway alignments with the goal of minimizing construction costs. First, in the DRL model, the state of the railway alignment optimization environment is determined, and the action and reward function of the optimization agent are defined along with the corresponding alignment constraints. Second, we integrate a recent DRL algorithm called the deep deterministic policy gradient with optional human experience to obtain the final optimized railway alignment, and the influence of human experience is demonstrated through a sensitivity analysis. Finally, this methodology is applied to a real‐world case study in a mountainous region, and the results verify that the DRL approach used here can automatically explore and optimize the railway alignment, decreasing the construction cost by 17.65% and 7.98%, compared with the manual alignment and with the results of a method based on the distance transform, respectively, while satisfying various alignment constraints.","[{""name"": ""Tianci Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of High‐Speed Railway Engineering, Ministry of Education Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China"", ""School of Civil Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Zihan Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of High‐Speed Railway Engineering, Ministry of Education Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China"", ""School of Civil Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Yan Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of High‐Speed Railway Engineering, Ministry of Education Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China"", ""School of Civil Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Paul Schonfeld"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Maryland  College Park MD USA""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoyun Feng"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Qingyuan Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Qing He"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of High‐Speed Railway Engineering, Ministry of Education Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China"", ""School of Civil Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China"", ""Industrial and Systems Engineering and Civil, Structural and Environment Engineering University at Buffalo, the State University of New York  Buffalo NY USA""]}]","[""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.1137/040603371"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.03.003"", ""10.1080/0305215X.2016.1271880"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.11.019"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(89)90008-8"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.02.016"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2005.00414.x"", ""10.1016/0191-2607(88)90024-6"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2008.00560.x"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(88)90021-5"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-1922-2_19"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2013.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2014.08.035"", ""10.1109/SMC.2017.8122622"", ""10.1061/JHCEA2.0000266"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00242"", ""10.3141/1719-31"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2004.04.001"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(01)00047-9"", ""10.1613/jair.301"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2011.09.006"", ""10.3141/2275-09"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2009)135:4(217)"", ""10.1155/2018/5781591"", ""10.1111/mice.12280"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.05.010"", ""10.4304/jsw.8.11.2967-2973"", ""10.1002/atr.5670430405"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2004.06.005"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2015.05.018"", ""10.1007/s10589-019-00160-3"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.01.054"", ""10.1080/03081067708717111"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2019.01.051"", ""10.1111/mice.12475"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2018.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2015.07.039"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001047"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001570"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2012.00769.x"", ""10.1038/nature24270"", ""10.1111/mice.12571"", ""10.1111/mice.12607"", ""10.1111/mice.12534"", ""10.1109/TNN.1998.712192"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105173"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(88)90039-2"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.10.045"", ""10.5703/1288284313790"", ""10.1609/aaai.v30i1.10295"", ""10.1111/mice.12350"", ""10.1111/mice.12287"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-27645-3"", ""10.1177/0278364917722396"", ""10.1109/CAC.2017.8244061"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.12.010"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989381"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106105""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1186/s12544-021-00488-0,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,0823 Transportation Engineering,Who continued travelling by public transport during COVID-19? Socioeconomic factors explaining travel behaviour in Stockholm 2020 based on smart card data,"Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has changed travel behaviour and reduced the use of public transport throughout the world, but the reduction has not been uniform. In this study we analyse the propensity to stop travelling by public transport during COVID-19 for the holders of 1.8 million smart cards in Stockholm, Sweden, for the spring and autumn of 2020. We suggest two binomial logit models for explaining the change in travel pattern, linking socioeconomic data per area and travel data with the probability to stop travelling. Modelled variables The first model investigates the impact of the socioeconomic factors: age; income; education level; gender; housing type; population density; country of origin; and employment level. The results show that decreases in public transport use are linked to all these factors. The second model groups the investigated areas into five distinct clusters based on the socioeconomic data, showing the impacts for different socioeconomic groups. During the autumn the differences between the groups diminished, and especially Cluster 1 (with the lowest education levels, lowest income and highest share of immigrants) reduced their public transport use to a similar level as the more affluent clusters. Results The results show that socioeconomic status affect the change in behaviour during the pandemic and that exposure to the virus is determined by citizens’ socioeconomic class. Furthermore, the results can guide policy into tailoring public transport supply to where the need is, instead of assuming that e.g. crowding is equally distributed within the public transport system in the event of a pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Erik Almlöf"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Isak Rubensson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matej Cebecauer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Erik Jenelius"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.31234/osf.io/5q3jv"", ""10.1126/science.aba9757"", ""10.2139/ssrn.360300"", ""10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121"", ""10.3386/w26948"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3570145"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2013.05.052"", ""10.1101/2020.06.25.20139915"", ""10.1016/j.trip.2020.100242"", ""10.1101/2020.04.06.20055632"", ""10.1126/science.abb4218"", ""10.1007/s40615-020-00756-0"", ""10.1101/2020.06.04.20122093"", ""10.1080/20008686.2020.1806505"", ""10.1101/2020.03.30.20048090"", ""10.3929/ETHZ-B-000420762"", ""10.1101/2020.03.27.20045302"", ""10.1101/2020.03.22.20039933"", ""10.1101/2020.05.06.20092676"", ""10.1101/2020.04.16.20067504"", ""10.1016/j.healthpol.2020.06.009"", ""10.3141/2121-06"", ""10.1080/15472450601122256"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0089405"", ""10.1101/2020.06.04.20112417"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3571708"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2007.00494.x""]","['Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Modeling and Simulation', 'Transportation']","[[('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"
10.1287/trsc.2021.1111,TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering; 1201 Management Science and Engineering,The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Capacitated Charging Stations,"Electric vehicle routing problems (E-VRPs) deal with routing a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) to serve a set of customers while minimizing an operational criterion, for example, cost or time. The feasibility of the routes is constrained by the autonomy of the EVs, which may be recharged along the route. Much of the E-VRP research neglects the capacity of charging stations (CSs) and thus implicitly assumes that an unlimited number of EVs can be simultaneously charged at a CS. In this paper, we model and solve E-VRPs considering these capacity restrictions. In particular, we study an E-VRP with nonlinear charging functions, multiple charging technologies, en route charging, and variable charging quantities while explicitly accounting for the number of chargers available at privately managed CSs. We refer to this problem as the E-VRP with nonlinear charging functions and capacitated stations (E-VRP-NL-C). We introduce a continuous-time model formulation for the problem. We then introduce an algorithmic framework that iterates between two main components: (1) the route generator, which uses an iterated local search algorithm to build a pool of high-quality routes, and (2) the solution assembler, which applies a branch-and-cut algorithm to combine a subset of routes from the pool into a solution satisfying the capacity constraints. We compare four assembly strategies on a set of instances. We show that our algorithm effectively deals with the E-VRP-NL-C. Furthermore, considering the uncapacitated version of the E-VRP-NL-C, our solution method identifies new best-known solutions for 80 of 120 instances.","[{""name"": ""Aurélien Froger"", ""affiliation"": [""Université de Bordeaux, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Bordeaux INP, Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux, Unité Mixte de Recherche 5251, F-33400 Talence, France;""]}, {""name"": ""Ola Jabali"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, I-20133 Milan, Italy;""]}, {""name"": ""Jorge E.

Using a lightweight classification algorithm, a lightweight segmentation algorithm, a high‐precision segmentation algorithm, and a crack width measurement algorithm, the cracks are classified, roughly segmented, finely segmented, and the maximum width is extracted. A crack information‐assisted drone flight automatic control algorithm for automatic crack detection guides the drone toward the crack position. The effectiveness of the crack detection algorithm and the crack information‐assisted drone flight automatic control algorithm was tested on two different datasets, a two‐story building, and a 16‐m‐high shaking table test building. The results show that crack detection can be finished in real‐time during the flight. Using the proposed method can significantly improve the MIoU of crack edge detection and the accuracy of maximum crack width measurement under the non‐ideal shooting conditions of the actual inspection situation by automatically approaching the vicinity of the crack.","[{""name"": ""Shiqiao Meng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering Tongii University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhiyuan Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""Shanghai Research Institute for Intelligent Autonomous Systems Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Ying Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering Tongii University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Bin He"", ""affiliation"": [""Shanghai Research Institute for Intelligent Autonomous Systems Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Abderrahim Djerrad"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering Tongii University  Shanghai China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ndteint.2008.06.005"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2644615"", ""10.1177/14759217211006485"", ""10.1111/mice.12844"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2764844"", ""10.1111/mice.12826"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01234-2_49"", ""10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224792"", ""10.1111/mice.12497"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.11.028"", ""10.1145/1360612.1360666"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2891167"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2016.90"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1166"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00745"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2006.00445.x"", ""10.1111/mice.12519"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.103019"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000447"", ""10.1111/mice.12375"", ""10.1111/mice.12626"", ""10.1111/mice.12353"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1111/mice.12849"", ""10.1111/mice.12622"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298965"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01264-9_8"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2017.01.020"", ""10.1111/mice.12428"", ""10.1111/mice.12421"", ""10.1111/mice.12549"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103357"", ""10.1002/tee.22056"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00474"", ""10.3846/jcem.2018.6186"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956191"", ""10.1061/40932(246)292"", ""10.1111/mice.12319"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01234-2_1"", ""10.1111/mice.12412"", ""10.1177/1369433219836292"", ""10.1111/mice.12338"", ""10.1007/s11263-021-01515-2"", ""10.1111/mice.12297"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000775"", ""10.1145/357994.358023"", ""10.1111/mice.12753"", ""10.1109/34.888718"", ""10.1109/CISP.2010.5646923"", ""10.1109/CVPRW.2018.00034"", ""10.1111/mice.12815""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1287/trsc.2019.0958,TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering; 1201 Management Science and Engineering,Dynamic Pricing and Routing for Same-Day Delivery,"An increasing number of e-commerce retailers offers same-day delivery. To deliver the ordered goods, providers dynamically dispatch a fleet of vehicles transporting the goods from the warehouse to the customers. In many cases, retailers offer different delivery deadline options, from four-hour delivery up to next-hour delivery. Due to the deadlines, vehicles often only deliver a few orders per trip. The overall number of served orders within the delivery horizon is small and the revenue low. As a result, many companies currently struggle to conduct same-day delivery cost-efficiently. In this paper, we show how dynamic pricing is able to substantially increase both revenue and the number of customers we are able to serve the same day. To this end, we present an anticipatory pricing and routing policy (APRP) method that incentivizes customers to select delivery deadline options efficiently for the fleet to fulfill. This maintains the fleet’s flexibility to serve more future orders. We model the respective pricing and routing problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). To apply APRP, the state-dependent opportunity costs per customer and option are required. To this end, we use a guided offline value function approximation (VFA) based on state space aggregation. The VFA approximates the opportunity cost for every state and delivery option with respect to the fleet’s flexibility. As an offline method, APRP is able to determine suitable prices instantly when a customer orders. In an extensive computational study, we compare APRP with a policy based on fixed prices and with conventional temporal and geographical pricing policies. APRP outperforms the benchmark policies significantly, leading to both a higher revenue and more customers served the same day.","[{""name"": ""Marlin W.

These conditions are the bases for fatigue analysis to accurately establish the remaining fatigue life of the structures that ideally requires a full‐field strain assessment of the structures over years of data collection. Traditional inspection methods collect strain measurements by using strain gauges for a short time span and extrapolate the measurements in time; nevertheless, large‐scale deployment of strain gauges is expensive and laborious as more spatial information is desired. This paper introduces a deep learning‐based approach to replace this high cost by employing inexpensive data coming from acceleration sensors. The proposed approach utilizes collected acceleration responses as inputs to a multistage deep neural network based on long short‐term memory and fully connected layers to estimate the strain responses. The memory requirement of training long acceleration sequences is reduced by proposing a novel training strategy. In the evaluation of the method, a laboratory‐scale horizontally curved girder subjected to various loading scenarios is tested.","[{""name"": ""Nur Sila Gulgec"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Lehigh University Bethlehem PA USA""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Takáč"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering Lehigh University Bethlehem PA USA""]}, {""name"": ""Shamim N.

The developed methodology uses the autoencoder to reconstruct raw acceleration sequences of user‐defined length collected from a healthy structure. To quantify the errors between the original input and the reconstructed output, which may be representative of damage occurrence, two indexes of reconstruction loss are selected as damage‐sensitive features. To support damage detection, a selected number of short‐time sequences are finally grouped into a unique macrosequence. The novel procedure can effectively both work at the single sensor level, as well as combine the predictive models using an ensemble learning strategy. Avoiding system identification, results obtained in the Z24 bridge demonstrate that the proposed method is quite effective for local damage detection with limited computational effort and using a limited number of sensors, thereby suitable to be easily applicable in the context of real‐time bridge assessment.","[{""name"": ""Valentina Giglioni"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Perugia Perugia Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Ilaria Venanzi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Perugia Perugia Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Valentina Poggioni"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Informatics University of Perugia Perugia Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Alfredo Milani"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Informatics University of Perugia Perugia Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Filippo Ubertini"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Perugia Perugia Italy""]}]","[""10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107077"", ""10.1177/1475921720972416"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81716-9_19"", ""10.1111/mice.12845"", ""10.47964/1120.9108.20087"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.113029"", ""10.1109/DSAA.2018.00018"", ""10.1111/mice.12641"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.10.021"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2010.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.06.011"", ""10.1007/s10921-020-00744-8"", ""10.1111/mice.12511"", ""10.21629/JSEE.2018.04.22"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2015.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.1155/2021/6658575"", ""10.1111/mice.12799"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.05.084"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.113064"", ""10.1002/stc.2714"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002535"", ""10.1177/1475921720934051"", ""10.1098/rsta.2006.1938""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

10.1186/s12544-021-00481-7,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,0823 Transportation Engineering,Mapping travel behavior changes during the COVID-19 lock-down: a socioeconomic analysis in Greece,"Abstract Background COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge that the world had never encountered in the last 100 years. In order to mitigate its negative effects, governments worldwide took action by prohibiting at first certain activities and in some cases by a countrywide lockdown. Greece was among the countries that were struck by the pandemic. Governmental authorities took action in limiting the spread of the pandemic through a series of countermeasures, which built up to a countrywide lockdown that lasted 42 days. Methodology This research aims at identifying the effect of certain socioeconomic factors on the travel behaviour of Greek citizens and at investigating whether any social groups were comparatively less privileged or suffered more from the lockdown. To this end, a dynamic online questionnaire survey on mobility characteristics was designed and distributed to Greek citizens during the lockdown period, which resulted in 1,259 valid responses. Collected data were analysed through descriptive and inferential statistical tests, in order to identify mobility patterns and correlations with certain socioeconomic characteristics. Additionally, a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) was developed in order to examine the potential influence of socioeconomic characteristics to trip frequency before and during the lockdown period. Results Outcomes indicate a decisive decrease in trip frequencies due to the lockdown. Furthermore, the model’s results indicate significant correlations between gender, income and trip frequencies during the lockdown, something that is not evident in the pre-pandemic era.","[{""name"": ""Ioannis Politis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Georgios Georgiadis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Anastasia Nikolaidou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aristomenis Kopsacheilis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ioannis Fyrogenis"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alexandros Sdoukopoulos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eleni Verani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Efthymis Papadopoulos"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.trip.2020.100255"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30567-5"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2020.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.trip.2020.100141"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0235590"", ""10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121"", ""10.1101/2020.04.13.20063933"", ""10.1016/j.trip.2020.100127"", ""10.1080/22221751.2020.1723441"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.028"", ""10.1016/j.trip.2020.100154"", ""10.2307/2344614"", ""10.2105/AJPH.93.9.1509"", ""10.1101/2020.05.29.20097097"", ""10.2139/ssrn.3572324"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2020.100864"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2019.01.027"", ""10.1186/1471-2334-11-16"", ""10.1201/9781420082869"", ""10.1093/jtm/taaa020""]","['Economics, Econometrics and Finance', 'Mathematics', 'Social Sciences']","['Economics and Econometrics', 'Modeling and Simulation', 'Transportation']","[[('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0701 数学', 0.7342), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7101), ('0714 统计学', 0.708), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7056), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7028)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7627), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7606)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

This approach, called column selection, applies a learned model to select a subset of the variables (columns) generated at each iteration of CG. The goal is to reduce the computing time spent reoptimizing the restricted master problem at each iteration by selecting the most promising columns. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two problems: the vehicle and crew scheduling problem and the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The ML model was able to generalize to instances of different sizes, yielding a gain in computing time of up to 30%.","[{""name"": ""Mouad Morabit"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Industrial Engineering, Polytechnique Montréal, Québec H3C 3A7, Canada"", ""Research Group in Decision Analysis (GERAD), Montréal, Québec H3T 2A7, Canada"", ""Canada Excellence Research Chair in Data Science for Real-Time Decision-Making, Polytechnique Montréal, Quebec H3C 3A7, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Guy Desaulniers"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Industrial Engineering, Polytechnique Montréal, Québec H3C 3A7, Canada"", ""Research Group in Decision Analysis (GERAD), Montréal, Québec H3T 2A7, Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Lodi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Industrial Engineering, Polytechnique Montréal, Québec H3C 3A7, Canada"", ""Research Group in Decision Analysis (GERAD), Montréal, Québec H3T 2A7, Canada"", ""Canada Excellence Research Chair in Data Science for Real-Time Decision-Making, Polytechnique Montréal, Quebec H3C 3A7, Canada""]}]","[""10.1287/ijoc.2016.0723"", ""10.1016/j.dam.2008.06.021"", ""10.1287/opre.1110.0975"", ""10.1287/trsc.17.1.4"", ""10.1287/opre.46.3.316"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2020.07.063"", ""10.1002/net.21594"", ""10.1287/trsc.2018.0878"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73312-6_3"", ""10.1007/978-1-4615-1507-4_14"", ""10.1007/b135457"", ""10.1137/1.9781611973594.ch5"", ""10.1287/opre.40.2.342"", ""10.1016/S0012-365X(98)00213-1"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2006.10.007"", ""10.1287/ijoc.1100.0425"", ""10.1007/s10107-008-0254-5"", ""10.1287/opre.1050.0222"", ""10.1002/net.20033"", ""10.1023/A:1022287504028"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-85970-0_21"", ""10.1287/opre.9.6.849"", ""10.1007/s12532-015-0090-6"", ""10.1287/trsc.35.3.286.10153"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2004.01.027"", ""10.1287/trsc.1040.0104"", ""10.1007/0-387-25486-2_2"", ""10.1287/opre.1070.0449"", ""10.1287/trsc.33.1.101"", ""10.1287/opre.1050.0234"", ""10.1007/s11750-017-0451-6"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2006.09.001"", ""10.1287/ijoc.2016.0744"", ""10.1287/ijoc.2017.0784"", ""10.1016/j.orl.2006.11.004"", ""10.1109/TNN.2008.2005605"", ""10.1007/s13676-019-00145-6"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2018.05.046"", ""10.1007/0-387-25486-2_12"", ""10.1007/s13675-018-0098-6"", ""10.1287/opre.2013.1247""]","['Engineering', 'Computer Science']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

The bond strength between different casts is attributed to surface roughness. Surface roughness can be achieved in many ways, such as water‐jetting or sandblasting. To evaluate the degree of surface roughness, qualitative and quantitative methods are introduced by many researchers; however, several drawbacks are associated with most of these methods, including cost, availability, human errors, and inability to assess old structures from prior inspection records. Two novel industrial implementation methods are introduced in this paper to estimate, quantitatively, the concrete surface roughness from images with sufficient resolution. In the first application method, a digital image processing method is proposed to distinguish the coarse aggregate from cement paste, and a new index is presented as a function of aggregate proportional area to the surface area. In the second application method, data augmentation and transfer learning techniques in computer vision and machine learning are utilized to classify new images based on predefined images during the learning process. Both application methods were related to a well‐established method of 3D laser scanning from sandblasted concrete surfaces.

At the current state, this arrangement is chosen through optimal sensor placement (OSP) techniques that consider only the initial conditions of the structure. The effects of the potential damage are usually completely neglected during its design. Consequently, this sensor pattern is not guaranteed to remain optimal during the whole lifetime of the structure, especially for complex masonry buildings in high seismic hazard zones. In this paper, a novel approach based on multi‐objective optimization (MO) and genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed for a damage scenario driven OSP strategy. The aim is to improve the robustness of the sensor configuration for damage detection after a potentially catastrophic event. The performance of this strategy is tested on the case study of the bell tower of the Santa Maria and San Giovenale Cathedral in Fossano (Italy) and compared to other classic OSP strategies and a standard GA approach with a single objective function.","[{""name"": ""Marco Civera"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Politecnico di Torino  Turin Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Marica Leonarda Pecorelli"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Structural, Building and Geotechnical Engineering Politecnico di Torino  Turin Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Rosario Ceravolo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Structural, Building and Geotechnical Engineering Politecnico di Torino  Turin Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Cecilia Surace"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Structural, Building and Geotechnical Engineering Politecnico di Torino  Turin Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Luca Zanotti Fragonara"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Aerospace, Transportation and Manufacturing Cranfield University  Cranfield UK""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(1994)7:1(104)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(1994)7:3(276)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(1995)8:3(156)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1995)121:11(1588)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1997)123:2(218)"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-28746-1"", ""10.1002/0470867353"", ""10.1007/BF02479335"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.09.439"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.07.690"", ""10.1007/BF01442131"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000503"", ""10.1080/15583058.2013.850554"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000594"", ""10.1080/15583050903582516"", ""10.3390/app9235064"", ""10.1109/4235.996017"", ""10.1007/978-981-13-8331-1_11"", ""10.1016/S0045-7949(00)00089-4"", ""10.1109/CEC.2008.4631121"", ""10.2514/3.20635"", ""10.1155/2018/3739690"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.01.067"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2007.05.004"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1106/1/012027"", ""10.1007/s00158-015-1261-9"", ""10.1177/107754630000600508"", ""10.2514/3.11998"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2016.02.013"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2011.00726.x"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(1994)7:3(297)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(1994)7:2(156)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2000)126:5(596)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2000)126:11(1339)"", ""10.1162/evco.1994.2.3.221"", ""10.1111/mice.12142"", ""10.1111/mice.12106"", ""10.12989/sss.2014.13.3.389"", ""10.1016/S0141-0296(00)00118-8"", ""10.1002/tal.712"", ""10.1007/s10518-016-9970-z"", ""10.1111/mice.12478"", ""10.1109/TEVC.2009.2014613""]","['Engineering', 'Decision Sciences']","['Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

To reduce sulfur emissions from shipping, the International Maritime Organization has established emission control areas (ECAs) where ships must use low-sulfur fuel with at most 0.1% sulfur or take equivalent emission-reduction measures. The use of low-sulfur fuel increases the costs for liner shipping companies and affects their operations management. This study addresses a holistic liner shipping service planning problem that integrates fleet deployment, schedule design, and sailing path and speed optimization, considering the effect of ECAs. We propose a nesting algorithmic framework to address this new and challenging problem. Semianalytical solutions are derived for the sailing path and speed optimization problem, which are used in the schedule design. A tailored algorithm is applied to solve schedule design problems, and the solutions are used in fleet deployment. The fleet deployment problem is then addressed by a dynamic programming-based pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that considering the effect of ECAs in liner shipping operations management can reduce over 2% of the costs, which is significant considering that the annual operating cost of a shipping company’s network can be as high as several billion dollars.","[{""name"": ""Shuaian Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong;""]}, {""name"": ""Dan Zhuge"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong;""]}, {""name"": ""Lu Zhen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Management, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China;""]}, {""name"": ""Chung-Yee Lee"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong""]}]","[""10.1016/j.trd.2017.09.017"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2014.03.017"", ""10.1111/poms.12742"", ""10.1111/poms.12244"", ""10.1287/msom.2015.0555"", ""10.1287/trsc.1030.0036"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2012.12.002"", ""10.1287/trsc.32.4.380"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2014.03.002"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2015.06.005"", ""10.1057/jors.2009.77"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.12.010"", ""10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01310.x"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2017.06.024"", ""10.1002/net.21503"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2013.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2015.02.004"", ""10.1111/poms.12996"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.10.004"", ""10.1016/S0965-8564(98)00018-4"", ""10.1287/mnsc.1120.1672"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2010.12.005"", ""10.1287/trsc.2013.0461"", ""10.1080/03088839.2017.1342878"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.05.003"", ""10.1287/opre.38.3.426"", ""10.1287/ijoc.2014.0601"", ""10.1111/poms.12849"", ""10.1287/trsc.23.4.266"", ""10.1016/0377-2217(95)00015-I"", ""10.1057/s41278-018-0098-8"", ""10.1057/s41278-019-00132-8"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2012.02.001"", ""10.1057/jors.2009.169"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2015.10.052"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2011.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.08.003"", ""10.1080/03088839.2018.1468938"", ""10.3141/2549-05""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

The operator, seeking to maximize profit, must assign vehicles to requests as they arise as well as recharge and reposition vehicles in anticipation of future requests. To solve this problem, we employ deep reinforcement learning, developing policies whose decision making uses [Formula: see text]-value approximations learned by deep neural networks. We compare these policies against a reoptimization-based policy and against dual bounds on the value of an optimal policy, including the value of an optimal policy with perfect information, which we establish using a Benders-based decomposition. We assess performance on instances derived from real data for the island of Manhattan in New York City. We find that, across instances of varying size, our best policy trained with deep reinforcement learning outperforms the reoptimization approach. We also provide evidence that this policy may be effectively scaled and deployed on larger instances without retraining.","[{""name"": ""Nicholas D.

Empirical evidence from San Francisco,"AbstractTransportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft, have been hypothesized to both complement and compete with public transit. Existing research on the topic is limited by a lack of detailed data on the timing and location of TNC trips. This study overcomes that limitation by using data scraped from the Application Programming Interfaces of two TNCs, combined with Automated Passenger Count data on transit use and other supporting data. Using a panel data model of the change in bus ridership in San Francisco between 2010 and 2015, and confirming the result with a separate time-series model, we find that TNCs are responsible for a net ridership decline of about 10%, offsetting net gains from other factors such as service increases and population growth. We do not find a statistically significant effect on light rail ridership.

10.1049/itr2.12030,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,An efficient and layout-independent automatic license plate recognition system based on the YOLO detector,"AbstractThis paper presents an efficient and layout‐independent Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system based on the state‐of‐the‐art you only look once (YOLO) object detector that contains a unified approach for license plate (LP) detection and layout classification to improve the recognition results using post‐processing rules. The system is conceived by evaluating and optimizing different models, aiming at achieving the best speed/accuracy trade‐off at each stage. The networks are trained using images from several datasets, with the addition of various data augmentation techniques, so that they are robust under different conditions. The proposed system achieved an average end‐to‐end recognition rate of 96.9% across eight public datasets (from five different regions) used in the experiments, outperforming both previous works and commercial systems in the ChineseLP, OpenALPR‐EU, SSIG‐SegPlate and UFPR‐ALPR datasets. In the other datasets, the proposed approach achieved competitive results to those attained by the baselines. The authors' system also achieved impressive frames per second (FPS) rates on a high‐end GPU, being able to perform in real time even when there are four vehicles in the scene. An additional contribution is that the authors manually labelled 38,351 bounding boxes on 6,239 images from public datasets and made the annotations publicly available to the research community.","[{""name"": ""Rayson Laroca"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Informatics Federal University of Paraná  Curitiba Brazil""]}, {""name"": ""Luiz A.

To improve the estimation accuracy of the sideslip angle based on the intelligent vehicle platform, this study proposes a novel vehicle sideslip angle estimation algorithm with the fusion of dynamic model and vision information. Firstly, to further improve the model accuracy of the vehicle during lateral acceleration conditions, a vehicle dynamic model is established considering the acceleration error compensation with the assistance of attitude information. In addition, based on the lane line information obtained from the equipped camera in intelligent vehicles, a visual geometric model is established. Owing to the measurement delay and low sampling frequency of the camera, a multi‐rate sideslip angle observer with delay compensation is designed to coordinate with the inter‐frequency signal of the vehicle chassis. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the slalom test.","[{""name"": ""Wei Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Automotive Engineering Center, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China"", ""School of Automotive Studies, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Lu Xiong"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Automotive Engineering Center, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China"", ""School of Automotive Studies, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Xin Xia"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Automotive Engineering Center, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China"", ""School of Automotive Studies, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yishi Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Automotive Engineering Center, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China"", ""School of Automotive Studies, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Letian Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Automotive Engineering Center, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China"", ""School of Automotive Studies, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Shunhui Song"", ""affiliation"": [""Clean Energy Automotive Engineering Center, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China"", ""School of Automotive Studies, Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1080/00423114.2012.663921"", ""10.1109/TIE.2019.2898599"", ""10.1007/s12239-017-0097-2"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2018.2812220"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2918176"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.12.037"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2850154"", ""10.3390/s19183816"", ""10.1007/s12239-016-0097-7"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5098"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.06.022"", ""10.3390/s19081930"", ""10.4271/2018-01-0571"", ""10.1080/00423114.2013.877148"", ""10.1080/00423110902721824"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2017.10.004"", ""10.1080/00423114.2013.859281"", ""10.1109/IVS.2018.8500507"", ""10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2010.08.003"", ""10.1109/TVT.2013.2294717"", ""10.1109/TVT.2015.2496969"", ""10.1109/IVS.2005.1505139"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2018.2870639"", ""10.1109/TIE.2013.2271596"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2774771""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

By using an autonomous panorama vision‐based inspection system, the limitations of the human cost and safety factors of previously time‐consuming tasks have been overcome. The main damage detection challenges to panorama images are (1) the lack of annotated panorama defect image data, (2) detection in high‐resolution images, and (3) the inherent distortion disturbance for panorama images. In this paper, a new PAnoramic surface damage DEtection Network (PADENet) is presented to solve the challenges by (a) using an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture panoramic images and a distorted panoramic augmentation method to expand the panoramic dataset, (b) employing the proposed multiple projection methods to process high‐resolution images, and (c) modifying the faster region‐based convolutional neural network and training via transfer learning on VGG‐16, which improves the precision for detecting multiple types of damage in distortion. The results show that the proposed method is optimal for surface damage detection.","[{""name"": ""Cai Luo"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Oceanography and Space Informatics China University of Petroleum (East China)  Qingdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Leijian Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Design, Manufacturing &amp; Engineering Management University of Strathclyde  Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Jiaxing Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Xi'an Jiaotong University  Shaanxi China"", ""State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering Xi'an Jiaotong University  Shaanxi China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhongwei Li"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Oceanography and Space Informatics China University of Petroleum (East China)  Qingdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Peng Ren"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Oceanography and Space Informatics China University of Petroleum (East China)  Qingdao China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiao Bai"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Computer Science and Engineering Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Erfu Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Design, Manufacturing &amp; Engineering Management University of Strathclyde  Glasgow UK""]}, {""name"": ""Yonghong Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering China University of Petroleum (East China)  Qingdao China""]}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2003)17:4(255)"", ""10.1201/9781482281767"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2018.10.019"", ""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.1088/0964-1726/24/6/065034"", ""10.1111/mice.12440"", ""10.1109/IVS.2015.7225675"", ""10.1111/mice.12334"", ""10.1007/s10845-014-0924-5"", ""10.1109/TIE.2005.851648"", ""10.2208/jscejpe.70.I_1"", ""10.1109/ICCAR.2017.7942721"", ""10.1109/TIV.2016.2622921"", ""10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4"", ""10.1109/CVPRW.2019.00079"", ""10.1111/mice.12363"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2012.06.005"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.169"", ""10.1016/j.compind.2014.10.006"", ""10.1111/mice.12550"", ""10.1002/nme.1964"", ""10.1111/mice.12375"", ""10.1016/j.aei.2011.01.002"", ""10.1260/1369-4332.17.3.303"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-6741-9_11"", ""10.1109/TIE.1930.896476"", ""10.1111/mice.12493"", ""10.1111/mice.12351"", ""10.1111/mice.12433"", ""10.3390/electronics8030329"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1111/mice.12501"", ""10.1260/1369-4332.17.3.289"", ""10.1111/mice.12505"", ""10.1002/stc.2286"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2017.10.070"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1111/mice.12580"", ""10.1007/s11263-013-0620-5"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000303"", ""10.1109/ICPR.2018.8546070"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10590-1_53"", ""10.1109/ICVRV.2017.00013"", ""10.1109/IGARSS.2005.1526355""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Therefore, it is essential to accurately detect and repair cracks before they impact services. This study developed a systematic pixel‐level crack segmentation–quantification method suited for nighttime detection of slab tracks. To be specific, slab track crack network II, a pixel‐level segmentation network that aggregates multi‐scale information was proposed to extract the morphology of slab track cracks, and then their widths were calculated by an alternative quantification method proposed in the paper. The model performs best when the initial learning rate is 0.0001, with intersection over unions (IOUs) 84.94% and 83.84% observed on the training set and validation set, respectively. In the test set, the IOU value is 81.07%, higher than that derived from similar segmentation algorithms, indicating higher robustness and better generalization of the network architecture. In addition, the average errors in predicting crack widths resulting from the proposed method are 0.13 and 0.12 mm, compared to the results measured by a vernier caliper and a 3D scanner, respectively. The proposed pixel‐level segmentation–quantification system provides a new method and theoretical support for slab track maintenance and repair.","[{""name"": ""Wenlong Ye"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China"", ""MOE Key Laboratory of High‐Speed Railway Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Juanjuan Ren"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China"", ""MOE Key Laboratory of High‐Speed Railway Engineering Southwest Jiaotong University  Chengdu China""]}, {""name"": ""Allen A.

10.1186/s12544-021-00522-1,EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW,0823 Transportation Engineering,"A systematic literature review of ride-sharing platforms, user factors and barriers","Abstract Aim Ride-sharing is an innovative on-demand transport service that aims to promote sustainable transport, reduce car utilization, increase vehicle occupancy and public transport ridership. By reviewing ride-sharing studies around the world, this paper aims to map major aspects of ride-sharing, including online platforms, user factors and barriers that affect ride-sharing services, and extract useful insights regarding their successful implementation. Method A systematic literature review is conducted on scientific publications in English language. Articles are eligible if they report a study on user factors affecting ride-sharing use and/or barriers preventing ride-sharing implementation; ride-sharing online platforms in these articles are also recorded and are further explored through their official websites. A database is built that organizes articles per author, year and location, summarizes online platform attributes, and groups user factors associated with the likelihood to ride-share. Findings The review shows that the term “ride-sharing” is used in the literature for both profit and non-profit ride-sharing services. In total, twenty-nine ride-sharing online platforms are recorded and analyzed according to specific characteristics. Sixteen user factors related to the likelihood to ride-share are recorded and grouped into sociodemographic, location and system factors. While location and system factors are found to follow a pattern among studies, mixed findings are recorded on the relationship between sociodemographic factors and ride-sharing. Factors that may hinder the development of ride-sharing systems are grouped into economic, technological, business, behavioral and regulatory barriers. Conclusion Opportunities exist to improve the quality of existing ride-sharing services and plan successful new ones. Future research efforts should focus towards studying ride-sharing users' trip purpose (i.e., work, university, shopping, etc.), investigating factors associated to ride-sharing before and after implementation of the service, and perform cross-case studies between cities and countries of the same continent to compare findings.","[{""name"": ""Lambros Mitropoulos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Annie Kortsari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Georgia Ayfantopoulou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2011.05.017"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2012.05.028"", ""10.3141/2217-13"", ""10.1016/j.pmcj.2014.05.010"", ""10.1016/0166-0462(92)90023-T"", ""10.3141/2118-05"", ""10.1007/s11116-010-9266-0"", ""10.1016/j.tbs.2019.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2009.07.008"", ""10.1080/01441647.2011.621557"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120559"", ""10.1186/2046-4053-2-76"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2009.07.008"", ""10.3929/ethz-b-000041315"", ""10.7326/0003-4819-126-5-199703010-00006"", ""10.1080/03081060.2013.830894"", ""10.3141/2187-17"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2015.10.014"", ""10.3929/ethz-b-000052402"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2013.08.012"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.329"", ""10.1108/9780080481449"", ""10.3386/w22776"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2018.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.is.2016.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.119792"", ""10.1504/IJISD.2010.034559"", ""10.1007/s40534-017-0135-9"", ""10.1016/j.ijtst.2017.10.002"", ""10.5038/2375-0901.10.4.6"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.02.013"", ""10.5198/jtlu.2015.669"", ""10.1007/BF00165595"", ""10.3141/2021-13"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.033"", ""10.1007/s11116-006-9101-9"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2011.01.006"", ""10.1108/13683040810881162"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.07.016"", ""10.1007/s11116-015-9661-7"", ""10.3390/urbansci1040036"", ""10.3390/su11082414"", ""10.1016/j.tbs.2018.08.002"", ""10.1080/01441647.2018.1497728"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2012.04.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-51602-8_12"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2016.04.010"", ""10.1002/atr.1326"", ""10.1080/15568318.2018.1542758"", ""10.1002/atr.1326"", ""10.1007/s12599-015-0396-y"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2011.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2012.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2018.08.013"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.044"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.017"", ""10.1002/atr.1300"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.186"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.01.052""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"
10.1111/mice.13103,COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0814 Civil Engineering; 0812 Computer Science and Technology,A lightweight encoder-decoder network for automatic pavement crack detection,"AbstractCracks are the most common damage type on the pavement surface. Usually, pavement cracks, especially small cracks, are difficult to be accurately identified due to background interference. Accurate and fast automatic road crack detection play a vital role in assessing pavement conditions. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient lightweight encoder–decoder network for automatically detecting pavement cracks at the pixel level. Taking advantage of a novel encoder–decoder architecture integrating a new type of hybrid attention blocks and residual blocks (RBs), the proposed network can achieve an extremely lightweight model with more accurate detection of pavement crack pixels. An image dataset consisting of 789 images of pavement cracks acquired by a self‐designed mobile robot is built and utilized to train and evaluate the proposed network. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network performs better than the state‐of‐the‐art methods on the self‐built dataset as well as three other public datasets (CamCrack789, Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack237), achieving F1 scores of 94.94%, 82.95%, 95.74%, and 92.51%, respectively. Additionally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of integrating the RBs and the proposed hybrid attention mechanisms. By introducing depth‐wise separable convolutions, an even more lightweight version of the proposed network is created, which has a comparable performance and achieves the fastest inference speed with a model parameter size of only 0.57 M. The developed mobile robot system can effectively detect pavement cracks in real scenarios at a speed of 25 frames per second.","[{""name"": ""Guijie Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China"", ""International Cooperation Base of Evolutionary Intelligence and Robotics of Guangdong Province Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiacheng Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China"", ""International Cooperation Base of Evolutionary Intelligence and Robotics of Guangdong Province Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhun Fan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China"", ""International Cooperation Base of Evolutionary Intelligence and Robotics of Guangdong Province Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Duan Yuan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China"", ""International Cooperation Base of Evolutionary Intelligence and Robotics of Guangdong Province Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Peili Ma"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China"", ""International Cooperation Base of Evolutionary Intelligence and Robotics of Guangdong Province Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Meihua Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Mathematics &amp; Informatics South China Agricultural University  Guangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Weihua Sheng"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Oklahoma State University Oklahoma  Stillwater USA""]}, {""name"": ""Kelvin C.

10.1007/s11116-021-10192-6,TRANSPORTATION,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering,Social distancing in public transport: mobilising new technologies for demand management under the Covid-19 crisis,"AbstractDense urban areas are especially hardly hit by the Covid-19 crisis due to the limited availability of public transport, one of the most efficient means of mass mobility. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, public transport operators are experiencing steep declines in demand and fare revenues due to the perceived risk of infection within vehicles and other facilities. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of implementing social distancing in public transport in line with epidemiological advice. Social distancing requires effective demand management to keep vehicle occupancy rates under a predefined threshold, both spatially and temporally. We review the literature of five demand management methods enabled by new information and ticketing technologies: (i) inflow control with queueing, (ii) time and space dependent pricing, (iii) capacity reservation with advance booking, (iv) slot auctioning, and (v) tradeable travel permit schemes. Thus the paper collects the relevant literature into a single point of reference, and provides interpretation from the viewpoint of practical applicability during and after the pandemic.","[{""name"": ""Daniel Hörcher"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ramandeep Singh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel J.

This paper aims to identify potential ways that MaaS (specifically MaaS plans) could help encourage behavioural change; and understand the barriers to using alternative transport modes. In-depth interviews and qualitative analysis are applied to the case study of London. The results indicate that individuals segment the transport modes offered via MaaS into three categories: essential, considered and excluded. Soft measures should target each individuals’ consideration set as this is where the most impact can be made regarding behaviour change. Respondents also highlighted factors that make them apprehensive towards certain modes, such as safety, service characteristics and administration. Interventions that focus on the socio-demographic groups that are most affected could help make these modes more appealing.","[{""name"": ""Melinda Matyas"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.12.057"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2004.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.04.009"", ""10.5771/0042-059X-2016-1-4"", ""10.1191/1478088706qp063oa"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2013.12.021"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2016.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2016.01.013"", ""10.1108/9781786359551-016"", ""10.1136/bmj.d4521"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2014.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2007.07.010"", ""10.1177/1094670517712877"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2003.08.002"", ""10.4324/9781315614311"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.277"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.273"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.08.014"", ""10.3141/2143-19"", ""10.3141/2314-04"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2006.08.007"", ""10.1023/A:1021230507071"", ""10.3141/2110-05"", ""10.3141/2542-07"", ""10.3141/2536-01"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30067-8"", ""10.1108/9780080481449"", ""10.1136/bmj.g425"", ""10.1007/s11116-018-9913-4""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting', 'Social Sciences']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Marketing']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

The numerical evaluation of aerodynamic performance for each shape search and update during the optimization process typically involves significant computational costs. Accordingly, an effective shape optimization algorithm is needed. In this study, the reinforcement learning (RL) method with deep neural network (DNN)‐based policy is utilized for the first time as a shape optimization scheme for aerodynamic mitigation of wind‐sensitive structures. In addition, “tacit” domain knowledge is leveraged to enhance the training efficiency. Both the specific direct‐domain knowledge and general cross‐domain knowledge are incorporated into the deep RL‐based aerodynamic shape optimizer via the transfer‐learning and meta‐learning techniques, respectively, to reduce the required datasets for learning an effective RL policy. Numerical examples for aerodynamic shape optimization of a tall building are used to demonstrate that the proposed knowledge‐enhanced deep RL‐based shape optimizer outperforms both gradient‐based and gradient‐free optimization algorithms.","[{""name"": ""Shaopeng Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering University at Buffalo  Buffalo NY USA""]}, {""name"": ""Reda Snaiki"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering University at Buffalo  Buffalo NY USA"", ""Department of Applied Sciences Université du Québec à Chicoutimi  Chicoutimi Québec Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Teng Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering University at Buffalo  Buffalo NY USA""]}]","[""10.3233/ICA-2010-0345"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04359-7"", ""10.3233/ICA-200632"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2015.03.011"", ""10.1061/JSDEAG.0000773"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2018.04.022"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-87479-9_39"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002199"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2018.09.013"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2018.06.006"", ""10.1109/ICNN.1995.488968"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000618"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2005)131:12(1794)"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2014.01.010"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2020.104116"", ""10.1111/mice.12425"", ""10.1109/MCI.2017.2742781"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1016/0167-6105(93)90050-X"", ""10.1109/TKDE.2009.191"", ""10.1111/0885-9507.00066"", ""10.1137/16M1082469"", ""10.1007/s00521-019-04146-4"", ""10.1002/aic.690381003"", ""10.14359/51689560"", ""10.1002/tal.1400"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2682102"", ""10.1016/S0022-460X(78)80028-5"", ""10.1038/nature24270"", ""10.3233/ICA-200631"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2017.09.030"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2019.103983"", ""10.3233/ICA-190613"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2012.04.014"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2008.02.058"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(1983)109:8(1933)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002802"", ""10.3846/13923730.2015.1068843"", ""10.1109/4235.585893"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2010.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.ast.2019.02.003"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000645"", ""10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.07.007"", ""10.1021/acscentsci.7b00492""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Aerospace Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Building and Construction']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)]]"

The use of animal fur (goat) in synthesis could assist in turning waste to wealth. Thus, potentials of animal fur in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AF-AgNPs), its biological activities and safety through cytogenotoxicity were investigated. Animal fur (1 g) was hydrolyzed with 100 ml of 0.1 M NaOH at 90 °C for 1 h, cooled and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min. The extract (1 ml) was added to 1 mM AgNO3 (40 ml) to reduce Ag+ to its nanoparticles. The AF-AgNPs was characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Larvicidal, antioxidant, anticoagulant and thrombolytic potentials of AF-AgNPs were studied. Onion bulbs (20) were exposed to 0.01, 0.10, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 μg/ml of AF-AgNPs solution for its cytogenotoxicity study with AgNO3 solution and distilled water as controls. Microscopic (24, 48 and 72 h) assessment of the onion cells and macroscopic (72 h) evaluation of the roots were also studied. The AF-AgNPs solution was brownish with surface plasmon resonance at 419 nm. Evaluation of FTIR spectra showed that protein molecules were used as capping and stabilization agents. The AF-AgNPs had size range of 11.67-31.47 nm, caused 60-100% mortality of exposed Anopheles mosquito larvae in 12 h, and scavenged DPPH (40-59%) and hydrogen peroxide (75-94%). The nanoparticles also exhibited anticoagulant and thrombolytic potentials on human blood with 25% lysis compared to 13% observed for only extract. Various chromosomal aberrations and growth inhibition were induced by AF-AgNPs especially at 72 h of 100 μg/ml. Extract from animal fur was explored in biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles and found to have high potentials as antioxidant, anticoagulant, thrombolytic agents. Inhibition of cell growth observed especially at highest concentration can be explored in anticancer drugs though with caution due to AF-AgNPs potential to induce chromosomal aberrations.","[{""name"": ""G O Akintayo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Lateef"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M A Azeez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T B Asafa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""I C Oladipo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J A Badmus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S A Ojo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J A Elegbede"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E B Gueguim-Kana"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L S Beukes"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T A Yekeen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1093/occmed/kql051"", ""10.1007/s00436-015-4800-9"", ""10.1016/j.cocis.2007.10.001"", ""10.15835/nsb929938"", ""10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.06.003"", ""10.1049/iet-nbt.2017.0299"", ""10.1007/s12649-018-0540-2"", ""10.1002/btpr.2829"", ""10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b00022"", ""10.1109/TNB.2016.2559161"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1146-0"", ""10.1515/gps-2018-0038"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0492-9"", ""10.1007/s00449-019-02193-8"", ""10.1155/2017/5919836"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2013.04.076"", ""10.1002/btpr.511"", ""10.1007/s40089-014-0133-4"", ""10.1088/0957-4484/16/10/059"", ""10.1016/S0023-6438(95)80008-5"", ""10.1016/j.lwt.2007.04.003"", ""10.4330/wjc.v7.i8.434"", ""10.1016/j.jtusci.2017.06.005"", ""10.1080/00087114.2017.1370260"", ""10.1016/j.materresbull.2011.06.025"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2008.06.051"", ""10.1016/j.matlet.2014.08.122"", ""10.1007/s13204-012-0125-5"", ""10.1007/s12247-014-9190-5"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0477-8"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2012.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.jiec.2015.03.033"", ""10.1007/s10876-016-1055-2"", ""10.1080/10826068.2018.1479864"", ""10.1055/s-0030-1254046"", ""10.1007/s00281-011-0290-8"", ""10.1016/S0049-3848(07)70143-3"", ""10.2217/nnm.13.49"", ""10.1021/nn900277t"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.06.069"", ""10.1016/S1995-7645(11)60197-1"", ""10.1007/s00436-012-2924-8"", ""10.1515/biolog-2015-0164"", ""10.33640/2405-609X.1018"", ""10.5897/AJB2013.12802"", ""10.1016/0014-4827(71)90630-6"", ""10.1508/cytologia.66.235""]",['Materials Science'],['Materials Chemistry'],"[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

Two subsamples (1519 users and 3695 non-users of car sharing) participated in a survey, translated into seven languages, with 36 questions regarding attitudes towards car sharing, the environment, political orientation, personal norms, frequency of use of different transport modes and transport mode choice for different travel purposes. Through a hierarchical cluster analysis, five distinct mobility styles were identified, with no a priori restriction of the number of clusters. The mobility styles were further characterised by sociodemographic variables and by the motives for making use of car sharing. This paper discusses the implications of research based decision-making and urban planning in a way that guarantees long-term human and environmental security.","[{""name"": ""Érika Martins Silva Ramos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cecilia Jakobsson Bergstad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Andrea Chicco"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marco Diana"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1016/j.chemolab.2007.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2004.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2004.09.008"", ""10.1038/nclimate1636"", ""10.1207/S15324834BASP2503_01"", ""10.1207/S15324834BASP2503"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2009.11.006"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.83.3.377"", ""10.1007/s11116-018-9901-8"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.10.009"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2016.01.013"", ""10.1007/BF02310555"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2014.11.001"", ""10.1007/s11116-009-9207-y"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.09.012"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2017.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2017.09.020"", ""10.1016/j.envsci.2014.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.09.024"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2008.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.12.082"", ""10.1002/ijop.12034"", ""10.1016/j.techsoc.2005.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.05.014"", ""10.1016/j.jesp.2017.10.011"", ""10.1080/00139157.2005.10524444"", ""10.1111/j.1530-2415.2003.00015.x"", ""10.1016/j.jth.2013.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2015.02.009"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2011.01.006"", ""10.1177/0013916513520416"", ""10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.06.001"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-813130-5.00003-5"", ""10.3390/en4112094"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1099-0836(199809)7:4<234::AID-BSE159>3.0.CO;2-A"", ""10.1111/j.1533-8525.2011.01198.x"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2015.10.010"", ""10.1007/s11116-016-9727-1"", ""10.1016/j.eist.2017.02.001"", ""10.1016/S0272-4944(03)00037-9"", ""10.3389/fbuil.2018.00047"", ""10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00109-8"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2019.11.013"", ""10.7312/sach17314"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2012.10.024"", ""10.1016/j.erss.2017.10.029"", ""10.1016/S0386-1112(14)60223-5"", ""10.1108/07363769910297506"", ""10.5116/ijme.4dfb.8dfd"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb00583.x"", ""10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199709/10)27:5<539::aid-ejsp831>3.3.co;2–1"", ""10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb01951.x"", ""10.1080/002075900399457"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2013.01.051"", ""10.1080/01621459.1963.10500845"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-813130-5.00002-3"", ""10.20982/tqmp.11.1.p008""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

Among the different sources, the one coming from the rail transit system will play a central concern in the following years due to its sustainability. Ground-borne vibration and noise assessment as well as techniques to mitigate them become key elements of the environmental impact and the global enlargement planned for the railway industry. This paper aims to describe and compare the different mitigation systems existing and reported in literature through a comprehensive state of the art analysis providing the performance of each measure. First, an introduction to the ground-borne vibration and noise generated from the wheel-rail contact and its propagation through the transmission path is presented. Then, the impact and the different ways of evaluating and assessing these effects are presented, and the insertion loss indicator is introduced. Next, the different mitigation measures at different levels (vehicle, track, transmission path and receiver) are discussed by describing their possible application and their efficiency in terms of insertion loss. Finally, a summary with inputs of how it is possible to address the future of mitigation systems is reported.","[{""name"": ""Slimane Ouakka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Olivier Verlinden"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Georges Kouroussis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s40726-017-0059-3"", ""10.1260/136943306777641887"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121316"", ""10.1016/j.apacoust.2010.05.007"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1996.0240"", ""10.1016/0022-460X(75)90327-2"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1996.0248"", ""10.1186/s10033-019-0375-1"", ""10.1121/1.412989"", ""10.1177/1351010X16670173"", ""10.3390/ijerph15091887"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1999.2642"", ""10.1016/0022-460X(83)90568-0"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002655"", ""10.3390/ijerph14111303"", ""10.1080/23248378.2014.897791"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2017.03.030"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.12.009"", ""10.1121/1.4983302"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1997.1025"", ""10.1631/jzus.A1800651"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.281"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2004.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.trgeo.2020.100422"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2010.11.012"", ""10.1080/23248378.2017.1399093"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.01.030"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1999.2232"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2000)126:6(531)"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1999.2647"", ""10.1002/9783433607275.ch9"", ""10.1016/S0267-7261(02)00209-9"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2012.07.011"", ""10.1177/0954406211414483"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2014.01.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44832-8_33"", ""10.1016/j.geotexmem.2019.103482"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1602274"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2008.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.07.042"", ""10.14513/actatechjaur.v9.n1.400"", ""10.1016/j.jappgeo.2019.103939"", ""10.1016/j.ultras.2012.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.wavemoti.2005.10.002"", ""10.1088/0957-4484/16/6/N01"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.109340"", ""10.1016/j.jacc.2003.07.050"", ""10.4103/1463-1741.127847"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1994.1014"", ""10.1080/00140139108964870"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2007.11.009"", ""10.1243/0954409981530689"", ""10.1080/23248378.2015.1076622"", ""10.1111/mice.12285"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2006.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2018.06.020"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2019.114949"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2020.108244"", ""10.1016/j.triboint.2020.106523"", ""10.1016/0022-460X(83)90573-4"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1996.0277"", ""10.1177/0954409711433686"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2011.09.002"", ""10.1243/0954409001531351"", ""10.1631/jzus.A1600741"", ""10.1016/j.compgeo.2019.03.028"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.105982"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2005.08.039"", ""10.1177/0954409711429210"", ""10.1243/095440904322804411"", ""10.1016/j.trgeo.2020.100348"", ""10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.069"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.11.027"", ""10.1016/S0022-460X(77)80087-4"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.039"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.08.926"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1996.0255"", ""10.1177/0954409716671549"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2019.114914"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2012.12.003"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2010.05.006"", ""10.1080/23248378.2016.1220844"", ""10.1016/j.trgeo.2019.100312"", ""10.1631/jzus.A1900680"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.12.071"", ""10.1061/JSFEAQ.0001180"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2016.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2012.03.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44832-8_63"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0207(19991020)46:5<713::AID-NME693>3.0.CO;2-U"", ""10.1016/S0003-682X(98)00031-0"", ""10.1016/0267-7261(94)90041-8"", ""10.1201/9781003209379-60"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2015.04.003"", ""10.1260/026309207783571361"", ""10.1680/grim.2007.11.4.229"", ""10.1680/navfht.29637.0010"", ""10.1680/jstbu.15.00057"", ""10.1080/23248378.2014.994260"", ""10.1016/B978-0-12-803581-8.09171-2""]",['Engineering'],"['General Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7123), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7075)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1007/s40534-020-00227-6,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Mechanical characteristic variation of ballastless track in high-speed railway: effect of train-track interaction and environment loads,"AbstractDue to the fact that ballastless tracks in high-speed railways are not only subjected to repeated train–track dynamic interaction loads, but also suffer from complex environmental loads, the fundamental understanding of mechanical performance of ballastless tracks under sophisticated service conditions is an increasingly demanding and challenging issue in high-speed railway networks. This work aims to reveal the effect of train–track interaction and environment loads on the mechanical characteristic variation of ballastless tracks in high-speed railways, particularly focusing on the typical interface damage evolution between track layers. To this end, a finite element model of a double-block ballastless track involving the cohesive zone model for the track interface is first established to analyze the mechanical properties of the track interface under the loading–unloading processes of the negative temperature gradient load (TGL) followed by the same cycle of the positive TGL. Subsequently, the effect of wheel–rail longitudinal interactions on the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the track interface is investigated by using a vehicle-slab track vertical-longitudinal coupled dynamics model. Finally, the influence of dynamic water pressure induced by vehicle dynamic load on the mechanical characteristics and damage evolution of the track interface is elucidated using a fluid–solid coupling method. Results show that the loading history of the positive and negative TGLs has a great impact on the nonlinear development and distribution of the track interface stress and damage; the interface damage could be induced by the wheel–rail longitudinal vibrations at a high vehicle running speed owing to the dynamic amplification effect caused by short wave irregularities; the vehicle dynamic load could produce considerable water pressure that presents nonlinear spatial–temporal characteristics at the track interface, which would lead to the interface failure under a certain condition due to the coupled dynamic effect of vehicle load and water pressure.","[{""name"": ""Shengyang Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jun Luo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mingze Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chengbiao Cai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.03.102"", ""10.1080/15732479.2020.1719167"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.224"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.116758"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002741"", ""10.1007/s12205-020-0671-4"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.04.017"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.01.076"", ""10.1016/j.istruc.2020.04.014"", ""10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2013.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.07.163"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.116995"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.07.089"", ""10.1177/0954409718805296"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2016.07.005"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000871"", ""10.1002/nme.93"", ""10.1016/0020-7683(95)00255-3"", ""10.1016/S1359-8368(98)00013-4"", ""10.1016/0022-5096(90)90001-K"", ""10.1016/0022-5096(92)90020-3"", ""10.1007/978-981-32-9283-3"", ""10.1080/00423110802621561"", ""10.1080/00423114.2020.1751860"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0207(19961230)39:24<4199::AID-NME39>3.0.CO;2-Y"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.01.001""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

With higher speeds and less effort needed, the e-bike is a promising mode of transport to many, and it is considered a good alternative for certain car trips by policy-makers and planners. A major limitation of many studies that investigate such substitution effects of the e-bike, is their reliance on cross-sectional data which do not allow an assessment of within-person travel mode changes. As a consequence, there is currently no consensus about the e-bike’s potential to replace car trips. Furthermore, there has been little research focusing on heterogeneity among e-bike users. In this respect, it is likely that different groups exist that use the e-bike for different reasons (e.g. leisure vs commute travel), something which will also influence possible substitution patterns. This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) it presents a statistical analysis to assess the extent to which e-bike trips are substituting trips by other travel modes based on longitudinal data; (2) it reveals different user groups among the e-bike population. A Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model is estimated using five waves of data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel. Furthermore, a Latent Class Analysis is performed using data from the Dutch national travel survey. Results show that, when using longitudinal data, the substitution effects between e-bike and the competing travel modes of car and public transport are not as significant as reported in earlier research. In general, e-bike trips only significantly reduce conventional bicycle trips in the Netherlands, which can be regarded an unwanted effect from a policy-viewpoint. For commuting, the e-bike also substitutes car trips. Furthermore, results show that there are five different user groups with their own distinct behaviour patterns and socio-demographic characteristics. They also show that groups that use the e-bike primarily for commuting or education are growing at a much higher rate than groups that mainly use the e-bike for leisure and shopping purposes.","[{""name"": ""Mathijs de Haas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maarten Kroesen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caspar Chorus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sascha Hoogendoorn-Lanser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Serge Hoogendoorn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1186/s12966-018-0751-8"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.09.007"", ""10.1207/S15328007SEM0803_5"", ""10.1016/0191-2607(87)90028-8"", ""10.1037/a0038889"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.141"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2015.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2017.04.036"", ""10.3141/2468-14"", ""10.15760/trec.197"", ""10.4135/9781412986311.n10"", ""10.4135/9781412984713"", ""10.3141/2193-04"", ""10.18637/jss.v048.i02"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2019.102202"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511499531.004"", ""10.1007/s11116-007-9118-8"", ""10.3141/2038-08"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2014.08.007""]",['Social Sciences'],['Transportation'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

Bike sharing could act as a viable alternative in the case of public transit disruptions given its flexibility and various social, environmental, and economic benefits. This study aims to estimate quantitatively the potential of bike sharing to promote transport resilience, by using autoregressive negative binomial time series model to investigate the effects of public transit closures on bike sharing demand in Washington, D.C. area during 2015–2017. We find that (1) bike sharing can act as a supplementary mode to enhance urban transport resilience in the case of complete transit closure; (2) the proximity of bike sharing docks to metro stations has a powerful effect on propensity to use a bike sharing program; and (3) extreme weather is one of major barriers to bicycling. Planners can enhance resilience of urban transport networks by fully considering the capacity and usage of bike sharing docks, as well as the coherence of metro stations and bike sharing docks, in distributing and rebalancing activities.","[{""name"": ""Lu Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhifu Mi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D’Maris Coffman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jing Meng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dining Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dongfeng Chang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3141/2140-04"", ""10.1007/s11067-017-9366-x"", ""10.1080/01441647.2020.1728419"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2008.08.002"", ""10.1080/23249935.2015.1087231"", ""10.1175/2009WCAS1014.1"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.09.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2018.12.008"", ""10.1080/01441647.2015.1033036"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2014.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.09.021"", ""10.1037/0033-2909.118.3.392"", ""10.3141/2034-01"", ""10.1007/s11067-019-09476-3"", ""10.1007/s11067-018-9401-6"", ""10.1007/s11116-018-9904-5"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2015.06.002"", ""10.1038/s41467-019-09260-4"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.11.018"", ""10.3141/2143-20"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.06.021"", ""10.3141/1636-07"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118135"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.101"", ""10.3141/2649-09""]","['Engineering', 'Social Sciences']","['Transportation', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

A multitude of investigations have been published during the years regarding solvolysis of newly produced composite laminates and known thermoset composition (epoxy, polyester, and vinyl ester). However, a real wind turbine blade is more complex and constitutes of thermosets, thermoplastics, and other materials such as balsa wood. It is a very challenging task to separate these materials from each other within the wind turbine blade structure, so the premise for recycling is a mixed waste stream where little is known about the chemical composition. In the present study, the solvolysis process for GFRPs based on sub/supercritical water at 250-370 °C and 100-170 bar process conditions with catalyst (acid and base) and additives (alcohols and glycols) was studied and optimized. The samples used are representative for End-of-Life wind turbine blades. The aim is therefore to investigate if it is possible to develop a general process that can accept all material constituents in a real wind turbine blade, resulting in recycled glass fibers and a hydrocarbon fraction that can be used as a refinery feedstock.","[{""name"": ""C Mattsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A André"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Juntikka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T Tränkle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Sott"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.04.013"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2018.08.041"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.01.004"", ""10.1007/s42452-020-2195-4"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2017.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2008.02.008"", ""10.1177/0731684414555745"", ""10.3390/pr7010022"", ""10.1016/S0032-3861(03)00324-0"", ""10.1016/j.polymer.2004.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2005.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.supflu.2014.05.015"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.10.014"", ""10.1177/0731684412453512"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.013"", ""10.1039/C5GC01048A"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.063"", ""10.1021/ie990690j"", ""10.1080/02773810902961104""]","['Materials Science', 'Engineering']","['Mechanics of Materials', 'Polymers and Plastics', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

To generate collision‐free trajectories, potential field functions are introduced to evaluate the collision risk of path candidates. However, many studies on artificial potential field approaches primarily focus on static and straight roads, and attach less importance to more complex driving scenarios, such as curving roads. In this study, a novel method based on the Frenet coordinate system is proposed to address such limitations. Moreover, to balance the driving comfortability and the driving safety of the path candidate, the path‐planning problem is converted to an optimisation problem, and sequential quadratic programming algorithm is employed to tackle this task. Another merit of this algorithm is the curvature of the generated path is continuous even at the joints of adjacent sub‐trajectories by utilising several specific properties of the Bézier curve. Furthermore, to execute the generated trajectory, a framework of velocity generation is proposed while vehicle dynamic constraints are considered. Some typical traffic scenarios, including lane‐changing, lane‐keeping, and collision avoidance have been designed to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, and simulations demonstrate the validity of this method.","[{""name"": ""Ling Zheng"", ""affiliation"": [""The State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission College of Automotive Engineering Chongqing University Chongqing 400044 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Pengyun Zeng"", ""affiliation"": [""Macro Net Communication Co., Ltd Chongqing 400044 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Wei Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""The State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission College of Automotive Engineering Chongqing University Chongqing 400044 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yinong Li"", ""affiliation"": [""The State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission College of Automotive Engineering Chongqing University Chongqing 400044 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhenfei Zhan"", ""affiliation"": [""The State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission College of Automotive Engineering Chongqing University Chongqing 400044 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1109/TIV.2015.2503342"", ""10.1109/TIV.2016.2578706"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2498841"", ""10.1002/rob.20266"", ""10.1002/rob.20255"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.01.002"", ""10.1109/MITS.2014.2306552"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2760910"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0223"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2015.0205"", ""10.1109/IVS.2011.5940531"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.312"", ""10.1146/annurev-control-060117-105157"", ""10.1109/TIE.2020.3009585"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907759"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.07.019"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2015.2493980"", ""10.1109/TVT.2016.2555853"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.12.017"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.08.029"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2302442"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2014.09.092"", ""10.1007/s10846-013-9817-7"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152860"", ""10.1007/s11370-013-0138-2"", ""10.1109/IVS.2014.6856469"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2015.02.003"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509799"", ""10.1109/TITS.2012.2198214"", ""10.1109/IVS.2015.7225840"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2003.11.004"", ""10.1109/TRO.2017.2699670"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.11.023"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795651"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2009.02.010"", ""10.1109/TASE.2009.2015886""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12079,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Vision-based vehicle speed estimation: A survey,"Abstract The need to accurately estimate the speed of road vehicles is becoming increasingly important for at least two main reasons. First, the number of speed cameras installed worldwide has been growing in recent years, as the introduction and enforcement of appropriate speed limits are considered one of the most effective means to increase the road safety. Second, traffic monitoring and forecasting in road networks plays a fundamental role to enhance traffic, emissions and energy consumption in smart cities, being the speed of the vehicles one of the most relevant parameters of the traffic state. Among the technologies available for the accurate detection of vehicle speed, the use of vision‐based systems brings great challenges to be solved, but also great potential advantages, such as the drastic reduction of costs due to the absence of expensive range sensors, and the possibility of identifying vehicles accurately. This paper provides a review of vision‐based vehicle speed estimation.

Those materials are also recognized as Thermal Protection System Materials (TPSMs). The structural materials used during the high-temperature oxidizing environment are mainly limited to SiC, oxide ceramics, and composites. In addition to that, silicon-based ceramic has a maximum-use at 1700 °C approximately; as it is an active oxidation process over low temperature and water vapor environment condition. However, a great emphasis is required for developing structural materials in oxidation and rapid heating environment where the temperature is greater than 1700 °C. This review covers briefly all main types of Thermal Protection Systems (TPSs) and all the materials are used to fabricate them with the maximum operational temperatures. Also, it covers the promised UHTMs (SiC, ZrB2, HfB2, SiB6 and B4C) which are currently using for several aerospace applications, especially for TPS. Besides, it discusses the oxidation of SiC, B4C, SiB6, ZrB2 and HfB2. Therefore, the carbides and borides of the transition metals, Zr and Hf have a high-melting temperature and good stability in forming high-melting temperature oxides.","[{""name"": ""H K M Al-Jothery"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T M B Albarody"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P S M Yusoff"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M A Abdullah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A R Hussein"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.actaastro.2004.05.034"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2016.08.003"", ""10.1134/S0036023613140039"", ""10.1007/s10697-005-0106-4"", ""10.1016/S0921-5093(02)00520-8"", ""10.1016/S0955-2219(02)00140-1"", ""10.1063/1.5075607"", ""10.1016/S0094-5765(01)00150-3"", ""10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.01.035"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2004.09.106"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2004.01170.x"", ""10.1016/j.jallcom.2015.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.compositesa.2017.07.012"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2016.02.015"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2015.08.015"", ""10.1016/j.corsci.2016.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2007.08.017"", ""10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2012.08.018"", ""10.2320/matertrans.44.401"", ""10.1016/S0920-3796(99)00007-1"", ""10.1016/0955-2219(90)90048-K"", ""10.1111/j.1151-2916.2000.tb01647.x"", ""10.1007/s11661-999-0230-6"", ""10.1016/S0955-2219(98)00071-5"", ""10.1006/jssc.1997.7316"", ""10.1007/BF00240800"", ""10.1111/j.1151-2916.2002.tb00260.x"", ""10.1111/j.1151-2916.2001.tb00714.x"", ""10.1063/1.347524"", ""10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03498.x"", ""10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.02.025"", ""10.2497/jjspm.41.1299"", ""10.1016/S0025-5408(01)00560-8"", ""10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00129-6"", ""10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2010.01.026"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01583.x"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01329.x"", ""10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00599.x""]","['Materials Science', 'Engineering']","['Materials Chemistry', 'Ceramics and Composites', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)], [('0806 冶金工程', 0.701), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6991)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Along with the fast development of high-speed railways all over the world, some commercialized lines are built for covering the remote places under harsh environment, especially in China; these environmental elements including wind, sand, rain, thunder, ice and snow need to be considered during the design of the pantograph–catenary system. The pantograph–catenary system includes the pantograph, the contact wire and the interface—pantograph slide. As the key component, this pantograph slide plays a critical role in reliable power transmission under dynamic condition. The fundamental material characteristics of the pantograph slide and contact wire such as electrical conductivity, impact resistance, wear resistance, etc., directly determine the sliding electrical contact performance of the pantograph–catenary system; meanwhile, different detection methods of the pantograph–catenary system are crucial for the reliability of service and maintenance. In addition, the challenges brought from extreme operational conditions are discussed, taking the Sichuan–Tibet Railway currently under construction as a special example with the high-altitude climate. The outlook for developing the ultra-high-speed train equipped with the novel pantograph–catenary system which can address the harsher operational environment is also involved. This paper has provided a comprehensive review of the high-speed railway pantograph–catenary systems, including its progress, challenges, outlooks in the history and future.","[{""name"": ""Guangning

Comprising the full-scale subgrade structure and all the five types of track structures adopted in Chinese high-speed railways, namely the CRTS I, the CRTS II and the CRTS III ballastless tracks, the double-block ballastless track and the ballasted track, the test platform is established strictly according to the construction standard of Chinese high-speed railways. Three kinds of effective loading methods are employed, including the real bogie loading, multi-point loading and the impact loading. Various types of sensors are adopted in different components of the five types of track–subgrade systems to measure the displacement, acceleration, pressure, structural strain and deformation, etc. Utilizing this test platform, both dynamic characteristics and long-term performance evolution of high-speed railway track–subgrade systems can be investigated, being able to satisfy the actual demand for large-scale operation of Chinese high-speed railways. As examples, three typical experimental studies are presented to elucidate the comprehensive functionalities of the full-scale multi-functional test platform for exploring the dynamic performance and its long-term evolution of ballastless track systems and for studying the long-term accumulative settlement of the ballasted track–subgrade system in high-speed railways. Some interesting phenomena and meaningful results are captured by the developed test platform, which provide a useful guidance for the scientific operation and maintenance of high-speed railway infrastructure.","[{""name"": ""Wanming Zhai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kaiyun Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhaowei Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shengyang Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chengbiao Cai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gang Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.soildyn.2014.08.003"", ""10.1080/00423119308969027"", ""10.1243/095440904322804411"", ""10.1080/00423110802621561"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2008.02.055"", ""10.1515/cee-2015-0011"", ""10.1139/t10-099"", ""10.3208/sandf.45.4_99"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2005.08.051"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2000)126:4(317)"", ""10.1177/0954409715613818"", ""10.1016/j.geotexmem.2016.03.006"", ""10.1080/23248378.2014.959083"", ""10.1177/0954409714552113"", ""10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00186-X"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2015.02.002"", ""10.1080/23248378.2013.791497"", ""10.1007/978-981-32-9283-3"", ""10.1111/mice.12285"", ""10.1080/15732479.2017.1359189"", ""10.1177/0954409716634751"", ""10.1080/23248378.2017.1279085"", ""10.1080/23248378.2017.1411212"", ""10.1177/0954409718812231""]",['Engineering'],"['General Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7123), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7075)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1007/s11116-020-10119-7,TRANSPORTATION,0814 Civil Engineering; 0823 Transportation Engineering,Do changes in the residential location lead to changes in travel attitudes? A structural equation modeling approach,"AbstractNumerous studies have found that travel attitudes might not only affect travel behavior, but also the residential location choice as people might choose a residential location based on their travel preferences and needs (i.e. transport-related residential self-selection). However, it might also be possible that the residential location and travel behavior influence attitudes towards travel. In this study—using quasi-longitudinal data—we analyze how a change in the residential environment affects attitudes towards specific modes, both directly and indirectly through changes in mode frequency (of commute and leisure trips). Using a structural equation modeling approach on 1650 recently relocated residents in the city of Ghent, Belgium, this study indicates that moving to a more urban type of neighborhood improves attitudes towards public transport and active travel. Especially for leisure trips the effects from changes in the built environment on attitudes are partly indirect through changes in mode frequency. This study offers new insights into the links between the built environment, travel behavior and attitudes. We provide further evidence that the built environment influences travel attitudes, but also indicate that these effects are partly mediated by travel mode frequency.","[{""name"": ""Jonas De Vos"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Long Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frank Witlox"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.tranpol.2011.09.009"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1007/s001680200083"", ""10.1080/01441640902808441"", ""10.1177/0042098016651569"", ""10.1007/s11116-005-7027-2"", ""10.1007/s11116-007-9132-x"", ""10.1080/01441640802539195"", ""10.1007/s11116-011-9376-3"", ""10.1068/a4114"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2005.12.004"", ""10.1007/s11116-010-9280-2"", ""10.5198/jtlu.v7i2.696"", ""10.1177/0361198106197700115"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2013.07.001"", ""10.1007/s11116-017-9812-0"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.102983"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.11.005"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2018.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.tbs.2019.04.001"", ""10.1080/15568318.2018.1456580"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.02.009"", ""10.1007/BF00168036"", ""10.1080/01944361003766766"", ""10.1177/0265813515594811"", ""10.1515/9781503620766"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.053"", ""10.1177/00139160121973241"", ""10.1023/A:1021234607980"", ""10.3141/2082-14"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2017.06.005"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(01)00046-7"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(96)00027-6"", ""10.1002/0471725277"", ""10.1080/01441647.2019.1692965"", ""10.1037/h0044335"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2005.05.002"", ""10.1080/01944360608976724"", ""10.1037/10628-000"", ""10.1093/esr/jcn048"", ""10.1023/A:1017959825565"", ""10.1016/j.tbs.2019.05.002"", ""10.1023/A:1005253813277"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.10.004"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(98)00022-8"", ""10.1080/03081060902861285"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2007.07.006"", ""10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00541-1"", ""10.1080/01441640802710812"", ""10.1007/s11135-008-9215-6"", ""10.1086/208780"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2004.11.001"", ""10.1016/0041-1647(77)90004-1"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2018.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.jth.2013.12.002"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2014.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2009.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2018.08.035"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.102540"", ""10.1007/s11116-007-9113-0"", ""10.1007/s11116-017-9783-1""]","['Social Sciences', 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance']","['Transportation', 'Economics and Econometrics']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.766), ('0714 统计学', 0.7639), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7634), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7449), ('0701 数学', 0.7423)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0202 应用经济学', 0.7539), ('0201 理论经济学', 0.7475)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12015,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Joint use of DSRC and C-V2X for V2X communications in the 5.9 GHz ITS band,"Abstract Vehicular communications networks form the backbone of cooperative intelligent transport systems to support road safety and infotainment applications amongst users. IEEE 802.11p of the Dedicated Short‐Range Communications protocol stack has been the technology of choice for Vehicle‐to‐Everything communications within the United States and Japan and has been extensively trailed in other countries such as Australia. With the advent of cellular technologies, a new, competing cellular‐based Device‐to‐Device technology, known as Cellular Vehicle‐to‐Everything Sidelink, has emerged. Considering both technologies suffer from performance limitations, there is a current debate as to which of these technologies will eventually dominate the cooperative intelligent transport systems landscape if they cannot coexist. To investigate mechanisms of spectrum sharing between Dedicated Short‐Range Communications and Cellular Vehicle‐to‐Everything for deployment in a common region, this paper initially reviews the background and technicalities of both technologies. The paper subsequently sets forth Vehicle‐to‐Everything platform models that allow not only spectrum sharing at the ITS band but also concurrent and simultaneous propagations of Dedicated Short‐Range Communications and Cellular Vehicle‐to‐Everything messages. The transmission and reception mechanisms of hybrid Vehicle‐to‐Everything platforms are verified through a describing function model.","[{""name"": ""Keyvan Ansari"", ""affiliation"": [""University of the Sunshine Coast  90 Sippy Downs Drive Sippy Downs QLD Australia""]}]","[""10.1109/TITS.2019.2902572"", ""10.1109/MVT.2017.2752798"", ""10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108535"", ""10.1109/VNC.2017.8275618"", ""10.1109/TVT.2017.2750803"", ""10.1109/VTCSpring.2018.8417885"", ""10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8691011"", ""10.1109/VNC.2017.8275637"", ""10.1016/j.adhoc.2018.03.004"", ""10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644470"", ""10.1109/MWC.2005.1452852"", ""10.1145/3161587.3161593"", ""10.1109/TVT.2011.2162755"", ""10.1109/TVT.2010.2085022"", ""10.1109/MCOM.2013.6515060"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919489"", ""10.1109/MCOMSTD.001.1900044"", ""10.1109/PIMRC.2019.8904104"", ""10.1109/COMST.2015.2440374"", ""10.1109/SIES.2018.8442086""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"
10.1057/s41278-020-00152-9,MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS,0823 Transportation Engineering,"Dry ports: research outcomes, trends, and future implications","AbstractThe concept of dry ports has gained significant interest among practitioners and researchers in the last decade. Consequently, publications on this topic have followed this development, and today there are more than 100 papers available in the Scopus and Science Direct databases, compared with only two papers in 2007. The purpose of this paper is to summarize current scientific knowledge on the phenomenon and to identify research outcomes, trends, and future research implications by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR). SLR is an explicit and reproducible method that ensures the reliability and traceability of the results. The selection of relevant papers was performed independently by each author using Rayyan QCRI software; the coding and analysis were conducted with the help of NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Findings show that the research area is largely represented by qualitative cases and optimization studies covering various aspects of dry ports. Dry port examples around the world differ based on location, functions, services, ownership, and maturity level. Although the research area is young and discrete, five main thematic areas are identified: debate on the concept, environmental impact, economic impact, performance impact, and dry ports from a network perspective.","[{""name"": ""Alena Khaslavskaya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Violeta Roso"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01441647.2017.1297868"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.073"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.06.014"", ""10.1057/mel.2011.17"", ""10.1504/WRITR.2010.034667"", ""10.1080/03081060.2015.1026103"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.026"", ""10.1080/03088839.2010.533712"", ""10.3923/jeasci.2016.145.152"", ""10.1111/jscm.12145"", ""10.1016/j.jocs.2014.10.003"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.01.012"", ""10.1108/09600031211246537"", ""10.1155/2013/309585"", ""10.1108/09600030410548541"", ""10.1016/j.iatssr.2011.06.001"", ""10.1057/mel.2011.19"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2011.08.006"", ""10.1057/s41278-017-0068-6"", ""10.1057/s41278-018-00116-0"", ""10.1016/j.ajsl.2015.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.enavi.2015.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.enavi.2017.06.003"", ""10.3390/su11051492"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2011.08.008"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2013.03.007"", ""10.1504/IJLSM.2016.079834"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2009.08.001"", ""10.2747/1539-7216.51.5.669"", ""10.1080/00343404.2010.532117"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.07.010"", ""10.1080/03088839.2018.1448478"", ""10.1016/j.enavi.2016.06.005"", ""10.1186/s13643-016-0384-4"", ""10.1504/IJSTL.2011.039381"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2015.07.008"", ""10.1504/WRITR.2013.058979"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2014.10.009"", ""10.1504/IJPMB.2013.058269"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2010.03.008"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2012.10.003"", ""10.1504/WRITR.2013.058976"", ""10.1504/WRITR.2009.026209"", ""10.1108/09600030810926493"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2007.07.001"", ""10.1057/mel.2010.5"", ""10.7225/toms.v08.n01.003"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.10.008"", ""10.1108/13598541211258609"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.12.026"", ""10.1111/1467-8551.00375"", ""10.1057/mel.2011.15"", ""10.1080/03088839.2017.1330558"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2016.04.009"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/JERA.20.235"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.07.010"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2018.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.053"", ""10.1353/tnp.2013.0013""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

On the one hand there is the need for finding a balance between the preservation of the aesthetic appearance and the historical values, but on the other hand, finding the space where to effectively integrate the systems might be quite challenging. The solar systems can be divided in photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal (ST) systems. Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) and Building Integrated Solar Thermal (BIST) are PV or ST panels integrated into the building envelope, combining the energy generation with other functions, such as noise, weather protection, thermal insulation, sun shadow, and other aspects. Nowadays, the dynamism of the market allows to design highly compatible products which look like traditional architecture materials. This situation fosters the integration of these products in the BIPV and BIST systems within the heritage sites, especially thanks to the use of advanced customisation processes, special and low-reflecting glasses, and innovative cost-competitive coatings. There is a limited number of studies on the application of these technologies in heritage contexts, due to the presence of architectonic, conservative, and cultural barriers. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the available literature on the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in heritage sites and buildings, which would foster the preservation of their cultural and natural values as well as reducing primary energy consumption, increasing comfort levels, minimizing environmental impacts, and improving technical quality and economical outlays. A common framework will thus defined to support restorers, historic conservators, and energy experts and to facilitate the diffusion and application of RES in heritage contexts. This conceptual framework will provide industries and academics with operative strategies and will encourage their diffusion and application in sensible contexts.","[{""name"": ""E Lucchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C S Polo Lopez"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Franco"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.08.085"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.07.058""]","['Arts and Humanities', 'Energy', 'Engineering']","['Conservation', 'Building and Construction', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('1301 艺术学', 0.685), ('0501 中国语言文学', 0.684), ('0502 外国语言文学', 0.6758), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.6679), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.667)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0907 林学', 0.7354), ('0910 水土保持与荒漠化防治学', 0.7254)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"
10.1049/iet-est.2020.0041,IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering,Research on deep learning method for rail surface defect detection,"Rail surface defect detection plays a critical role in the maintenance of the rail transportation system. Video analysis technology is a promising method to detect defects due to its low cost and effectiveness. Several attempts with hand‐craft features have been made to obtain the detection results by using traditional machine vision algorithms. However, these methods suffer from imprecise results due to challenging conditions, such as deteriorated and changeable lighting environment and various types of complex rail surface defects. Recently, classification methods with complex deep convolutional networks have become popular. Despite their high accuracy, these methods cannot meet the requirements of defects localisation and real‐time processing in practice. To solve these problems, this study proposes a novel object detection algorithm to detect rail defects. The net architecture of the proposed algorithm includes a backbone network using MobileNet and several novel detection layers with multi‐scale feature maps inspired by you only look once (YOLO) and feature pyramid networks. Two different architectures of MobileNet are used to estimate the performance of defects detection. The experimental results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed algorithm with fast inference speed and high accuracy in the industry.","[{""name"": ""Jiang Hua Feng"", ""affiliation"": [""CRRC Zhuzhou Institute Co., Ltd Shidai Road Zhuzhou People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Hao Yuan"", ""affiliation"": [""CRRC Zhuzhou Institute Co., Ltd Shidai Road Zhuzhou People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yun Qing Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""CRRC Zhuzhou Institute Co., Ltd Shidai Road Zhuzhou People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Jun Lin"", ""affiliation"": [""CRRC Zhuzhou Institute Co., Ltd Shidai Road Zhuzhou People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Shi Wang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""CRRC Zhuzhou Institute Co., Ltd Shidai Road Zhuzhou People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiao Luo"", ""affiliation"": [""CRRC Zhuzhou Institute Co., Ltd Shidai Road Zhuzhou People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1063/1.1570217"", ""10.1016/j.ndteint.2008.12.008"", ""10.1109/TSMCC.2007.893278"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2016.2615333"", ""10.3788/OPE.20162407.1772"", ""10.1109/TIM.2012.2184959"", ""10.1007/s11771-016-3350-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-14249-4_64"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727522"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.123"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2014.81"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.169"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.690"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00474"", ""10.1007/s11263-009-0275-4""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Computational Mechanics']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)]]"

This study proposes an adaptive fault‐tolerant tracking control for USVs in the presence of input saturations and error constraints. A tan‐type barrier Lyapunov function is utilised for the error constraints and the neural networks are employed to treat the model uncertainty. Moreover, the adaptive technique combined with the backstepping method not only enables the actuator fault‐tolerant controller to address the fault effects but also handles the external disturbances and input saturations. The proposed control approach can track the desired trajectory with error constraints and the system is guaranteed to be uniformly bounded under certain actuator failure. Numerical simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of this control strategy.","[{""name"": ""Hongde Qin"", ""affiliation"": [""Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Laboratory, Harbin Engineering University Harbin 150001 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Chengpeng Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Laboratory, Harbin Engineering University Harbin 150001 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yanchao Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle Laboratory, Harbin Engineering University Harbin 150001 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2017.12.054"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2779442"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2793338"", ""10.3390/app8071024"", ""10.1109/TVT.2017.2760367"", ""10.1002/rob.21452"", ""10.1515/ijnaoe-2015-0058"", ""10.1007/s40815-017-0387-x"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2015.12.085"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2016.11.024"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2016.2554621"", ""10.1080/00207721.2016.1193255"", ""10.1109/TCST.2013.2281211"", ""10.1109/TSMC.2017.2717850"", ""10.1002/rnc.3596"", ""10.1109/TSMC.2018.2854770"", ""10.1007/s40815-017-0396-9"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2017.2756110"", ""10.1007/s12555-017-0292-y"", ""10.1109/TCST.2017.2728518"", ""10.1109/TCSI.2017.2763625"", ""10.1109/TIE.2016.2590993"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817345"", ""10.1109/TSMC.2017.2758902"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2783319"", ""10.1002/rnc.3324"", ""10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007810"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2008.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2018.10.029"", ""10.1109/TAC.2019.2908699"", ""10.1109/TCST.2006.872507""]",['Engineering'],['Control and Systems Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

The review explores the nature and frequency of transit crime and passengers’ safety perceptions in transport nodes and along the trip using bibliometric analysis and a systematic review of the literature. The number of retrieved documents was 3137, and 245 were selected for in-depth analysis. Transit safety as a research area took off after the mid-1990s and peaked after the 2010s. The body of research is dominated by the English-language literature (mostly large cities), with a focus on the safety of rail-bound environments and examples of interventions to improve actual and perceived safety for public transportation (PT) users. Highlighting the importance of transit environments along the whole trip, the article also helps advocate for more inclusion of passengers’ safety needs and the involvement of multiple stakeholders in implementing PT policies.","[{""name"": ""Vania Ceccato"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nathan Gaudelet"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gabin Graf"", ""affiliation"":

These machines need to achieve high power densities while reducing electrical heat losses to minimize the required cryogenic power and subsequent additional weight. Hydrogen powered all-electric planes provide a design space where ac losses are manageable. However, the high electrical frequencies in high-speed fully superconducting machines pose a significant challenge to reducing armature ac losses. In high-speed applications, coupling loss in the SC armature coils dominates and becomes a barrier for practical application of these machines. In this paper a fully superconducting machine is proposed for a hydrogen powered regional all-electric plane. An air core design is considered utilizing low ac loss MgB2 wires. The design is targeted to achieve 50 kW/kg specific power while requiring ac losses to be less than 3 kW. This study explores the possibility of replacing a passive iron shield with active shielding coils to contain the magnetic flux inside the machine while reducing weight and increasing power density. The study focuses on minimizing weight as well as ac losses in the armature coils. An optimization algorithm is used to determine the trade-offs between iron shield and active shield coil designs. Results show that optimal designs for electric propulsion eliminate the passive shield in favor of active shielding coils - increasing the power density of the machine while maintaining the outside flux density below standard safety limits.","[{""name"": ""T Balachandran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N Salk"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K S Haran"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/ESARS-ITEC.2018.8607734"", ""10.2514/6.2018-5000"", ""10.1109/TASC.2019.2906655"", ""10.1109/TASC.2018.2823503"", ""10.1109/PECI.2015.7064939"", ""10.1109/IEMDC.2015.7409294"", ""10.1109/TASC.2017.2651118""]","['Engineering', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Condensed Matter Physics']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0702 物理学', 0.731), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7181)]]"

In this paper, we analyse the working conditions, earnings, and job satisfaction of ride-hailing drivers. We begin by discussing the regulatory, labour, financial, and urban mobility effects of ride-hailing companies. Then, we present the results of a self-administered survey to ride-hailing drivers in Chile, which is complemented with the use of online tools for the estimation of driving earnings. Our findings show that the flexibility to choose work times is the most appreciated attribute of this job, even though most drivers follow a somewhat fixed routine each week. By contrast, the level of transparency with which ride-hailing apps determine driver pay is the attribute with the lowest satisfaction score. A large number of respondents drive for long daily and weekly periods, which is a health and safety hazard. Current drivers are not concerned about the future deployment of driverless vehicles for on-demand mobility services. Ordered probit models for job satisfaction show that ride-hailing was better evaluated by drivers who use it as a complement to another part-time job, by those who earn more money per week, and by those who have not experienced undesirable situations while working, such as harassment or traffic crashes.","[{""name"": ""Andrés Fielbaum"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alejandro Tirachini"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.2139/ssrn.3410623"", ""10.1016/j.tbs.2020.04.002"", ""10.3141/2650-10"", ""10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.05.006"", ""10.1177/001979391206500203"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2890666"", ""10.1145/2940716.2940798"", ""10.1145/2815675.2815681"", ""10.3386/w23296"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2013.03.002"", ""10.1016/S0927-5371(97)00010-9"", ""10.1016/S0927-5371(01)00031-8"", ""10.3386/w22083"", ""10.1111/1467-923X.12373"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aau2670"", ""10.1016/S0001-4575(97)00025-0"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.232"", ""10.1080/00036840500392987"", ""10.1145/2858036.2858476"", ""10.1016/j.labeco.2010.04.002"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511845062"", ""10.1177/0019793917717222"", ""10.1002/asi.23552"", ""10.1007/s11116-018-9923-2"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2018.01.012"", ""10.1016/S0927-5371(03)00053-8"", ""10.1016/j.labeco.2009.02.003"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2012.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.10.004"", ""10.2139/ssrn.2608017"", ""10.22381/JSME4320161"", ""10.1080/15568318.2019.1584932"", ""10.1007/s11116-019-10070-2"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2019.07.008"", ""10.1080/15568318.2018.1539146"", ""10.1016/j.shaw.2018.01.003"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2019.03.005"", ""10.1080/0022250X.2015.1112384"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.07.010""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Sociology and Political Science', 'Marketing']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0302 政治学', 0.7685), ('0303 社会学', 0.7605)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

It can improve public health and make cities more active and environmentally friendly. Due to the significant net benefits, many local governments in Scotland have promoted cycling. Glasgow City Council constructed four significant pieces of cycling infrastructure between 2013 and 2015, partly in preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games and partly to encourage cycling more generally. This required substantial capital investment. However, the effectiveness of these big new infrastructure investments has not been well examined, mostly due to data limitations. In this study, we utilised data from the activity tracking app Strava for the years 2013–2016 and fixed effects panel data regression models to examine whether the new cycling infrastructure has increased cycling volumes on these routes. Our results show that three of the infrastructure projects have a positive effect on the monthly total volume of cycling trips made by users of the app, with flows up by around 12% to 18%. Although this result is promising, it needs to be interpreted with care due to the characteristics of the data.","[{""name"": ""Jinhyun Hong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Philip McArthur"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mark Livingston"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/1467-9531.00117"", ""10.1007/s11116-011-9355-8"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2008.11.001"", ""10.1136/bmj.j1456"", ""10.1289/ehp.0901747"", ""10.1016/j.tmp.2013.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.08.030"", ""10.2105/AJPH.2014.302059"", ""10.1016/j.jth.2016.06.006"", ""10.1080/21650020.2014.955210"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.01.014"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9488(2009)135:2(66)"", ""10.1080/12265934.2014.1002523"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2018.11.018"", ""10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.04.010"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0838.2011.01299.x"", ""10.1016/j.healthplace.2016.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.09.011"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.11.017"", ""10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007945"", ""10.3390/ijerph14060644"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2012.01.006"", ""10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61714-1"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2015.10.025""]","['Social Sciences', 'Psychology']","['Transportation', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1049/iet-est.2018.5080,IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering,Optimal infrastructure planning for EV fast-charging stations based on prediction of user behaviour,"Electric vehicles (EVs) appear to offer a promising solution to support sustainable transportation and the reduction of CO 2 emissions in the metropolitan areas. To satisfy the EV load demand of the new EV models with larger battery capacities, public direct‐current fast‐charging stations (DCFCSs) are essential to recharge EVs rapidly. A stochastic planning method of the DCFCSs is presented considering user behaviour and the probabilistic driving patterns in order to predict EVs charging demand. According to the stochastic method, a coordinated charging demand and storage charging demand are proposed with the objective of minimising peak load from EVs and charging‐infrastructure costs. The proposed planning method can prevent additional grid‐reinforcement costs due to EV demand during peak hours. In the coordinated charging demand, the peak load from EVs is managed by controlling the DCFCSs. Instead, in the battery energy storage (BES) charging demand, an optimal BES is proposed as an alternative solution to reduce the peak demand of EVs as well as DCFCSs operational costs. Finally, an economic analysis is carried out to evaluate the technical and economic aspects related to DCFCSs, the BES life‐cycle costs as well as the financial performance of BES costs versus grid‐reinforcement costs.","[{""name"": ""Marjan Gjelaj"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering Technical University of Denmark 2800 Kgs.

10.1049/els2.12026,IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering,Onboard energy storage in rail transport: Review of real applications and techno-economic assessments,"Abstract Despite low energy and fuel consumption levels in the rail sector, further improvements are being pursued by manufacturers and operators. Their primary efforts aim to reduce traction energy demand, replace diesel, and limit the impact of electrified overhead infrastructures. From a system‐level perspective, the integration of alternative energy sources on board rail vehicles has become a popular solution among rolling stock manufacturers. Surveys are made of many recent realizations of multimodal rail vehicles with onboard electrochemical batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen fuel cell systems. The ratings, technical features, and operating data of onboard sources are gathered for each application, and a comparison among different technologies is presented. Traction system architectures and energy‐control strategies of actual multimodal units are explored and compared with literature research. Moreover, the maturity and potential of recent technologies and alternative topologies of power converters for multimodal traction systems are discussed. Ultimately, onboard storage systems are compared with other solutions for energy‐saving and catenary‐free operation, with particular focus on their current techno‐economic attractiveness as an alternative to diesel propulsion.","[{""name"": ""Emanuele Fedele"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e Tecnologie dell'Informazione Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II  Naples Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Diego Iannuzzi"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e Tecnologie dell'Informazione Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II  Naples Italy""]}, {""name"": ""Andrea Del Pizzo"", ""affiliation"": [""Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e Tecnologie dell'Informazione Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II  Naples Italy""]}]","[""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.01.060"", ""10.1109/tte.2020.2996362"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.118987"", ""10.1002/er.4795"", ""10.1109/tpel.2015.2411996"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.128"", ""10.1109/tvt.2017.2747135"", ""10.1109/tpel.2013.2253492"", ""10.1109/EPEPEMC.2016.7752014"", ""10.3390/en11020423"", ""10.23919/ICEMS50442.2020.9291012"", ""10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2018.10.037"", ""10.1049/iet‐est.2013.0031"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.980"", ""10.3390/en12061092"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.06.039"", ""10.1109/PCCON.2007.373143"", ""10.1002/tee.20279"", ""10.1002/tee.20532"", ""10.1002/tee.20534"", ""10.1109/VPPC.2010.5728994"", ""10.1109/IPEC.2014.6869881"", ""10.1109/IPEC.2010.5542319"", ""10.1109/EPE.2016.7695286"", ""10.1109/PESC.2004.1355828"", ""10.1109/EPE.2007.4417400"", ""10.1109/VPPC.2010.5729152"", ""10.1002/9781118954454"", ""10.1109/VPPC.2009.5289693"", ""10.1016/S1464-2859(17)30099-8"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2871792"", ""10.3390/ma12121973"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.11.090"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.07.058"", ""10.1049/iet-est.2012.0051"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.12.081"", ""10.1109/TIE.2009.2034173"", ""10.1109/TVT.2014.2305593"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.035"", ""10.1109/CPE.2017.7915255"", ""10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309851"", ""10.23919/IPEC.2018.8507944"", ""10.23919/ICEMS50442.2020.9290864"", ""10.7567/jjap.54.04dp07"", ""10.1109/ECCE.2017.8095885"", ""10.1109/TTE.2017.2765518"", ""10.1002/tee.23121"", ""10.1109/TTE.2018.2792330"", ""10.1109/TIE.2005.843973"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2010.2042303"", ""10.1109/ECCE.2015.7310179"", ""10.1109/ESARS.2012.6387415"", ""10.1109/TPEL.2018.2846622"", ""10.1109/IEMDC.2007.382676"", ""10.1109/TVT.2012.2191987"", ""10.1109/TVT.2011.2116050"", ""10.1109/ITEC.2017.7993356"", ""10.1109/APEC.2018.8341086"", ""10.1109/TTE.2017.2703583"", ""10.1109/ESARS.2010.5665214"", ""10.1109/TIA.2016.2555790"", ""10.1109/ESARS.2010.5665264"", ""10.1049/iet-est.2014.0049"", ""10.1109/TVT.2017.2780924"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.088"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.11.195"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.08.157""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"
10.1007/s12469-022-00301-8,PUBLIC TRANSPORT,0823 Transportation Engineering,Robustness and disturbances in public transport,"AbstractNetwork-based systems are at the core of our everyday life. Whether it is electronic networking, electricity grids or transportation, users expect the networks to function properly and provide a feeling of safety and security. However, there may be disturbances. In this paper, we consider disturbances in the context of public transportation. The focus in this respect is on public transport planning and operations. To classify and cope with disturbances, one can find many ideas, including robustness, resilience, vulnerability, disruption mitigation or delay management. We survey related streams of literature and put them into perspective. As a major insight we show that different strands of literature exist that may benefit from becoming better connected and intertwined. Together with recent advances in information technology and solution methods, more integrated problem settings incorporating robustness and disturbances can play a major role in future planning and operations.","[{""name"": ""Liping Ge"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Stefan Voß"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lin Xie"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1287/inte.1050.0158"",

10.1049/iet-its.2019.0458,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0711 Systems Science; 0823 Transportation Engineering,Online estimation of inertial parameter for lightweight electric vehicle using dual unscented Kalman filter approach,"Accurate knowledge of vehicle inertial parameters (e.g. vehicle mass and yaw moment of inertia) is essential to manage vehicle potential trajectories and improve vehicle active safety. For lightweight electric vehicles (LEVs), whose control performance of dynamics system can be substantially affected due to the drastic reduction of vehicle weights and body size, such knowledge is even more critical. This study proposes a dual unscented Kalman filter (DUKF) approach, where two UKFs run in parallel to simultaneously estimate vehicle states and parameters such as vehicle velocity, vehicle sideslip angle, and inertial parameters. The proposed method only utilises real‐time measurements from torque information of in‐wheel motor and sensors in a standard car. The four‐wheel non‐linear vehicle dynamics model considering payload variations is developed, local observability of the DUKF observer is analysed and derived via differential geometry theory. To address the non‐linearities in vehicle dynamics, the DUKF and dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF) are also presented and compared. Simulations with various manoeuvres are carried out using the platform of MATLAB/Simulink‐Carsim ® . Simulation results of MATLAB/Simulink‐Carsim ® show that the proposed DUKF method can effectively estimate inertial parameters of LEV under different payloads. Moreover, the investigation reveals that the proposed DUKF approach has better performance of estimating vehicle inertial parameters compared with the DEKF method.","[{""name"": ""Xianjian Jin"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation Shanghai University Shanghai 200072 People's Republic of China"", ""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control Jilin University Changchun 130025 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Junpeng Yang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation Shanghai University Shanghai 200072 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yanjun Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Case Western Reserve University Cleveland Heights OH 44106 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Bing Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control Jilin University Changchun 130025 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiadong Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation Shanghai University Shanghai 200072 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Guodong Yin"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical Engineering Southeast University Nanjing 211189 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1109/TIE.2016.2613838"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2754140"", ""10.1080/00423114.2013.773453"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2007.910075"", ""10.1080/00423114.2013.879190"", ""10.1109/TVT.2010.2045520"", ""10.1016/j.jfranklin.2017.07.006"", ""10.1177/0954407014560419"", ""10.1115/1.4031629"", ""10.1016/j.conengprac.2017.12.001"", ""10.1109/TVT.2015.2498949"", ""10.1109/TVT.2019.2907696"", ""10.1016/j.arcontrol.2018.04.011"", ""10.1080/00423114.2013.859281"", ""10.1109/TIE.2012.2208436"", ""10.1049/iet-cta.2015.1030"", ""10.1080/00423114.2014.918629"", ""10.1109/TVT.2013.2260190"", ""10.1007/s12239-015-0068-4"", ""10.1177/0954407017701284"", ""10.1109/ISIE.2004.1571831"", ""10.1109/TITS.2012.2196796"", ""10.1080/00423114.2014.960430"", ""10.1109/TCST.2010.2043104"", ""10.1109/TCST.2017.2746060"", ""10.1080/00423110902721824"", ""10.1016/j.jfranklin.2016.09.020"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896588"", ""10.1016/j.isatra.2019.03.002"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2724138"", ""10.3390/s19194289"", ""10.1080/00423114.2018.1517219"", ""10.1115/1.4007554"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.08.015"", ""10.1243/09544070JAUTO991"", ""10.1080/00423110903406656"", ""10.1080/00423110500385949"", ""10.3182/20110828-6-IT-1002.03379"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2164246"", ""10.3390/en10010074"", ""10.1007/978-1-4757-2101-0"", ""10.1109/TAC.2018.2798806""]",['Engineering'],['Automotive Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

The objective of this paper is to review microplastics and analyze its possible impact on wildlife and seabird. Seabirds are upper-trophic level predators in marine ecosystems, feed on zooplankton, fish, and squid. Microplastics in seabirds have been reported in many countries, including the USA, Canada, Brazil, Japan, China, the Netherlands, and North Pacific region, involving albatrosses, petrels, storm-petrels, fulmars, cormorants, shearwaters, penguins, and many other seabird species. Microplastics were accidentally ingested because of their resemblance to the fish, plankton, or from ingestion of microplastics that already occurred inside fish food. Types of microplastics were pellet, fragment, film, fiber, foamed plastic and styrofoam. Microplastics might decrease feeding stimuli by producing a false sense of fullness, causing the bird to stop eating, resulting in malnutrition and death. Other harmful impact on birds are interrupting nutrient absorption, disrupting reproductive problems, and hindered growth and survival of chicks. Study on microplastics in Indonesia is in progress, by using Little-black cormorant to represent seabirds.","[{""name"": ""N K Y Susanti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Mardiastuti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Y Wardiatno"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.09.025"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0193308"", ""10.1021/es2031505"", ""10.5772/intechopen.71494"", ""10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.031"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2004.05.006"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2008.10.018"", ""10.3354/meps037295"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2010.03.008"", ""10.1590/S1516-89132009000200011"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.112"", ""10.1098/rstb.2008.0242""]",['Environmental Science'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Pollution']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)]]"
10.1007/s40534-020-00209-8,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Running safety assessment of a train traversing a three-tower cable-stayed bridge under spatially varying ground motion,"AbstractTo explore the influence of spatially varying ground motion on the dynamic behavior of a train passing through a three-tower cable-stayed bridge, a 3D train–track–bridge coupled model is established for accurately simulating the train–bridge interaction under earthquake excitation, which is made up of a vehicle model built by multi-body dynamics, a track–bridge finite element model, and a 3D rolling wheel–rail contact model. A conditional simulation method, which takes into consideration the wave passage effect, incoherence effect, and site-response effect, is adopted to simulate the spatially varying ground motion under different soil conditions. The multi-time-step method previously proposed by the authors is also adopted to improve computational efficiency. The dynamic responses of the train running on a three-tower cable-stayed bridge are calculated with differing earthquake excitations and train speeds. The results indicate that (1) the earthquake excitation significantly increases the responses of the train–bridge system, but at a design speed, all the running safety indices meet the code requirements; (2) the incoherence and site-response effects should also be considered in the seismic analysis for long-span bridges though there is no fixed pattern for determining their influences; (3) different train speeds that vary the vibration characteristics of the train–bridge system affect the vibration frequencies of the car body and bridge.","[{""name"": ""Wei Gong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhihui Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ruitao Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yongjiu Tang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lizhong Jiang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00423114.2019.1605085"", ""10.1080/23248378.2018.1503975"", ""10.1007/987-981-32-9283-3"", ""10.2749/101686613X13439149156886"", ""10.1080/19373260.2013.832640"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.08.107"", ""10.1016/S0141-0296(03)00080-4"", ""10.3233/BRS-170110"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2008.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.08.051"", ""10.1007/s13296-016-0104-x"", ""10.1007/s12206-010-0812-7"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2008.05.012"", ""10.1002/eqe.594"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2015.01.004"", ""10.1061/(asce)be.1943-5592.0001046"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1096-9845(199601)25:1<99::AID-EQE540>3.0.CO;2-C"", ""10.1016/j.probengmech.2011.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2010.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.probengmech.2011.09.002"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2000)126:4(398)"", ""10.1002/eqe.4290210805"", ""10.1002/eqe.562"", ""10.1177/1369433217691775"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2017.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2019.01.036"", ""10.4324/9780203491683"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(1995)121:7(801)"", ""10.1080/00423110412331315178"", ""10.1080/23248378.2013.791498"", ""10.1142/S021945541350065X"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2013.03.047"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-2039-1"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2012.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2003.11.005"", ""10.1002/eqe.831""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12035,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Impact of connected vehicle environment on driving performance: A case of an extra-long tunnel scenario,"Abstract In view of the benefits and a promising prospect of the emerging connected vehicles (CV), more and more vehicles will be equipped with the in‐vehicle human‐machine interface (HMI). This study aims to assess the comprehensive impacts of HMIs on individual driving performance, traffic safety, and eco‐driving behaviour based on a driving simulator. In order to explore how a driver responds to warnings when approaching a tunnel, this study divided the experimental road into five zones according to warning positions. A comparative analysis was conducted to examine the changes in driving comfort, speeding behaviour, the standard deviation of speed, time headway (THW), fuel consumption, and emissions. Results showed that the HMI could be beneficial to speed adjustment before entering a tunnel. Meanwhile, HMI may affect the THW of vehicles. Drivers were usually more cautious when the HMI was on. However, no significant effects of the HMI for driving comfort and eco‐driving behaviour can be observed. It is expected that more efficient technology and different warning strategies can be developed to enhance eco‐safe driving for different zones because they have different effects. The findings of this study are also helpful for active safety management and for evaluating the effectiveness of CV systems.","[{""name"": ""Xin Chang"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Engineering Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jian Rong"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Engineering Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Haijian Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Engineering Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Yiping Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Engineering Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaohua Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Key Laboratory of Traffic Engineering Beijing University of Technology  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.trf.2006.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2012.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2019.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.04.030"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.869"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2018.04.002"", ""10.1504/IJGENVI.2008.017266"", ""10.1016/j.iatssr.2016.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2019.03.018"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2017.04.020"", ""10.1080/19439962.2016.1173155"", ""10.3141/2518-08"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.959"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2014.03.014"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2018.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.tust.2013.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2016.02.005"", ""10.1155/2014/429657"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.959"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2016.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2011.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.05.010"", ""10.3141/2365-03"", ""10.3141/1803-01"", ""10.1518/0018720024497925"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2017.02.013"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.12.012"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2007.07.001"", ""10.1155/2019/9468451"", ""10.1109/JSYST.2020.3015553"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2018.02.027"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2014.12.004"", ""10.1155/2018/9058674"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2016.04.024"", ""10.1145/3003715.3005458"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2019.04.020"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2019.04.019"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2013.02.024"", ""10.3141/1740-22"", ""10.1006/jsvi.2001.4256"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.030"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2006.11.008"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2017.12.012"", ""10.1518/001872097778543930"", ""10.1518/0018720024497925""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

To study the effects of the contact model and applied particle shape on the ballast performance (shear strength and deformation), the direct shear test (DST) model and the large-scale process simulation test (LPST) model were developed on the basis of two types of contact models, namely the rolling resistance linear (RRL) model and the linear contact (LC) model. Particle shapes are differentiated by clumps. A clump is a sphere assembly for one ballast particle. The results show that compared with the typical LC model, the RRL method is more efficient and realistic to predict shear strength results of ballast assemblies in DSTs. In addition, the RRL contact model can also provide accurate vertical and lateral ballast deformation under the cyclic loading in LPSTs.","[{""name"": ""Yunlong Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Chunfa Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Valeri Markine"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Can Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guoqing Jing"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wanming Zhai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/23248378.2017.1279085"", ""10.1007/s40534-020-00203-0"", ""10.1201/9780429504242"", ""10.1201/b18982"", ""10.1080/23248378.2019.1570477"", ""10.1080/23248378.2020.1737256"", ""10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00186-X"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2015.01.316"", ""10.1080/23248378.2017.1411212"", ""10.1080/00423114.2018.1458992"", ""10.1007/s10035-018-0795-0"", ""10.1007/s10035-006-0006-2"", ""10.1016/j.powtec.2014.05.052"", ""10.1016/j.compgeo.2019.02.010"", ""10.1016/j.compgeo.2015.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.compgeo.2013.09.008"", ""10.1080/23248378.2013.788361"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2019.01.017"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.07.225"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0000871"", ""10.1007/s10035-004-0189-3"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.06.096"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.01.023"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.07.095"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0001403"", ""10.1007/s10035-006-0021-3"", ""10.1016/j.compgeo.2017.10.011"", ""10.1007/s10035-016-0660-y"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2011.03.019"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-1926-5_136"", ""10.1016/j.compgeo.2016.12.034"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.geotexmem.2012.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2014.11.012"", ""10.1016/j.trgeo.2020.100341"", ""10.3208/sandf.43.4_35"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002199"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.10.045""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The vehicle–track coupled system is established in light of vehicle–track coupled dynamics theory. The physical characteristics and mechanical behavior of tunnel segments and rings are modeled by the finite element method, while the soil layers of the vehicle–track–tunnel (VTT) system are modeled as an assemblage of 3-D mapping infinite elements by satisfying the boundary conditions at the infinite area. With novelty, the tunnel components, such as rings and segments, have been coupled to the vehicle–track systems using a matrix coupling method for finite elements. The responses of sub-systems included in the VTT interaction are obtained simultaneously to guarantee the solution accuracy. To relieve the computer storage and save the CPU time for the large-scale VTT dynamics system with high degrees of freedoms, a cyclic calculation method is introduced. Apart from model validations, the necessity of considering the tunnel substructures such as rings and segments is demonstrated. In addition, the maximum number of elements in the tunnel segment is confirmed by numerical simulations.","[{""name"": ""Lei Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wanming Zhai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.tust.2020.103423"", ""10.1016/j.autcon.2019.103050"", ""10.1080/19648189.2020.1837251"", ""10.3141/2476-02"", ""10.1007/s12205-015-0406-0"", ""10.1098/rspa.2005.1450"", ""10.1080/00423114.2018.1444182"", ""10.1016/j.compgeo.2016.08.005"", ""10.1007/s00707-018-2330-0"", ""10.1016/j.compgeo.2019.103150"", ""10.1063/1.1728759"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2005.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2014.07.020"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2019.114914"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2006.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2005.04.007"", ""10.1080/23248378.2019.1591312"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2011.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2015.01.021"", ""10.1007/978-981-32-9283-3"", ""10.1016/j.apm.2019.04.037"", ""10.1080/00423114.2020.1847298"", ""10.1002/nme.1620210705"", ""10.1177/1077546317731005""]",['Engineering'],"['General Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7123), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7075)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

This work investigates four technological concepts for the rollout of electric buses from a technical and economic perspective: very fast and moderate opportunity charging, overnight charging and trolley hybrid buses (power supply via catenary/battery). The investigations fund on real demonstrations in four European cities. They were carried out in direct cooperation with the respective public transport operators to obtain realistic results. The focus of this work is on an economic comparison based on the total cost of ownership (TCO), including all investment and operating costs in the bus service. Thereby, the battery represents a major asset and is examined more closely, especially with regard to the expected service life. The TCO of corresponding electric and diesel buses, scaled up to a complete line, are directly compared. This includes penalty costs for the emissions of noise and pollutants. Sensitivity analyses on the most relevant variables are conducted to take into account risks and uncertainties. It shows that electric buses can nowadays already be economically competitive under favourable assumptions, regardless of the concept. Trolley hybrid buses turned out to be the most cost‐effective variant in their respective country.","[{""name"": ""Fabian Meishner"", ""affiliation"": [""Chair for Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage Systems Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA) RWTH Aachen University Jägerstrasse 17–19 52066 Aachen Germany"", ""Jülich Aachen Research Alliance JARA‐Energy Templergraben 55 52056 Aachen Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Dirk Uwe Sauer"", ""affiliation"": [""Chair for Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage Systems Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA) RWTH Aachen University Jägerstrasse 17–19 52066 Aachen Germany"", ""Jülich Aachen Research Alliance JARA‐Energy Templergraben 55 52056 Aachen Germany"", ""Helmholtz Institute Münster (HI MS) IEK‐12, Forschungszentrum Jülich 52425 Jülich Germany"", ""Institute for Power Generation and Storage Systems (PGS) E.ON ERC RWTH Aachen University Mathieustrasse 10 52074 Aachen Germany""]}]","[""10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.066"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2018.09.011"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2015.04.001"", ""10.1109/T-AIEE.1949.5059952"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.08.056""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)]]"

Model learning requires large amounts of training data; however, collecting sufficient samples is a challenge in the event of traffic incidents. To address this challenge, large amounts of traffic data were generated by performing traffic simulations under various traffic incidents. These data were used as training data, and a deep learning model with graph convolution and input of traffic incident information features was proposed. Subsequently, the prediction accuracy was compared with other models such as long short‐term memory, which is typically used in traffic prediction. The results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed model in representing phenomena with strong spatio‐temporal dependencies, such as traffic flow, and its effectiveness in traffic prediction.","[{""name"": ""Shota Fukuda"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo 7‐3‐1 Hongo, Bunkyo Tokyo 113‐8656 Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Hideaki Uchida"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo 7‐3‐1 Hongo, Bunkyo Tokyo 113‐8656 Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Hideki Fujii"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo 7‐3‐1 Hongo, Bunkyo Tokyo 113‐8656 Japan""]}, {""name"": ""Tomonori Yamada"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo 7‐3‐1 Hongo, Bunkyo Tokyo 113‐8656 Japan""]}]","[""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.02.022"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.10.002"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-32460-4"", ""10.3141/1644-14"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:6(664)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2007)133:3(180)"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.10.011"", ""10.1111/mice.12450"", ""10.1137/1.9781611974973.87"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(1995)121:3(249)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(1997)123:4(261)"", ""10.1080/0144164042000195072"", ""10.1016/S0968-090X(97)82903-8"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(84)90002-X"", ""10.1109/ICSMC.1994.400094"", ""10.3141/1588-14"", ""10.1109/TITS.2014.2311123"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(1991)117:2(178)"", ""10.1109/ICNC.2007.661"", ""10.1109/PEITS.2008.135"", ""10.3141/1811-04"", ""10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735"", ""10.1109/SmartCity.2015.63"", ""10.1109/YAC.2016.7804912"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0208"", ""10.3115/v1/W14-4012"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2017.0313"", ""10.3390/s17040818"", ""10.1109/MSP.2017.2693418"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.576"", ""10.1155/2017/6575947"", ""10.1109/ICDM.2017.17"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.09.018"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569642"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569402"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569426"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.11.027""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

One of the critical problems in persuading citizens to commute using the bike‐sharing service is the uneven bikes distribution which leads to bike shortage in certain locations, especially during rush hours. This study offers a system, which provides predictions of both rental and return demand in real‐time for each bike station by using only one model, which can be used to formulate load balancing strategies between stations. Five different architectures based on recurrent neural network are described and compared with four evaluation metrics: mean absolute percentage error, root mean squared logarithmic error, mean absolute error and root mean squared error. This system has been tested with New York Citi Bike dataset. The evaluation shows the authors’ proposed methods demonstrate satisfying results at both the global and station levels.","[{""name"": ""Po‐Chuan Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Taipei City 10607 Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""He‐Yen Hsieh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Taipei City 10607 Taiwan"", ""Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica 128 Nankang Taipei Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Kuan‐Wu Su"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Taipei City 10607 Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Xanno Kharis Sigalingging"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Taipei City 10607 Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Yan‐Ru Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Taipei City 10607 Taiwan""]}, {""name"": ""Jenq‐Shiou Leu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Taipei City 10607 Taiwan""]}]","[""10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108575"", ""10.1080/15568318.2012.660115"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.01.013"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.769"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2010.09.004"", ""10.1145/2750858.2804291"", ""10.1016/j.apgeog.2012.07.002"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.08.058"", ""10.1016/j.pmcj.2010.07.002"", ""10.1109/MDM.2012.16"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-24264-9_10"", ""10.1142/S0219525911002950"", ""10.1145/2820783.2820837"", ""10.1145/2906388.2906408"", ""10.1109/MDM.2016.35"", ""10.1007/s13676-012-0017-6"", ""10.1051/ro/2011102"", ""10.1109/72.279181"", ""10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735"", ""10.1109/78.650093"", ""10.1023/A:1010933404324""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

Its performance could be degraded by wind, road conditions, vehicle parameter uncertainty and signal delay. This study proposes a path tracking control framework for autonomous vehicle by combining tube model predictive control (MPC) and time delay motion prediction (TDMP). Tube MPC with N ‐step reachable set is proposed to handle disturbances. A robust invariant set is computed efficiently using supporting function and guarantees state constraints in the presence of disturbances. In TDMP, a path during the signal delay is presented and a vehicle kinematics model is adopted to predict changes of vehicle position and yaw. Simulations show that the computational cost with support function for a robust positively invariant set is less than that with Multi‐Parametric Toolbox. In addition, the proposed control framework not only addresses disturbances like wind, road conditions and vehicle parameter uncertainty, but also handles the steering signal delay through motion prediction.","[{""name"": ""Jiaxing Yu"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology of Automotive Components, Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Xuexun Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center of Automotive Components Technology, Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaofei Pei"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology of Automotive Components, Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Zhenfu Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center of Automotive Components Technology, Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Wei Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology of Automotive Components, Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Maolin Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology of Automotive Components, Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Chaoxian Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology of Automotive Components, Wuhan University of Technology Wuhan People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1177/0954407015618533"", ""10.1243/09544070JAUTO568"", ""10.1177/0954407013503628"", ""10.1007/s12239-012-0120-6"", ""10.1109/TVT.2016.2555853"", ""10.3390/en11061451"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912094"", ""10.1109/TCST.2007.894653"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2004.08.019"", ""10.1080/00423114.2014.902537"", ""10.1109/IVS.2013.6629472"", ""10.4271/2019-01-0693"", ""10.1017/9781139061759.018"", ""10.1109/TAC.2005.843854"", ""10.1007/978-1-4614-1433-9"", ""10.1080/00423114.2014.909941""]",['Engineering'],['Control and Systems Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

Learning transportation modes from the GPS trajectory data is an important problem in the domain of trajectory data mining. Traditional supervised learning‐based approaches rely heavily on data preprocessing and feature engineering, which require domain expertise and are time consuming. The authors propose a deep learning‐based convolutional long short term memory (LSTM) model for transportation mode learning, in which the convolution neural network is first used to extract deep high‐level features and then LSTM is used to learn the sequential patterns in the data that uses both GPS and weather features, thus making the full use of spatiotemporal operations. The authors have also analysed the impact of the geospatial region on human mobility. Experiments conducted on the Microsoft Geolife data set fused with the weather data set show that their model achieves the state‐of‐the‐art results. The authors compare the performance of their model with the benchmark models, which shows the superiority of their model having 3% improvement in accuracy using only GPS features, and the accuracy is further improved by 4 and 7% on including the impact of geospatial region and weather attributes, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Asif Nawaz"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) Nanjing 211106 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Huang Zhiqiu"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) Nanjing 211106 People's Republic of China"", ""Key Laboratory of Safety‐Critical Software, NUAA, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Nanjing 211106 People's Republic of China"", ""Collaborative Innovation Centre of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization Nanjing 210093 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Wang Senzhang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) Nanjing 211106 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yasir Hussain"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) Nanjing 211106 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Izhar Khan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) Nanjing 211106 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Zaheer Khan"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) Nanjing 211106 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1145/2996913.2997016"", ""10.1109/MDM.2016.25"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2870948"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68783-4_25"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795922"", ""10.1145/3057281"", ""10.1080/13658816.2015.1005094"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2544140"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2017.0405"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5250"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2749413"", ""10.1145/1367497.1367532"", ""10.1145/1658373.1658374"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2405759"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2017.2737825"", ""10.1145/2743025"", ""10.1145/1409635.1409677"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2012.06.001"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-2053-7_35"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2009.0029"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-31750-2_5"", ""10.1587/transinf.2016EDL8252"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.11.021"", ""10.3390/s19030523"", ""10.1145/2093973.2093982"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2011.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.05.004"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2723523"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.05.003"", ""10.1109/PERCOMW.2019.8730799"", ""10.1007/978-981-10-6385-5_51"", ""10.1145/3022227.3022309"", ""10.1080/17489725.2013.819128"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2018.05.008"", ""10.3390/s18113741"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.05.005"", ""10.1080/15472450.2018.1436968"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.0064"", ""10.1038/nature14539"", ""10.1145/1526709.1526816""]","['Social Sciences', 'Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"
10.1049/iet-est.2019.0033,IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering,Systematic mixed adaptive observer and EKF approach to estimate SOC and SOH of lithium-ion battery,"One of the main issues with KF‐based methods is complication of determining the process noise covariance matrix, which is usually obtained by empirical tuning. Here, by using the adaptive observer designed around an arbitrary operating point of a non‐linear system, a novel systematic approach is developed for determining the covariance matrix of the parameter noise in the EKF with the aim of jointly estimating the states and unknown parameters of the system. The proposed mixed adaptive observer and EKF method are applied to a Lithium–Ion battery to simultaneously estimate its state of charge (SOC) and internal resistance as well as the state of health (SOH). The dynamical behaviour of the battery is modelled by using a commonly used RC model and is validated by the real data collected from the battery. The proposed method provides a robust performance against the model uncertainties and shows satisfactory parameter convergence properties. Experimental tests are established to certify the capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the conventional EKF.

10.1007/s11116-023-10392-2,TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0814 Civil Engineering,Systematic literature review on impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding measures on mobility,"AbstractThe unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak has significantly influenced our daily life, and COVID-19’s spread is inevitably associated with human mobility. Given the pandemic’s severity and extent of spread, a timely and comprehensive synthesis of the current state of research is needed to understand the pandemic’s impact on human mobility and corresponding government measures. This study examined the relevant literature published to the present (March 2023), identified research trends, and conducted a systematic review of evidence regarding transport’s response to COVID-19. We identified key research agendas and synthesized the results, examining: (1) mobility changes by transport modes analyzed regardless of government policy implementation, using empirical data and survey data; (2) the effect of diverse government interventions to reduce mobility and limit COVID-19 spread, and controversial issues on travel restriction policy effects; and (3) future research issues. The findings showed a strong relationship between the pandemic and mobility, with significant impacts on decreased overall mobility, a remarkable drop in transit ridership, changes in travel behavior, and improved traffic safety. Government implemented various non-pharmaceutical countermeasures, such as city lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing. Many studies showed such interventions were effective. However, some researchers reported inconsistent outcomes. This review provides urban and transport planners with valuable insights to facilitate better preparation for future health emergencies that affect transportation.","[{""name"": ""Kwang-Sub Lee"",

Compared to statistical modeling approaches, machine learning makes fewer explicit assumptions about data structures, such as linearity. Consequently, the parameters of machine learning models usually cannot be easily related to the data generating process. To learn about the modeled relationships, partial dependence (PD) plots and permutation feature importance (PFI) are often used as interpretation methods. However, PD and PFI lack a theory that relates them to the data generating process. We formalize PD and PFI as statistical estimators of ground truth estimands rooted in the data generating process. We show that PD and PFI estimates deviate from this ground truth not only due to statistical biases, but also due to learner variance and Monte Carlo approximation errors. To account for these uncertainties in PD and PFI estimation, we propose the learner-PD and the learner-PFI based on model refits and propose corrected variance and confidence interval estimators.","[{""name"": ""Christoph Molnar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Timo Freiesleben"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gunnar König"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Julia Herbinger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tim Reisinger"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Giuseppe Casalicchio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marvin N.

10.1049/iet-its.2019.0273,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0711 Systems Science; 0823 Transportation Engineering,Motion control of unmanned underwater vehicles via deep imitation reinforcement learning algorithm,"In this study, a motion control algorithm based on deep imitation reinforcement learning is proposed for the unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). The algorithm is called imitation learning (IL) twin delay deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) (TD3). It combines IL with DDPG (TD3). In order to accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning, the supervised learning method is used in IL for behaviour cloning from the closed‐loop control data. The deep reinforcement learning employs actor–critic architecture. The actor part executes the control strategy and the critic part evaluates current control strategy. The training efficiency of IL‐TD3 is compared with DDPG and TD3. The simulation results show that the training results of IL‐TD3 converge faster and the training process is more stable than both of them, the convergence rate of IL‐TD3 algorithm during training is about double that of DDPG and TD3. The control performance via IL‐TD3 is superior to PID in UUVs motion control tasks. The average track error of IL‐TD3 is reduced by than PID control. The average tracking error under thruster fault is almost the same as under normal condition.","[{""name"": ""Zhenzhong Chu"", ""affiliation"": [""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Maritime Search &amp; Rescue and Underwater Vehicles Shanghai Maritime University Shanghai 201306 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Bo Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Maritime Search &amp; Rescue and Underwater Vehicles Shanghai Maritime University Shanghai 201306 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Daqi Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Maritime Search &amp; Rescue and Underwater Vehicles Shanghai Maritime University Shanghai 201306 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Mingjun Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Harbin Engineering University Harbin 150001 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Chaomin Luo"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Mississippi State University Mississippi MS 39762 USA""]}]","[""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896588"", ""10.1109/JOE.2017.2769938"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2018.2812220"", ""10.1109/TCST.2018.2789440"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2779442"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1109/IROS.2012.6386109"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2018.8462901"", ""10.1049/joe.2018.8314"", ""10.1109/TSMC.2016.2645699"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2018.05.016"", ""10.1109/TSMC.2017.2785794"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2017.02.006"", ""10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2170565"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2884797"", ""10.1016/S0921-8890(00)00100-7"", ""10.1016/j.isatra.2019.07.024""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

In the current study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by green approach from methanolic leaf extract ofBlighia sapida. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging assay, determination of total reductive potential, total phenolics content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) of the synthesized AgNPs. SEM analysis revealed that the size of the synthesized silver nanoparticles ranged from 50-70 nm with maximum UV-vis absorbance at 413 nm. DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of the synthesized AgNPs increased in a dose dependent manner as compared to ascorbic acid the standard reference used. This result confirmed thatBlighia sapidais a potential biomaterial for synthesizing AgNPs which can be exploited for its antioxidant activity.","[{""name"": ""AO Akintola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""BD Kehinde"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""PB Ayoola"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""AG Adewoyin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""OT Adedosu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""JF Ajayi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""SB Ogunsona"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb27444.x"", ""10.26719/1998.4.2.350"", ""10.1136/jcp.54.3.176"", ""10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.001"", ""10.1073/pnas.91.23.10771"", ""10.1007/BF02253564"", ""10.1113/expphysiol.1997.sp004024"", ""10.1096/fasebj.6.9.1612291"", ""10.1093/jn/122.suppl_3.636"", ""10.1021/jf0303924"", ""10.1002/jsfa.2740310705"", ""10.14720/aas.2006.87.2.15105"", ""10.1016/j.addr.2009.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.technovation.2007.05.009"", ""10.1021/nn300652p"", ""10.1002/jbm.b.31615"", ""10.1021/nn3008383"", ""10.1016/j.addr.2011.10.007"", ""10.7897/2230-8407.080457"", ""10.1007/s13204-015-0473-z"", ""10.1016/j.foodres.2004.05.003"", ""10.1080/15563650600584410"", ""10.1016/S0021-9673(99)01281-9"", ""10.1186/1746-4269-6-12"", ""10.5530/pj.2018.2.63"", ""10.1007/s12668-015-0181-x"", ""10.1155/2011/650979"", ""10.1002/ptr.687"", ""10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00355.x"", ""10.1080/13102818.2017.1282836"", ""10.1016/S0378-8741(03)00036-9"", ""10.1016/j.sjbs.2013.02.003"", ""10.1021/jf0307595"", ""10.1006/abbi.2001.2692"", ""10.1021/np9904509""]","['Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics', 'Materials Science', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences']","['Plant Science', 'Pharmacology', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('1007 药学', 0.7158), ('1008 中药学', 0.7084), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7039), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.6954), ('1001 基础医学', 0.6922)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('1007 药学', 0.768), ('1008 中药学', 0.754)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

In the past, research and development have been primarily focusing on light rail and regional trains, but the interest in hydrogen-powered freight and heavy haul trains is also growing. The review shows that some technical feasibility has been demonstrated from the research and experiments on proof-of-concept designs. Several rail vehicles powered by hydrogen either are currently operating or are the subject of experimental programmes. The paper identifies that fuel cell technology is well developed and has obvious application in providing electrical traction power, while hydrogen combustion in traditional IC engines and gas turbines is not yet well developed. The need for on-board energy storage is discussed along with the benefits of energy management and control systems.","[{""name"": ""Yan Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M.

10.1007/s40534-020-00217-8,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Experimental investigation of the dynamic behavior of railway track with sleeper voids,"AbstractThe deterioration of the sleeper support on the ballasted track begins with the accumulation of sleeper voids. The increased dynamic loading in the voided zone and the ballast contact conditions cause the accelerated growth of the settlements in the voided zones, which results in the appearance of local instabilities like ballast breakdown, white spots, subgrade defects, etc. The recent detection and quantification of the sleeper voids with track-side and onboard monitoring can help to avoid or delay the development of local instabilities. The present paper is devoted to the study of the dynamic behavior of railway track with sleeper voids in the ballast breakdown zone. The result of the experimental track-side measurements of rail acceleration and deflection is presented. The analysis shows the existence of the dynamic impact during wheel entry in the voided zone. However, the measured dynamic impact is subjected to the bias of the track-side measurement method.

To accurately predict the trajectory of the target vehicle, the interaction between vehicles must be considered. Interaction aware prediction methods track the previous trajectories of both the target vehicle and its surrounding vehicles. In this study, the authors consider trajectory prediction as a sequence‐to‐sequence prediction problem. They tackle this problem with an LSTM encoder–decoder framework. Moreover, they propose two spatial‐attention mechanisms to account for the interaction between vehicles, i.e. context attention and lane attention. Spatial‐attention mechanisms adopt the selective‐attention mechanism of human drivers. They choose context vectors to help the model understand the surrounding environment better and thus improve its prediction accuracy. They evaluate the authors’ methods on the highD data set recorded in German highways with root mean squared error metric. Their experimental results show superior performance to other state‐of‐the‐art methods.

10.1057/s41278-020-00168-1,MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS,0823 Transportation Engineering,Managing supply chain uncertainty by building flexibility in container port capacity: a logistics triad perspective and the COVID-19 case,"AbstractThe contemporary supply chains in which container ports logistics operate are characterized by increased uncertainties driven by a range of factors such as socioeconomic factors and changing supply chain strategies in response to market dynamics. Recently, the occurrences and effects of these factors on global economic activities, and thus container port logistics, have been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Enabling flexibility in port logistics is more important than ever to navigate uncertainties, now and in the post-COVID-19 world. This paper seeks to develop a conceptual framework to holistically capture different dimensions of container port logistics capacity. A systematic literature review method is employed to formulate a conceptual framework depicting the structure of various elements of capacity and the interplay among the logistics triad of transport carriers, port operators, and logistics service providers whose interactions and service capacities constitute the overall capacity of the system. The study reveals four dimensions of port logistics capacity, namely seaside interface, platform, landside interface, and system-wide, each of which consists of subelements that can be distinguished into static or adjustable. The proposed framework provides insights corresponding to the logistics triad roles and interactions within the system for understanding uncertainty characteristics, assessing various elements of capacity, and identifying potential levers to build flexibility into these interrelated capacity elements.","[{""name"": ""Dawn Russell"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kusumal Ruamsook"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Violeta Roso"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/mel.2008.24"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2018.12.017"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.06.014"", ""10.1080/03088830601102725"", ""10.1057/s41278-019-00137-3"", ""10.1108/01443570910925352"", ""10.1057/mel.2016.15"", ""10.1007/s10696-013-9178-3"", ""10.1108/09600031011079355"", ""10.1186/s41072-018-0035-0"", ""10.1108/13598541211246558"", ""10.1108/01443570911000168"", ""10.1007/s10696-012-9146-3"", ""10.1108/09600030210437951"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2009.03.001"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2009.05.001"", ""10.1108/IJPDLM-05-2013-0133"", ""10.1108/00251740610656278"", ""10.1108/09600031211231317"", ""10.1108/BPMJ-10-2012-0111"", ""10.1108/09600030911011441"", ""10.1787/9789282102619-2-en"", ""10.1080/23311975.2017.1411066"", ""10.1057/mel.2015.3"", ""10.1108/SCM-10-2013-0363"", ""10.1108/03090560510581782"", ""10.1057/mel.2009.13"", ""10.1057/s41278-018-00116-0"", ""10.1108/IJLM-05-2013-0052"", ""10.1111/j.1745-493X.2010.03187.x"", ""10.1007/s10696-019-09345-8"", ""10.1108/BPMJ-03-2013-0042"", ""10.1108/MRR-08-2012-0189"", ""10.1108/13598541111139062"", ""10.1057/s41278-020-00152-9"", ""10.1007/s10696-011-9100-9"", ""10.1111/j.1937-5956.2005.tb00009.x"", ""10.1007/s00291-010-0200-9"", ""10.1108/17410390610658487"", ""10.1057/mel.2013.23"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2010.04.015"", ""10.1007/s00291-012-0318-z"", ""10.1007/s00291-010-0207-2"", ""10.1186/s12544-019-0385-1"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2010.01.026"", ""10.1108/09600030810866986"", ""10.19030/jabr.v33i3.9949"", ""10.1108/9781780523415-004"", ""10.1002/j.2158-1592.2009.tb00101.x"", ""10.1108/SCM-04-2013-0114"", ""10.1057/mel.2008.21"", ""10.1108/09574090610717491"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2009.03.003"", ""10.1057/palgrave.mel.9100148"", ""10.1068/a40220"", ""10.1057/palgrave.mel.9100196"", ""10.1108/09600030310478810"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2013.07.005"", ""10.1007/s11067-014-9231-0"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2010.07.007"", ""10.19030/jabr.v28i5.7234"", ""10.1108/01443570110390507"", ""10.1504/IJISM.2004.004599"", ""10.1007/s10479-016-2384-0"", ""10.1108/09574090910954864"", ""10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602412"", ""10.1108/09600030810882807"", ""10.1504/WRITR.2015.069242"", ""10.5465/19416520802211651"", ""10.1108/09574091011042179"", ""10.1108/01443570510605090"", ""10.1108/13598541211258609"", ""10.1007/s10696-012-9134-7"", ""10.1108/09600030910973742"", ""10.1007/s00291-007-0100-9"", ""10.1108/01443570710756956"", ""10.1108/01443570910986238"", ""10.1108/01443570610641639"", ""10.1108/01443570710820657"", ""10.19030/jabr.v29i2.7653"", ""10.1007/s10708-008-9214-0"", ""10.1108/09600031011062209"", ""10.1057/palgrave.mel.9100172"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6486.1983.tb00211.x"", ""10.1057/mel.2012.22"", ""10.1787/9789282102619-3-en"", ""10.1057/palgrave.mel.9100182"", ""10.1007/s00291-017-0480-4"", ""10.1108/IJLM-10-2012-0126"", ""10.1007/s00291-010-0201-8"", ""10.1108/IMDS-12-2017-0563"", ""10.1155/2018/1768536"", ""10.1080/03088830802469329"", ""10.1007/s11067-018-9434-x"", ""10.1108/13598541111139080"", ""10.1108/01443571211274521"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2015.10.010"", ""10.1016/j.cor.2018.12.022""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Strategy and Management', 'Management Information Systems']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)]]"
10.1007/s12469-021-00280-2,PUBLIC TRANSPORT,0823 Transportation Engineering,Investigating spatio-temporal mobility patterns and changes in metro usage under the impact of COVID-19 using Taipei Metro smart card data,"AbstractModern public transit systems are often run with automated fare collection (AFC) systems in combination with smart cards. These systems passively collect massive amounts of detailed spatio-temporal trip data, thus opening up new possibilities for public transit planning and management as well as providing new insights for urban planners. We use smart card trip data from Taipei, Taiwan, to perform an in-depth analysis of spatio-temporal station-to-station metro trip patterns for a whole week divided into several time slices. Based on simple linear regression and line graphs, days of the week and times of the day with similar temporal passenger flow patterns are identified. We visualize magnitudes of passenger flow based on actual geography. By comparing flows for January to March 2019 and for January to March 2020, we look at changes in metro trips under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) that caused a state of emergency around the globe in 2020. Our results show that metro usage under the impact of COVID-19 has not declined uniformly, but instead is both spatially and temporally highly heterogeneous.","[{""name"": ""Christian Martin Mützel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Joachim Scheiner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.tranpol.2020.07.001"", ""10.3390/su11247069"", ""10.1109/PHM-Qingdao46334.2019.8943009"", ""10.1007/s11116-020-10120-0"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.080"", ""10.1007/s11116-011-9368-3"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0212"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2600515"", ""10.1155/2018/9247102"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0223650"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.12.012"", ""10.1109/TVCG.2009.143"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2015.08.002"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2910548"", ""10.1080/13658816.2014.898768"", ""10.3390/su10030787"", ""10.1007/s12469-013-0077-5"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2015.445"", ""10.1016/j.cities.2016.03.007"", ""10.1007/s12205-017-1016-9"", ""10.3141/2063-18"", ""10.1109/WAINA.2017.19"", ""10.1109/TAAI.2018.00024"", ""10.1007/s12652-018-1135-2"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.08.004"", ""10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005611"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.07.010"", ""10.3390/ijgi6050128"", ""10.1007/s11116-016-9747-x"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0414"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.01.009"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.12.003"", ""10.1007/978-981-15-0644-4_110"", ""10.1080/23729333.2016.1278151"", ""10.1080/10095020.2018.1545884"", ""10.18757/ejtir.2021.21.1.5135"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985734"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2014.09.008"", ""10.3390/s19020332"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.01.001"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2015.03.085"", ""10.1007/s12469-016-0137-8"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2011.06.009"", ""10.3390/ijgi8060271"", ""10.3390/su11184989"", ""10.4995/CARMA2018.2018.8310"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2896460"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.05.009"", ""10.1007/s11116-013-9492-3"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2679179"", ""10.3390/su11195346"", ""10.1080/13658816.2014.914521"", ""10.1016/j.jocs.2015.04.021"", ""10.1007/s11116-016-9756-9""]","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Science']","['Global and Planetary Change', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

In fact, biogas has been well expected to substitute current conventional sources of energy. The main composition of biogas includes methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is accompanied by different contaminants in varied quantities such as ammonia (NH3), water vapour (H2O), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), methyl siloxanes, nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons. Biogas has been widely utilized as either engine fuel or starting material for chemicals, hydrogen and/or synthesis gas productions. For certain applications, a certain purity degree of biogas is required. Technically, the presence of trace components in biogas has been known to negatively affect engine performance. Therefore, a removal of contaminants, particularly H2S and CO2, is expected to significantly improve biogas quality, thus enhancing its performance in various applications. Besides, the removal is performed to meet standardized gas specifications for its usage as vehicle fuel or being injected into a natural gas grid. In practices, different methods for biogas cleaning and upgrading have been recognized, in which differ in terms of functions, efficiency, and required quality of input gas. This study, therefore, aims at reviewing various H2S removal-based biogas cleaning techniques during and after digestion process.","[{""name"": ""D Andriani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Rajani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kusnadi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Santosa"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Saepudin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Wresta"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T D Atmaja"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s12010-013-0652-x"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2012.04.029"", ""10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.02.033"", ""10.1080/15435075.2015.1018992"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.06.029"", ""10.1007/s12649-016-9826-4"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.09.086"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/100/1/012177"", ""10.18331/BRJ2017.4.4.6"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2013.04.066"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.204"", ""10.1016/j.bej.2008.12.011"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.06.004"", ""10.1016/j.psep.2013.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.08.015"", ""10.2225/vol10-issue4-fulltext-6"", ""10.1016/S1389-1723(00)80029-8"", ""10.1002/bit.20443"", ""10.1002/bit.260290216"", ""10.1016/S0009-2509(99)00482-0"", ""10.1016/S0032-9592(98)00139-3""]","['Chemical Engineering', 'Engineering']","['Process Chemistry and Technology', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.761), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7487), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7377), ('0703 化学', 0.7365), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7354)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7622), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.761)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1007/s40534-020-00218-7,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,"Simple and fast prediction of train-induced track forces, ground and building vibrations","AbstractA simple and fast prediction scheme is presented for train-induced ground and building vibrations. Simple models such as (one-dimensional) transfer matrices are used for the vehicle–track–soil interaction and for the building–soil interaction. The wave propagation through layered soils is approximated by a frequency-dependent homogeneous half-space. The prediction is divided into the parts “emission” (excitation by railway traffic), “transmission” (wave propagation through the soil) and “immission” (transfer into a building). The link between the modules is made by the excitation force between emission and transmission, and by the free-field vibration between transmission and immission. All formula for the simple vehicle–track, soil and building models are given in this article. The behaviour of the models is demonstrated by typical examples, including the mitigation of train vibrations by elastic track elements, the low- and high-frequency cut-offs characteristic for layered soils, and the interacting soil, wall and floor resonances of multi-storey buildings. It is shown that the results of the simple prediction models can well represent the behaviour of the more time-consuming detailed models, the finite-element boundary-element models of the track, the wavenumber integrals for the soil and the three-dimensional finite-element models of the building. In addition, measurement examples are given for each part of the prediction, confirming that the methods provide reasonable results. As the prediction models are fast in calculation, many predictions can be done, for example to assess the environmental effect along a new railway line. The simple models have the additional advantage that the user needs to know only a minimum of parameters. So, the prediction is fast and user-friendly, but also theoretically and experimentally well-founded.","[{""name"": ""Lutz Auersch"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1006/jsvi.1996.0266"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1996.0259"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2006.03.005"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1996.0260"", ""10.1785/BSSA0710061743"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1994.1228"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2008.07.003"", ""10.1007/s00419-016-1209-6"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2006.06.006"", ""10.1080/00423110412331307663"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2005.08.040"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2010.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.09.013"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2014.06.021"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2018.07.046"", ""10.1007/s00521-016-2625-9"", ""10.1177/1687814019847290"", ""10.1007/s12206-014-0501-z"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2016.12.008"", ""10.1080/00423119508969628"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2018.06.032"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0001826"", ""10.1016/j.soildyn.2014.02.013"", ""10.1177/0954409713511449"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-44832-8_33"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2014.07.042"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1602274"", ""10.1080/00423110802691515"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.09.390"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2004.06.017"", ""10.3997/1873-0604.2015011"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2008)134:3(328)"", ""10.47964/1120.9371.19375""]",['Engineering'],"['General Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7123), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7075)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Firstly, in order to improve the efficiency of data processing, a method of road network data compression is proposed based on correlation analysis and CX decomposition. Secondly, the traffic flow data are divided into trend term and random fluctuation term by spectral decomposition method, and the influence of trend term on prediction accuracy is removed. Finally, by combining a deep belief network model and a kernel extreme learning machine classifier as the prediction model, the essential characteristics of the traffic flow data are extracted by using DBN at the bottom of the network, and the extracted results are input into the kernel extreme learning machine to predict the traffic flow. The actual regional road network traffic flow data are tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed short‐time network traffic flow forecasting method. The results show that the proposed method can not only save 90% of the running time but also the average prediction accuracy of each road section can reach 92%.","[{""name"": ""Lei Han"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Traffic and Transportation Engineering Changsha University of Science and Technology Changsha People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yi‐Shao Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Traffic and Transportation Engineering Changsha University of Science and Technology Changsha People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1109/TITS.2015.2513411"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0208"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2158001"", ""10.3141/1644-14"", ""10.3141/1857-09"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2260540"", ""10.1016/S0968-090X(02)00009-8"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2008.07.069"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2016.01.234"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.02.006"", ""10.1016/S0169-2070(96)00697-8"", ""10.1109/CCDC.2013.6561856"", ""10.1111/exsy.12055"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2005)131:10(771)"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2643005"", ""10.1109/TIM.2012.2212506"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2019.01.015"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.05.009"", ""10.1109/TITS.2014.2311123"", ""10.1109/TITS.2014.2345663"", ""10.1109/SOLI.2016.7551691"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.10.019"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2574840"", ""10.3141/2283-09"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2411675"", ""10.1109/CIVTS.2013.6612288"", ""10.1016/j.dsp.2017.10.025"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2013.05.025""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

The proposed merging strategy is capable of making a good trade‐off between performance and computational cost. In this study, the authors address the problem of optimally coordinating CAVs under mixed traffic conditions, where both CAVs and human‐driven vehicles (non‐CAVs) travel on the roads, so as to enhance efficiency while guaranteeing safety constraints. A hierarchical cooperative merging framework is proposed for CAVs, which integrates merging sequence scheduling strategies (high level) and motion planning methods (low level). The impacts of CAV penetration (i.e. the fraction of CAVs relative to all vehicles) on throughput, delay, fuel consumption and emission are also investigated under different traffic demands. Simulation‐based case studies indicate that the performance improvement becomes more significant as the CAV penetration rate increases and about 30% CAV penetration can effectively mitigate the shockwave and reduce traffic congestion.","[{""name"": ""Jishiyu Ding"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Automation Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Huei Peng"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Michigan Ann Arbor MI 48109 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Yi Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Automation BNRist Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Li Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Automation BNRist Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1109/TITS.2015.2398453"", ""10.1109/TCST.2004.833406"", ""10.1109/TITS.2007.908724"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2277737"", ""10.1109/TVT.2006.878730"", ""10.1080/21680566.2018.1540951"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2587582"", ""10.1109/TVT.2017.2780269"", ""10.1109/TVT.2019.2910987"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2600504"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.07.013"", ""10.1108/JICV-11-2017-0001"", ""10.3141/2243-17"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2006.12.017"", ""10.1145/3003965.3003969"", ""10.1109/TIV.2018.2873899"", ""10.1080/23249935.2019.1645758"", ""10.1080/15472450.2016.1248288"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.04.015"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569485"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(81)90037-0"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2112648"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2002)128:2(182)"", ""10.1201/9781315153179""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

We develop a dynamic model based on a reaction and a diffusion term that properly reproduces the cascade phenomena of traffic. The interaction of these two terms brings the values of the speeds on road network in self-organized patterns and it reveals an elegant physical law that reproduces the dynamics of congestion with very few parameters. The results presented show a promising match with an available real data set of link speeds estimated from more than 40 millions of GPS coordinates per day of about 20,000 taxis in Shenzhen, China.","[{""name"": ""Leonardo Bellocchi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Nikolas Geroliminis"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.trb.2014.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.07.002"", ""10.1038/nature06958"", ""10.1038/srep01001"", ""10.1038/srep04141"", ""10.1088/1751-8113/41/22/224015"", ""10.1007/s10955-012-0645-0"", ""10.1068/b32047"", ""10.1038/ncomms7007"", ""10.1088/1742-5468/2010/05/P05001"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.51.2909"", ""10.1016/S0895-7177(02)80019-X"", ""10.1038/srep05276"", ""10.1038/ncomms12600"", ""10.1140/epjb/e2009-00438-2"", ""10.1088/0034-4885/65/9/203"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2008.02.002"", ""10.3141/2124-12"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2010.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2014.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2014.12.010"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2014.06.010"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2010.11.004"", ""10.3141/2391-13"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.08.021"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.05.008"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-14237-8"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(81)90037-0"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(00)00044-8"", ""10.3141/2249-09"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2006.11.004"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(94)90002-7"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(94)00022-R"", ""10.1098/rstb.1952.0012"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-08542-4"", ""10.1038/nphys1651"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(99)00047-8"", ""10.1103/PhysRevA.46.R6124"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511791383"", ""10.3141/2390-10"", ""10.1038/srep05381"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(95)00007-Z"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.53.2366"", ""10.1016/j.physd.2005.06.002"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.53.R4275"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.50.54"", ""10.3141/2422-01"", ""10.1073/pnas.1419185112"", ""10.3141/2422-01"", ""10.1073/pnas.1801545116"", ""10.1073/pnas.1814982116"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.51.3164"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.10.011"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.10.016""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Transportation', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

10.1057/s41278-020-00160-9,MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS,0823 Transportation Engineering,"Potential for, and drivers of, private voluntary initiatives for the decarbonisation of short sea shipping: evidence from a Swedish ferry line","AbstractThe aim of this paper is to analyse shipping firms’ reactions to environmental challenges and identify how significant reductions in energy consumption and air emissions can come about by implementing a variety of voluntary initiatives. The paper focuses on the various sustainability initiatives implemented by the Swedish short sea shipping operator, Stena Line, either on a purely voluntary basis as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy or as their chosen route for compliance with regulations. A conceptual model is developed based on stakeholder theory, the theory of planned behaviour and resource dependence theory to understand the main drivers of the firm’s adoption of sustainability initiatives and the factors affecting the integration of CSR in maritime companies. According to our findings, the company operates within a strongly enforced regulatory environmental framework and needs to exceed this framework to differentiate its service and strengthen its relationships with its customers by addressing their social and environmental concerns. As the firm’s competitive strategy focuses on service differentiation, a large pool of complementary resources is available for CSR and the implementation of sustainability practices. The results of this paper bring new insights to the potential of local private voluntary initiatives for the reduction of maritime air emissions. These include the provision of onshore power supply, the conversion of vessels to use methanol, ferry electrification, the construction of larger RoPax vessels and the implementation of an energy-saving program that focuses on crew involvement and continuous training. The environmental outcomes derived from a combination of local operational and technical energy efficiency measures are found to be significant and can contribute to the efforts for the achievement of sustainable maritime transport undertaken by international and regional organisations. The main barriers for the adoption of voluntary sustainability initiatives in the maritime sector are economic and technological. To encourage the wider adoption of these initiatives, the provision of economic incentives at national or regional level is crucial, as such initiatives usually imply high initial installation costs that should be somehow compensated for both vessels and terminals.","[{""name"": ""Anastasia Christodoulou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kevin Cullinane"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enpol.2014.04.013"", ""10.1080/08870446.2011.613995"", ""10.5541/ijot.5000070299"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2015.10.007"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2012.02.030"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2017.03.022"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2013.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.respol.2013.05.010"", ""10.15453/0191-5096.3583"", ""10.1108/MABR-08-2018-0030"", ""10.3390/su11216046"", ""10.3390/su11102847"", ""10.1021/es071686z"", ""10.1108/S2044-9941(2012)0000002007"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2013.12.004"", ""10.1080/01441647.2013.806604"", ""10.1177/0149206312471391"", ""10.1007/s10668-005-7900-3"", ""10.1017/CBO9781139192675"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.122"", ""10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.05.008"", ""10.1080/08870440290013644a"", ""10.1177/0149206309343469"", ""10.1080/01441640903289849"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2018.02.004"", ""10.1080/03088839.2012.757373"", ""10.3390/su11061532"", ""10.1080/03088839.2011.588262"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2010.12.004"", ""10.1108/02635571211264609"", ""10.3390/su6031544"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-26482-0_2"", ""10.1080/03088831003700678"", ""10.1108/IJPDLM-05-2013-0155"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.013"", ""10.1504/IJEP.1997.028314"", ""10.1007/s13437-017-0134-z"", ""10.1007/s40685-017-0045-z"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2017.09.020"", ""10.1080/03088839.2018.1489150"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.09.014"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2015.11.013"", ""10.1057/mel.2009.11"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2017.04.033"", ""10.1021/acs.est.5b04860"", ""10.4324/9781315754185"", ""10.1108/01443570210414329"", ""10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.11.064"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2015.07.013"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2015.10.008"", ""10.1007/s10551-012-1603-0"", ""10.1016/j.im.2009.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2009.08.017"", ""10.1007/s13437-014-0059-8"", ""10.1016/j.ajsl.2016.03.006"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.01.020"", ""10.3141/2549-05"", ""10.1057/mel.2014.6""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering', 'Strategy and Management']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7505), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7443)]]"

They will only become a success if they are accepted by their users. Therefore, there is a need for user acceptance for these vehicles. Previous studies on acceptance of AV have identified several predictors. Inspired by these studies, the authors’ investigation is aimed at sociodemographic characteristics, including broader individual and societal acceptance, beyond technical issues to get a clear view of user acceptance. In this study, they surveyed 229 respondents, using a 46‐item online questionnaire. Overall, the authors’ analysis revealed that the respondents are most concerned about crashing/malfunctioning, purchase price, liability for incidents, interaction with non‐AV, performance in unexpected situations, hacking and safety. The results also revealed that the AV is perceived as ‘somewhat low risk’ to drive. Gender, age, education level and employment status had varied relationships with the perceived concerns and general attitude towards the AV. For instance, respondents with a university degree (Bachelor/Master/PhD) are less concerned about the liability of accidents and AV system failure than those without it. Similarly, respondents between 36 and 65 years of age are more concerned and even refused to drive AV in comparison to the age ranges of 18–35 years and 65 + years.","[{""name"": ""Elena Thomas"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science Tech Hub Edge Hill University St Helen Road Ormskirk L39 4QP UK""]}, {""name"": ""Connie McCrudden"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science Tech Hub Edge Hill University St Helen Road Ormskirk L39 4QP UK""]}, {""name"": ""Zachary Wharton"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science Tech Hub Edge Hill University St Helen Road Ormskirk L39 4QP UK""]}, {""name"": ""Ardhendu Behera"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science Tech Hub Edge Hill University St Helen Road Ormskirk L39 4QP UK""]}]","[""10.1109/ICSEE.2016.7806133"", ""10.1007/s40309-015-0071-z"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2015.04.003"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2017.10.001"", ""10.1007/s11116-017-9808-9"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2015.04.014"", ""10.1115/1.2011-FEB-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-03991-1"", ""10.1177/1555343417695197"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.05.232"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.01.019"", ""10.1145/2667317.2667330"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2018.06.024"", ""10.1109/MTITS.2017.8005606"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.05.005"", ""10.1145/3301275.3302268"", ""10.4067/S0718-27242018000400037"", ""10.1002/9781394260485"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.08.029"", ""10.1016/j.techfore.2019.02.010""]","['Psychology', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1007/s40534-020-00205-y,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Effect of cavity flow control on high-speed train pantograph and roof aerodynamic noise,"AbstractThe pantograph and its recess on the train roof are major aerodynamic noise sources on high-speed trains. Reducing this noise is particularly important because conventional noise barriers usually do not shield the pantograph. However, less attention has been paid to the pantograph recess compared with the pantograph. In this paper, the flow features and noise contribution of two types of noise reduction treatments rounded and chamfered edges are studied for a simplified high-speed train pantograph recess, which is represented as a rectangular cavity and numerically investigated at 1/10 scale. Improved delayed detached-eddy simulations are performed for the near-field turbulent flow simulation, and the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic analogy is used for far-field noise prediction. The highly unsteady flow over the cavity is significantly reduced by the cavity edge modifications, and consequently, the noise radiated from the cavity is reduced. Furthermore, effects of the rounded cavity edges on the flow and noise of the pantographs (one raised and one folded) are investigated by comparing the flow features and noise contributions from the cases with and without rounding of the cavity edges. Different train running directions are also considered. Flow analysis shows that the highly unsteady flow within the cavity is reduced by rounding the cavity edges and a slightly lower flow speed occurs around the upper parts of the raised pantograph, whereas the flow velocity in the cavity is slightly increased by the rounding. Higher pressure fluctuations occur on the folded pantograph and the lower parts of the raised pantograph, whereas weaker fluctuations are found on the panhead of the raised pantograph. This study shows that by rounding the cavity edges, a reduction in radiated noise at the side and the top receiver positions can be achieved. Noise reductions in the other directions can also be found.","[{""name"": ""Hogun Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhiwei Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""David Thompson"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jsv.2005.08.069"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1999.2544"", ""10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00707-7"", ""10.2219/rtriqr.51.220"", ""10.2219/rtriqr.50.227"", ""10.2219/rtriqr.49.184"", ""10.1016/S0167-6105(01)00161-1"", ""10.1121/1.425410"", ""10.1260/1475-472X.11.3-4.411"", ""10.1007/s11431-016-0649-6"", ""10.1177/0954409712473095"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1999.2545"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.08.041"", ""10.1177/0954409715606748"", ""10.1017/S0001924000007557"", ""10.3813/AAA.918541"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1998.2012"", ""10.1007/s00162-006-0015-0"", ""10.1016/S0142-727X(00)00007-2"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2008.07.001"", ""10.1098/rsta.1969.0031"", ""10.1016/S0376-0421(02)00068-4"", ""10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2007.03.004"", ""10.2514/1.17638"", ""10.2514/6.2000-2012"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2017.01.028""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

Applying the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to examine generational differences in transportation-related attitudes,"AbstractConsiderable recent work suggests that Millennials’ behaviors may be converging with those of Generation X as they enter later life stages, but few have investigated whether attitudes, which are often strong predictors of behavior, are undergoing the same convergence. In this study, we analyze the existing generational gap in four transportation-related attitudes (currently pro-urban, long-term pro-urban, pro-car ownership, and pro-environment), and examine the differential effects of other characteristics, including life-stage variables, on these attitudinal gaps. We apply the threefold Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition method to a statewide (weighted) sample of 1029 Millennials and 946 Generation Xers from California to unravel these effects. The method distinguishes among: (1) effects due to the cohorts having different characteristics (endowments); (2) effects due to those characteristics having different influences on attitudes (coefficients); and (3) the interaction of those two effects. We observe that Millennials’ attitudes: (1) differ from those of Generation X only by small, albeit statistically significant, amounts on average; and (2) are closer to those of Generation X as they gain on a host of life-stage variables such as marital status, income, and education. For example, if Millennials were married, employed, and earning higher incomes at the same rates as Generation X (but retaining their own model coefficients), the generational gap in the currently pro-urban attitude would be reduced by 24%. This study brings an econometric approach to the study of generational divides in transportation-related attitudes, with findings suggesting that Millennials might be leaving part of their uniqueness behind as they enter later life stages.","[{""name"": ""Ali Etezady"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""F.

10.1049/iet-its.2019.0587,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0711 Systems Science; 0823 Transportation Engineering,Using Sky-pointing fish-eye camera and LiDAR to aid GNSS single-point positioning in urban canyons,"Robust and globally‐referenced positioning is indispensable for autonomous driving vehicles. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is still an irreplaceable sensor. Satisfactory accuracy (about 1 m) can be obtained in sparse areas. However, the GNSS positioning error can be up to 100 m in dense urban areas due to the multipath effects and non‐line‐of‐sight (NLOS) receptions caused by reflection and blockage from buildings. NLOS is currently the dominant factor degrading the performance of GNSS positioning. Recently, the camera has been employed to detect the NLOS and then to exclude the NLOS measurements from GNSS calculation. The exclusion of NLOS measurements can cause severe distortion of satellite distribution, due to the excessive NLOS receptions in deep urban canyons. Correcting the NLOS receptions with the aid of 3D light detection and ranging after detection of NLOS receptions using a fish‐eye camera was proposed in this study. Finally, the GNSS positioning was improved by using the healthy and corrected NLOS pseudo‐range measurements. The proposed method is evaluated through real road tests in typical highly urbanised canyons of Hong Kong. The evaluation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the positioning performance.","[{""name"": ""Xiwei Bai"", ""affiliation"": [""Interdisciplinary Division of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Kowloon 518000 Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Weisong Wen"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Kowloon Hong Kong""]}, {""name"": ""Li‐Ta Hsu"", ""affiliation"": [""Interdisciplinary Division of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Kowloon 518000 Hong Kong""]}]","[""10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196526"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2016.04.003"", ""10.1109/ISIE.2017.8001484"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509700"", ""10.1109/NAVITEC.2012.6423080"", ""10.1109/TVT.2019.2944680"", ""10.1007/s10291-017-0667-9"", ""10.1109/TAES.2011.5751245"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795701"", ""10.1109/ITST.2011.6060069"", ""10.3390/s130100829"", ""10.1109/PLANS.2018.8373377"", ""10.1002/navi.38"", ""10.1017/S0373463314000836"", ""10.1007/s10291-017-0654-1"", ""10.1017/S0373463317000509"", ""10.1007/s10291-015-0451-7"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2432122"", ""10.1109/IVS.2012.6232285"", ""10.1016/j.cageo.2008.01.004"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509895"", ""10.33012/2017.15165"", ""10.1109/TITS.2008.2011688"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980424"", ""10.3390/s18041244"", ""10.1109/TRO.2015.2463671"", ""10.33012/2018.15984"", ""10.1002/navi.335"", ""10.33012/2019.16845"", ""10.1007/s10291-002-0017-3"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2006.153"", ""10.1088/0957-0233/24/11/115010"", ""10.1007/s10291-015-0469-x""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Since their first appearance just before the mid-1990s, they have progressed to account for 90% of global container shipping capacity with the top eight container operators organizing today their East/West route services through one of the main three strategic alliances. This paper reviews comprehensively and critically the literature on the subject, over 25 years of research on this topic. This includes 85 articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 1994 and 2019, and analyzed and grouped into three main research areas: formation, management, and optimization of strategic alliances. The output of the analysis is then used to provide a future research agenda.","[{""name"": ""Mohammad Ghorbani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Michele Acciaro"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sandra Transchel"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Pierre Cariou"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1287/trsc.1070.0205"", ""10.1287/opre.1100.0848"", ""10.1016/S0966-6923(98)00048-9"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2012.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2015.07.015"", ""10.1016/j.omega.2019.06.005"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2012.10.020"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2009.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2017.10.004"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ijme.9100044"", ""10.1504/IJTMKT.2016.079726"", ""10.1080/0308883042000282516"", ""10.1057/palgrave.mel.9100145"", ""10.1504/IJOSM.2008.017778"", ""10.1057/s41278-021-00184-9"", ""10.1007/s11067-014-9230-1"", ""10.1057/s41278-017-0088-2"", ""10.1017/S0373463313000192"", ""10.6119/JMST.201904_27(2).0001"", ""10.6119/JMST.201904_27(2).0001"", ""10.1057/s41278-019-00118-6"", ""10.5325/transportationj.46.3.0022"", ""10.1080/03088839.2011.556677"", ""10.51400/2709-6998.1963"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2004.07.013"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2011.06.002"", ""10.1111/j.1467-940X.2000.00079.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.10.027"", ""10.31217/p.31.2.7"", ""10.1080/13675569908901570"", ""10.1057/ijme.2000.3"", ""10.1080/03088830801956789"", ""10.1111/j.1937-5956.2011.01310.x"", ""10.1080/03088830601020653"", ""10.1080/03088839800000024"", ""10.1287/orsc.1110.0733"", ""10.7307/ptt.v28i3.1749"", ""10.1057/mel.2013.21"", ""10.1016/j.ajsl.2017.06.002"", ""10.1080/03088839600000085"", ""10.1057/s41278-018-00116-0"", ""10.1080/030888300416559"", ""10.1016/j.ajsl.2017.03.004"", ""10.5465/amp.2009.43479263"", ""10.1016/S1090-9516(97)90008-0"", ""10.1016/j.ajsl.2019.12.008"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.823"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.05.001"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2015.09.010"", ""10.1080/03088839.2017.1295325"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2019.06.009"", ""10.1287/trsc.2013.0461"", ""10.1057/s41278-022-00225-x"", ""10.1080/030888300286662"", ""10.5465/amj.2009.44634482"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2013.09.041"", ""10.1016/j.ajsl.2016.05.002"", ""10.1057/palgrave.mel.9100148"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2017.09.002"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ijme.9100045"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2011.06.008"", ""10.1504/IJSTL.2014.064571"", ""10.1080/03088839.2018.1437285"", ""10.1016/j.ecotra.2017.10.004"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2016.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2017.02.005"", ""10.1080/07266472.1998.10878505"", ""10.1080/030888399286790"", ""10.1080/03088839800000059"", ""10.1057/palgrave.ijme.9100025"", ""10.3141/2066-07"", ""10.1086/261647"", ""10.1177/0003603X9303800208"", ""10.1080/03088830110063694"", ""10.1108/02635571011055081"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2015.09.007"", ""10.1080/03088830210132632"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.04.006"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2009.08.003"", ""10.1504/IJSTL.2014.062902"", ""10.1108/MABR-08-2017-0023"", ""10.1080/030888399286853"", ""10.1504/IJLSM.2009.022497"", ""10.5430/ijba.v6n5p22"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2014.09.006"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2011.06.002"", ""10.5325/transportationj.53.4.0499"", ""10.1108/MABR-05-2018-0018"", ""10.1002/smj.4250160504"", ""10.1080/21642583.2019.1585302"", ""10.1287/trsc.2014.0572"", ""10.1504/IJSTL.2017.084827""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Management Information Systems', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

The competition evaluated 59 verification systems and 17 validation systems from 34 teams from 12 countries. This yields a good overview of the state of the art in tools for software verification. The competition was executed on a benchmark set with 30 300 verification tasks for C programs and 587 . verification tasks for Java programs. The specifications again included reachability, memory safety, overflows, and termination. This year was the second time that the competition had an extra competition track on witness validation. We introduced a new witness format 2.0, and a new scoring schema for the validation track.

10.1007/s40534-022-00279-w,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Simulation of wheel and rail profile wear: a review of numerical models,"AbstractThe development of numerical models able to compute the wheel and rail profile wear is essential to improve the scheduling of maintenance operations required to restore the original profile shapes. This work surveys the main numerical models in the literature for the evaluation of the uniform wear of wheel and rail profiles. The standard structure of these tools includes a multibody simulation of the wheel–track coupled dynamics and a wear module implementing an experimental wear law. Therefore, the models are classified according to the strategy adopted for the worn profile update, ranging from models performing a single computation to models based on an online communication between the dynamic and wear modules. Nevertheless, the most common strategy nowadays relies on an iteration of dynamic simulations in which the profiles are left unchanged, with co-simulation techniques often adopted to increase the computational performances. Work is still needed to improve the accuracy of the current models. New experimental campaigns should be carried out to obtain refined wear coefficients and models, while strategies for the evaluation of both longitudinal and transversal wear, also considering the effects of tread braking, should be implemented to obtain accurate damage models.","[{""name"": ""N.

10.1049/iet-its.2019.0784,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0711 Systems Science; 0823 Transportation Engineering,Procuring cooperative intelligence in autonomous vehicles for object detection through data fusion approach,"In an autonomous vehicle (AV), in order to efficiently exploit the acquired resources, big data analyses will be a reliable source for extracting valuable information from various sensors and actuators. The data extracted with the combined ability of telematics and real‐time investigation forms the vibrant asset for self‐driving cars. To demonstrate the significances of big data analysis, this study proposes a competent architecture for real‐time big data analysis for an AV, which indeed keeps pace with the latest trends and advancement concerning an emerging paradigm. There are a massive amount of sensors and independent systems needed to be realised for better competence in an AV, and the proposed model focuses on independent sensors that distinguish objects and handles visual information to decide the path. In order to attain the objective as mentioned above, a sensor fusion mechanism is proposed, which combines 3D camera sensor data and Lidar sensor information to provide an optimised solution for path selection.

The novelty is the usage of Gamma transition model, in which the transition from laminar to turbulent flow can be predicted. First, a mesh dependency study was undertaken, showing second-order convergence with respect to the mesh refinement. Second, an aerodynamic analysis for two designs, short and optimized, was conducted with the traveling speed 125 m/s at the system pressure 0.15 bar. The concept of the short model was to delay the transition to decrease the frictional drag; meanwhile that of the optimized design was to minimize the pressure drag by decreasing the frontal area and introduce the transition more toward the front of the pod. The computed results show that the transition of the short model occurred more on the rear side due to the pod shape, which resulted in 8% smaller frictional drag coefficient than that for the optimized model. The pressure drag for the optimized design was 24% smaller than that for the short design, half of which is due to the decrease in the frontal area, and the other half is due to the smoothed rear-end shape. The total drag for the optimized model was 14% smaller than that for the short model. Finally, the influence of the system pressure was investigated. As the system pressure and the Reynolds number increase, the frictional drag coefficient increases, and the transition point moves toward the front, which are the typical phenomena observed in the transition regime.","[{""name"": ""Nathalie Nick"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yohei Sato"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/TASC.2002.1018549"", ""10.1007/bf03325739"", ""10.1109/TASC.2017.2716842"", ""10.2514/6.2015-1587"", ""10.2514/6.2017-0221"", ""10.1007/bf03325776"", ""10.1007/BF03325788"", ""10.2514/1.J055634"", ""10.2514/1.J057103"", ""10.3390/en12030518"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-52919-5_13"", ""10.1007/s10494-015-9622-4"", ""10.1146/annurev.fl.18.010186.002005"", ""10.2514/3.12149"", ""10.1063/1.555744"", ""10.1002/andp.19243791502""]",['Engineering'],"['Computational Mechanics', 'Aerospace Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7435), ('1401 集成电路科学与工程', 0.74)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)]]"

The approach is underpinned by an inductive framework: this is structured as a sequential loop between a learner, which manipulates a candidate BC structured as a neural network, and a sound verifier, which either certifies the candidate’s validity or generates counter-examples to further guide the learner. We compare the approach against state-of-the-art techniques, over polynomial and non-polynomial dynamical models: the outcomes show that we can synthesise sound BCs up to two orders of magnitude faster, with in particular a stark speedup on the verification engine (up to three orders less), whilst needing a far smaller data set (up to three orders less) for the learning part. Beyond improvements over the state of the art, we further challenge the new approach on a hybrid dynamical model and on larger-dimensional models, and showcase the numerical robustness of our algorithms and codebase.","[{""name"": ""Andrea Peruffo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniele Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alessandro Abate"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3005328"", ""10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3005328"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_15"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2009.02.028"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45190-5_6"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225351"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.11.154"", ""10.1007/s10817-020-09562-z"", ""10.1016/j.jsc.2016.07.010"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-78800-3_24"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31365-3_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-38574-2_14"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-50497-0"", ""10.1016/j.nahs.2020.100858"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-19249-9_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-70545-1_17"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2005.08.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24743-2_32"", ""10.1109/TAC.2007.902736"", ""10.1109/CDC.2015.7402879"", ""10.1145/2968478.2968485"", ""10.15607/RSS.2017.XIII.049"", ""10.3182/20130904-3-FR-2041.00198"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_25"", ""10.1145/1168857.1168907"", ""10.1109/TRO.2017.2659727"", ""10.1145/2968478.2968484"", ""10.1145/3365365.3382222""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

If traffic congestion on the road ahead can be accurately and promptly predicted, and routes can be planned reasonably based on the prediction results, traffic congestion can be effectively alleviated. Aiming at the spatio‐temporal correlation and evolution characteristics of traffic flow data, the Conv–BiLSTM module comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short‐term memory (BiLSTM) is proposed, considering the spatio‐temporal features. Firstly, the obtained traffic speed data is folded according to spatio‐temporal features, and a three‐dimensional matrix is constructed as the input of the prediction network module. After the spatial features are extracted by the CNN, the temporal features and alignment features are extracted by the BiLSTM, followed by which the prediction results are obtained as an output. Prediction and evaluation experiments on the traffic data of the highway in Shanghai prove that the traffic congestion state predicted by this method is largely consistent with the actual state. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has a higher prediction accuracy compared with the conventional and state‐of‐the‐art methods and is an efficient method of traffic congestion prediction.","[{""name"": ""Tao Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Naval Architecture, Ocean &amp; Civil Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai 200240 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Anning Ni"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Naval Architecture, Ocean &amp; Civil Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai 200240 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Chunqin Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Civil Engineering and Architecture Zhejiang Sci‐Tech University Hangzhou 310018 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Guangnian Xiao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Economics and Management Shanghai Maritime University 1550 Haigang Ave 201306 Shanghai People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Linjie Gao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Naval Architecture, Ocean &amp; Civil Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai 200240 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.trc.2014.01.005"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:2(161)"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.08.017"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-18032-8_28"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2013.03.006"", ""10.1155/2018/7365761"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936443"", ""10.1109/TITS.2020.3000761"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0873"", ""10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735"", ""10.1080/01441647.2014.992496"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.014"", ""10.1109/ACC.2014.6858871"", ""10.3141/1776-25"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:6(664)"", ""10.1016/j.cageo.2004.05.012"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.10.002"", ""10.1115/1.3662552"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.02.006"", ""10.3141/1857-09"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.08.076"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0263"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2005.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2008.07.069"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5315"", ""10.1109/TITS.2014.2311123"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0119044"", ""10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848593"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0208"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5593"", ""10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171119"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2013.03.008"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2012.04.007"", ""10.1109/TITS.2010.2090521"", ""10.1177/1550147717713376"", ""10.1111/mice.12221"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2007.06.003"", ""10.1016/0191-2607(89)90071-X"", ""10.3390/su8111100"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000435"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.04.025"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2009.0053"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31205-2_4"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2017.0059""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"
10.1007/s11116-020-10116-w,TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0814 Civil Engineering,Relocating shared automated vehicles under parking constraints: assessing the impact of different strategies for on-street parking,"AbstractWith shared mobility services becoming increasingly popular and vehicle automation technology advancing fast, there is an increasing interest in analysing the impacts of large-scale deployment of shared automated vehicles. In this study, a large fleet of shared automated vehicles providing private rides to passengers is introduced to an agent-based simulation model based on the city of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The fleet is dimensioned for a sufficient service efficiency during peak-hours, meaning that in off-peak hours a substantial share of vehicles is idle, requiring vehicle relocation strategies. This study assesses the performance of zonal pro-active relocation strategies for on-demand passenger transport under constrained curbside parking capacity: (1) demand-anticipation, (2) even supply dispersion and (3) balancing between demand and supply of vehicles. The strategies are analysed in regard to service efficiency (passenger waiting times, operational efficiency), service externalities (driven mileage, parking usage) and service equity (spatial distribution of externalities and service provision). All pro-active relocation strategies are outperformed by a naïve remain-at-drop off-location strategy in a scenario where curbside parking capacity is in abundance. The demand-anticipation heuristic leads to the highest average waiting times due to vehicle bunching at demand-hotspots which results in an uneven usage of parking facilities. The most favourable results in regard to service efficiency and equity are achieved with the heuristics balancing demand and supply, at the costs of higher driven mileage due to the relocation of idle vehicles. These results open up opportunities for municipalities to accompany the introduction of large fleets of shared automated vehicles with suitable curbside management strategies that mitigate undesired effects.","[{""name"": ""Konstanze Winter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oded Cats"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Karel Martens"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bart van Arem"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1073/pnas.1611675114"", ""10.1007/s11116-014-9531-8"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2002.10.001"", ""10.1177/0361198119841032"", ""10.3141/2564-03"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.020"", ""10.1145/167293.167897"", ""10.4018/978-1-60566-226-8.ch003"", ""10.1016/J.PROCS.2019.04.121"", ""10.1016/J.TRA.2018.11.017"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2016.04.121"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2016.12.078"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2012.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2017.09.005"", ""10.1016/J.APACOUST.2016.09.018"", ""10.1016/J.TRANPOL.2017.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.08.020"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2857208"", ""10.1007/s11116-019-10007-9"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.12.001"", ""10.3141/2536-12"", ""10.1177/0361198119850785"", ""10.1016/J.TRC.2019.02.020"", ""10.5334/baw"", ""10.3390/ijerph14101265"", ""10.5334/baw.23"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.107"", ""10.3846/16484142.2017.1347827"", ""10.1109/MIS.2016.2"", ""10.5334/baw.3"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2017.08.003"", ""10.1016/J.TRC.2018.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2017.12.015"", ""10.4121/uuid:6108ed85-7b24-455e-bd95-89d84e6306fa"", ""10.1109/mtits.2017.8005630"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2014.09.060"", ""10.1177/0278364915581863"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2015.07.006"", ""10.1109/icra.2016.7487272"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.01.008""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"
10.1007/s40534-020-00219-6,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Random dynamic analysis of vertical train-bridge systems under small probability by surrogate model and subset simulation with splitting,"AbstractThe response of the train–bridge system has an obvious random behavior. A high traffic density and a long maintenance period of a track will result in a substantial increase in the number of trains running on a bridge, and there is small likelihood that the maximum responses of the train and bridge happen in the total maintenance period of the track. Firstly, the coupling model of train–bridge systems is reviewed. Then, an ensemble method is presented, which can estimate the small probabilities of a dynamic system with stochastic excitations. The main idea of the ensemble method is to use the NARX (nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input) model to replace the physical model and apply subset simulation with splitting to obtain the extreme distribution. Finally, the efficiency of the suggested method is compared with the direct Monte Carlo simulation method, and the probability exceedance of train responses under the vertical track irregularity is discussed. The results show that when the small probability of train responses under vertical track irregularity is estimated, the ensemble method can reduce both the calculation time of a single sample and the required number of samples.","[{""name"": ""Huoyue Xiang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ping Tang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuan Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yongle Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/23248378.2013.791498"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1605085"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2017.11.004"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2014.11.008"", ""10.1177/0954409715616836"", ""10.1080/23248378.2017.1338538"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2017.12.024"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2015.12.002"", ""10.1155/2017/2365812"", ""10.1002/wics.1314"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2003)129:8(901)"", ""10.1016/j.cma.2004.05.028"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2013.03.051"", ""10.1007/s00158-016-1528-9"", ""10.1007/s00158-012-0857-6"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2020.106236"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2020.106198"", ""10.1016/j.apor.2013.03.003"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.07.036"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2014.12.007"", ""10.1615/Int.J.UncertaintyQuantification.2016016603"", ""10.1177/1369433219849809"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2015.05.002"", ""10.1016/j.jweia.2005.04.001"", ""10.1080/00207178908953491"", ""10.1002/9781118535561""]",['Engineering'],"['Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

A safe interactive system that interacts with people and things is essential to achieve these objectives. In this context, a crowd intelligence system plays a key role in interactive system development. Crowd intelligence is a combined method of data collection, integration and analysis from devices such as the smartphones, wearables, vehicles and a wide range of Internet of Things applications to use them as sensors. This collective feedback‐driven interactive method is opportunistic for the development of the future transportation system. In this study, a survey is conducted considering crowd‐intelligence techniques for the transportation system. From this survey, various challenges of the intelligent transportation system have been outlined and crowd‐intelligent solutions have been discussed. A layered structure of transportation system architecture is suggested considering various problems in each layer and its crowd‐intelligent solutions. The crowd‐intelligence‐based mobility, traffic control, traffic prediction, parking solutions have been discussed in this survey. Moreover, the importance of crowd‐intelligent techniques and its applicability is discussed for sustainable development of futuristic transport infrastructure.","[{""name"": ""Rathin Chandra Shit"",

10.1049/itr2.12041,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Automated classification system for drowsiness detection using convolutional neural network and electroencephalogram,"Abstract Detecting drowsiness in drivers while driving is extremely important to avoid possible accidents and reduce the fatality rate due to drivers sleeping at the wheel. A real‐time alert generation when the driver might possibly go into sleepy state is essential to safeguard any unwarranted incidents. Wearable sensors to monitor vehicle movement and camera‐based systems to monitor driver behaviour are commonly used to detect driver drowsiness. Due to the fact that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have the ability to monitor the mood of humans and are easily obtainable, many different EEG‐based drowsiness detection systems have been proposed to date. In this study, a novel deep learning architecture based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for automated drowsiness detection using a single‐channel EEG signal. To improve the generalization performance of the proposed method, subject‐wise, cross‐subject‐wise, and combined‐subjects‐wise validations have been employed. The whole of the work is carried over pre‐recorded sleep state EEG data obtained from benchmarked dataset. The experimental results show a superior detection capability compared to the existing state–of–the–art drowsiness detection methods using single‐channel EEG signals.","[{""name"": ""Venkata Phanikrishna Balam"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Engineering National Institute of Technology Rourkela  Rourkela India""]}, {""name"": ""Venkata Udaya Sameer"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Engineering National Institute of Technology Rourkela  Rourkela India""]}, {""name"": ""Suchismitha Chinara"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science and Engineering National Institute of Technology Rourkela  Rourkela India""]}]","[""10.1016/j.aap.2018.01.012"", ""10.1007/s00213-019-05424-8"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2017.0183"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914373"", ""10.1016/j.jsr.2019.12.015"", ""10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101686"", ""10.1016/j.inffus.2019.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.bspc.2020.101865"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2012.0032"", ""10.1088/1741-2552/ab260c"", ""10.3390/app7121239"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2811723"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951028"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0216456"", ""10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105116"", ""10.1016/j.patrec.2018.02.010"", ""10.3390/s150820873"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2008.01.007"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2015.05.028"", ""10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2046415"", ""10.1109/SCEECS48394.2020.61"", ""10.1016/j.apacoust.2020.107224"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-93940-7_7"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2019.2917850"", ""10.1016/j.micpro.2018.02.004"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5290"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0183"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.02.041"", ""10.1016/j.bbe.2015.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.medengphy.2013.07.011"", ""10.1016/j.bbe.2018.05.005"", ""10.1007/s11571-018-9496-y"", ""10.1007/s13748-019-00203-0"", ""10.1046/j.1440-1819.2001.00810.x"", ""10.1016/j.neucli.2016.07.002"", ""10.1007/s13534-016-0223-5"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2015.2473679""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Engineering']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12003,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,A review of system integration and current integrity monitoring methods for positioning in intelligent transport systems,"Abstract Applications of intelligent transportation systems are continuously increasing. Since positioning is a key component in these systems, it is essential to ensure its reliability and robustness, and monitor its integrity so that the required levels of positioning accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability can be maintained. In challenging environments, such as urban areas, a single navigation system is often difficult to fulfil the positioning requirements. Therefore, integrating different navigation sensors becomes intrinsic, which may include the global navigation satellite systems, the inertial navigation systems, the odometers and the light detection and ranging sensors. To bind the positioning errors within a pre‐defined integrity risk, the integrity monitoring is an essential step in the positioning service, which needs to be fulfilled for integrated vehicular navigation systems used in intelligent transportation systems. Developing such innovative integrity monitoring techniques requires knowledge of many relevant aspects including the structure, positioning methodology and different errors affecting the positioning solution of the individual and integrated systems. Moreover, knowledge is needed for the current mitigation techniques of these errors, for possible fault detection and exclusion algorithms and for computation of protection levels. This paper provides an overview and discussion of these aspects with a focus on intelligent transportation systems.","[{""name"": ""Tarek Hassan"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Earth and Planetary Sciences Curtin University  GPO Box U1987 Perth WA 6845 Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Ahmed El‐Mowafy"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Earth and Planetary Sciences Curtin University  GPO Box U1987 Perth WA 6845 Australia""]}, {""name"": ""Kan Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Earth and Planetary Sciences Curtin University  GPO Box U1987 Perth WA 6845 Australia""]}]","[""10.1093/ietcom/e90-b.7.1816"", ""10.1017/S0373463312000082"", ""10.33012/2018.16028"", ""10.1017/S0373463311000087"", ""10.20965/jrm.2016.p0031"", ""10.1007/s10291-012-0305-5"", ""10.1017/S0373463313000350"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2017.2654359"", ""10.1007/s10291-014-0384-6"", ""10.1007/PL00012765"", ""10.3390/s150923286"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-42928-1"", ""10.1109/70.544770"", ""10.1109/5.736347"", ""10.1002/j.2161-4296.2004.tb00338.x"", ""10.1002/0470099720"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-30466-8"", ""10.3390/s130809549"", ""10.1002/apmc.1988.051620106"", ""10.1155/2017/8739598"", ""10.1515/9783110879957"", ""10.1007/978-3-7091-6199-9"", ""10.1007/BF02521068"", ""10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700030"", ""10.3390/proceedings2130852"", ""10.1109/34.121791"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2008.4543181"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241772"", ""10.1109/IROS.2005.1545234"", ""10.1002/j.2161-4296.2007.tb00404.x"", ""10.1016/j.robot.2005.02.004"", ""10.1109/IVS.2014.6856405"", ""10.1017/S0263574708004840"", ""10.1109/IVS.2008.4621318"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152375"", ""10.1007/s10514-009-9108-0"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570528"", ""10.1109/TIV.2017.2749181"", ""10.1017/S0373463319000638"", ""10.1080/12265934.2018.1473043"", ""10.3390/rs11111348"", ""10.3390/rs9111188"", ""10.3390/app9112341"", ""10.1115/1.3662552"", ""10.1007/978-3-7091-2804-6"", ""10.1017/S037346331400054X"", ""10.3390/mi6020196"", ""10.1007/s00190-019-01306-1"", ""10.1109/TAES.2018.2876583"", ""10.1109/JPROC.2008.2006101"", ""10.1002/j.2161-4296.1988.tb00975.x"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2766768"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977455"", ""10.1109/TAES.2014.130739"", ""10.1109/TIE.2015.2417501"", ""10.1109/TIE.2015.2417501"", ""10.1088/1361-6501/ab1836"", ""10.1098/rsta.1933.0009"", ""10.1088/1361-6501/aa5c66"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.0106"", ""10.1002/j.2161-4296.1996.tb01920.x"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9453(2010)136:1(13)"", ""10.2514/1.59480"", ""10.1109/TAES.2018.2850381""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The threat of a decline in food production in various countries by climate change triggers a long drought. The increase in temperature causes heat stress on the plant which has an impact on the decline in land quality and others. Heat stress is often defined as an increase in temperature for a certain period of time, which can cause irreversible damage to plants, which generally occurs at temperatures of 10-15°C above the threshold. Heat stress is a major factor limiting crop productivity and adaptation, especially when extreme temperatures coincide with the critical stage of plant growth. Heat stress is a major factor limiting crop productivity and adaptation, especially when extreme temperatures coincide with the critical stage of plant growth. Excessive heat can disrupt by denaturing enzymes and damaging metabolism so that changes occur in the morphological structure, phenology, physiology and molecular plants. The response to increase in temperature of 5-10° C, makes plants produce a unique protein called heat shock proteins (HSP). An increase in HSP production occurs when plants experience a sudden or gradual increase in temperature. HSP is released when the stress of exposed to plant. Under these conditions HSP is useful for protecting proteins and causes resistant plants. The resistance obtained by heat shock is different from the resistance obtained by rapid growth at moderately high temperatures. This difference is presumed by the presence of HSP responses induced by heat stress. The HSP can play a role as a sign of gene stress and activation and in regulating oxidation reactions in cells. Utilization of heat stress signaling in food crops breeding can be used to development Wheat Tolerance to High Temperature.","[{""name"": ""Firmansyah"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N Argosubekti"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1078/0176-1617-00594"", ""10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.05.015"", ""10.1016/S0176-1617(98)80209-5"", ""10.1016/j.tibs.2006.05.001"", ""10.12702/1984-7033.v03n02a01"", ""10.1071/FP03105"", ""10.1016/S0981-9428(99)80061-8"", ""10.1002/9780470650011.ch5"", ""10.2135/cropsci2001.4151405x"", ""10.1146/annurev.ge.22.120188.003215"", ""10.1016/j.cub.2010.10.035"", ""10.1146/annurev-arplant-042809-112116"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0126051"", ""10.1016/S0168-1923(98)00089-6"", ""10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.05.011"", ""10.1016/j.envpol.2005.01.032"", ""10.1146/annurev.pp.42.060191.003051"", ""10.1007/s10535-007-0021-0"", ""10.1093/jxb/47.3.325""]","['Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Plant Science', 'Molecular Biology', 'Physiology']","[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7379), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7336)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7815), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7672)]]"

EVs are using lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and it have many challenges like low efficiency at low and high temperatures, decline of electrode’s life at high temperature and safety concerns related to thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries are the directly impact on performance, reliability, cost and safety of the vehicle. Overheating caused by electron’s movements during chemical reactions during the charging and discharging process in elevated temperatures can lead to fatal destruction of the batteries. Hence an efficient battery thermal management system (BTMS) is one of the most necessary technologies for success of the electric vehicles in the long term.

While trip chain complexity is conventionally investigated between travel modes, our scope is the more aggregated level of a person’s activity-travel pattern. Using data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel, a latent class cluster analysis was performed to group people with similar mode choice behaviour in distinct mobility pattern classes. All trip chains were assigned to both a travel mode and the mobility pattern class of the traveller. Subsequently, differences in trip chain complexity distributions were analysed between travel modes and between mobility pattern classes. Results indicate considerable differences between travel modes, particularly between multimodal and unimodal trip chains, but also between the unimodal travel modes car, bicycle, walking and public transport trip chains. No substantial differences in trip chain complexity were found between mobility pattern classes. Independently of the included travel modes, the distributions of trip chain complexity degrees were similar across mobility pattern classes. This means that personal circumstances such as the number of working hours or household members are not systematically translated into specific mobility patterns.","[{""name"": ""Florian Schneider"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Danique Ton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lara-Britt Zomer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Winnie Daamen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dorine Duives"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sascha Hoogendoorn-Lanser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Serge Hoogendoorn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5198/jtlu.2017.882"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.08.003"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.11.007"", ""10.2307/2340521"", ""10.1007/s11116-007-9136-6"", ""10.3141/2231-04"", ""10.1023/A:1005246916731"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2013.01.040"", ""10.1007/s11116-013-9479-0"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2015.12.027"", ""10.1080/03081060.2012.680812"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2006.03.006"", ""10.1007/s11116-006-7728-1"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2013.06.001"", ""10.1007/s11116-007-9134-8"", ""10.1007/s11116-019-09975-9"", ""10.1186/1472-6947-9-47"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2006.03.004""]",['Social Sciences'],['Transportation'],"[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

For the model creation and simulation, PCSWMM based on the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used. The analysis was carried out by considering different land use conversion scenarios including the implementation of LID practices. Therefore, a specific permeable pavement and green roof developed and implemented at full scale at University of Calabria were chosen as source-control measures. The simulations were run by using as input a synthetic hyetograph of 30 min with return period of 10 years. Three hydrological performance indexes, Runoff Coefficient (RC), Runoff Reduction (RR) and Peak Flow Reduction (PFR) were evaluated at subcatchment scale and, a mean value was estimated for an overall evaluation. Main findings show that RR and PFR linearly increase with the reduction of imperviousness due to the modelling of a major percentage of LID solutions, while the RC decreases. In addition, first detailed results reveal the suitability of LID solutions to reduce surface runoff also for the scenario 1 which considers the conversion of only 30% of specific impervious surface in green roofs and permeable pavements.","[{""name"": ""S A Palermo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""V C Talarico"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Turco"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0169-2046(03)00026-4"", ""10.1890/10-1551.1"", ""10.1016/j.habitatint.2014.10.011"", ""10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2019.01.008"", ""10.1080/1573062X.2014.916314"", ""10.2166/wst.2018.060"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000238"", ""10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.12.014"", ""10.1088/1748-9326/9/5/055002"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.119"", ""10.1080/23311916.2017.1410272"", ""10.1007/s12665-019-8312-2"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.06.050"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.01.036"", ""10.1080/1573062X.2018.1439975""]",['Environmental Science'],"['Environmental Engineering', 'Global and Planetary Change']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)]]"

We propose a logical framework based on first-order logic, and develop the main tool we rely upon for achieving the automation of proofs of quantum specification: PPS, a parametric extension of the recently developed path sum semantics. To back-up our claims, we implement and verify parametric versions of several famous and non-trivial quantum algorithms, including the quantum parts of Shor’s integer factoring, quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Grover’s search.","[{""name"": ""Christophe Chareton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sébastien Bardin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""François Bobot"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Valentin Perrelle"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Benoît Valiron"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4204/EPTCS.287.1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_1"", ""10.1038/s41586-019-1666-5"", ""10.26421/QIC3.2-8"", ""10.1109/ISMVL.2019.00026"", ""10.1038/nature23474"", ""10.1145/3385412.3386007"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.195.6"", ""10.4086/toc.2018.v014a011"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3408"", ""10.1145/242223.242257"", ""10.1098/rspa.1998.0164"", ""10.1017/9781316219317"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.318.6"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.287.5"", ""10.1126/science.1057726"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-73368-3_21"", ""10.1007/s10703-016-0243-x"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-70545-1_51"", ""10.1103/RevModPhys.86.153"", ""10.1007/s00224-018-9872-3"", ""10.1145/2499370.2462177"", ""10.1145/237814.237866"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2019.2897703"", ""10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502"", ""10.1145/3434318"", ""10.1145/3307650.3322213"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_22"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2009.07.045"", ""10.1145/3428218"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25543-5_12"", ""10.1109/FOCS.2018.00033"", ""10.1145/3428198"", ""10.1007/s10817-019-09518-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-59936-6_7"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009894"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.287.17"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.266.8"", ""10.1017/S0960129506005238"", ""10.23919/DATE.2018.8341993"", ""10.22331/q-2018-01-31-49"", ""10.1145/3183895.3183901"", ""10.1109/MC.2016.293"", ""10.1145/2699415"", ""10.1145/2049706.2049708"", ""10.1007/s00165-018-0465-3"", ""10.1145/2629680"", ""10.1145/3009837.3009840""]","['Computer Science', 'Physics and Astronomy']","['Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0704 天文学', 0.7308), ('0702 物理学', 0.7214), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7121), ('1404 遥感科学与技术', 0.7093), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7071)], [('0702 物理学', 0.7711), ('0803 光学工程', 0.7598)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

Its prevalence has had a powerful impact in healthcare, with numerous applications and intelligent systems achieving clinical level expertise. However, building robust and generalizable systems relies on training algorithms in a centralized fashion using large, heterogeneous datasets. In medicine, these datasets are time consuming to annotate and difficult to collect centrally due to privacy concerns. Recently, Federated Learning has been proposed as a distributed learning technique to alleviate many of these privacy concerns by providing a decentralized training paradigm for models using large, distributed data. This new approach has become the defacto way of building machine learning models in multiple industries (e.g. edge computing, smartphones). Due to its strong potential, Federated Learning is also becoming a popular training method in healthcare, where patient privacy is of paramount concern. In this paper we performed an extensive literature review to identify state-of-the-art Federated Learning applications for cancer research and clinical oncology analysis.

Currently, there are a large number of widely accepted commercial software. For example, Aspen Plus which was used to simulate offshore petroleum production processes, but it is often too costly to purchase and maintain a valid software license. On the other hand, since open-source software is freely accessible, the simulation models developed using open-source software could be studied, reviewed, and modified by any interested parties. This would help promoting technology transfer and knowledge dissemination in both academic and industry sectors. We specifically focus on the simulation of chemical process using the modeling software to evaluate thermal and chemical behaviour of the system which uses the chemical processes related to offshore petroleum production facilities as an example to demonstrate the software capabilities of both Aspen Plus and DWSIM. This work emphasizes on the comparison of simulation results calculated by commercial software namely Aspen Plus vs. open-source software called DWSIM (An open-source sequential modular steady state simulator) [1]. The simulation was carried out under the steady-state conditions, adiabatic processes, and negligible pressure losses. Finally, simulation results from DWSIM and Aspen Plus were compared with the heat and mass flow diagram which was used as reference. It was found that the discrepancy between simulation and reported values was in general less than 5%. It has been demonstrated that free and open-source software like DWSIM could potentially perform similar tasks as commercial software.","[{""name"": ""Kwanchanok Tangsriwong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Puttida Lapchit"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tanatip Kittijungjit"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thepparat Klamrassamee"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yanin Sukjai"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yossapong Laoonual"", ""affiliation"": []}]",[],['Engineering'],['Ocean Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

Metro has become an essential transport infrastructure and the passenger volume provides the basic support for the optimisation of the metro system. Thus, accurate forecasting of the volume is extremely required. In this study, a model for improving the accuracy and stability of metro passenger volume prediction named VMD‐TPE‐LightGBM (light gradient boosting machine) is proposed. The original dataset is firstly regrouped both in the station and chronological order while the time interval is reset as 10‐minute. Time features for extracting the hidden patterns are extracted by analysing the variation tendency of the passenger volume. For enhancing the precision, the variational mode decomposition algorithm is applied to decompose the original data series. Then each of the modes is regarded as the input of the LightGBM model, which are optimised by a tuning method named the tree of Parzen estimators and K‐fold cross‐validation. According to this process, the final forecasting results are acquired by reconstructing the predicted modes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model performs superior to all the comparisons and has an impressive effect on short‐term metro passenger volume forecasting.","[{""name"": ""Youyang Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Traffic &amp; Transportation Lanzhou Jiaotong University Gansu 730070 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Changfeng Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Traffic &amp; Transportation Lanzhou Jiaotong University Gansu 730070 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Qingrong Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electronic &amp; Information Engineering Lanzhou Jiaotong University Gansu 730070 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950327"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2879497"", ""10.1109/TITS.2017.2711046"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2019.121065"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2018.12.005"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2019.122601"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.02.006"", ""10.1016/j.tre.2014.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.05.099"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.417"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2010.09.083"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.06.011"", ""10.1016/j.future.2017.08.041"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0147263"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944744"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2854913"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2007.11.003"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2015.03.085"", ""10.1145/2939672.2939785"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901920"", ""10.1049/iet-net.2019.0103"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2886549"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2635719"", ""10.1155/2017/7074143"", ""10.3390/ijgi5110201"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.02.019"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2018.12.016"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2019.123913"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936938"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2016.03.103"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.193"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2019.03.007"", ""10.1109/TSP.2013.2288675"", ""10.1016/j.apm.2018.01.014"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2015.05.067"", ""10.1109/JSYST.2015.2487339"", ""10.1214/aos/1013203451"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2779794""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

If the surface waviness occurs on the races of the motor bearing, it will cause abnormal vibration and noise, accelerate fatigue and wear, and seriously affect the stability and safety of the traction power transmission. In this paper, an excitation model coupling the time-varying displacement and contact stiffness excitations is adopted to investigate the effect of the surface waviness of the motor bearing on the traction motor under the excitation from the locomotive-track coupled system. The detailed mechanical power transmission path and the internal/external excitations (e.g., wheel–rail interaction, gear mesh, and internal interactions of the rolling bearing) of the locomotive are comprehensively considered to provide accurate dynamic loads for the traction motor. Effects of the wavenumber and amplitude of the surface waviness on the traction motor and its neighbor components of the locomotive are investigated. The results indicate that controlling the amplitude of the waviness and avoiding the wavenumber being an integer multiple of the number of the rollers are helpful for reducing the abnormal vibration and noise of the traction motor.","[{""name"": ""Yuqing Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zaigang Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wei Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kaiyun Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0301-679X(99)00077-8"", ""10.1115/1.3662587"", ""10.1115/1.4032582"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107257"", ""10.1080/05698196508972094"", ""10.1016/S0890-6955(99)00076-0"", ""10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00127-5"", ""10.1177/1077546315589675"", ""10.1007/s11431-017-9110-3"", ""10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2020.103799"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115650"", ""10.1080/00423110802621561"", ""10.1080/23248378.2013.791498"", ""10.1007/s40534-020-00203-0"", ""10.1177/0954409715617787"", ""10.1177/0954409720902359"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.05.038"", ""10.1080/23248378.2020.1867658"", ""10.1080/00423114.2018.1473615"", ""10.1080/00423114.2021.1918728"", ""10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2020.103838"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2021.116029"", ""10.1115/1.3453332"", ""10.1115/1.3063817"", ""10.1007/s12206-012-0627-9"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.09.023"", ""10.1016/j.protcy.2014.08.057"", ""10.1002/(SICI)1097-0207(19961230)39:24<4199::AID-NME39>3.0.CO;2-Y"", ""10.1016/0771-050X(80)90013-3""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

A new symmetric key exchange scenario for smart city applications is presented in this research. The protocol is based on the specific properties of the Fuss‐Catalan numbers and the Lattice Path combinatorics. The proposed scenario consists of three phases: generating a Fuss‐Catalan object based on the grid dimension, defining the movement in the Lattice Path Grid and defining the key equalisation rules. In the experimental part, the authors present the security analysis of the protocol as well as its test. Also, they examine the equivalence of the proposed with Maurer's satellite scenario and suggest a new scenario that implements an information‐theoretical protocol for the public key distribution. Additionally, a comparison with related studies and methods is provided, as well as a comparison with satellite scenario, which proves the advantages of solution presented by the authors.

Unfortunately, neural networks are known to suffer from various safety and security issues. Formal verification is a promising avenue for tackling this difficulty, by formally certifying that networks are correct. We propose an SMT-based technique for verifyingbinarized neural networks— a popular kind of neural network, where some weights have been binarized in order to render the neural network more memory and energy efficient, and quicker to evaluate. One novelty of our technique is that it allows the verification of neural networks that include both binarized and non-binarized components. Neural network verification is computationally very difficult, and so we propose here various optimizations, integrated into our SMT procedure as deduction steps, as well as an approach for parallelizing verification queries. We implement our technique as an extension to the Marabou framework, and use it to evaluate the approach on popular binarized neural network architectures.","[{""name"": ""Guy Amir"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haoze Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Clark Barrett"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guy Katz"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-44534-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_11"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2012.6248110"", ""10.7249/R366"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-55754-6_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-01090-4_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_3"", ""10.1109/DASC.2016.7778091"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.257.3"", ""10.1007/s10703-021-00363-7"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.1145/3341216.3342218"", ""10.1609/aaai.v29i1.9513"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.12206"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-46493-0_32"", ""10.1007/s10994-021-06050-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00748"", ""10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11623""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"

However, it is often impossible to detect these faults immediately through single-point monitoring or collecting data after accidents. To coordinate the power quality data of both traction power supply systems (TPSSs) and high-speed trains (HSTs), a monitoring and assessing system is proposed to access the power quality issues on HSRs. By integrating train monitoring, traction substation monitoring and data center, this monitoring system not only realizes the real-time monitoring of operational behaviors for both TPSSs and HSTs, but also conducts a comprehensive assessment of operational quality for train-network systems. Based on a large number of monitoring data, the field measurements show that this real-time monitoring system is effective for monitoring and evaluating a traction-network system.","[{""name"": ""Jun Zhu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haitao Hu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhengyou He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaomin Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Weiguo Pan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2033800"", ""10.1109/TPWRD.2008.2005361"", ""10.1007/s40534-020-00211-0"", ""10.1177/2057150X18803581"", ""10.1007/s40534-020-00206-x"", ""10.1109/TIE.2007.904022"", ""10.1109/TPWRD.2016.2586963"", ""10.1109/TIM.2003.820496"", ""10.1109/TPWRD.2007.911126"", ""10.1109/APAP.2011.6180829"", ""10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2043122"", ""10.1109/TSG.2012.2233767"", ""10.1007/s40565-018-0473-6""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The average comprehensive utilization rate of fly ash in China is 70%, which is mainly used in building materials, but is relatively low in road, backfill and other scopes. Compared with developed countries, the scope and limit value of indexes involved in the standards of fly ash in China are loose, and the fields involved are mostly traditional building materials and infrastructure construction. The comprehensive utilization of fly ash of China can be improved from the following points: the indexes investigated in standards should reflect and conform to the particularity of China; the comprehensive utilization standard of fly ash should be more suitable for the local region; the power plants should actively explore and improve their own comprehensive utilization.","[{""name"": ""Shengxiang Jin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhihong Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shifeng Jiang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jian Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Haibin Pan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Long Jiang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s10971-019-05204-y"", ""10.1080/17436753.2017.1342394"", ""10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.11.016""]","['Earth and Planetary Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Geochemistry and Petrology', 'Civil and Structural Engineering']","[[('0816 测绘科学与技术', 0.74), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.739), ('0708 地球物理学', 0.7365), ('0709 地质学', 0.7363), ('0705 地理学', 0.7352)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0820 石油与天然气工程', 0.7485), ('0818 地质资源与地质工程', 0.7296)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Calculation of the thermal comfort of a room issued with a PMV index is quite complicated, considering the determination of the effect parameters can take a long time because it has a non-linear relationship. The purpose of this study is to analyze the sensitivity parameters that affect thermal comfort and to develop an artificial neural network model to predict the thermal comfort of the PMV index with two different input scenarios. Sensitivity analysis of thermal comfort uses the rank Spearman method, whereas the modeling of artificial neural networks uses the backpropagation method using a total of 784 data as data training and testing. Based on the results of sensitivity analysis shows metabolism rate and clothing insulation have a significant effect on the sensitivity of thermal comfort. Prediction of thermal comfort with the PMV index using an artificial neural network is very effective and has higher accuracy. The results are proven by validating the two model scenarios with an R2 value of 0.99 and low RMSE value.","[{""name"": ""H A Dyvia"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Arif"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.enconman.2009.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2004.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.ergon.2016.12.002"", ""10.25077/josi.v12.n1.p310-316.2013"", ""10.31028/ji.v10.i1.1-10"", ""10.1016/S0301-6226(98)00194-8"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.01.001""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

For large messages, this capability is designed to achieve reduction bandwidths similar to those of point-to-point messages of the same size, and complements the latency-optimized low-latency aggregation reduction capabilities, aimed at small data reductions. MPI_Allreduce() bandwidth measured on an HDR InfiniBand based system achieves about 95% of network bandwidth. For medium and large data reduction this also improves the reduction bandwidth by a factor of 2–5 relative to host-based (e.g., software-based) reduction algorithms. Using this capability also increased DL-Poly and PyTorch application performance by as much as 4% and 18%, respectively. This paper describes SHARP Streaming-Aggregation hardware architecture and a set of synthetic and application benchmarks used to study this new reduction capability, and the range of data sizes for which Streaming-Aggregation performs better than the low-latency aggregation algorithm.","[{""name"": ""Richard L.

It is crucial to fully understand the influence of operation parameters and types of gasifier on the performance of biomass gasification. It also can provide useful information for a better design and operation of gasification process. The general overview on each types of gasifier are discussed where it can be classified into fixed bed and fluidized bed gasifiers. Most of the review from literature focuses more on the effects of temperature and equivalence ratio rather than gasifying agent. However, the review on the effect of gasifying agent is still limited whereas the effect of gasifying agent is also important as it influences the yield and composition of product gas. In the present work, the effects of gasifying agent, temperature and equivalence ratio on the gasification process were reviewed. Firstly, this article highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each gasifiers which consists of fixed bed and fluidized bed. Based on review, a detailed comparison was made in terms of syngas composition obtained by using steam, air, oxygen and carbon dioxide as gasifying agents in order to provide basic knowledge regarding the selection of gasifying agents. The effects of temperature and equivalence ratio (ER) on the gas composition, tar content and reaction rate were discussed and analyzed. Finally, guidelines on the operation parameters in terms of gasifying agent, temperature and equivalence ratio are suggested in the summary review.","[{""name"": ""F N Sidek"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N A F Abdul Samad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Saleh"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b03489"", ""10.1080/15567036.2013.783657"", ""10.1039/C6EE00935B"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2010.09.101"", ""10.1016/j.ces.2017.04.050"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201713103008"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2013.07.068"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.11.007"", ""10.1016/J.ENG.2017.03.004"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.08.022"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2010.02.025"", ""10.1063/1.5117101"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.01.130"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2019.05.003""]","['Materials Science', 'Engineering']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

We present Paracosm, a framework for writing systematic test scenarios for autonomous driving simulations. Paracosm allows users to programmatically describe complex driving situations with specific features, e.g., road layouts and environmental conditions, as well as reactive temporal behaviors of other cars and pedestrians. A systematic exploration of the state space, both for visual features and for reactive interactions with the environment is made possible. We define a notion of test coverage for parameter configurations based on combinatorial testing and low dispersion sequences. Using fuzzing on parameter configurations, our automatic test generator can maximize coverage of various behaviors and find problematic cases. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the capabilities of Paracosm in programmatically modeling parameterized test environments, and in finding problematic scenarios.","[{""name"": ""Rupak Majumdar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aman Mathur"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Marcus Pirron"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Laura Stegner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Damien Zufferey"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1145/3180155.3180160"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_21"", ""10.1145/2970276.2970311"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24953-7_35"", ""10.1007/s10703-017-0286-7"", ""10.1145/3126521"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57288-8_26"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_1"", ""10.1145/3302504.3313351"", ""10.1109/ACC.2015.7171969"", ""10.1145/3314221.3314633"", ""10.1145/3338906.3338942"", ""10.1145/3293882.3330566"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1109/ASE.2019.00013"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-11164-3_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-44833-4_6"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00108"", ""10.6028/NIST.SP.800-142"", ""10.1007/978-1-4302-3748-8"", ""10.1145/3238147.3238202"", ""10.1145/3158134"", ""10.1109/MODELS.2019.00-12"", ""10.1137/1.9781611970081"", ""10.1145/3052973.3053009"", ""10.1145/3132747.3132785"", ""10.14722/ndss.2017.23404"", ""10.1016/0895-7177(96)00036-2"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/368 10.24963/ijcai.2018/368"", ""10.1145/2483760.2483790"", ""10.1145/2185632.2185653"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180220"", ""10.1109/IVS.2018.8500421"", ""10.1145/3178126.3187004"", ""10.1145/349299.349331"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_22""]","['Computer Science', 'Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Software', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

The accurate identification of abnormal driving behaviour helps to judge the driver's driving style, inform surrounding vehicles, and ensure the road traffic safety. Most of the existing studies use clustering and shallow learning, it is difficult to accurately identify the types of abnormal driving behaviours. Aimed at addressing the difficulty of identifying driving behaviour, this study proposed a recognition model based on a long short‐term memory network and convolutional neural network (LSTM‐CNN). The extreme acceleration and deceleration points are detected through the statistical analysis of real vehicle driving data, and the driving behaviour recognition data set is established. By using the data set to train the model, the LSTM‐CNN can achieve a better result.","[{""name"": ""Shuo Jia"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Transportation Engineering School of Information Engineering, Chang'an University Middle‐section of Nan'er Huan Road Xi'an People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Fei Hui"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Transportation Engineering School of Information Engineering, Chang'an University Middle‐section of Nan'er Huan Road Xi'an People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Shining Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Transportation Engineering School of Information Engineering, Chang'an University Middle‐section of Nan'er Huan Road Xi'an People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiangmo Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Transportation Engineering School of Information Engineering, Chang'an University Middle‐section of Nan'er Huan Road Xi'an People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Asad J.

10.1007/s12469-020-00240-2,PUBLIC TRANSPORT,0823 Transportation Engineering,Insights into factors affecting the combined bicycle-transit mode,"AbstractThis paper considers an increasingly popular, sustainable multimodality: the combination of bicycle and transit. The flexibility of the bicycle combined with the speed and comfort of good transit can be a highly competitive alternative to the car. This study shows that many factors influence the uptake and attractiveness of the bicycle-transit combination. An in-depth literature review resulted in over thirty unique factors: six transit-related factors, twenty-first-last mile factors and fifteen context-related factors. All these factors might influence the demand for this ‘new’ mode positively or negatively. An exploratory choice modelling study showed the weights of some factors that Dutch bicycle-train users consider when choosing to cycle to a railway station. The weights showed that people are especially willing to cycle to a station with longer bicycle time (or bicycle parking time) when by doing so they can avoid a transfer in their train trip thereafter. The willingness to pay found were €0.11 for 1 min less bicycle time, €0.08 for a minute less train time, €0.11 for a minute of less time to park and €0.60 per avoided transfer. These kinds of insights give the bicycle and transit sector valuable information to be used in modelling multimodality and cost–benefit analyses, thereby supporting improved decision making and integrated design of bicycle and transit networks.","[{""name"": ""Joeri F.

IVs have made significant progress in recent years, but it is still face great challenges in order to be accepted by users on a large scale. In this regard, the authors propose that the research of IVs can be developed along the lines of safety, comfort and economy, gradually overcoming existing dilemmas. First of all, security is the most basic requirement of IVs. The authors sort out the key technologies and challenges of the basic architecture of IVs, and propose existing attack and defences strategies for IVs information security technology. Secondly, comfort is more about people's subjective feelings. From two aspects of physiological comfort and psychological comfort, the paper studies the anthropomorphic decision‐making to overcome the mechanized speed control, human computer interaction design, personalized driving style and ethical decision‐making methods. Then, aiming at the micro‐ and macro‐levels of economy, it outlines technologies such as economic driving behavioural, collaborative control of people, vehicles and roads and IVs sharing. Finally, the authors summarized the challenges and future development directions in the three stages of IVs development.","[{""name"": ""Lin Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Automotive and

10.1049/itr2.12208,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,A review of reinforcement learning applications in adaptive traffic signal control,"Abstract In urban areas, the problem of recurring daily congestion is constantly increasing. A possible solution is seen in the application of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems for the control of signalized intersections. While available ATSC systems can achieve an increase in the Level of Service, the focus of ATSC research has shifted towards the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, which allow the controller to learn the optimal control policy by direct interaction with the environment. This paper describes the fundamentals of traffic signal control, RL algorithms and approaches and their application to ATSC, with a discussion on the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles on future traffic signal control. In conclusion, a summary of open research questions and possible directions for future research in the domain of RL‐based traffic signal control is given.","[{""name"": ""Mladen Miletić"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Intelligent Transport Systems, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences University of Zagreb Zagreb Croatia""]}, {""name"": ""Edouard Ivanjko"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Intelligent Transport Systems, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences University of Zagreb Zagreb Croatia""]}, {""name"": ""Martin Gregurić"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Intelligent Transport Systems, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences University of Zagreb Zagreb Croatia""]}, {""name"": ""Krešimir Kušić"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Intelligent Transport Systems, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences University of Zagreb Zagreb Croatia""]}]","[""10.23919/ELMAR.2018.8534608"", ""10.1061/JTEPBS.0000068"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-037025-5.50040-2"", ""10.23919/ELMAR.2017.8124425"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728449"", ""10.1049/iet-smc.2019.0034"", ""10.3141/2035-07"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2008.01.002"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2017.05.327"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569307"", ""10.1016/j.jtte.2018.09.005"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569615"", ""10.25088/ComplexSystems.16.1.29"", ""10.1007/978-1-84628-982-8_3"", ""10.1007/s12205-013-1215-y"", ""10.3390/info8030101"", ""10.1155/2018/1096123"", ""10.1109/25.69966"", ""10.5703/1288284315333"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-18072-0_44"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000099"", ""10.1109/CCDC.2018.8408271"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-25808-9_4"", ""10.1007/BF00992698"", ""10.1145/1390156.1390240"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28487-8_22"", ""10.1109/ACSSC.2018.8645125"", ""10.1109/ELMAR49956.2020.9219024"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2901791"", ""10.1007/BF00992696"", ""10.1137/S0363012901385691"", ""10.3390/app10114011"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2019.07.026"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.3390/robotics8010004"", ""10.3390/jimaging4020036"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2890726"", ""10.1109/JAS.2016.7508798"", ""10.1109/APCC.2018.8633520"", ""10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294471"", ""10.1016/j.engappai.2017.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.958"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2011.6083114"", ""10.1109/SASO.2009.23"", ""10.1145/3357384.3357902"", ""10.1145/3292500.3330949"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116830"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2009.0070"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338707"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.12.009"", ""10.1109/TVT.2017.2702388"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907618"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2019.2904742"", ""10.1109/TVT.2019.2962514"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2958859"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2020.3015811"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-29894-4_28"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.026"", ""10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8690934"", ""10.1109/TITS.2014.2354380"", ""10.1109/MITS.2017.2743167"", ""10.1109/TIV.2017.2788209"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2018.03.056"", ""10.3141/2047-05""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"
10.1007/s11116-021-10198-0,TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0814 Civil Engineering,Understanding bikeability: a methodology to assess urban networks,"AbstractA fully separated bicycle network from vehicular traffic is not realistic even for the most bicycle-friendly cities. Thus, all around the world urban cycling entails switching between streets of different safety, convenience, and comfort levels. As a consequence, the quality of bicycle networks should be evaluated not based on one but multiple factors and by considering the different user preferences regarding these factors. More comprehensive methodologies to assess urban bicycle networks are essential to the operation and planning of modern city transportation. This work proposes a multi-objective methodology to assess—what we refer to as—bikeability between origin–destination locations and over the entire network, useful for evaluation and planning of bicycle networks. We do so by introducing the concept of bikeability curves which allows us to assess the quality of cycling in a city network with respect to the heterogeneity of user preferences. The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on two cities with different bike cultures: Amsterdam and Melbourne. Our results suggest the effectiveness of bikeability curves in describing the characteristic features and differences in the two networks.","[{""name"": ""Giulia Reggiani"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Tim van Oijen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Homayoun Hamedmoghadam"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Winnie Daamen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Hai L.

10.1049/iet-est.2019.0076,IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering,Salp swarm algorithm-based fractional-order PID controller for LFC systems in the presence of delayed EV aggregators,"Electric vehicles (EVs) battery has the ability to enhance the balance between the load demand and power generation units. Random behaviour of owners and EVs low capacity are some factors that develop the EV aggregator notion to increase the EV participation in the ancillary services market. In the presence of EVs aggregator, the frequency control service is capable of causing time‐varying delay in load frequency control (LFC) systems. Owing to the dependency of controller effectiveness on its parameters, these parameters should be designed optimally in order to have a better result in an LFC system in the presence of time‐varying delay. Therefore, a salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is utilised to adjust the fractional‐order proportional integral derivative (PID) (FOPID) controller coefficients. Also, some evaluations are performed about the proposed LFC performance by an integral absolute error, integral time absolute error and mean absolute error indicators. In this study, both single and two‐area LFC systems containing EVs aggregator with time‐varying delay are simulated and analysed. The results indicate that the proposed controller has fewer frequency variations in contrast to other controllers presented in the case studies. Moreover, it is concluded that the FOPID controller could significantly decrease the overshoot and settling time of the frequency variation signal.","[{""name"": ""Farshad Babaei"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University Tabriz Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Zahra Bahari Lashkari"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University Tabriz Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Amin Safari"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University Tabriz Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Meisam Farrokhifar"", ""affiliation"": [""Center for Energy Science and Technology Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology Moscow Russia""]}, {""name"": ""Javad Salehi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical Engineering Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University Tabriz Iran""]}]","[""10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.09.091"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.09.040"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.012"", ""10.1016/j.enpol.2008.06.007"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.09.012"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2496551"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2252029"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.159"", ""10.1016/j.ijepes.2018.07.005"", ""10.1109/TSG.2017.2731846"", ""10.1109/PTC.2019.8810956"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.174"", ""10.1109/TSG.2015.2449877"", ""10.1049/iet-rpg.2019.0199"", ""10.3906/elk-1809-131"", ""10.1007/s00500-018-3243-5"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2894840"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.05.174"", ""10.1109/TSTE.2017.2763607"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2633540"", ""10.1049/iet-gtd.2016.0108"", ""10.1109/TSG.2016.2527821"", ""10.1177/0142331216642839"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2654453"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2690915"", ""10.1049/iet-rpg.2018.5419"", ""10.1109/TSG.2010.2045163"", ""10.1016/j.advengsoft.2017.07.002"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2784385""]",['Engineering'],"['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

We propose a supervised learning approach to perform these predictions, as this allows for predictions for individual stations for each time period, without the requirement of having sufficient empirical disruption observations available for each location and time period. This approach also enables a fast prediction of disruption impacts for a large number of disruption instances, hence addressing the computational challenges that rise when typical public transport assignment or simulation models would be used for real-world public transport networks. To improve transferability of our study results, we cluster stations based on their contribution to network vulnerability using unsupervised learning. This supports public transport agencies to apply the appropriate type of measure aimed to reduce disruptions or to mitigate disruption impacts for each station type. Applied to the Washington metro network, we predict a yearly passenger delay of 5.9 million hours for the total metro network. Based on the clustering, five different types of station are distinguished. Stations with high train frequencies and high passenger volumes located at central trunk sections of the network show to be most critical, along with start/terminal and transfer stations. Intermediate stations located at branches of a line are least critical.","[{""name"": ""Menno Yap"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oded Cats"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/TR.2002.808062"", ""10.1007/s11067-014-9237-7"", ""10.1080/15472450.2013.801714"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2010.04.008"", ""10.1109/TNET.2014.2317486"", ""10.1007/s12544-016-0212-x"", ""10.3141/2343-03"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2004.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2018.03.028"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2012.01.007"", ""10.1111/j.1468-2257.2008.00447.x"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.01.008"", ""10.1007/s10107-016-1030-6"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2005.10.003"", ""10.1016/S0001-4575(02)00032-5"", ""10.3141/2012-01"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2017.12.067"", ""10.1109/MTITS.2019.8883320"", ""10.1080/23249935.2018.1537319"", ""10.1007/s11116-018-9892-5"", ""10.1109/CIT.2010.180"", ""10.1155/2017/2525481""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

In this study, the oil palm frond-derived NCQDs/TiO2 was adopted for the first time in the photodegradation of Methylene Blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. TiO2 photocatalyst and NCQDs/TiO2 nanocomposites with different NCQDs contents were successfully synthesised through a facile in-situ hydrothermal method. The surface morphology and crystalline structure of NCQDs-decorated semiconductor photocatalyst were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) were utilized to prove the successful attachment and the uniform dispersion of NCQDs on TiO2 surface, respectively. The best-performed photocatalyst with the optimum amount of NCQDs (NCQDs/TiO2-1) displayed a degradation efficiency of 40.9% within 60 minutes, which is 2.6 times faster than that of pure TiO2 (15.6%). The improved photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the better charge separation since NCQDs act as an electron reservoir which impeded the recombination of electron-hole pairs. The present work proposed a simple synthetic route for the preparation of NCQDs/TiO2 nanocomposites and the use of biomass as a natural precursor which contributed to green and sustainable fabrication of photocatalyst in environmental application.","[{""name"": ""Z W Heng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""W C Chong"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Y L Pang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L C Sim"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jece.2019.103248"", ""10.1016/j.cis.2018.02.003"", ""10.1038/s41598-018-34349-z"", ""10.1016/j.carbon.2019.06.034"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2016.04.016"", ""10.1016/j.jphotochem.2016.04.012"", ""10.3390/nano6090157"", ""10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.03.184"", ""10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.04.019""]","['Materials Science', 'Energy']","['Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

Further, WAAM geometry was modeled using simplified rectangular bead shape with five layers and three strings. The thermo-mechanical numerical simulation is conducted under consideration of non-linear isotropic hardening modeled by using general purposed FEM software MSC Marc/Mentat. In this simulation, different heat source models (Goldak’s double-ellipsoid and rectangular) are implemented and compared, whereby the later model was to be developed by using subroutine provided in the software. For analyzing the residual stress, separation technique between wall and substrate was introduced after the cooling down period. The outcome of this research is to develop an effective procedure to analyze the distortion and residual stress of wire arc additive manufacturing of stainless steel.","[{""name"": ""Siti Nursyahirah Ahmad"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yupiter HP Manurung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Muhd Faiz Mat"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zaidi Minggu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmed Jaffar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Simon Pruller"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Martin Leitner"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.150"", ""10.1179/1743284715Y.0000000073"", ""10.1016/j.procir.2016.06.124"", ""10.1007/s40194-018-0556-z"", ""10.1007/s11665-014-0958-z"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2017.08.007"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201926905003"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.04.080"", ""10.1016/j.commatsci.2011.06.023"", ""10.12691/ajme-2-4-4"", ""10.1007/BF02667333"", ""10.1016/S0017-9310(99)00271-9"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2013.04.012""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Falsification, given a desired temporal specification, tries to find an input of violation instead of a proof guarantee. The state-of-the-art falsification approaches often employ stochastic hill-climbing optimization that minimizes the degree of satisfaction of the temporal specification, given by its quantitativerobust semantics. However, it has been shown that the performance of falsification could be severely affected by the so-calledscale problem, related to the different scales of the signals used in the specification (e.g., rpm and speed): in the robustness computation, the contribution of a signal could bemaskedby another one. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle this problem. We first introduce a new robustness definition, calledQB-Robustness, which combines classical Boolean satisfaction and quantitative robustness. We prove that QB-Robustness can be used to judge the satisfaction of the specification and avoid the scale problem in its computation. QB-Robustness is exploited by a falsification approach based on Monte Carlo Tree Search over the structure of the formal specification. First, tree traversal identifies the sub-formulas for which it is needed to compute the quantitative robustness. Then, on the leaves, numerical hill-climbing optimization is performed, aiming to falsify such sub-formulas. Our in-depth evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates that our approach achieves better falsification results than the state-of-the-art falsification approaches guided by the classical quantitative robustness, and it is largely not affected by the scale problem.","[{""name"": ""Zhenya Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Deyun Lyu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Paolo Arcaini"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lei Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ichiro Hasuo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jianjun Zhao"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483411"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_24"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.257.2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-19835-9_21"", ""10.1145/1985793.1985795"", ""10.1109/CEC.2005.1554902"", ""10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2186810"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-24953-7_35"", ""10.1145/3126521"", ""10.1109/COASE.2017.8256286"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_17"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15297-9_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_10"", ""10.1145/2883817.2883838"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-57288-8_26"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2009.06.021"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-41528-4_29"", ""10.1145/3302504.3311800"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-22110-1_30"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-31424-7_34"", ""10.1145/2562059.2562140"", ""10.1109/MCS.2016.2602089"", ""10.1109/PRDC47002.2019.00054"", ""10.1007/11871842_29"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-10512-3_11"", ""10.1109/DASC.2015.7311613"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-02450-5_6"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2004.03.072"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63588-0"", ""10.1145/2331147.2331165"", ""10.1038/nature16961"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-66845-1_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-95582-7_27"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2020.3013073"", ""10.1109/TCAD.2018.2858463"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-76384-8_24""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

However, this method needs an expensive investment due to the urease enzyme issue. The enzyme itself brings 90% of the total materials cost. It means that finding new inexpensive material for replacing the enzyme is considered essential for the development of this method. In this study, a potential material, which is soybean powder, was evaluated through several experimental tests. A comparison of urease activity value between EICP using soybean powder and commercial urease as a catalyst for hydrolysis of urea compound was made through a series of conductivity tests. It was found that EICP using soybean urease can be a potential alternative to a commercial product in terms of urease activity. The precipitation materials were analysed using a microscale test to analyses the minerals type. Besides, the reinforcing effect of EICP solution on soil specimens was evaluated by conducting unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test and acid leaching test. The results of the UCS test were indicated that the soybean powder is a potential material to be used in soil improvement technique.","[{""name"": ""G B S Pratama"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""H Yasuhara"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N Kinoshita"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""H Putra"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.sandf.2012.05.011"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000959"", ""10.18517/ijaseit.7.6.3425"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0001973"", ""10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.01.004"", ""10.12989/gae.2017.12.5.803"", ""10.1016/S0031-9422(02)00270-4"", ""10.18388/abp.2000_3972"", ""10.1080/01490450701436505"", ""10.3390/cryst7020059""]","['Environmental Science', 'Materials Science', 'Immunology and Microbiology']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Immunology', 'Materials Chemistry']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('1001 基础医学', 0.7323), ('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.732), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7292), ('0710 生物学', 0.7287), ('0836 生物工程', 0.72)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('1001 基础医学', 0.7385), ('0710 生物学', 0.7264)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7539), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7516)]]"

Although its application is huge in the building of aerospace structure, 2XXX and 7XXX series alloys are categorised as non-weldable aluminium alloys. Recent development in the application of friction stir welding process in the joining of these non-weldable alloys simplified the fabrication processes. In this review article, significance of friction stir welding comparing with other solid state metal joining process is addressed.

However, due to the accumulation of dust and dirt over the panel surface, the performance of the photovoltaic system degrades to a noticeable number. To address this issue: a fully automated, cost worthy and efficient system needs to be invented. This paper presents the design and fabrication process of a prototype able to clean the panel surface. The prototype of this system comprises of a cleaning robot and a cloud interface: the cleaning robot is mobile and able to clean the entire solar array back and forth, with its separately driven cleaning rotatory brush; whereas, the cloud interface is a human-machine interface featuring the distant monitoring and control of the robot. Additionally, to notify the performance of distantly placed solar farm, a sensing unit consisting of sensors was added to this system. Furthermore, to add an automatic cleaning feature, a month-long data of totally clean and dusty panel was processed with regression analysis, and the developed regression model was programmed into the sensing unit. The sensing unit added with the regression model is named as an autonomous unit, as it predicts the suitable time for cleaning action. According to the system evaluation done on a demonstration PV module, it was found that the designed system can clean dry dust accumulated over the panel’s surface. Moreover, by attaching the metal rail tracks on a long solar array, the system seems to be implementable on a large scale solar farm.","[{""name"": ""Nasib Khadka"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aayush Bista"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Binamra Adhikari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ashish Shrestha"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Diwakar Bista"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/01691864.2014.996602"", ""10.1016/j.renene.2013.11.073"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2014.06.006""]","['Environmental Science', 'Energy']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)]]"

One way to reach a more sustainable world is to start re-using end-of-life structures and waste and give them a ‘Second Life” with a new function in the society. As composite structures are lightweight, strong, stiff and durable materials, there is great potential to re-use decommissioned composite for new resource-efficient solutions in the building and infrastructure sector. The present paper investigates innovative solutions in re-using wind turbine blades as elements in new bicycle and pedestrian bridge designs. Several conceptual bridge designs where wind blades utilized as load bearing elements were developed and studied. The main design requirements for pedestrian bridges were considered and assumptions regarding wind blades quality and their mechanical properties addressed based on interviews with industries working with wind turbine blades repair and recycling. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a sustainable use of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) waste and at the same time provide a more cost-effective FRP bridges. In a larger perspective, the authors would like to highlight the economically profitable potential of recovering and reusing / re-manufacturing end-of-life glass FRP composites.","[{""name"": ""A André"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""J Kullberg"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""D Nygren"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""C Mattsson"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Nedev"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Haghani"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.04.013"", ""10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2013.09.036"", ""10.3390/recycling3010003""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Mechanics of Materials', 'Pollution', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12185,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Quantifying the performance and optimizing the placement of roadside sensors for cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems,"Abstract A cooperative vehicle‐infrastructure system (CVIS) can provide perception information beyond the visual range for autonomous vehicles via roadside directional sensors, such as cameras, millimeter‐wave radar, and lidar. The performance of roadside perception strongly depends on sensor placement, where physical occlusion between vehicles is inevitable. This paper proposes an occlusion degree model (ODM) to describe the dynamic occlusion between sensors, obstacles, and targets in a three‐dimensional space. The ODM is then integrated with microscopic traffic simulation to study the impacts of traffic density, vehicle model composition, and sensor configurations on vehicle detection and tracking performances. Based on the simulation, a multifactor regression model with a logistic growth curve is established to quantify the performance of roadside sensors with different factors, where the evaluation metrics are rigorously designed. Finally, an optimization model of roadside sensor placement with non‐linear constraints is formulated to reduce the construction cost under a coverage constraint and improve the perception accuracy within budget limitations. A case study of a highway scenario shows that the performance of the proposed approach improves by 5.63%, 6.55%, and 8.01%, respectively, under the worst possible condition with accuracy requirements of 0.97, 0.96, and 0.95 compared with the conventional placement scheme. The study provides a map of the performance of roadside perception with different influencing factors and guides the optimal roadside sensor placement for a CVIS.","[{""name"": ""Yuchuan Du"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education Tongji University  Shanghai China"", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Urban Infrastructure Renewal  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Fengqi Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Cong Zhao"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Yifan Zhu"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}, {""name"": ""Yuxiong Ji"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education Tongji University  Shanghai China""]}]","[""10.1049/itr2.12065"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2021.103489"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2022.103624"", ""10.1080/15472450.2019.1586335"", ""10.1109/TITS.2021.3119079"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.007"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917197"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2010.0169"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.02.024"", ""10.1109/TITS.2014.2379699"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2592184"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2017.2723481"", ""10.1016/j.adhoc.2011.02.003"", ""10.1007/s11263-007-0057-9"", ""10.1111/mice.12385"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0297"", ""10.1109/TWC.2014.2341585"", ""10.1109/TVT.2017.2681692"", ""10.1109/JSYST.2018.2820085"", ""10.1109/TMC.2013.118"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2014.2310180"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2017.2694385"", ""10.1109/JSEN.2018.2825781"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2019.101945"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993554"", ""10.1016/j.jnca.2013.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.camwa.2008.10.019"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2010.09.001"", ""10.3390/s19051192"", ""10.3390/s140201988"", ""10.1016/j.adhoc.2010.07.001"", ""10.1007/s11276-020-02370-8"", ""10.1109/JSYST.2015.2446952"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5258"", ""10.1111/mice.12251"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2015.02.004"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.016"", ""10.1111/mice.12595"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2021.103176"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.07.010"", ""10.23919/ICCAS50221.2020.9268196"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.07.024"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569938"", ""10.1098/rsta.2010.0084"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-15024-6_7""]",['Engineering'],"['Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

Our method starts with applying the DeepPoly abstract domain to analyze the network. If the robustness property cannot be verified, the result is inconclusive. Due to the over-approximation, the computed region in the abstraction may be spurious in the sense that it does not contain any true counterexample. Our goal is to identify such spurious regions and use them to guide the abstraction refinement. The core idea is to make use of the obtained constraints of the abstraction to infer new bounds for the neurons. This is achieved by linear programming techniques. With the new bounds, we iteratively apply DeepPoly, aiming to eliminate spurious regions. We have implemented our approach in a prototypical tool DeepSRGR. Experimental results show that a large amount of regions can be identified as spurious, and as a result, the precision of DeepPoly can be significantly improved. As a side contribution, we show that our approach can be applied to verify quantitative robustness properties.","[{""name"": ""Pengfei Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Renjue Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jianlin Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cheng-Chao Huang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jingyi Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jun Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bai Xue"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Lijun Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-030-59152-6_5"", ""10.1007/10722167_15"", ""10.1145/512950.512973"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-77935-5_9"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-68167-2_19"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_3"", ""10.1109/SP.2018.00058"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02658-4_47"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_22"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-63387-9_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_26"", ""10.1109/5.726791"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-32304-2_15"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.01168"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/368"", ""10.1007/s10916-014-0110-5"", ""10.1038/nature16961"", ""10.1145/3290354"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53288-8_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-30942-8_39"", ""10.1109/ICSE.2019.00126"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-89960-2_22""]",['Computer Science'],"['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

In this context, a sustainable strategy is required, and an innovative solution can be found in the implementation of low impact development (LID) systems as green walls. These sustainable solutions, by reintroducing vegetation in urban area, can partially restore the pre-urbanization situation and mitigate these drastic environmental impacts. To investigate the state of art of these techniques, a deeper overview on the green wall systems was carried out. This analysis was finalized to evaluate the current developed systems in terms of classification, components and benefits in order to establish where do we stand in terms of evolution of these systems and where we are going in terms of new trends and possible future directions.","[{""name"": ""S A Palermo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Turco"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2019.01.008"", ""10.1080/23311916.2017.1410272"", ""10.2166/wst.2018.060"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.203"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2009.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.01.012"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2011.05.068"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.09.010"", ""10.18178/ijesd.2017.8.2.933"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.05.009"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2009.11.013"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.011"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2017.09.106"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.010"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.12.035"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.09.079"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2008.07.004"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.02.005"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.03.005"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.11.014"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.11.055"", ""10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.11.023"", ""10.1016/j.ufug.2018.05.008"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.06.017"", ""10.1016/j.buildenv.2009.06.017""]",['Environmental Science'],"['Environmental Engineering', 'Global and Planetary Change', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0705 地理学', 0.7381), ('0706 大气科学', 0.7347)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

A lane‐changing behaviour decision‐making model based on the Gauss mixture hidden Markov model (GM‐HMM) is proposed according to the characteristic of a driver's lane changing behaviour. The proposed model is tested and verified based on the database of Next‐Generation Simulation (NGSIM). The results show that the GM‐HMM is 95.4% similar to the real driver's behaviour. To further verify the proposed model, the proposed algorithm is compared with some machine learning techniques from literature in different test scenarios. The comparison and analysis indicate that the GM‐HMM method can more accurately simulate the real driver's lane‐change behaviour, thus improving the trust of the passengers and other vehicles around autonomous vehicles.","[{""name"": ""Hao Jin"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control Jilin University 5988 Renmin Avenue Changchun People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Chunguang Duan"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control Jilin University 5988 Renmin Avenue Changchun People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""KH Automotive Technologies Co, Ltd Changchun Jilin 130012 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Pingping Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control Jilin University 5988 Renmin Avenue Changchun People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1136/ip.2004.005405"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2012.03.002"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896588"", ""10.1109/TIE.2019.2898599"", ""10.1016/0191-2615(86)90012-3"", ""10.1016/S0968-090X(96)00006-X"", ""10.1016/S0378-4371(96)00314-7"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.02.009"", ""10.4271/2000-01-0349"", ""10.1109/IVS.2013.6629544"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625262"", ""10.1109/CICN.2011.156"", ""10.1109/IVS.2018.8500651"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728533"", ""10.3141/2088-10"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5167"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5079"", ""10.1109/5.18626"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.07.015"", ""10.1093/nsr/nwx110""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

Water harvesting is considered one of means to grantee the sustainability of water for use in domestic, irrigation and even industry. The current study carried out on Haqlan valley basin in western part of Iraq. The selection of suitable location for rainwater harvesting is based on different key determinates such as environment, hydrology, socio-economic, and topography as well as the estimation of the storage volume and the surface area. This study aims to identify the suitable location for rainwater harvesting using Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing with multi-criteria decision techniques in the study area. Many thematic maps were extracted such as soil map, vegetation cover, land use/land cover, slope, and digital elevation model. The drainage network and the contour line map were used to suggest six sites in the study area. The result shows that the total suitable area for water harvesting was 28% of the study area, while 21% indicated moderate suitability. The proposed method is relatively supportive in analyzing geospatial data to determine and select the optimal site for rainwater harvesting and minimize evaporation losses.","[{""name"": ""K N Sayl"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A S Mohammed"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A D Ahmed"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/sl2524-009-0009-7"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2006.09.024"", ""10.1016/j.pce.2007.07.009"", ""10.1007/s11269-012-0031-3"", ""10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.04.006"", ""10.1007/s12665-017-6699-1"", ""10.1007/s12517"", ""10.1016/j.iswcr.2018.07.003"", ""10.1007/s11269-009-9422-5"", ""10.1080/15324982.2012.709214"", ""10.1016/j.pce.2013.09.005"", ""10.1016/j.progress.2003.09.002."", ""10.1016/0022-2496(77)90033-5"", ""10.1016/j.pce.2008.06.047"", ""10.1016/j.pce.2007.07.014"", ""10.1016/S0168-1699(02)00111-4""]","['Environmental Science', 'Decision Sciences']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7574), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7573)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"

The most common approaches that are used to address this problem are based on optimal control methods, which make assumptions about the model of the environment and the system dynamics. On the contrary, this work proposes the development of a driving policy based on reinforcement learning. In this way, the proposed driving policy makes minimal or no assumptions about the environment, since a priori knowledge about the system dynamics is not required. Driving scenarios where the road is occupied both by autonomous and manual driving vehicles are considered. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first approaches that propose a reinforcement learning driving policy for mixed driving environments. The derived reinforcement learning policy, firstly, is compared against an optimal policy derived via dynamic programming, and, secondly, its efficiency is evaluated under realistic scenarios generated by the established SUMO microscopic traffic flow simulator. Finally, some initial results regarding the effect of autonomous vehicles’ behaviour on the overall traffic flow are presented.","[{""name"": ""Konstantinos Makantasis"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Production Engineering and Management, Technical University of Crete Chania Greece"", ""Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta Msida Malta""]}, {""name"": ""Maria Kontorinaki"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Production Engineering and Management, Technical University of Crete Chania Greece"", ""Department of Statistics and Operations Research, Faculty of Science University of Malta Msida Malta""]}, {""name"": ""Ioannis Nikolos"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Production Engineering and Management, Technical University of Crete Chania Greece""]}]","[""10.1109/IVS.2014.6856581"", ""10.1109/IVS.2017.7995969"", ""10.1076/vesd.32.2.113.2089"", ""10.3141/2621-09"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.05.005"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-15775-2_25"", ""10.3141/2197-01"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2011.07.037"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49487-6_2"", ""10.1109/SMC.2013.709"", ""10.3141/2442-07"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.08.007"", ""10.1007/s10846-009-9383-1"", ""10.1109/IVS.2008.4621260"", ""10.1002/rob.20266"", ""10.1109/ROBOT.2008.4543783"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2401837"", ""10.1109/IVS.2015.7225752"", ""10.1109/ACC.2016.7526648"", ""10.1080/00423114.2014.902537"", ""10.1177/0361198118780710"", ""10.1115/DSCC2010-4263"", ""10.1109/CDC.2012.6426612"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2604240"", ""10.1073/pnas.38.8.716"", ""10.1109/TCDS.2017.2717451"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.312"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2017.376"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1090/S0002-9904-1954-09848-8"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.11.132"", ""10.1007/BF00992698"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317797"", ""10.1177/0278364917696568""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

In the one‐dimensional scenario, different formation geometries are analysed, and the interlaced structure is mathematically modellised to improve driving safety while making full use of the lane capacity. The assignment problem for vehicles, and target positions is solved using Hungarian algorithm to improve the flexibility of the method in multiple scenarios. In the two‐dimensional scenario, an improved virtual platoon method is proposed to transfer the complex two‐dimensional passing problem to the one‐dimensional formation control problem based on the idea of rotation projection. Besides, the vehicle regrouping method is proposed to connect the two scenarios. Simulation results prove that the proposed multi‐vehicle formation control framework can apply to multiple typical scenarios, and have better performance than existing methods.","[{""name"": ""Qing Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Mengchi Cai"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Keqiang Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Biao Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jianqiang Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Vehicle and Mobility Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiangbin Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""Intel Lab China  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1109/IVS.2016.7535413"", ""10.1016/S0389-4304(01)00137-0"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795659"", ""10.1109/IVS.2015.7225676"", ""10.1109/TITS.2002.802929"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625197"", ""10.1016/S0968-090X(99)00006-6"", ""10.1109/IVS.2007.4290284"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338779"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917409"", ""10.1016/j.rcim.2014.04.002"", ""10.1109/IROS.2010.5649318"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2519526"", ""10.1109/TIE.2013.2245612"", ""10.1016/j.isatra.2017.05.003"", ""10.1007/s10514-015-9429-0"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140034"", ""10.1109/TCST.2013.2262768"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2014.12.016"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.06.004"", ""10.1109/TVT.2006.878730"", ""10.1613/jair.2502"", ""10.1109/TITS.2012.2186442"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2411619"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2178836"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.01.004"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.003"", ""10.1109/IVS.2019.8813792"", ""10.1002/nav.3800020109"", ""10.1137/0105003"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957887"", ""10.1109/ISCAS.2019.8702254""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

The immutable blockchain databases of the trains and track infrastructures help to forecast the traffic conflicts in real time. Seven variants of virtual coupling strategies are described in this study. Based on the chosen strategy, the reference model of the automatic train operation of mainline trains is virtually coupled or synchronised. Finally, the simulation results and theoretical analyses using several case studies are carried out to confirm the sufficiency of the proposed system and method. The major advantage of the proposed study is that it can be an overlay to the existing European Railway Traffic Management System Level‐2.","[{""name"": ""Ganesan Muniandi"", ""affiliation"": [""ALSTOM Digital Mobility Technology Centre, ALSTOM Transport India Limited Bengaluru 560075 India""]}]","[""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935106"", ""10.3390/a11040055"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2017.10.005"", ""10.1155/2018/8394397"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2446985"", ""10.1007/s12469-010-0032-7"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2006.10.034"", ""10.1145/375735.375866"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.05.011"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2603441"", ""10.1155/2018/3473175"", ""10.1007/s40534-019-0188-z"", ""10.1049/iet-cta.2016.1275"", ""10.1080/00423114.2017.1330482"", ""10.1049/iet-cta.2019.0038"", ""10.1049/iet-rsn.2018.5359"", ""10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795984"", ""10.1109/MWC.2018.1700294""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

10.1007/s40534-022-00295-w,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,An abnormal carbody swaying of intercity EMU train caused by low wheel-rail equivalent conicity and damping force unloading of yaw damper,"AbstractLow-frequency carbody swaying phenomenon often occurs to railway vehicles due to hunting instability, which seriously deteriorates the ride comfort of passengers. This paper investigates low-frequency carbody swaying through experimental analysis and numerical simulation. In the tests, the carbody acceleration, the wheel–rail profiles, and the dynamic characteristics of dampers were measured to understand the characteristics of the abnormal carbody vibration and to find out its primary contributor. Linear and nonlinear numerical simulations on the mechanism and optimization measures were carried out to solve this carbody swaying issue. The results showed that the carbody swaying is the manifest of carbody hunting instability. The low equivalent conicity and the decrease of dynamic damping of the yaw damper are probably the cause of this phenomenon. The optimization measures to increase the equivalent conicity and dynamic damping of the yaw damper were put forward and verified by on-track tests. The results of this study could enrich the knowledge of carbody hunting and provide a reference for solving abnormal carbody vibrations.","[{""name"": ""Yixiao Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Maoru Chi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhaotuan Guo"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Shulin Liang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1076/vesd.31.5.283.8362"", ""10.1080/00423114.2018.1469776"", ""10.1080/23248378.2014.992819"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1674344"", ""10.1177/0954409718789531"", ""10.1177/0954409720949116"", ""10.1007/s40534-016-0107-5"", ""10.1080/23248378.2021.1904444"", ""10.1177/14644193221103211"", ""10.1080/00423114.2020.1763407"", ""10.1080/00423110600869644"", ""10.1080/00423119308969537"", ""10.1023/A:1008278713331"", ""10.1007/s11071-017-3489-y"", ""10.1080/00423114.2022.2086145"", ""10.1080/00423110902993654"", ""10.1080/23248378.2019.1625824"", ""10.1080/23248378.2017.1336652"", ""10.1142/S0219455422501450"", ""10.1142/S0219455418500931"", ""10.1201/9780203970997"", ""10.1243/0954409991531182"", ""10.1243/PIME_PROC_1996_210_331_02"", ""10.1007/s12206-013-0611-z"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1664751"", ""10.1080/00423114.2022.2053171"", ""10.1080/00423114.2022.2062012"", ""10.1006/mssp.1998.1211"", ""10.1080/00423117908968610"", ""10.1080/00423118208968684""]",['Engineering'],"['Aerospace Engineering', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0825 航空宇航科学与技术', 0.7793), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7315)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

In the era of autonomous shipping, where the autonomous operating system takes the lead and data flows define decision-making, how the ship and its leaders can successfully navigate these new ways of working have important implications for safety, efficiency and reliability of future ship operations. It is critical that the non-technical skills requirements, in particular the leadership competencies, be re-evaluated as new operational paradigms of shipping systems emerge and evolve. This study extends the current research of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) by using a Delphi consensus survey and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with a panel of 36 experts to (1) bridge a knowledge gap, i.e., the lack of an understanding regarding the leadership implication of autonomous shipping; (2) evaluate the applicability of current STCW leadership requirements for MASS operations; (3) identify and prioritize the leadership competences that should be accrued by the personnel involved in future ship operations. The results have shown that the current STCW framework is not fully relevant for MASS. The redefined leadership competence and the constructed hierarchy of criticality generated from this study can be valuable input for revision of the STCW and maritime education and training practices, contributing to successful ship operations of the future.","[{""name"": ""Tae-eun Kim"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Steven Mallam"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.3940/rina.sst.2016.02"", ""10.1177/004912418101000205"", ""10.1177/1056492616638173"", ""10.1201/b11458"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2011.07.001"", ""10.1007/s10514-015-9457-9"", ""10.1037/1076-8998.5.3.347"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-12786-2_2"", ""10.1016/j.ress.2017.05.002"", ""10.3390/safety6010008"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2015.11.014"", ""10.1007/s13437-019-00176-w"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-94709-9_32"", ""10.12716/1001.12.02.15"", ""10.1017/S0373463301001588"", ""10.3233/WOR-162365"", ""10.1080/00140139.2019.1659995"", ""10.1353/rhe.1995.0008"", ""10.3846/1611-1699.2009.10.181-189"", ""10.1201/9781351174664-52"", ""10.1080/00908320.2019.1582593"", ""10.1016/0378-4754(79)90101-0"", ""10.1016/S0377-2217(02)00227-8"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-28490-8_17"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2004.04.028"", ""10.1016/j.chb.2019.07.027""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0714 统计学', 0.7515), ('0701 数学', 0.745)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

10.1007/s40534-023-00320-6,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,"Traction power systems for electrified railways: evolution, state of the art, and future trends","AbstractTraction power systems (TPSs) play a vital role in the operation of electrified railways. The transformation of conventional railway TPSs to novel structures is not only a trend to promote the development of electrified railways toward high-efficiency and resilience but also an inevitable requirement to achieve carbon neutrality target. On the basis of sorting out the power supply structures of conventional AC and DC modes, this paper first reviews the characteristics of the existing TPSs, such as weak power supply flexibility and low-energy efficiency.

10.1007/s40534-022-00272-3,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Quantitative detection of locomotive wheel polygonization under non-stationary conditions by adaptive chirp mode decomposition,"AbstractWheel polygonal wear is a common and severe defect, which seriously threatens the running safety and reliability of a railway vehicle especially a locomotive. Due to non-stationary running conditions (e.g., traction and braking) of the locomotive, the passing frequencies of a polygonal wheel will exhibit time-varying behaviors, which makes it too difficult to effectively detect the wheel defect. Moreover, most existing methods only achieve qualitative fault diagnosis and they cannot accurately identify defect levels. To address these issues, this paper reports a novel quantitative method for fault detection of wheel polygonization under non-stationary conditions based on a recently proposed adaptive chirp mode decomposition (ACMD) approach. Firstly, a coarse-to-fine method based on the time–frequency ridge detection and ACMD is developed to accurately estimate a time-varying gear meshing frequency and thus obtain a wheel rotating frequency from a vibration acceleration signal of a motor. After the rotating frequency is obtained, signal resampling and order analysis techniques are applied to an acceleration signal of an axle box to identify harmonic orders related to polygonal wear. Finally, the ACMD is combined with an inertial algorithm to estimate polygonal wear amplitudes. Not only a dynamics simulation but a field test was carried out to show that the proposed method can effectively detect both harmonic orders and their amplitudes of the wheel polygonization under non-stationary conditions.","[{""name"": ""Shiqian Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kaiyun Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ziwei Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yunfan Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zaigang Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Wanming Zhai"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s40534-020-00222-x"", ""10.1115/1.4048897"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.104292"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2021.105501"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107022"", ""10.1007/s10409-021-01140-9"", ""10.1080/00423114.2012.695022"", ""10.1080/00423114.2020.1770810"", ""10.1080/00423114.2017.1399210"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2019.01.020"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1626013"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2019.05.029"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2020.108199"", ""10.1007/s11277-017-5194-z"", ""10.1155/2012/409048"", ""10.3390/s19183981"", ""10.1177/1475921720921772"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107497"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2017.08.038"", ""10.3390/app10051613"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2020.107540"", ""10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.07.024"", ""10.1016/j.sigpro.2012.11.029"", ""10.1109/MSP.2013.2265316"", ""10.1016/j.acha.2010.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.04.023"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2020.108592"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2017.03.037"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2012.09.015"", ""10.1109/LGRS.2015.2493198"", ""10.1190/geo2015-0489.1"", ""10.1109/TSP.2017.2731300"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.06.052"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2019.115065"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115800"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2021.115963"", ""10.1080/23248378.2020.1867658"", ""10.1007/s40534-021-00246-x"", ""10.1109/TSP.2017.2656838"", ""10.1109/TSP.2012.2212891"", ""10.1109/TIM.2018.2869440"", ""10.1109/TIM.2019.2902806"", ""10.1088/0957-0233/24/9/094014"", ""10.1142/S1793536912500161"", ""10.1080/00423114.2016.1254260"", ""10.1007/978-981-32-9283-3"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2017.07.017""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanical Engineering', 'Control and Systems Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.8034), ('0802 机械工程', 0.7722)]]"

The aim of this paper is to develop and evaluate a Xgboost model for the prediction of outdoor air temperature and humidity using acquired data from Shenzhen, China. Datasets fetched from sensor real-time collection and meteorological station interface are utilized as observations, through the construction of Xgboost to predict outdoor temperature and humidity in predictive horizon of 1-3 hours. The effectiveness of the prediction is verified by comparing the prediction with the measured outdoor air temperature and humidity. In addition, statistical tools such as R2 and root mean square error (rmse) are applied to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show the excellent performance of Xgboost in accurately predicting outdoor temperature and humidity by comparison between the measured and predicted outdoor air temperature (R2 &gt; 0.73, rmse &lt; 1.77) and air humidity (R2 &gt; 0.81, rmse &lt; 6.33).","[{""name"": ""Xiaoming Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cong Fang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Junping Ji"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.solener.2010.09.001"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2009.06.018"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2013.12.002"", ""10.1038/sj.jes.7500588"", ""10.1016/j.scs.2011.05.001"", ""10.1007/s007040070024"", ""10.1016/j.solener.2010.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.087""]","['Environmental Science', 'Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Environmental Engineering', 'Building and Construction', 'Artificial Intelligence']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)]]"
10.1007/s40534-020-00224-9,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Experimental and numerical study on fretting wear and fatigue of full-scale railway axles,"AbstractThis study investigated the fretting wear and fatigue of full-scale railway axles. Fatigue tests were conducted on full-scale railway axles, and the fretting wear and fretting fatigue in the fretted zone of the railway axles were analysed. Three-dimensional finite element models were established based on the experimental results. Then, multi-axial fatigue parameters and a linear elastic fracture mechanics-based approach were used to investigate the fretting fatigue crack initiation and propagation, respectively, in which the role of the fretting wear was taken into account. The experimental and simulated results showed that the fretted zone could be divided into zones I–III according to the surface damage morphologies. Fretting wear alleviated the stress concentration near the wheel seat edge and resulted in a new stress concentration near the worn/unworn boundary in zone II, which greatly promoted the fretting crack initiation at the inner side of the fretted zone. Meanwhile, the stress concentration also increased the equivalent stress intensity factor range ΔKeq below the mating surface, and thus promoted the propagation of fretting fatigue crack. Based on these findings, the effect of the stress redistribution resulting from fretting wear is suggested to be taken into account when evaluating the fretting fatigue in railway axles.","[{""name"": ""Lang Zou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dongfang Zeng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yabo Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Kai Yang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Liantao Lu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caiqin Yuan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2015.06.016"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2012.09.029"", ""10.1016/j.triboint.2020.106383"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1605085"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2015.08.023"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2017.06.054"", ""10.1016/S0142-1123(97)00096-0"", ""10.1243/0954409043125932"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2018.09.008"", ""10.1016/S0142-1123(00)00092-X"", ""10.1111/ffe.12085"", ""10.1299/jsme1958.24.1893"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2019.105371"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2017.05.014"", ""10.1080/10402004.2017.1378395"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2018.01.008"", ""10.2472/jsms.55.550"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2017.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2007.04.003"", ""10.1243/0954409043125905"", ""10.1016/j.triboint.2020.106443"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2015.11.028"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2019.105361"", ""10.1016/j.triboint.2009.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2015.08.007"", ""10.1243/030932405X7836"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2695.1988.tb01169.x"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2015.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2004.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2009.12.013"", ""10.1080/23248378.2018.1427008"", ""10.1016/j.engfracmech.2016.12.019"", ""10.1016/0013-7944(74)90007-1"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.251-252.251"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2013.06.019"", ""10.1115/1.3656897"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2019.105285"", ""10.1016/j.jmrt.2020.04.083"", ""10.1111/j.1460-2695.2004.00855.x""]",['Engineering'],"['Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The results showed that, in a warm environment, wearing masks for a long time significantly affected the subjective feelings and physiological reactions of people. After wearing the mask, the personnel feels more hot and humid, the discomfort is significantly increased. At the same time, the mean skin temperature increases, the heart rate increases, and the blood oxygen saturation level decreases, which ultimately leads to a decline in health and comfort levels. Different types of masks have different effects on people. The effects of wearing KN95 masks, gauze masks, medical surgical masks, disposable civilian masks, disposable medical masks, and sponge masks on people’s health and comfort levels are sequentially reduced.","[{""name"": ""Cong Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guojian Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yuhang He"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zixuan Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yujian Ding"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1097/MCP.0000000000000153"", ""10.1007/s11684-020-0739-z"", ""10.1111/j.1600-0668.1999.t01-1-00003.x"", ""10.1016/j.apergo.2007.05.008"", ""10.1152/jappl.1999.86.3.874""]","['Environmental Science', 'Medicine', 'Engineering']","['Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine', 'Building and Construction', 'Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7106), ('1009 特种医学', 0.7025)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('1004 公共卫生与预防医学', 0.7435), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7208)]]"

However, autonomous shipping enabled by such ships bears a greater potential than just replacing humans with machines. Rather, MASS can play a role in transforming supply and logistics chains. The value creation potential of these ships depends on the degree to which they disrupt logistics. Our aim here is to clarify how MASS create value and for whom, as well as how different actors in the maritime logistics ecosystem are able to monetize or otherwise benefit from the innovation. Based on interviews with experts in maritime logistics and autonomous technology, and a desktop study of the opinions of the leaders in maritime innovation, we analyse the different facets of value creation by MASS. We distinguish between the two key sources of value – onboard crew reduction and increased ship intelligence and their effects (cost reductions, earning potential, increased safety and system value) – and explicate for which actors in the ecosystem the value is created. We identify the key changes in the maritime logistics ecosystem, which concern the changing roles of technology providers, shipowners and operators, and we highlight the need for developing complementary infrastructure and activities in the ecosystem.","[{""name"": ""Anastasia Tsvetkova"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Magnus Hellström"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1177/0149206316678451"", ""10.1002/smj.821"", ""10.1002/smj.187"", ""10.21125/inted.2018.2374"", ""10.4324/9781315456539"", ""10.1016/J.AJSL.2013.01.002"", ""10.1177/8756972818820191"", ""10.1080/01441647.2018.1502834"", ""10.1016/bs.atpp.2020.05.002"", ""10.1002/smj.1975"", ""10.1007/s10799-017-0282-z"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.04.128"", ""10.1080/18366503.2016.1229244"", ""10.3390/joitmc5020030"", ""10.1002/smj.2904"", ""10.2307/1814809"", ""10.1080/25725084.2020.1779427"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2017.06.002"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2013.06.001"", ""10.1016/j.jii.2020.100173"", ""10.1108/IJOPM-09-2018-0578"", ""10.1080/16258312.2019.1631714"", ""10.1007/S00773-021-00836-8"", ""10.1016/j.ajsl.2014.09.005"", ""10.1080/00908320.2019.1582593"", ""10.1111/JOMS.12343"", ""10.1057/mel.2015.10"", ""10.1016/j.promfg.2020.02.078"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2018.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2009.07.003"", ""10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.09.007"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-49649-8_20"", ""10.1057/s41278-020-00163-6"", ""10.1080/00207543.2013.825056"", ""10.1201/9780429450655"", ""10.1016/j.lrp.2009.07.004"", ""10.1177/0149206311406265""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Management Information Systems', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7365), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7299)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

However, studies dedicated to battery OCV estimation are not as much as the research efforts on state‐of‐charge determination and parameter identification such as capacity and resistance. Hence, a general discussion for selecting the battery OCV estimation algorithm is proposed in this study. To this end, modelling process of extended state‐space model and autoregressive exogenous model is presented in detail. Four estimation algorithms, namely, Luenberger observer, Kalman filter, recursive least‐square with forgetting factor and recursive least‐square with variable forgetting factor are selected and compared in terms of estimation accuracy, computational cost, parameter tuning and robustness to parameter variations. Based on real battery cell parameters and environmental conditions, simulation results have shown that even if they are less robust to model uncertainty, observer‐based methods exhibit better estimation performances than regression‐based ones.","[{""name"": ""Jianwen Meng"", ""affiliation"": [""ESTACA, Ecole d'ingénieurs 12 avenue Paul Delouvrier 78066 Saint‐Quentin‐en‐Yvelines France"", ""GeePs | Group of Electrical Engineering – Paris CNRS CentraleSupélec, Univ.

Where a trace property defines a set of traces, a hyperproperty defines a set of sets of traces. The temporal logics HyperLTL and HyperCTL* have been proposed to express hyperproperties. However, their semantics aresynchronousin the sense that all traces proceed at the same speed and are evaluated at the same position. This precludes the use of these logics to analyze systems whose traces can proceed at different speeds and allow that different traces take stuttering steps independently. To solve this problem in this paper, we propose anasynchronousvariant of HyperLTL. On the negative side, we show that the model-checking problem for this variant is undecidable. On the positive side, we identify a decidable fragment which covers a rich set of formulas with practical applications. We also propose two model-checking algorithms that reduce our problem to the HyperLTL model-checking problem in the synchronous semantics.","[{""name"": ""Jan Baumeister"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Norine Coenen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Borzoo Bonakdarpour"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Bernd Finkbeiner"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""César Sánchez"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/0020-0190(85)90056-0"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-88313-5_22"", ""10.1145/512644.512660"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-81685-8_33"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-03421-4_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-14295-6_5"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54792-8_15"", ""10.3233/JCS-2009-0393"", ""10.1109/LICS.2019.8785713"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-25540-4_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-21690-4_3"", ""10.1109/SP.1982.10014"", ""10.1145/3434319"", ""10.1145/78969.78972"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-72016-2_6"", ""10.1145/567446.567463"", ""10.1007/978-1-4612-4222-2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-39322-9_1"", ""10.1109/SFCS.1977.32"", ""10.1007/BFb0054170"", ""10.1090/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9"", ""10.1023/A:1011553200337"", ""10.1145/3358232""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12265,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Trajectory prediction for autonomous driving based on multiscale spatial-temporal graph,"Abstract Predicting the trajectories of surrounding heterogeneous traffic agents is critical for the decision making of an autonomous vehicle. Recently, many existing prediction methods have focused on capturing interactions between agents to improve prediction accuracy. However, few methods pay attention to the temporal dependencies of interactions that there are different behavioural interactions at different time scales. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for trajectory prediction by stacking spatial‐temporal layers at multiple time scales. Firstly, the authors design three kinds of adjacency matrices to capture more genuine spatial dependencies rather than a fixed adjacency matrix. Then, a novel dilated temporal convolution is developed to handle temporal dependencies. Benefiting from the dilated temporal convolution, the authors’ graph convolution is able to aggregate information from neighbours at different time scales by stacking spatial‐temporal layers. Finally, a long short‐term memory networks (LSTM)‐based trajectory generation module is used to receive the features extracted by the spatial‐temporal graph and generate the future trajectories for all observed traffic agents simultaneously. The authors evaluate the proposed model on the publicly available next generation simulation dataset (NGSIM), the highway drone dataset (highD), and ApolloScape datasets. The results demonstrate that the authors’ approach achieves state‐of‐the‐art performance. Furthermore, the proposed method ranked #1 on the leaderboard of the ApolloScape trajectory competition in March 2021.","[{""name"": ""Luqi Tang"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Automotive Components Technology Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Research Center for New Energy &amp; Intelligent Connected Vehicle  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Fuwu Yan"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Automotive Components Technology Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Research Center for New Energy &amp; Intelligent Connected Vehicle  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Bin Zou"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Automotive Components Technology Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Research Center for New Energy &amp; Intelligent Connected Vehicle  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Wenbo Li"", ""affiliation"": [""Hubei Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Automotive Components Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Collaborative Innovation Center for Automotive Components Technology Wuhan University of Technology  Wuhan China"", ""Hubei Research Center for New Energy &amp; Intelligent Connected Vehicle  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Chen Lv"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Nanyang Technological University  Singapore""]}, {""name"": ""Kewei Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Dongfeng USharing Technology Co.

This situation brings many negative impacts towards the environment, cost, productivity, time, social and economy. The increasing of construction wastes is mainly due to the inefficient waste management practices in the construction projects. Hence, the effective management practices in handling construction waste should be highlighted. This study seeks to identify the waste management practices that are able to engender on-site waste minimization. As much as 54 practices had been found from previous research publications. Mapping technique was used to determine the frequency for each practice. This study have found five (5) significant management practices that need to be emphasized in order to achieve on-site waste minimization. The findings of this paper will help researchers to further investigate the significant management practices in minimizing on-site construction waste.","[{""name"": ""Muhammad Fikri Hasmori"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ahmad Faizul Md Zin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sasitharan Nagapan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rafikullah Deraman"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Norhaslinda Abas"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Riduan Yunus"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mustafa Klufallah"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2004)130:4(472)"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.10.015"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.08.016"", ""10.1177/0734242X12437564"", ""10.11591/ijaas.v1i1.476"", ""10.1016/j.sepro.2011.08.025"", ""10.1108/02630800410533285"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2016.10.040"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.03.009"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.10.006"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.05.003"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.11.003"", ""10.1108/20425941311323136"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.04.179"", ""10.1007/s10098-012-0481-6"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2011.01.018"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.09.004"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9364(2009)135:7(647)"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.025"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2010.09.010"", ""10.1016/j.wasman.2008.02.015""]","['Decision Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Management Science and Operations Research']","[[('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7645), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7569), ('0714 统计学', 0.7511), ('0711 系统科学', 0.7506), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7957), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7796)]]"
10.1007/s40534-020-00210-1,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,The mechanism and effects of subgrade fluidisation under ballasted railway tracks,"AbstractThe rapid growth in railway infrastructure and the construction of high-speed heavy-haul rail network, especially on ground that is basically unsuitable, poses challenges for geotechnical engineers because a large part of the money invested in the development of railway lines is often spent on track maintenance. In fact around the world, the mud pumping of subgrade fines is one of the common reasons why track performance deteriorates and track stability is hindered. This article presents a series of laboratory tests to examine following aspects of mud pumping: (1) the mechanisms of subgrade fluidisation under undrained condition, (2) the effects of mud pumping on the engineering characteristics of ballast, and (3) the use of vertical drains to stabilize subgrade under cyclic loads. The undrained cyclic triaxial testing on vulnerable soft subgrade was performed by varying the cyclic stress ratio (CSR) from 0.2 to 1.0 and the loading frequency f from 1.0 to 5.0 Hz. It is seen from the test results that for a specimen compacted at an initial dry density of 1790 kg/m3, the top portion of the specimen fluidises at CSR = 0.5, irrespective of the applied loading frequency. Under cyclic railway loading, the internal redistribution of water at the top of the subgrade layer softens the soil and also reduces its stiffness. In response to these problems, this paper explains how the inclusion of vertical drains in soft subgrade will help to prevent mud pumping by alleviating the build-up of excess pore pressures under moving train loads.","[{""name"": ""Buddhima Indraratna"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mandeep Singh"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Thanh Trung Nguyen"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.4203/ijrt.1.1.9"", ""10.1016/j.sandf.2012.05.009"", ""10.3141/2117-12"", ""10.1680/geot.13.T.033"", ""10.1139/cgj-2019-0350"", ""10.1680/geot.1994.44.3.449"", ""10.1680/geot.2002.52.4.285"", ""10.1520/GTJ20130145"", ""10.1016/j.geotexmem.2016.01.005"", ""10.1016/0266-1144(96)84940-5"", ""10.1016/S0266-352X(03)00064-8"", ""10.1139/t69-027"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1989)115:7(968)"", ""10.1139/t00-062"", ""10.1080/19386362.2016.1171951"", ""10.1016/j.trgeo.2020.100319"", ""10.1520/GTJ104107"", ""10.1680/geot.11.P.086"", ""10.1139/t05-029"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000006"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000270"", ""10.1680/geot.1973.23.2.151""]",['Engineering'],"['Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The major contribution of this study is to provide a comparison of load prediction between various types of charging sites. Real charging data from shopping centres, residential, public, and workplace charging sites are gathered. Altogether, the data consists of 50,504 charging events measured at 37 different charging sites in Finland between January 2019 and January 2020. A forecast of the aggregated charging load is performed in 15‐min resolution for each type of charging site. The second contribution of the work is the extended short‐term forecast horizon. A multi‐step prediction of either four (i.e., one hour) or 96 (i.e., 24 h) time steps is carried out, enabling a comparison of both horizons. The findings reveal that all charging sites exhibit distinct charging characteristics, which affects the forecasting accuracy and suggests a differentiated analysis of the different charging categories. Furthermore, the results indicate that the forecasting accuracy strongly correlates with the forecast horizon. The 4‐time step prediction yields considerably superior results compared with the 96‐time step forecast.","[{""name"": ""Tim Unterluggauer"", ""affiliation"": [""Unit of Electrical Engineering Tampere University  Tampere Finland"", ""Institute of Energy Systems Energy Efficiency and Energy Economics TU Dortmund University  Dortmund Germany"", ""Department of Electrical Engineering Technical University of Denmark  Denmark""]}, {""name"": ""Kalle Rauma"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Energy Systems Energy Efficiency and Energy Economics TU Dortmund University  Dortmund Germany""]}, {""name"": ""Pertti Järventausta"", ""affiliation"": [""Unit of Electrical Engineering Tampere University  Tampere Finland""]}, {""name"": ""Christian Rehtanz"", ""affiliation"": [""Institute of Energy Systems Energy Efficiency and Energy Economics TU Dortmund University  Dortmund Germany""]}]","[""10.1016/j.rser.2016.10.005"", ""10.1109/TSG.2016.2606442"", ""10.1016/j.est.2020.101267"", ""10.1109/TSG.2015.2438852"", ""10.1109/TSTE.2017.2746097"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2873409"", ""10.1016/j.epsr.2017.02.019"", ""10.1109/TTE.2016.2616864"", ""10.1109/TSG.2017.2749623"", ""10.1109/TSG.2019.2932695"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2850030"", ""10.1109/TSG.2013.2294436"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2561296"", ""10.1109/TII.2018.2865433"", ""10.1016/j.epsr.2016.06.003"", ""10.1109/TSG.2015.2458852"", ""10.1080/15325008.2017.1336583"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.184"", ""10.3390/en11113207"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.345"", ""10.1109/TII.2020.2990397"", ""10.3390/app9091723"", ""10.3390/en12142692"", ""10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2019.8881655"", ""10.1109/iSPEC48194.2019.8975364"", ""10.1109/TSG.2020.2998072"", ""10.1088/1742-6596/1757/1/012145"", ""10.1088/1755-1315/546/4/042001"", ""10.3390/en11061449"", ""10.3390/en11051253"", ""10.3390/en12071341"", ""10.1109/TCYB.2020.2975134"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70338-1"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.177"", ""10.1109/TSG.2017.2753802"", ""10.5120/ijca2017915495"", ""10.3390/en6031385""]","['Energy', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.758), ('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7362), ('0703 化学', 0.7355), ('1406 纳米科学与工程', 0.7293), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7288)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7416), ('0827 核科学与技术', 0.7248)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"
10.1007/s40534-020-00212-z,RAILWAY ENGINEERING SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Rotary-scaling fine-tuning (RSFT) method for optimizing railway wheel profiles and its application to a locomotive,"AbstractThe existing multi-objective wheel profile optimization methods mainly consist of three sub-modules: (1) wheel profile generation, (2) multi-body dynamics simulation, and (3) an optimization algorithm. For the first module, a comparably conservative rotary-scaling fine-tuning (RSFT) method, which introduces two design variables and an empirical formula, is proposed to fine-tune the traditional wheel profiles for improving their engineering applicability. For the second module, for the TRAXX locomotives serving on the Blankenburg–Rübeland line, an optimization function representing the relationship between the wheel profile and the wheel–rail wear number is established based on Kriging surrogate model (KSM). For the third module, a method combining the regression capability of KSM with the iterative computing power of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to quickly and reliably implement the task of optimizing wheel profiles. Finally, with the RSFT–KSM–PSO method, we propose two wear-resistant wheel profiles for the TRAXX locomotives serving on the Blankenburg–Rübeland line, namely S1002-S and S1002-M. The S1002-S profile minimizes the total wear number by 30%, while the S1002-M profile makes the wear distribution more uniform through a proper sacrifice of the tread wear number, and the total wear number is reduced by 21%. The quasi-static and hunting stability tests further demonstrate that the profile designed by the RSFT–KSM–PSO method is promising for practical engineering applications.","[{""name"": ""Yunguang Ye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yayun Qi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dachuan Shi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yichang Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markus Hecht"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1533/9781845696788"", ""10.1201/9781420004892"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2010.10.072"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2016.05.021"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2013.12.007"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2014.01.011"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2013.11.033"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2005.01.018"", ""10.1007/s11044-020-09722-4"", ""10.1080/00423110801993094"", ""10.1080/00423114.2016.1180405"", ""10.1177/0954409714542478"", ""10.1016/S0967-0661(02)00070-9"", ""10.1080/00423110600907402"", ""10.1007/s40534-020-00207-w"", ""10.1080/00423110701426690"", ""10.1243/095440903762727320"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2004.03.051"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2008.03.018"", ""10.1177/09544097JRRT305"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2010.10.055"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2010.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2006.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2020.105554"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.075"", ""10.1243/09544097JRRT150"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2013.02.009"", ""10.1109/ICNN.1995.488968"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1657908"", ""10.1007/s00158-018-2065-5"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2019.04.012"", ""10.2514/2.1234"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2008.03.026"", ""10.1080/00423114.2013.802096"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2019.02.016"", ""10.1080/00423114.2018.1447677"", ""10.1080/00423114.2012.711478"", ""10.1080/00423114.2015.1137958"", ""10.1177/0954409718825412"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1636098"", ""10.1016/0043-1648(91)90025-P"", ""10.1243/1350650042794815"", ""10.1080/00423119708969355"", ""10.1016/j.ast.2012.11.010"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1620956"", ""10.1515/crll.1882.92.156"", ""10.1080/00423114.2016.1156135"", ""10.1631/jzus.A1600693"", ""10.1243/095440905X33251""]",['Engineering'],"['General Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7123), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7075)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

QFD is a planning process that helps the organization plan to implement various technical support tools effectively and complement each other to prioritize each problem. House of Quality (HOQ) is a tool from QFD that is used to determine design boundaries, shows the relationship between respondent needs and the matrix to satisfy the needs of respondents and illustrates the focus of the design team to produce quality products. The paper’s purpose is to review the QFD literature based on references that have been collected about the history of the development of the QFD method and the application of QFD in product design and development. Planning for process quality is a very important technique for managing the quality of the product during the product development process. Done to expand processes and adequate process capabilities aimed at producing products. Since Japanese academics and industry began 3 decades more than have passed to formalize QFD techniques in 1960 and 1970. Because of the effectiveness in quality management and product expend, QFD applications have been widely used.","[{""name"": ""Rosnani Ginting"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Aulia Ishak"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Alfin Fauzi Malik"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Riski Satrio"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0377-2217(02)00178-9"", ""10.1080/09544820050034213"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/505/1/012090"", ""10.55732/jrt.v2i2.228"", ""10.1016/j.ijhm.2018.03.010"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/495/1/012009"", ""10.1088/1757-899X/602/1/012048""]","['Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Biomedical Engineering', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Management of Technology and Innovation']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0831 生物医学工程', 0.7587), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7385)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.7469), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7336)]]"

However, their usefulness is hampered by their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Recently, many methods for measuring and improving a network’s robustness to adversarial perturbations have been proposed, and this growing body of research has given rise to numerous explicit or implicit notions of robustness. Connections between these notions are often subtle, and a systematic comparison between them is missing in the literature. In this paper we begin addressing this gap, by setting up general principles for the empirical analysis and evaluation of a network’s robustness as a mathematical property—during the network’s training phase, its verification, and after its deployment. We then apply these principles and conduct a case study that showcases the practical benefits of our general approach.","[{""name"": ""Marco Casadio"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ekaterina Komendantskaya"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Matthew L.

This upcoming shift requires the preparation of necessary policies, such as rethinking obsolete training curricula, in relation to a variety of aspects of the industry, including the future of seafaring as a profession. To formulate such policies, the views of professional seafarers and scholars are sometimes solicited, but the opinions of industry entrants are often neglected. However, the latter may also have some interesting views on the future of their profession, which may be relevant to policy-makers. The results of a worldwide survey, conducted using the Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) method, suggest that the future generation of seafarers fears automation less than their mentors. Although they expect their skills to be useful in automation-driven shipping, they also feel that their Maritime Education and Training institutions (MET) are not doing enough to prepare them for the challenges that the future may hold. This may be due to a lack or poor coverage of shipping autonomization issues in MET curricula, which was mentioned by as many as 41.9% of the respondents. This finding advocates for rethinking the curricula of METs and human resources management in the shipping industry of the future.","[{""name"": ""Krzysztof Bogusławski"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Mateusz Gil"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jan Nasur"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Krzysztof Wróbel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1057/palgrave.mel.9100098"", ""10.1007/s13437-015-0078-0"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.107188"", ""10.5755/j01.eis.0.8.7323"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2007.12.006"", ""10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104758"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.024"", ""10.1057/s41278-017-0068-6"", ""10.12716/1001.13.03.01"", ""10.1080/18366503.2016.1229244"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2018.08.018"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-64088-0_5"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104139"", ""10.1080/03088839.2019.1597290"", ""10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.12.018"", ""10.1007/s13437-020-00203-1"", ""10.17402/262"", ""10.12716/1001.12.02.15"", ""10.24868/issn.2515-818x.2018.016"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2017.06.002"", ""10.1080/00140139.2019.1659995"", ""10.1016/j.ergon.2018.08.005"", ""10.1080/030888399287050"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2020.09.018"", ""10.12716/1001.13.04.04"", ""10.1016/j.ress.2019.106697"", ""10.1002/abc.21293"", ""10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104349"", ""10.1353/jip.2015.0021"", ""10.1016/j.ress.2017.03.029"", ""10.12716/1001.13.01.02""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Information Systems', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12127,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,GSA-ELM: A hybrid learning model for short-term traffic flow forecasting,"Abstract Accurate and timely short‐term traffic flow forecasting is an essential component for intelligent traffic management systems. However, developing an effective and robust forecasting model is challenging due to the inherent randomness and nonlinear characteristic of the traffic flow. In this paper, a gravitational search algorithm optimized extreme learning machine, termed GSA‐ELM, is proposed to unlock the potential performance for short‐term traffic flow forecasting. The extreme learning machine avoids the tedious backpropagation by analytically determining the optimal solution. The gravitational search algorithm globally searches the optimal parameters for the extreme learning machine. The forecasting performance of the GSA‐ELM is evaluated on four benchmark datasets by comparing several state‐of‐the‐art models. The four benchmark datasets are real‐world traffic flow data from highways A1, A2, A4, A8 near the ring road of Amsterdam. The MAPEs of the GSA‐ELM model are , , and on four benchmark datasets, respectively, whereas the RMSEs of the GSA‐ELM model are 287.89, 203.04, 221.39 and , respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.","[{""name"": ""Zhihan Cui"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Boyu Huang"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Haowen Dou"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Guanru Tan"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Shiqiang Zheng"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China""]}, {""name"": ""Teng Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering Shantou University  Shantou China"", ""Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Technology (Shantou University) Ministry of Education  Shantou China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.physa.2019.121461"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105592"", ""10.1007/s11063-018-9804-x"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2174051"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5385"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2019.122601"", ""10.1109/MSN48538.2019.00093"", ""10.1016/j.cie.2018.02.042"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.10.002"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2015.02.008"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2174634"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2013.11.011"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2260540"", ""10.1007/s00521-012-1291-9"", ""10.1080/15472450802262281"", ""10.1007/s00500-016-2262-3"", ""10.1109/TITS.2018.2854913"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5315"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.06.011"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963784"", ""10.1155/2021/5582974"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.02.009"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970250"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2017.03.049"", ""10.3390/electronics9091474"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2020.11.026"", ""10.1016/j.aap.2020.105628"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.3301922"", ""10.1109/TITS.2019.2900481"", ""10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17761"", ""10.1016/j.knosys.2019.01.015"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2015.03.036"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2019.09.077"", ""10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3029198"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2021.126485"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2005.12.126"", ""10.1007/s12559-014-9255-2"", ""10.1016/j.patcog.2005.03.028"", ""10.1016/j.neucom.2009.12.007"", ""10.1007/s11771-017-3538-1"", ""10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7873027"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.01.005"", ""10.1016/j.ins.2009.03.004"", ""10.1007/s11269-018-2061-y"", ""10.3390/w12010301"", ""10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2017.02.005"", ""10.1007/s11269‐019‐02346‐0"", ""10.1109/TITS.2013.2278192"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2013.0052"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8667.2007.00489.x"", ""10.1109/IVS.2013.6629516"", ""10.1007/s11269-017-1632-7"", ""10.1063/1.5120502"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2019.04.019"", ""10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.03.031"", ""10.1109/ISBI45749.2020.9098488"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2019.107049"", ""10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00454"", ""10.1155/2020/8874521""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

A speed profile controller is designed based on a multi‐phase dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, which is utilised to optimise speed trajectories with the detailed model of the traction power system, vehicle dynamics system, and signal constraints at intersections. The optimised speed and demand power profiles are designed as the reference of the power split optimal controller. A DP algorithm is presented to determine voltage trajectories of supercapacitors with power plant voltage limitations and dynamic power losses. The performance of the proposed integrated method is evaluated by numerical simulation based on an actual route of Chengdu Tramway Line 2. The energy reduction can be achieved by the speed profiles controller, compared to the eco‐cruising benchmark strategies. Energy efficiency can be further improved by the integrated eco‐driving controller. Moreover, the influences of green signal time windows and trip time on the shape of the optimised solution are investigated. For a given journey, the trip time with minimum energy consumption can be obtained. The integrated eco‐driving control method can be implemented by driver assistant systems or automatic train operation systems.","[{""name"": ""Zhuang Xiao"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University 611756 Chengdu People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiaoyun Feng"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University 611756 Chengdu People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Qingyuan Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University 611756 Chengdu People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Pengfei Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University 611756 Chengdu People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.01.060"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.04.070"", ""10.1109/TITS.2015.2447507"", ""10.1016/j.ejor.2016.09.044"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2016.0214"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2018.01.006"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2003.07.001"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2009.07.028"", ""10.1016/j.automatica.2013.07.008"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.07.014"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2011.0187"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.04.009"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.09.010"", ""10.1109/TTE.2018.2851785"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.11.040"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.007"", ""10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309851"", ""10.1109/TVT.2013.2271646"", ""10.1109/TTE.2017.2739399"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2871792"", ""10.1002/tee.20479"", ""10.3390/en11030478"", ""10.1243/0954409001531306"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.130"", ""10.1109/TVT.2017.2769084"", ""10.1109/MCS.2015.2449688""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The information asymmetry poses significant challenges in managing and controlling vehicles in mixed traffic. To address such challenges, this study first customises the intelligent driver model to describe the car‐following behaviour of CAVs. Furthermore, to raise the traffic efficiency of the mixed traffic flow, a new lane‐changing decision support algorithm is proposed, which incorporates the interaction between CAVs and HVs by controlling the speed and locating the lane of CAVs. In addition to the common indexes of outflow and travel time to be used to measure the travel efficiency, new parameters such as platoon intensity and single rate are defined to evaluate the CAV platooning capability. Through simulation tests, the proposed controlling framework is implemented for a two‐lane (per direction) freeway segment under different CAV penetration rates and input volumes. The simulation results indicate that, at all the CAV penetration levels, the proposed controlling algorithm provides significant performance improvements to the whole mixed traffic flow in terms of outflow, travel time, and the number of CAV platoons.","[{""name"": ""Guojing Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mathematics and Statistical Sciences Jackson State University Jackson USA""]}, {""name"": ""Feng Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""Ingram School of Engineering, Texas State University San Marcos USA""]}, {""name"": ""Weike Lu"", ""affiliation"": [""Alabama Transportation Institute, The University of Alabama Tuscaloosa USA""]}, {""name"": ""Tor A.

10.1007/s40864-019-00117-z,URBAN RAIL TRANSIT,0823 Transportation Engineering,Connectivity Reliability on an Urban Rail Transit Network from the Perspective of Passenger Travel,"Abstract Under the background of urbanization and the rapid development of urban rail transit (URT), serious attention has been focused on URT network reliability in recent years. In this work, in order to measure network reliability, three indicators are constructed based on passengers’ tolerable travel paths, passenger travel efficiency and passenger travel realization on a URT network. The passenger tolerability coefficient, which is the ratio of passengers’ tolerable travel time to the shortest possible travel time, is proposed and added to the indicators. It reflects passengers’ behavior with respect to choice of travel paths. The ratio of affected passenger volume (RAPV) is proposed to identify important stations. Finally, the connectivity reliability of Wuhan’s subway network is analyzed by simulating attacks on stations. The results show that the degree centrality, betweenness centrality and RAPV indicators of stations can effectively identify the important stations that have a significant impact on the connectivity reliability of the network. In particular, the RAPV indicator effectively identifies stations that have the greatest influence on passenger travel realization. The connectivity reliability of Wuhan’s subway network is sensitive to passenger tolerability coefficient, and reliability is greater during non-peak hours than during peak hours. In addition, the stations that are important to the connectivity reliability of the Wuhan subway have two features, i.e., they are located at the center of the city, and they are important for connecting subgraphs of the network.","[{""name"": ""Jie Liu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Qiyuan Peng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jinqu Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yong Yin"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/S0378-4371(02)01089-0"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2010.04.008"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2004.03.019"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2016.03.040"", ""10.1002/9781118903032"", ""10.1080/10798587.2013.787189"", ""10.1109/SOLI.2011.5986595"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2015.05.006"", ""10.1109/NCM.2009.180"", ""10.3390/su9081479"", ""10.1016/j.strusafe.2016.12.001"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2016.02.049"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.01.008"", ""10.1016/j.physa.2015.02.002"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2016.07.015"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2018.12.015"", ""10.1007/s11771-013-1811-5"", ""10.1080/01441647.2010.519127"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2019.07.010"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2019.08.001"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2019.05.013""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

The idea of cooperative verification is that different tools help each other to achieve the goal of correctly solving verification tasks.The language is based on verification artifacts (programs, specifications, witnesses) as basic objects and verification actors (verifiers, validators, testers) as basic operations. We define composition operators that make it possible to easily describe new compositions. Verification artifacts are the interface between the different verification actors. CoVeriTeam consists of a language for composition of verification actors, and its interpreter.As a result of viewing tools as components, we can now create powerful verification engines that are beyond the possibilities of single tools, avoiding to develop certain components repeatedly. We illustrate the abilities of CoVeriTeam on a few case studies. We expect that CoVeriTeam will help verification researchers and practitioners to easily experiment with new tools, and assist them in rapid prototyping of tool combinations.","[{""name"": ""Dirk Beyer"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sudeep Kanav"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/978-3-540-24756-2_1"", ""10.1145/1965724.1965743"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45234-6_25"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99527-0_20"", ""10.1145/2950290.2950351"", ""10.1145/3477579"", ""10.1145/2786805.2786867"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-92994-1_1"", ""10.1145/3510003.3510064"", ""10.1145/2393596.2393664"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-16722-6_23"", ""10.1145/3180155.3180259"", ""10.5281/zenodo.5644953"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-99429-7_3"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-31784-3_11"", ""10.1145/2491411.2491429"", ""10.1007/s10009-017-0469-y"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-53291-8_10"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-61362-4_8"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-17524-9_1"", ""10.1109/69.43410"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-32759-9_13"", ""10.1007/10722167_15"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_3"", ""10.1145/567752.567778"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-35873-9_18"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54624-2_13"", ""10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_7"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2"", ""10.1126/science.275.5296.51"", ""10.1016/j.dam.2006.04.015"", ""10.1145/1138912.1138916"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-11486-1_14"", ""10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60520-3"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-30729-4_10"", ""10.1007/11576280_3"", ""10.1007/s100090050003""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

The research on the public acceptance of autonomous buses will help to provide a basis for formulating policies and measures, and thus have important theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, an initial theoretical model of acceptance of autonomous buses was established. An on‐line survey was conducted with a total of 401 valid samples collected. The reliability and validity tests of the data showed that the internal consistency of the questionnaire was high, and the reliability and validity all met the requirements. Based on the results of structural equation modelling, the proposed model was validated and all the hypotheses were confirmed. Attitude would positively affect behavioural intention, and trust and perceived usefulness would positively affect attitudes. Moreover, both perceived ease of use and perceived comfort would have positive effects on perceived usefulness as well as on trust. Perceived risk would be negatively associated with trust. Multi‐group analyses were conducted to test the moderating effects of the individual's education and knowledge of autonomous buses, and the two factors showed significant effects. Based on the results, corresponding measures can be taken to increase the acceptance of autonomous buses.","[{""name"": ""Zhongyi Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""China Academy of Transportation Sciences  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongmei Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation and Logistics Dalian University of Technology  Dalian China""]}, {""name"": ""Haijiao Xi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation and Logistics Dalian University of Technology  Dalian China""]}, {""name"": ""Nan Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation and Logistics Dalian University of Technology  Dalian China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.trf.2017.07.007"", ""10.1016/j.cstp.2020.05.005"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2019.09.002"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2020.12.007"", ""10.1155/2019/4603548"", ""10.1016/j.jup.2019.100994"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2019.10.016"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2018.06.024"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5513"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2020.06.001"", ""10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982"", ""10.1002/mar.20196"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2019.08.002"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.11.018"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.024"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.08.013"", ""10.1080/10447318.2015.1070549"", ""10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2019.07.009"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.09.022"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2019.07.002"", ""10.1108/17465660710834462"", ""10.1007/s10209-014-0348-1"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2018.09.029"", ""10.1016/S0963-8687(02)00020-3"", ""10.1177/0018720815625744"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0703"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2019.05.013"", ""10.1016/j.dss.2007.07.001""]","['Psychology', 'Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Social Psychology']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7768), ('0402 心理学', 0.7712)]]"
10.1049/els2.12029,IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering,An intelligent energy management strategy for an off-road plug-in hybrid electric tractor based on farm operation recognition,"Abstract Due to the growing emergence of vehicle electrification, agricultural tractor developers are launching hybrid powertrains in which energy management strategy (EMS) assumes a prominent role. This work mainly aims at developing an EMS for a plug‐in hybrid electric tractor (PHET) to minimise fuel consumption and increase the operating range. The developed off‐road PHET power sources are composed of a biogas‐fuelled Internal Combustion Engine Generator (Bio‐Gen), a photovoltaic system, and a battery pack. To control the power flow among different sources, a two‐layer EMS is formulated. In this regard, initially, the farm operating mode is recognised by means of classification of a working cycle's features. Then, a control strategy based on a multi‐mode fuzzy logic controller (MFLC) is employed to manage the power flow. At each sequence, the classifier identifies the farm operation condition and accordingly activates the relative mode of the MFLC to meet the requested power from the Bio‐Gen. The performance of the proposed EMS has been evaluated based on three real‐world typical agricultural working cycles. The results demonstrate the successful performance of the proposed intelligent EMS under farm conditions by maintaining the energy sources' operation in a high‐efficiency zone which can lead to the extension of the working range and decrease fuel consumption.","[{""name"": ""Amin Ghobadpour"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Université du Québec à Trois‐Rivières  Trois‐rivieres QC Canada"", ""Department of Mechanical Engineering of Biosystems University of Tehran  Karaj Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Hossein Mousazadeh"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering of Biosystems University of Tehran  Karaj Iran""]}, {""name"": ""Sousso Kelouwani"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Université du Québec à Trois‐Rivières  Trois‐rivieres QC Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Nadjet Zioui"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering Université du Québec à Trois‐Rivières  Trois‐rivieres QC Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Mohsen Kandidayeni"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Université du Québec à Trois‐Rivières  Trois‐rivieres QC Canada"", ""e‐TESC Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Sherbrooke  Sherbrooke QC Canada""]}, {""name"": ""Loïc Boulon"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Université du Québec à Trois‐Rivières  Trois‐rivieres QC Canada""]}]","[""10.13031/2013.32586"", ""10.1016/j.egypro.2019.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.02.018"", ""10.1016/j.jterra.2013.03.004"", ""10.1002/9781118970553"", ""10.1049/iet-est.2016.0060"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.09.085"", ""10.1109/ACC.2010.5531308"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2019.0606"", ""10.1109/TVT.2010.2090178"", ""10.1049/iet-est.2020.0035"", ""10.3390/en11030476"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.12.031"", ""10.1016/j.trd.2015.04.024"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2016.05.060"", ""10.1109/TVT.2015.2476820"", ""10.1007/s10098-016-1122-2"", ""10.1109/VPPC.2008.4677545"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.071"", ""10.1049/iet-est.2020.0052"", ""10.1109/CVCI47823.2019.8951584"", ""10.1049/iet-est.2017.0067"", ""10.1109/OJVT.2020.3018146"", ""10.1109/TVT.2019.2936713"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.057"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.01.071"", ""10.1109/VPPC.2011.6043061"", ""10.3390/wevj10010001"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.139"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2020.117297"", ""10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.01.008"", ""10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00194-5"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-51317-1"", ""10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.11.021"", ""10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7"", ""10.1109/TFUZZ.2018.2856086"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2020.112474"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.020"", ""10.3390/en9121020"", ""10.3390/en8043225""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

As a result, the total length of modern, high-speed roads has increased from around 500 km in 2005 to over 3000 km in 2015. Yet, while the positive impact of transport infrastructure investment on overall accessibility is unquestionable there are no studies that assess its influence on economic development of particular regions. This paper applies a regional dynamic CGE model to measure the effects of big transport infrastructure investments in Polish NUTS2 regions. We use data on both investment spending and accessibility improvement (expressed as a reduction in transport margins) in order to distinguish between possible short and long term impacts. We find that there exist significant disparities in the impact between regions with high share of major road infrastructure investment undertaken by private investors and the ones that relied fully on public funding. In the case of the former, the lack of analyzed investment would lead to relatively significant decrease in real GDP or average employment. In the case of the latter, the impact of major road infrastructure investment is almost negligible.","[{""name"": ""Bartlomiej Rokicki"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Eduardo A.

The focus is mainly on the soil candidates, binding mechanism, the reported strengths and weaknesses for each chemical stabiliser used in soil stabilisation. While it is generally agreed that cement is best suited for sand-sized to gravel-sized soil mixtures (well-graded), lime is mainly used for wet heavy-clay soil mixtures. Polymer emulsion is more suitable for silt-sized to fine gravel-sized soil mixtures (well-graded). Organic soils are the most difficult soil type to stabilise, and for any kind of chemical stabiliser used, the strength gain is relatively minimal. Cement undergoes hydration reaction which is rapid, and results in high compressive strength, while lime undergoes a slower pozzolanic reaction is slower, and provide lower compressive strength. Polymer emulsion depends on the rate of evaporation for the film formation to complete, and results in ductile polymer-soil matrix. Like lime, polymer does not provide significant compressive strength but does provide great flexural strength that prevents crack propagations. The outcomes from this paper provide an insight into recent and upcoming research trend using chemical soil stabilisers on local soil mixtures to improve the engineering properties of pavement layers made of these soil mixtures.","[{""name"": ""E H Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""E M M Zahran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S J Tan"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s12665-010-0767-0"", ""10.11648/j.ijtet.20170302.12"", ""10.1186/s40703-017-0041-3"", ""10.1515/secm-2016-0084"", ""10.3141/1819b-10"", ""10.1007/s12205-012-1388-9"", ""10.1155/2018/4158682"", ""10.3141/1652-28"", ""10.2113/gseegeosci.I.2.139"", ""10.1007/s10064-013-0549-5"", ""10.1007/s00723-007-0019-y"", ""10.1186/s40703-017-0064-9"", ""10.1016/S0958-9465(97)00065-6"", ""10.1007/s10064-014-0667-8"", ""10.3141/1787-07"", ""10.3141/1989-49"", ""10.1051/matecconf/201710307014"", ""10.30880/ijie.2018.10.09.007"", ""10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2015.06.004"", ""10.3923/jas.2016.344.358"", ""10.3923/jas.2015.1266.1277"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.687.329"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.306-307.588""]",['Engineering'],['Civil and Structural Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)]]"

Currently few or no study regarding the usage of this platform to study land use/cover changes over years in Malaysia. The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of GEE as a free cloud-based platform by performing classification of Klang Valley area from Landsat composites of three different years (1988-2003-2018) using multiple Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA). The best classification results were then imported and further processed to quantify the changes over the years using commercial software. Although, the classification results are of high accuracy but CART shows the best accuracy with 94.71%, 97.72% and 96.57% in 1988, 2003 and 2018 in comparison with RF and SVM. Some misclassified pixels were encountered because the annual composited images were compiled without taken into considerations of crops phenological stages (paddy) which resulted to the misclassified agricultural land into urban and bare land. Hence, the selection and composition of data initially had to be structured and strategized prior to processing as they can affect the classification result and further analysis. Regardless, GEE has performed quite well and fast in term of time and processing complexity of multiple datasets with minimal human interaction and intervention. Generally, GEE has proven to be reliable in fulfilling the objectives of this study to evaluate the GEE feasibility by performing classification and quantifying the land use/cover of studied area and provide good base for further analysis using different platform.","[{""name"": ""N.A Wahap"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Helmi Z.M.

In Latin America, such systems have recently been implemented in zones with high levels of poverty and vulnerability. Although the social implications of their implementation are relevant, individual expectations of these systems and how current changes in travel conditions and quality of life are perceived have not been widely reported in the literature. This paper aims to evaluate users’ expectations and perceptions of a new cable car in the southern periphery of Bogotá (Colombia). We conducted a panel survey before (n = 341) and after (n = 301) the cable car started operations to evaluate the ranking of preferences toward a set of possible benefits of the project. We estimated discrete choice models to analyze the statistical differences between the expectations and perceptions before and after changes. Results suggest that travel time reductions, comfort improvements, and in-vehicle security are the benefits most valued by the users. Even though the project meets expectations of these aspects, it seems to fall short in expectations of reductions of pollution. Individuals’ experience with the cable car shapes their perceptions of the system. We found that perceptions differ between those who have used the service at least once and those who never did. Policy implications derived from this study might be of interest to decision-makers seeking to guarantee the public acceptability of urban projects.","[{""name"": ""Luis A.

10.1049/iet-its.2020.0004,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0711 Systems Science; 0823 Transportation Engineering,Urban traffic flow online prediction based on multi-component attention mechanism,"Traffic flow prediction is regarded as an important concept used in traffic planning, traffic design, and traffic management. In this study, the authors propose a multi‐component attention (MCA) method for traffic flow prediction, which may jointly and adaptively understand components of long‐term trends, seasons, and traffic flow residuals that result from multi‐dimensional decomposition. According to the highly non‐linear nature of traffic flow, the proposed module consists of a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network, a bidirectional long short‐term memory, and a bidirectional mechanism with an attention mechanism. The former captures local trend characteristics of residuals, while the latter captures trends and seasonal time adjustments. Due to the randomness, irregularity, and periodicity of traffic flow at intersections, target flow prediction is related to various sequences. Through the introduction of the attention mechanism, highly related historical information may be connected for multi‐component flow data in the final prediction. Compared to seasonal autoregressive integral moving average model, artificial neural network, and recurrent neural network, the experimental results demonstrated that the proposed MCA model can meet the accuracy and effectiveness of complex non‐linear urban traffic flow prediction models.","[{""name"": ""Bo Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Urban Design Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture Beijing 100044 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Tuo Sun"", ""affiliation"": [""Key Laboratory of Road and Traffic Engineering of the Ministry of Education Tongji University Shanghai 201804 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yujia Zhang"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Future Urban Design Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture Beijing 100044 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Pengpeng Jiao"", ""affiliation"": [""Beijing Urban Transportation Infrastructure Engineering Technology Research Center Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture Beijing 100044 People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.trc.2014.01.005"", ""10.1155/2018/5728042"", ""10.1145/3065386"", ""10.1109/MSP.2012.2205597"", ""10.1080/15472450.2012.710158"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2015.0136"", ""10.1016/j.asoc.2008.03.006"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btn195"", ""10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.09.036"", ""10.1023/A:1008640732416"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.04.025"", ""10.1016/S0968-090X(97)82903-8"", ""10.3141/1776-25"", ""10.3141/1857-09"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:6(664)"", ""10.1109/ICINIS.2013.32"", ""10.1109/ACC.2013.6580568"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2014.02.006"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2008.07.069"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004"", ""10.1080/18128600902823216"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.08.076"", ""10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.08.233"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2006)132:2(114)"", ""10.1109/TITS.2014.2311123"", ""10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1223839"", ""10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084006"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0119044"", ""10.1109/ISKE.2017.8258813"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.03.014"", ""10.1109/SmartCity.2015.63"", ""10.1061/9780784482292.210"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929692"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-70139-4_31"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99247-1_21"", ""10.3390/s17071501"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2943890"", ""10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.09.008""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

Products produced from plants such as fruits, vegetables, cereals, essential oils and many others are rich in carbohydrate, protein, vitamins and fibre that are necessary for health maintenance. They are an integral part of our regular diet because they are all of the food that people eat. Plants are arranged in a hierarchical classification that is called Taxonomy, and any given organism can be classified throughout the hierarchy. Such an arrangement allows related organisms to be classified. There are various taxonomic levels and each level is given a name (e.g., kingdom, division (phylum), class, order, family, genus, species). For example, the taxonomic class of monocotyledonous involves different families, but in this article, only the families of Poaceae (formerly called Gramineae) and Fabaceae (also called Leguminosae) are considered. Some of the major crops of these families that yield highly nutritious edible seeds or grains are known as cereals and legumes respectively. Legumes include common beans, peas, soybean, peanut and lentils while the most important crops of cereals are wheat, rice, corn, barley and rye. Their products account for a large part of the energy, carbohydrate and protein of the daily diet of every person in the world. Consequently, they play a fundamental role in the food security in the UK, as well as food security globally.","[{""name"": ""M V Shavanov"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1111/nyas.12299"", ""10.1104/pp.017004""]",['Agricultural and Biological Sciences'],['Plant Science'],"[[('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12033,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Social graph convolutional LSTM for pedestrian trajectory prediction,"Abstract Understanding the movement of pedestrians and predicting their future trajectory can be very important in intelligent transportation systems because accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction will improve the level of autonomous driving technology and reduce traffic accidents. The authors address this problem with a social graph convolutional long short‐term memory neural network architecture by considering the movement information of each pedestrian and its interaction with neighbours. Specifically, the authors use a graph to model pedestrian walking state where nodes denote the pedestrian movement information, and edges represent the interactions between pairwise pedestrians. An end‐to‐end architecture that combines a sequence‐to‐sequence model with a graph convolutional network to learn the movement features and interaction features is used. To capture the interaction influence on different pedestrians, an emotion gate to refine the learned features and filter out useless information is introduced. A companion loss function to increase the ability of the network to capture ‘walking in groups’ behaviour is further proposed. Through experiments on two public datasets (ETH and UCY), the authors prove that our method outperforms the previous methods.","[{""name"": ""Yutao Zhou"", ""affiliation"": [""The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying Mapping and Remote Sensing Wuhan University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Huayi Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying Mapping and Remote Sensing Wuhan University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Hongquan Cheng"", ""affiliation"": [""The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying Mapping and Remote Sensing Wuhan University  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Kunlun Qi"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Geography and Information Engineering China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)  Wuhan China""]}, {""name"": ""Kai Hu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Internet of Things Jiangnan University  Wuxi China""]}, {""name"": ""Chaogui Kang"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering Wuhan University  Wuhan China"", ""Center for Urban Science + Progress New York University  Brooklyn New York USA""]}, {""name"": ""Jie Zheng"", ""affiliation"": [""The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying Mapping and Remote Sensing Wuhan University  Wuhan China""]}]","[""10.1109/CVPR.2016.110"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2005.09.006"", ""10.1016/S0378-4371(01)00141-8"", ""10.1016/j.neunet.2018.09.002"", ""10.1109/TPAMI.2011.176"", ""10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638947"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2018.00240"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282"", ""10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735"", ""10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01089.x"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2016.08.018"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206641"", ""10.1371/journal.pone.0010047"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2009.5459260"", ""10.1109/CVPR.2019.00144"", ""10.1109/TNN.2008.2005605"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-91554-8_22"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2017/386"", ""10.1177/0278364914557874"", ""10.1109/IROS.2010.5654369"", ""10.1145/1141911.1142008"", ""10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460504"", ""10.1109/ICCV.2015.512"", ""10.1145/3219819.3219890"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/505""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'Ocean Engineering']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7558), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7479)], [('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7602), ('0707 海洋科学', 0.7281)]]"

The pseudo-excitation method is adopted in the proposed framework, where the vehicle is modelled as a rigid body and the bridge is modelled using the finite element method. The vertical and lateral wheel–rail pseudo-excitations are established assuming the wheel and rail have the same displacement and using the simplified Kalker creep theory, respectively. The power spectrum function of vehicle and bridge responses is calculated by history integral. Based on the dynamic responses from the deterministic and random analyses of the interaction system, and the probability density functions for three safety factors (derailment coefficient, wheel unloading rate, and lateral wheel axle force) are obtained, and the probabilities of the safety factors exceeding the given limits are calculated. The proposed method is validated by Monte Carlo simulations using a case study of a high-speed train running over a bridge with five simply supported spans and four piers.","[{""name"": ""Nan Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Ziji Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Zhaozhi Wu"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1080/00423114.2019.1605085"", ""10.1080/23248378.2013.791498"", ""10.1177/0954409711411609"", ""10.1016/j.probengmech.2013.08.006"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2008.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.probengmech.2011.09.001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000386"", ""10.1002/eqe.4290210805"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2015.06.031"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.07.308"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2013.05.018"", ""10.1016/j.jsv.2019.05.031"", ""10.1155/2016/1450895"", ""10.1177/0954409715616836"", ""10.1016/j.engstruct.2010.08.001"", ""10.1080/15732479.2019.1704800"", ""10.1006/jsvi.2002.5107"", ""10.1016/j.compstruc.2012.10.007"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)BE.1943-5592.0000476"", ""10.1007/s00419-011-0506-3""]",['Engineering'],"['General Engineering', 'Mechanics of Materials', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7123), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7075)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7401), ('0801 力学', 0.7332)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

WPFTS can recommend one or more optimized wheel profiles according to train operators’ needs, e.g., reducing wheel wear, mitigating the development of wheel out-of-roundness (OOR), improving the shape stability of the wheel profile. Specifically, WPFTS includes four modules: (I) a wheel profile generation module based on the rotary-scaling fine-tuning (RSFT) method; (II) a multi-objective generation module consisting of a rigid multi-body dynamics simulation (MBS) model, an analytical model, and a rigid–flexible MBS model, for generating 11 objectives related to wheel damage, vehicle stability, vehicle safety, and passenger comfort; (III) a weight assignment module consisting of an adaptive weight assignment strategy and a manual weight assignment strategy; and (IV) an optimization module based on radial basis function (RBF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, three cases are introduced to show how WPTFS recommends a wheel profile according to train operators’ needs. Among them, a wheel profile with high shape stability, a wheel profile for mitigating the development of wheel OOR, and a wheel profile considering hunting stability and derailment safety are developed, respectively.","[{""name"": ""Yunguang Ye"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jonas Vuitton"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yu Sun"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Markus Hecht"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1007/s40534-020-00212-z"", ""10.1243/095440903762727320"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2004.03.051"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2006.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2010.10.055"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2010.10.005"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2008.03.018"", ""10.1080/00423114.2018.1447677"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1657908"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2019.04.012"", ""10.1007/s11044-020-09722-4"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2016.03.029"", ""10.1080/00423119808969454"", ""10.1243/1350650042794815"", ""10.1243/09544097JRRT343"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2013.02.009"", ""10.1243/095440905X33251"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511735271.005"", ""10.1007/s40534-020-00222-x"", ""10.1115/1.4048897"", ""10.1243/PIME_PROC_1992_206_226_02"", ""10.1006/jsvi.1999.2055"", ""10.1080/00423114.2020.1770810"", ""10.1080/00423114.2020.1772984"", ""10.1016/j.engfailanal.2020.104937"", ""10.1080/00423114.2019.1636098"", ""10.1631/jzus.A2000033"", ""10.1177/1464419320956831"", ""10.1080/23248378.2020.1792808"", ""10.1016/S0893-6080(01)00027-2"", ""10.1016/b978-0-12-811318-9.00028-4"", ""10.1109/ICNN.1995.488968"", ""10.1007/s00158-018-2065-5"", ""10.1016/j.ast.2012.11.010"", ""10.1016/S0043-1648(02)00087-X"", ""10.1016/j.wear.2021.203715""]",['Engineering'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Automotive Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

Indonesia has the largest coconut palm-growing areas in the world, followed by the Philippines and India. The average national coconut productivity is still lower than the production potency of superior varieties. Indonesia and the Philippines contributed about 67% of crude coconut oil (CNO) export to global market. At present, the global market demand of coconut oil is fluctuating lead to the low price of CNO, while demand for certain coconut products such as coconut water, milk and flour is growing rapidly. This review provides an overview of the present status of coconut development in Indonesia, the recent advances in technologies for coconut improvement and outlook of coconut development toward 2045. Technological, political and socio economic issues including senility, pests and diseases, inferior varieties, poor agronomic practices, land conversion affected the low coconut production, while unfavorable supply chain, narrow product line, low product quality, monoculture-planting system might be affected the economic welfare of farmers. About 6.6 million farmers rely their main source of income on coconut and coconut based-products, which are mostly copra and CNO. Technological and institutional innovations for smallholder in coconut development become important strategies. Producing high value coconut products, establishment of seed farms, replanting of senile palms, pest and disease management, synergy among industries, farmers, and governments as well as research on finding more innovative technologies and technology transfer to solve existing problems are required to ensure the sustainability of coconut sector.","[{""name"": ""J C Alouw"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Wulandari"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.5897/AJAR2013.7013"", ""10.1007/s10340-012-0474-6"", ""10.1007/s10340-012-0474-6"", ""10.1603/an10106"", ""10.21082/bp.v17n2.2016.97-104"", ""10.1094/PHYTO-09-15-0243-RVW"", ""10.2174/2212711902999150615155807"", ""10.9734/arrb/2014/11023"", ""10.21082/bp.v17n2.2016.97-104"", ""10.6007/IJAREMS/v8-i2/5874"", ""10.1177/097639961200300108"", ""10.18517/ijaseit.9.2.7172"", ""10.2478/s11756-011-0104-4""]","['Social Sciences', 'Environmental Science', 'Chemistry']","['Inorganic Chemistry', 'Demography', 'Ecology']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0703 化学', 0.7396), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7296)], [('0303 社会学', 0.7387), ('0714 统计学', 0.7288)], [('0713 生态学', 0.7889), ('0907 林学', 0.7722)]]"

Specifically, accurate power system load forecasting plays an important role in the safety and stability of the power system production scheduling process. Due to the limitations of traditional load forecasting methods in dealing with large scale nonlinear time series data, in this paper, we proposed an Attention-BiLSTM (Attention based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Attention-BiLSTM) network to do the accurate short-term power load forecasting. This model is based on BiLSTM recurrent neural network which has high robustness on time series data modeling, and the Attention mechanism which can highlight the key features playing key roles in load forecasting in input data. The verification experiments with real data in a certain area show that the proposed model outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy and algorithm robustness.","[{""name"": ""Jie Du"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yingying Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Quan Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Jiaming Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaoyong Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Gang Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.eswa.2009.08.019"", ""10.1016/j.aej.2011.01.015"", ""10.1109/59.496166"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2007.09.031"", ""10.1016/S0196-8904(02)00225-X"", ""10.1007/978-1-4471-0219-9_20"", ""10.1109/TSG.2017.2753802"", ""10.21437/Interspeech.2010-343"", ""10.1142/S0218488598000094"", ""10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735""]",['Engineering'],"['Building and Construction', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

Considering the interactions between these domains is a major challenge in product development. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) enables cross-domain system development, based on commonly understood system architectures. However, there is still a gap in using MBSE for development, especially in mechanics. Systematic evaluation of design decisions based on system architecture models is not done. The strong simulation methods predicting physical product behaviour are not well connected to the evolving system architecture. We propose a new approach for connecting simulation and design models in a System Modelling Language (SysML) system model using the example of a combustion engine’s cooling circuit. The electric-mechanical coolant pump is chosen for design. The design processes of the hydrodynamic pump wheel and the volume flow controller are modelled as workflows in SysML. Here, we integrate design models for the pump wheel and the controller into the workflows. Thereby, parameters of the pump wheel and controller are calculated. Design results are automatically transferred to CAD.

However, the lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying process-structure-property relationships hinders the utilisation of DED-AM for the production or repair of safety-critical components. This study uses in situ and operando synchrotron X-ray imaging to provide an improved fundamental understanding of laser-matter interactions and their influence on the melt pool geometry. Coupled with process modelling, these unique observations illustrate how process parameters can influence the DED-AM melt pool geometry. The calibrated simulation can be used for guidance in an industrial additive manufacturing process for microstructure and quality control.","[{""name"": ""Y Chen"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Clark"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A C L Leung"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""L Sinclair"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""S Marussi"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""R Atwood"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""T Connoley"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""M Jones"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""G Baxter"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""P D Lee"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.phpro.2016.08.077"", ""10.1038/ncomms9300"", ""10.3390/ma10111260"", ""10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2018.08.041"", ""10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2012.11.011"", ""10.1016/j.prostr.2017.11.053"", ""10.1007/s00170-018-2586-5"", ""10.1016/j.matdes.2013.09.045"", ""10.1038/s41598-017-03761-2"", ""10.1038/s41467-018-03734-7"", ""10.1063/1.5017236"", ""10.1016/j.mtadv.2019.01.001"", ""10.1107/S1600577516016623"", ""10.1016/j.mtadv.2019.100011"", ""10.1038/ncomms5464"", ""10.1007/s11837-001-0066-z"", ""10.1107/S1600577515003513""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7803), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7598)]]"

The strength and durability of this material will decrease over time due to several factors that influence the mechanism of its structural characteristics. Although the compression strength is excellent, it is weak in tensile. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are widely used as an alternative material to replace metal-based engineering materials. This material has properties such as lightweight products, low production costs, easy to form, high tensile and flexural strength, and elastic. The purpose of this review paper is to provide information about the application of FRP composites as reinforcement of concrete structures either as repairs or new structures. Initially, FRP composite materials were used as reinforcement structures for reinforced concrete column-beam joints. The resulting structure has increased the flexural ability due to the load given. The addition of natural fiber (jute) to concrete also increases in the hardness of concrete. Other investigations regarding the application of FRP composites in concrete to improve strength performance are discussed in this paper. Finally, the technique of wrapping FRP composites in concrete in an effort to improve the performance of the resulting structure is also discussed in the paper.","[{""name"": ""M Y Yuhazri"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A J Zulfikar"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""A Ginting"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.25082/MER.2019.02.007"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.02.032"", ""10.1007/s40069-016-0182-3"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111634"", ""10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.10.088"", ""10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104511"", ""10.4236/jmmce.2016.41002"", ""10.1007/s10570-019-02543-5"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2017.12.155"", ""10.1016/j.compscitech.2019.107694"", ""10.31289/jmemme.v3i1.2416"", ""10.1177/204124791700800203"", ""10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.04.043"", ""10.1016/j.matpr.2017.11.034"", ""10.1007/s10924-009-0155-6"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0268(2006)10:2(139)"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0268(2005)9:2(187)"", ""10.15623/ijret.2012.0101007"", ""10.1016/S0950-0618(02)00092-2"", ""10.1016/j.compositesb.2006.07.020"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.048"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)CC.1943-5614.0000152"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.04.050"", ""10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.119763""]","['Materials Science', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Civil and Structural Engineering', 'Polymers and Plastics']","[[('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.7628), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7623), ('0821 纺织科学与工程', 0.7557), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7549), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7522)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7642), ('0819 矿业工程', 0.7364)], [('0805 材料科学与工程', 0.6941), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.6921)]]"

This study addresses the challenges of using renewable power supplies in delay‐sensitive fogs and proposes an efficient workload allocation method based on a learning classifier system. The system dynamically learns the workload allocation policies between the cloud and the fog servers and then converges on the optimal allocation that fulfils the energy and delay requirements in the overall transportation system. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm reduces the long‐term costs of the system including service delay and operating costs. Also, compared to some other techniques, when the proposed method presents the most successful solution for reducing the average delay of the workloads and converging on the minimum value as well as retaining or even increasing the battery levels of fog nodes up to 100%.

Considering large computation load of global optimization methods, most researches adopt instantaneous or local algorithms to optimize the recuperation energy, and incline to study straight deceleration processes. However, uncertain drivers' intentions limit the potential exploration of economy improvement, and simple test conditions do not reflect the complexity of actual driving cycles. Herein, an innovative control architecture is designed for intelligent vehicles to overcome these challenges to some extent. Compared with traditional vehicles, driverless ones would eliminate drivers' interferences, and have more freedoms to optimize energy recovery, route tracking and dynamics stability. Specifically, a series regenerative braking system is designed, and then a three‐level control architecture is first proposed to coordinate three performances. In the top layer, some rules with maximum recuperation energy is exploited off‐line for optimising the velocity and control commands on‐line. In the middle layer, local algorithm is used to track the commands and complex routes for optimal energy from a global perspective. In the bottom layer, hydraulic and regenerative toques are allocated. Tests are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design and control schemes.","[{""name"": ""Liang Li"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Xianyao Ping"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Jialei Shi"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Mechanical Engineering University College London  London UK""]}, {""name"": ""Xiangyu Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}, {""name"": ""Xiuheng Wu"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy Tsinghua University  Beijing China""]}]","[""10.1109/TVT.2017.2731525"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.10.008"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2013.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.044"", ""10.1080/00423114.2014.894198"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5089"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2917313"", ""10.1016/j.ymssp.2019.03.012"", ""10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.11.006"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.015"", ""10.1109/TVT.2019.2935617"", ""10.1016/j.mechatronics.2017.06.005"", ""10.1109/TITS.2016.2634019"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877960"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111972"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.191"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2015.12.077"", ""10.1177/0954407012441884"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990349"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2915102"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2018.02.046"", ""10.1016/j.enconman.2015.09.062"", ""10.1177/0954407018785740"", ""10.1080/00423114.2015.1129059"", ""10.1080/00423114.2010.527994"", ""10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2019.103586"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2774771"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.5159"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2018.12.005""]",['Engineering'],['Automotive Engineering'],"[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)]]"

10.1049/iet-est.2019.0161,IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering,Energy flow control and sizing of a hybrid battery/supercapacitor storage in MVDC shipboard power systems,"The propulsion system of a medium‐voltage dc (MVDC) ship is subject to large thrust/torque variations due to interactions of the ship and the propeller with sea waves. These variations induce steep power fluctuations on the MVDC bus, adversely impacting the stability, efficiency and power quality. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is a promising solution for mitigating these power fluctuations. Dictating the energy that the HESS components must deliver/absorb, the energy management strategy (EMS) impacts the size/capacity of the energy storage system (ESS). Based on this consideration, sizing and EMS of a battery/supercapacitor (SC) HESS are jointly optimised by using a deep reinforcement learning‐based method. The proposed method splits the power between the HESS components such that while the operational constraints are satisfied, energy storage size and losses are minimised. Its features are adaptability to varying sea states, real‐time implementation feasibility, while obviating the requirement for knowledge of the ship propulsion power profile. The efficacy of the joint sizing/EMS on reducing the ESS size is validated by comparing the sizes when battery‐only, SC‐only and HESS are employed in the MVDC shipboard power system. Real‐time implementation feasibility and adaptability to various ship propulsion power profiles is confirmed through real‐time simulations.","[{""name"": ""Juan Nunez Forestieri"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Louisiana State University Baton Rouge LA 70803 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Mehdi Farasat"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Louisiana State University Baton Rouge LA 70803 USA""]}]","[""10.1109/TIE.2010.2076414"", ""10.1109/TTE.2016.2598078"", ""10.1109/JOE.2017.2674878"", ""10.1049/iet-est.2015.0029"", ""10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2737828"", ""10.1109/JSAC.2016.2525599"", ""10.1109/JESTPE.2016.2566583"", ""10.1016/j.rser.2014.10.011"", ""10.1109/TII.2014.2334233"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2863185"", ""10.1016/j.energy.2017.12.009"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.08.031"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2881057"", ""10.1109/TTE.2015.2464690"", ""10.1109/TTE.2016.2552721"", ""10.1109/TVT.2013.2287102"", ""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848464"", ""10.1109/TIE.2015.2475419"", ""10.1109/TMECH.2014.2336264"", ""10.1109/TVT.2014.2318275"", ""10.1109/TSTE.2016.2582927"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2805380"", ""10.1109/TIA.2016.2555790"", ""10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2926061"", ""10.1109/TEC.2018.2882147"", ""10.1016/j.oceaneng.2016.06.034"", ""10.1016/B978-0-08-097123-0.00009-5"", ""10.1109/TPAS.1973.293548"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2871792"", ""10.1109/TIA.2019.2898839"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.09.003"", ""10.1109/TSTE.2011.2114901"", ""10.1109/TVT.2012.2190630"", ""10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2157180"", ""10.1561/2200000071"", ""10.1038/nature14236"", ""10.1002/9781119941446""]","['Environmental Science', 'Engineering']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.772), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7717)]]"

In anxiety, drivers are more likely to get engaged in distracted driving, increasing the likelihood of vehicle crash. Therefore, it is essential to identify driver's anxiety during driving, to provide a basis for driving safety. This study used multiple‐electrocardiogram (ECG) feature fusion to recognise driver's emotion, based on back‐propagation network and Dempster–Shafer evidence method. The three features of ECG signals, the time–frequency domain, waveform and non‐linear characteristics were selected as the parameters for emotion recognition. An emotion recognition model was proposed to identify drivers’ calm and anxiety during driving. The results show after ECG evidence fusion, the proposed model can recognise drivers’ emotion, with an accuracy rate of 91.34% for calm and 92.89% for anxiety. The authors’ findings of this study can be used to develop the personalised driving warning system and intelligent human–machine interaction in vehicles. This study would be of great theoretical significance and application value for improving road traffic safety.","[{""name"": ""Xiaoyuan Wang"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Electromechanical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science &amp; Technology Qingdao People's Republic of China"", ""The Joint Laboratory for Internet of Vehicles, Ministry of Education – China Mobile Communications Corporation Tsinghua University Beijing People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Yongqing Guo"", ""affiliation"": [""The Joint Laboratory for Internet of Vehicles, Ministry of Education – China Mobile Communications Corporation Tsinghua University Beijing People's Republic of China"", ""School of Transportation and Vehicle Engineering Shandong University of Technology Zibo People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Jeff Ban"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Washington Seattle WA 98195 USA""]}, {""name"": ""Qing Xu"", ""affiliation"": [""Department of Automotive Engineering Tsinghua University Beijing 100084 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Chenglin Bai"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Physics Science and Communication Engineering Liaocheng University Liaocheng 252000 People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Shanliang Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""College of Electromechanical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science &amp; Technology Qingdao People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1016/j.trf.2012.02.004"", ""10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.395-396.411"", ""10.1177/1687814017747708"", ""10.1016/j.trf.2017.06.019"", ""10.1007/s12193-009-0025-5"", ""10.1016/j.jth.2017.11.001"", ""10.1016/j.proeng.2011.08.452"", ""10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.08.005"", ""10.1016/j.eswa.2011.04.161"", ""10.1016/j.sigpro.2008.06.018"", ""10.1093/oso/9780195169157.003.0003"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_42-1"", ""10.3390/ijerph16071236""]","['Psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Medicine']","['Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Experimental and Cognitive Psychology', 'Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine']","[[('0402 心理学', 0.7693), ('0303 社会学', 0.7389), ('0714 统计学', 0.7326), ('1011 护理学', 0.731), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7276)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7369), ('0402 心理学', 0.7327), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7293), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7277), ('1002 临床医学', 0.7245)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7333), ('1007 药学', 0.7307), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7301), ('1008 中药学', 0.7257), ('1005 中医学', 0.7236)], [('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7242), ('0402 心理学', 0.7233)], [('0402 心理学', 0.7575), ('0303 社会学', 0.7301)], [('1002 临床医学', 0.7509), ('1001 基础医学', 0.7502)]]"
10.1007/s11116-020-10148-2,TRANSPORTATION,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0814 Civil Engineering,Do millennials value travel time differently because of productive multitasking? A revealed-preference study of Northern California commuters,"AbstractMillennials, the demographic cohort born in the last two decades of the twentieth century, are reported to adopt information and communication technologies (ICTs) in their everyday lives, including travel, to a greater extent than older generations. As ICT-driven travel-based multitasking influences travelers’ experience and satisfaction in various ways, millennials are expected to be affected at a greater scale. Still, to our knowledge, no previous studies have specifically focused on the impact of travel multitasking on travel behavior and the value of travel time (VOTT) of young adults. To address this gap, we use an original dataset collected among Northern California commuters (N = 2216) to analyze the magnitude and significance of individual and household-level factors affecting commute mode choice. We estimate a revealed-preference mode choice model and investigate the differences between millennials and older adults in the sample. Additionally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to explore how incorporation of explanatory factors such as attitudes and propensity to multitask while traveling in mode choice models affects coefficient estimates, VOTT, and willingness to pay to use a laptop on the commute. Compared to non-millennials, the mode choice of millennials is found to be less affected by socio-economic characteristics and more strongly influenced by the activities performed while traveling. Young adults are found to have lower VOTT than older adults for both in-vehicle (15.0% less) and out-of-vehicle travel time (15.7% less), and higher willingness to pay (in time or money) to use a laptop, even after controlling for demographic traits, personal attitudes, and the propensity to multitask. This study contributes to better understanding the commuting behavior of millennials, and the factors affecting it, a topic of interest to transportation researchers, planners, and practitioners.","[{""name"": ""Aliaksandr Malokin"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Giovanni Circella"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Patricia L.

10.1049/itr2.12130,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0823 Transportation Engineering; 0711 Systems Science,Directed hypergraph attention network for traffic forecasting,"Abstract In traffic systems, traffic forecasting is a critical issue, which has attracted much interest from researchers. It is a challenging task due to the complex spatial‐temporal patterns of traffic data. Previous works focus on designing complex graph‐based neural networks to model spatial‐temporal dependencies from data. By using graphs to represent road networks, these works capture spatial patterns with graph convolutions. However, graphs cannot fully represent spatial relations from road networks. It limits the performance of graph‐based methods. In this paper, we propose a directed hypergraph neural network architecture, Directed Hypergraph Attention Network(DHAT), for traffic forecasting. Unlike previous works, DHAT introduces a directed hypergraph to represent road networks. Compared with graphs, directed hypergraphs could represent spatial information from graphs and outperform them in modeling complex directed relations among multiple nodes. Based on the directed hypergraph, a directed hypergraph convolution is proposed to exploit spatial relations among traffic series. By combining the proposed convolution and attention mechanisms, DHAT can effectively achieve promising predictions for traffic forecasting. To evaluate the performance of DHAT, we have conducted extensive experiments on four real‐world traffic datasets. Compared with other baselines, experimental results show that DHAT reduces Mean Absolute Error by 0.03–0.64 on these datasets.","[{""name"": ""Xiaoyi Luo"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Industrial Control Technology Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Jiaheng Peng"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Industrial Control Technology Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}, {""name"": ""Jun Liang"", ""affiliation"": [""State Key Lab of Industrial Control Technology Zhejiang University  Hangzhou China""]}]","[""10.1109/TITS.2011.2158001"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2003)129:6(664)"", ""10.1137/1.9781611974973.87"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2018/505"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.3301922"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i01.5438"", ""10.1609/aaai.v34i01.5477"", ""10.7551/mitpress/7503.003.0205"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013558"", ""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013656"", ""10.1016/0166-218X(93)90045-P"", ""10.1007/3-540-45446-2_20"", ""10.24963/ijcai.2019/264""]","['Computer Science', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"
10.1098/rsos.191074,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,0823 Transportation Engineering,Dealing with uncertainty in agent-based models for short-term predictions,"Agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining traction as one of the most powerful modelling tools within the social sciences. They are particularly suited to simulating complex systems. Despite many methodological advances within ABM, one of the major drawbacks is their inability to incorporate real-time data to make accurate short-term predictions. This paper presents an approach that allows ABMs to be dynamically optimized. Through a combination of parameter calibration and data assimilation (DA), the accuracy of model-based predictions using ABM in real time is increased. We use the exemplar of a bus route system to explore these methods. The bus route ABMs developed in this research are examples of ABMs that can be dynamically optimized by a combination of parameter calibration and DA. The proposed model and framework is a novel and transferable approach that can be used in any passenger information system, or in an intelligent transport systems to provide forecasts of bus locations and arrival times.","[{""name"": ""Le-Minh Kieu"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leeds, Leeds, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Nicolas Malleson"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"", ""Alan Turing Institute, London, UK""]}, {""name"": ""Alison Heppenstall"", ""affiliation"": [""University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"", ""Alan Turing Institute, London, UK""]}]","[""10.1073/pnas.082080899"", ""10.4018/978-1-60566-226-8.ch003"", ""10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2013.05.003"", ""10.1260/1748-3018.5.4.601"", ""10.1017/S0956792515000625"", ""10.1016/j.simpat.2015.05.001"", ""10.1098/rsos.150703"", ""10.1017/CBO9780511526480"", ""10.1073/pnas.97.21.11143"", ""10.1017/CBO9781107049994"", ""10.1109/TITS.2011.2106209"", ""10.1049/ip-rsn:19990255"", ""10.1080/15472450600981009"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2002)128:5(429)"", ""10.1007/s100510051139"", ""10.1140/epjb/e2003-00233-1"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2012.06.004"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.58.1404"", ""10.1016/S0378-4371(03)00517-X"", ""10.1016/S0378-4371(02)00622-2"", ""10.1016/S0378-4371(00)00455-6"", ""10.1103/PhysRevE.63.036115"", ""10.1007/s11071-012-0445-8"", ""10.3141/2188-02"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2015.10.017"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2010.02.008"", ""10.5334/baw"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.11.010"", ""10.1093/bioinformatics/btn260"", ""10.1068/b32068"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-39149-1_12"", ""10.1016/j.jedc.2017.01.014"", ""10.1109/WSC.2018.8632276"", ""10.1002/wcc.535"", ""10.1023/A:1010091220143"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2012.02.007"", ""10.1007/s10712-014-9309-8"", ""10.1080/00031305.1983.10482723"", ""10.1080/01621459.1994.10476469"", ""10.1109/TIM.2006.881569"", ""10.5565/rev/elcvia.107"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2016.04.012"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2017.04.002"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2009.04.002"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2018.0085"", ""10.1002/nav.3800260304"", ""10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2004)130:1(56)""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering']","['Building and Construction', 'Transportation']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0814 土木工程', 0.7442), ('0813 建筑学', 0.7208)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)]]"

This exploratory research presents insights of a sample of licensed deck officers (LDOs) regarding the potential future of the Collision Avoidance Regulations (COLREGs) with the implementation of MASS. At present, there is much discussion in the maritime industry on if and how the COLREGs will need to be amended to be able to be applied to MASS. Limited research is published from the key perspective of the LDO. Qualitative and quantitative methods are used, including a literature review and a multiple-choice survey. Data is analyzed via descriptive statistics, and commonalities within the results are investigated as well as years of experience with practicing the COLREGs. Results show that many barriers exist when applying the COLREGs to MASS, and minor amendments to certain terms and definitions are recommended. Moreover, the COLREGs should not be quantified, and MASS should be identifiable from other vessels. LDOs with more experience with practicing the COLREGs are found to be slightly more open to changing the rules versus LDOs with less experience. When compared to the results of the International Maritime Organization’s regulatory scoping exercise, the results of this study are found to be in congruence.

A number of approaches have been proposed for how to reverse formal models of concurrent computation including process calculi such as CCS, languages like Erlang, prime event structures and occurrence nets. However it has not been settled what properties a reversible system should enjoy, nor how the various properties that have been suggested, such as the parabolic lemma and the causal-consistency property, are related. We contribute to a solution to these issues by using a generic labelled transition system equipped with a relation capturing whether transitions are independent to explore the implications between these properties. In particular, we show how they are derivable from a set of axioms. Our intention is that when establishing properties of some formalism it will be easier to verify the axioms rather than proving properties such as the parabolic lemma directly. We also introduce two new notions related to causal consistent reversibility, namely causal safety and causal liveness, and show that they are derivable from our axioms.","[{""name"": ""Ivan Lanese"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Iain Phillips"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Irek Ulidowski"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.scico.2017.10.008"", ""10.1147/rd.176.0525"", ""10.4204/EPTCS.223.7"", ""10.1145/347823.347828"", ""10.1109/LICS.2013.45"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-28644-8_19"", ""10.1007/11539452_31"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2006.07.036"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-21571-2_11"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-54804-8_26"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2016.09.003"", ""10.1006/inco.1997.2634"", ""10.1007/s00354-018-0034-6"", ""10.1016/j.scico.2017.09.008"", ""10.1147/rd.53.0183"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-45231-5_23"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-23217-6_20"", ""10.1016/j.tcs.2016.02.019"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2018.06.004"", ""10.1109/IROS.2015.7353609"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-30793-5_1"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22397-7_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-22397-7_2"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99498-7_5"", ""10.1007/11690634_17"", ""10.1016/j.entcs.2007.08.018"", ""10.1016/j.jlap.2006.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.jlamp.2015.07.004"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-36315-3_18"", ""10.1007/3-540-18088-5_19"", ""10.1016/S0304-3975(96)80710-9"", ""10.1007/s00354-018-0040-8"", ""10.1145/1244381.1244404""]",['Computer Science'],"['Hardware and Architecture', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Computer Networks and Communications']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7493), ('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7461)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7362), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7268)]]"

The high content of phosphorus often leads to the nutrition of water body. Water resources have been seriously threatened, which has brought great impact on environment and public health. Therefore, the removal of phosphorus from wastewater attracts more and more attention. This work reviewed the forms, hazards and treatment of phosphorus in wastewater, and focuses on the methods of phosphorus-containing wastewater such as chemical precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange, membrane separation and biological methods. With the current economic and development of world, the bio-treatment of phosphorus-containing wastewater will become a research trend in the future, and the research and development of new technologies for phosphorus-containing wastewater will be an important topic for the treatment of phosphorus-containing wastewater in the future.","[{""name"": ""Yong Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Xiaolong Nan"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Dongyun Li"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Liming Wang"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Rui Xu"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Qian Li"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.micres.2020.126586"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.207"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.01.098"", ""10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127005"", ""10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.12.068"", ""10.1016/S1004-9541(13)60511-X"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.02.028"", ""10.1016/j.cej.2020.126924"", ""10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124430"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.110"", ""10.1016/j.desal.2011.07.047"", ""10.1016/S0956-053X(02)00051-X"", ""10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.01.085"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2010.01.024"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2015.09.045"", ""10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135453"", ""10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109803"", ""10.1016/j.copbio.2019.03.008"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2019.06.008"", ""10.1016/j.jwpe.2020.101245"", ""10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123453"", ""10.1111/j.1751-7915.2011.00248.x"", ""10.1016/S0043-1354(01)00093-8"", ""10.1016/j.bej.2016.08.004"", ""10.1016/j.watres.2005.09.025""]",['Environmental Science'],"['Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering', 'Pollution']","[[('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.8035), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7866), ('0713 生态学', 0.77), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7684), ('0907 林学', 0.7684)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7554), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7533)], [('0830 环境科学与工程', 0.7083), ('0706 大气科学', 0.6788)]]"
10.1049/itr2.12005,IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS,0711 Systems Science; 0823 Transportation Engineering,A novel compression approach for truck GPS trajectory data,"Abstract Nowadays, the application of location‐aware devices, such as global positioning system (GPS)‐enabled mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) is increasing. Based on this, a new demand for efficiently storing trajectory data has arisen. Trajectory compression reduces the storage space and cost, the cost and time of data transmission by retaining critical trajectory points and effectively eliminating redundant data. Herein, a novel trajectory compression method based on stay points (TCSP) is proposed. By using the road network data and the stay points of GPS trajectory data to compress the GPS trajectory data, this method can greatly improve the ratio and accuracy of compression. Experimental results based on real data sets show that the compression rate of this method can stably reach 8.61%, and the compression effect can be restored to the original trajectory route. Compared with the critical point algorithm and the Douglas–Peucker (DP) algorithm, the TCSP method can reach a better compression effect and compression ratio.","[{""name"": ""Sijing Liu"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation and Logistics Southwest Jiaotong University  Sichuan People's Republic of China"", ""National Engineering Laboratory of Integrated Transportation Big Data Application Technology  Sichuan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Gang Chen"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation and Logistics Southwest Jiaotong University  Sichuan People's Republic of China"", ""National Engineering Laboratory of Integrated Transportation Big Data Application Technology  Sichuan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Long Wei"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation and Logistics Southwest Jiaotong University  Sichuan People's Republic of China""]}, {""name"": ""Guoqi Li"", ""affiliation"": [""School of Transportation and Logistics Southwest Jiaotong University  Sichuan People's Republic of China"", ""National United Engineering Laboratory of Integrated and Intelligent Transportation  Sichuan People's Republic of China""]}]","[""10.1109/COMGEO.2013.15"", ""10.1145/1463434.1463477"", ""10.1145/1409635.1409677"", ""10.1007/s00778-011-0244-8"", ""10.1080/10630730802401942"", ""10.1145/2063212.2063215"", ""10.1145/2063212.2063219"", ""10.1145/1526709.1526816"", ""10.1145/1921591.1921596"", ""10.1007/978-3-319-99365-2_22"", ""10.1145/1281192.1281230"", ""10.1049/iet-its.2009.0029"", ""10.3138/FM57-6770-U75U-7727"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-24741-8_44"", ""10.1007/978-3-642-02982-0_30"", ""10.1155/2016/6587309""]",['Computer Science'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Signal Processing']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7329), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7301)], [('0810 信息与通信工程', 0.7598), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7575)]]"

This often limits the application of verification techniques, as writing formal specifications is an error-prone and time-consuming manual task. To facilitate this, we present , a framework for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive formal specifications (in temporal logics) from unstructured natural language. In particular, we introduce a new methodology to detect and resolve the inherent ambiguity of system requirements in natural language: we utilize LLMs to map subformulas of the formalization back to the corresponding natural language fragments of the input. Users iteratively add, delete, and edit these sub-translations to amend erroneous formalizations, which is easier than manually redrafting the entire formalization. The framework is agnostic to specific application domains and can be extended to similar specification languages and new neural models. We perform a user study to obtain a challenging dataset, which we use to run experiments on the quality of translations. We provide an open-source implementation, including a web-based frontend.","[{""name"": ""Matthias Cosler"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Christopher Hahn"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Daniel Mendoza"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Frederik Schmitt"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Caroline Trippel"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33013159"", ""10.1007/BFb0058022"", ""10.1007/978-3-031-37703-7_18"", ""10.5281/ZENODO.3888410"", ""10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27068"", ""10.1145/3428269"", ""10.15607/RSS.2018.XIV.067"", ""10.1145/1368088.1368094"", ""10.1016/S1571-0661(04)00253-1"", ""10.1145/3510003.3510171"", ""10.1145/1062455.1062526"", ""10.1007/978-3-540-30206-3_12"", ""10.1007/11837862_18"", ""10.1109/SFCS.1977.32"", ""10.1007/978-3-030-79876-5_2"", ""10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x"", ""10.1007/b137011""]",['Computer Science'],"['Information Systems', 'Computational Theory and Mathematics', 'Software']","[[('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7697), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7566), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7551), ('0835 软件工程', 0.7476), ('1405 智能科学与技术', 0.7393)], [('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7454), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7417)], [('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.7469), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7285)], [('0835 软件工程', 0.7738), ('0812 计算机科学与技术', 0.755)]]"

In general, the pH measurement is performed using a sensor from synthetic chemicals. The use of chemicals as pH sensors has several disadvantages that are toxic and threaten human health. Therefore, pH biosensors should be developed from bioactive compound. Bioactives such as curcumin, anthocyanin, chlorophyll, and Angkak pigments are indigeneous natural resources that produce color with specific specificity. Curcumin was extracted from turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), anthocyanin from purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L), chlorophyll from suji leaf (Pleomele angustifolia), and reddish pigment from rice fermented by Monascus sp. The type of color of each bioactive can give different responses to certain pH so that it is potential to be developed as a pH biosensor. However, bioactives have sensitivity to certain pH, so it is necessary to test the sensitivity and selection of bioactives to various pH (2-’3). The results of the sensitivity of the bioactives to pH 2-‘3 showed that anthocyanin and curcumin were the best bioactive as pH biosensor because they provide a unique and significant color change compared to angkak pigment and chlorophyll which did not show clear discoloration. The anthocyanin was sensitive to pH 5-13 and curcumin was sensitive to pH 7-13 and both were stable at acidic pH.","[{""name"": ""Anting Wulandari"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Titi Candra Sunarti"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Farah Fahma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Toshiharu Enomae"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.tet.2011.09.003"", ""10.1016/j.foodchem.2004.03.002"", ""10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02077.x"", ""10.1111/j.1574-6968.2000.tb09293.x"", ""10.21273/JASHS.116.5.865"", ""10.1002/rcm.2401"", ""10.1021/jf101898j"", ""10.1016/j.foodchem.2003.08.011"", ""10.1590/S0102-695X2012005000117"", ""10.3136/fstr.8.4"", ""10.1270/jsbbs.49.43"", ""10.3390/molecules19079535"", ""10.1080/02757259009532129"", ""10.1186/1475-2859-8-24"", ""10.1590/1678-457X.6687"", ""10.1021/jf000791o"", ""10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02271.x"", ""10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.11.002"", ""10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.10.005"", ""10.1007/BF01042637"", ""10.1016/j.talanta.2014.07.063"", ""10.1021/mp700113r"", ""10.1111/j.1745-4549.2000.tb00417.x"", ""10.1021/jf00085a002"", ""10.1021/jf00048a048"", ""10.1021/jf980505x""]","['Chemistry', 'Agricultural and Biological Sciences', 'Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology']","['Inorganic Chemistry', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Plant Science']","[[('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7425), ('0703 化学', 0.7424), ('0822 轻工技术与工程', 0.7279), ('0806 冶金工程', 0.7261), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7243)], [('0909 草学', 0.735), ('0905 畜牧学', 0.7348), ('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7344), ('0828 农业工程', 0.7328), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7301)], [('0710 生物学', 0.7285), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7264), ('0836 生物工程', 0.7242), ('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0832 食品科学与工程', 0.7157)], [('0703 化学', 0.7396), ('0817 化学工程与技术', 0.7296)], [('1001 基础医学', 0.717), ('0710 生物学', 0.7029)], [('0903 农业资源与环境', 0.7532), ('0902 园艺学', 0.7513)]]"

As artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques advance, data-driven methods especially deep learning algorithms have become the rising star in RUL prediction. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants such as Long Short Term Memory have proven effectiveness in various sequential tasks. However, due to its iterative nature along the time axis, RNNs take much time for information to flow through the network for prediction. Inspired by recent advance brought by Transformer in sequence transduction tasks, we proposed the attention mechanism based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with positional encoding to tackle this problem. The attention mechanism enables the network to focus on specific parts of sequences and positional encoding injects position information while utilizing the parallelization merits of CNN on GPUs. Empirical experiments show that the proposed approach is both time effective and accurate in battery RUL prediction.","[{""name"": ""Beitong Zhou"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Cheng Cheng"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Guijun Ma"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Yong Zhang"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.107"", ""10.3390/en6083654"", ""10.3390/en7020520"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.05.036"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.10.013"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.035"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.07.020"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.03.134"", ""10.1177/0142331208092030"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.106"", ""10.1016/j.microrel.2012.12.004"", ""10.1016/j.jpowsour.2014.07.176"", ""10.1109/TIE.2018.2808918"", ""10.36001/phmconf.2010.v2i1.1896"", ""10.1109/TVT.2018.2805189"", ""10.1016/j.measurement.2017.07.017"", ""10.1109/TIE.2017.2774777"", ""10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113626"", ""10.1162/neco.1989.1.4.541"", ""10.1007/s10994-019-05815-0""]",['Engineering'],"['Automotive Engineering', 'Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality', 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering']","[[('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0837 安全科学与工程', 0.7653), ('0839 网络空间安全', 0.7515)], [('0809 电子科学与技术', 0.7724), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7689)]]"

In this study, we assess the demand for on-demand mobility services in urban areas, using a stated preference survey, to understand the potential impact of introducing on-demand services on the current modal split. The survey was carried out in the Netherlands and offered respondents a choice between bike, car, public transport and on-demand services. 1,063 valid responses are analysed with a multinomial logit and a latent class choice model. By means of the latter, we uncover four distinctive groups of travellers based on the observed choice behaviour. The majority of the sample, the Sharing-ready cyclists (55%), are avid cyclists and do not see on-demand mobility as an alternative for making urban trips. Two classes, Tech-ready individuals (27%) and Flex-ready individuals (9%) would potentially use on-demand services: the former is fairly time-sensitive and would thus use on-demand service if they were sufficiently fast. The latter is highly cost-sensitive, and would therefore use the service primarily if it is cheap. The fourth class, Flex-sceptic individuals (9%) shows very limited potential for using on-demand services.","[{""name"": ""Nejc Geržinič"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Niels van Oort"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Sascha Hoogendoorn-Lanser"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Oded Cats"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""Serge Hoogendoorn"", ""affiliation"": []}]","[""10.1016/j.tbs.2018.06.002"", ""10.1016/J.TRC.2018.12.016"", ""10.1007/s11116-020-10110-2"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2019.11.022"", ""10.1177/0361198118790842"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2020.102621"", ""10.1073/pnas.1611675114"", ""10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.069"", ""10.1177/03611981211029919"", ""10.1016/J.TRC.2017.02.013"", ""10.1016/j.tra.2017.07.005"", ""10.3141/2606-14"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2020.100910"", ""10.13140/RG.2.2.32813.33760"", ""10.1126/sciadv.aau2670"", ""10.1016/J.TRC.2016.12.017"", ""10.1177/0361198118821903"", ""10.1016/S0191-2615(02)00046-2"", ""10.1016/j.rtbm.2019.100390"", ""10.1016/j.jue.2018.09.003"", ""10.1007/s11116-018-9923-2"", ""10.1016/j.trpro.2015.12.027"", ""10.1016/j.tbs.2018.05.001"", ""10.1016/J.RETREC.2018.11.009"", ""10.32866/001c.12872"", ""10.1016/j.trb.2020.06.006"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2019.05.037"", ""10.1016/J.TRF.2021.02.021"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.09.022"", ""10.1016/J.TRC.2018.10.007"", ""10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00675.x"", ""10.1080/13683500.2015.1043248"", ""10.1109/EEEIC.2017.7977646"", ""10.1016/0047-2727(74)90003-6"", ""10.1016/j.cstp.2019.07.013"", ""10.1007/s10640-004-3332-z"", ""10.1007/s10273-016-2048-3"", ""10.1109/BigData.2015.7363837"", ""10.1016/j.retrec.2020.100904"", ""10.1016/J.RETREC.2014.09.064"", ""10.1016/J.TRC.2018.04.007"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2019.07.008"", ""10.1007/s11238-017-9647-3"", ""10.1016/j.tranpol.2004.05.001"", ""10.1186/s12544-020-00420-y"", ""10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.029"", ""10.1016/J.TRA.2018.11.018"", ""10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.102629""]","['Social Sciences', 'Engineering', 'Business, Management and Accounting']","['Automotive Engineering', 'Transportation', 'Marketing']","[[('0303 社会学', 0.7395), ('0714 统计学', 0.7394), ('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7379), ('0602 中国史', 0.7298), ('0304 民族学', 0.7297)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7567), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7543), ('0814 土木工程', 0.7511), ('0808 电气工程', 0.7505), ('0807 动力工程及工程热物理', 0.7487)], [('1202 工商管理学', 0.7094), ('1201 管理科学与工程', 0.701), ('0714 统计学', 0.6903), ('0202 应用经济学', 0.685), ('0701 数学', 0.6834)], [('0802 机械工程', 0.7467), ('0811 控制科学与工程', 0.7348)], [('0823 交通运输工程', 0.7643), ('0824 船舶与海洋工程', 0.7342)], [('0503 新闻传播学', 0.7309), ('1202 工商管理学', 0.7243)]]"

Star fruit (Averrhoa carambola L.) is a native fruit in the north eastern states of India. Due to its rich nutritional composition and medicinal property, the demand for this fruit increased nationally. The proposed design consists of a tunnel type drying chamber and thermal storage unit. Paraffin wax (PCM) was used as a thermal storing material mounted in the tunnel dryer chamber to use the thermal energy at off sunshine hours. The thermal insulation coating on the outer surface of the solar drying chamber enhances the thermal performance of the tunnel dryer. The overall efficiency of this proposed design was analysed. The results indicated that drying of star fruit occurred in the falling rate period, where no constant rate period of drying rate was observed. The quality analyses data revealed that higher values of TPC (47.59 mg GAE/gram of sample) and DPPH (73.59 μ mol of TE/gram of sample) are obtained in the samples dried in solar dried as compared to open sun-dried samples. Sensory analysis (taste, aroma and flavour) carried out on slices of star fruit indicated that the solar-dried slices provided better scores compared to open sun-dried samples.","[{""name"": ""Rajesh Kondareddy"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""N Sivakumaran"", ""affiliation"": []}, {""name"": ""K.
